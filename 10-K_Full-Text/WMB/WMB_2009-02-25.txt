GENERAL

We are a natural gas company originally incorporated under the
    laws of the state of Nevada in 1949 and reincorporated under the
    laws of the state of Delaware in 1987. We were founded in 1908
    when two Williams brothers began a construction company in
    Fort Smith, Arkansas. Today, we primarily find, produce,
    gather, process and transport natural gas. Our operations are
    concentrated in the Pacific Northwest, Rocky Mountains, Gulf
    Coast, the Eastern Seaboard, and the province of Alberta in
    Canada.

Our principal executive offices are located at One Williams
    Center, Tulsa, Oklahoma 74172. Our telephone number is

918-573-2000.

In 2008, we used Economic Value
    Added

®

(EVA

®

)


as the basis for disciplined decision making around the use of
    capital.
    EVA

®

is a tool that considers both financial earnings and a cost of
    capital in measuring performance. It is based on the idea that
    earning profits from an economic perspective requires that a
    company cover not only all of its operating expenses but also
    all of its capital costs. The two main components of
    EVA

®

are net operating profit after taxes and a charge for the
    opportunity cost of capital. We derive these amounts by making
    various adjustments to our reported results and financial
    position, and by applying a cost of capital. We look for
    opportunities to improve
    EVA

®

because we believe there is a strong correlation between
    EVA

®

improvement and creation of shareholder value.

BUSINESS
    SEGMENTS

Substantially all our operations are conducted through our
    subsidiaries. To achieve organizational and operating
    efficiencies, our activities are primarily operated through the
    following business segments:

•

Exploration & Production

— produces,
    develops and manages natural gas reserves primarily located in
    the Rocky Mountain and Mid-Continent regions of the United
    States and is comprised of several wholly owned and partially
    owned subsidiaries including Williams Production Company LLC and
    Williams Production RMT Company (RMT).

•

Gas Pipeline

— includes our interstate natural
    gas pipelines and pipeline joint venture investments organized
    under our wholly owned subsidiary, Williams Gas Pipeline
    Company, LLC (WGP). Gas Pipeline also includes Williams Pipeline
    Partners L.P. (WMZ), our master limited partnership formed in
    2007.

•

Midstream Gas & Liquids

— includes
    our natural gas gathering, treating and processing business and
    is comprised of several wholly owned and partially owned
    subsidiaries including Williams Field Services Group LLC and
    Williams Natural Gas Liquids, Inc. Midstream also includes
    Williams Partners L.P. (WPZ), our master limited partnership
    formed in 2005.

•

Gas Marketing Services

— manages our natural
    gas commodity risk through purchases, sales and other related
    transactions, under our wholly owned subsidiary Williams Gas
    Marketing, Inc.

•

Other

— primarily consists of corporate
    operations.

This report is organized to reflect this structure.

Detailed discussion of each of our business segments follows.

Exploration &
    Production

Our Exploration & Production segment produces,
    develops, and manages natural gas reserves primarily located in
    the Rocky Mountain (primarily New Mexico, Wyoming and Colorado)
    and Mid-Continent (Oklahoma and Texas) regions of the United
    States. We specialize in natural gas production from tight-sands
    and shale formations and coal bed methane reserves in the
    Piceance, San Juan, Powder River, Arkoma, Green River and
    Fort Worth basins. Over 99 percent of
    Exploration & Production’s domestic reserves are
    natural gas. Our Exploration & Production segment also
    has international oil and gas interests, which include a
    69 percent equity interest in Apco Argentina Inc., an oil
    and gas exploration and production company with operations in
    Argentina, and a 4 percent equity interest in Petrowayu
    S.A., a Venezuelan corporation that is the operator of a
    100 percent interest in the La Concepcion block
    located in western Venezuela.

Exploration & Production’s current proved
    undeveloped and probable reserves provide us with strong capital
    investment opportunities for several years into the future.
    Exploration & Production’s goal is to drill its
    existing proved undeveloped reserves, which is comprised of
    approximately 43 percent of proved reserves, and to drill
    in areas of probable reserves adding to our proved reserves. In
    addition, Exploration & Production provides a
    significant amount of equity production that is gathered

and/or

processed by our Midstream facilities in the San Juan basin.

Information for our Exploration & Production segment
    relates only to domestic activity unless otherwise noted. We use
    the terms “gross” to refer to all wells or acreage in
    which we have at least a partial working interest and
    “net” to refer to our ownership represented by that
    working interest.



Gas
    reserves and wells

The following table summarizes our U.S. natural gas
    reserves as of December 31 (using market prices on December 31
    held constant) for the year indicated:




(Bcfe)

1,891

1,756

Total proved natural gas reserves

4,339

4,143

3,701

No major discovery or other favorable or adverse event has
    caused a significant change in estimated gas reserves since
    year-end 2008. We have not filed on a recurring basis estimates
    of our total proved net oil and gas reserves with any
    U.S. regulatory authority or agency other than the
    Department of Energy (DOE) and the SEC. The estimates furnished
    to the DOE have been consistent with those furnished to the SEC,
    although Exploration & Production has not yet been
    required to file any information with respect to its estimated
    total reserves at December 31, 2008 with the DOE. Certain
    estimates filed with the DOE may not necessarily be directly
    comparable to those reported here due to special DOE reporting
    requirements, such as the requirement to report gross operated
    reserves only. In 2007 and 2006, the underlying estimated
    reserves for the DOE did not differ by more than 5 percent
    from the underlying estimated reserves utilized in preparing the
    estimated reserves reported to the SEC.

Approximately 99 percent of our year-end 2008 United States
    proved reserves estimates were audited in each separate basin by
    Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc. (NSAI). When
    compared on a

well-by-well

basis, some of our estimates are greater and some are less than
    the estimates of NSAI. However, in the opinion of NSAI, the
    estimates of our proved reserves are in the aggregate reasonable
    by basin and have been prepared in accordance with generally
    accepted petroleum engineering and evaluation principles. These
    principles are set forth in the Standards Pertaining to the
    Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserve Information
    promulgated by the Society of Petroleum Engineers. NSAI is
    satisfied with our methods and procedures in preparing the
    December 31, 2008 reserve estimates and saw nothing of an
    unusual nature that would cause NSAI to take exception with the
    estimates, in the aggregate, as prepared by us. Reserve
    estimates related to properties underlying the Williams Coal
    Seam Gas Royalty Trust, which comprise approximately
    1 percent of our total U.S. proved reserves, were
    prepared by Miller and Lents, LTD.

The SEC has revised its oil and gas reporting requirements
    effective for fiscal years ending on or after December 31,
    2009, with early adoption prohibited. These changes include:

•

Expanding the definition of oil and gas reserves and providing
    clarification of certain concepts and technologies used in the
    reserve estimation process.

•

Allowing optional disclosure of probable and possible reserves
    and permitting optional disclosure of price sensitivity analysis.

•

Modifying prices used to estimate reserves for SEC disclosure
    purposes to a

12-month

average price instead of a

single-day,

period-end

price.

•

Requiring certain additional disclosures around proved
    undeveloped reserves, internal controls used to ensure
    objectivity of the estimation process, and qualifications of
    those preparing and/or auditing the reserves.

Piceance
    basin

The Piceance basin is located in northwestern Colorado and is
    our largest area of concentrated development. During 2008 we
    operated an average of 26 drilling rigs in the basin. As of
    December 31, 2008, 15 of these rigs were the new high
    efficiency rigs designed to drill up to 22 wells from one
    location. This area has approximately 1,770 undrilled proved
    locations in inventory. Within this basin we own and operate
    natural gas gathering facilities including some 300 miles
    of gathering lines and associated field compression.
    Approximately 85 percent of the gas gathered is our own
    equity production. The gathering system also includes 7
    processing plants and associated treating facilities with an
    eighth plant that came on-line in February 2009, for a total
    capacity of 1.25 Bcfd. During 2008, these plants recovered
    approximately 69 million gallons of natural gas liquids
    (NGLs) which were marketed separately from the residue natural
    gas.

San Juan
    basin

The San Juan basin is located in northwest New Mexico and
    southwest Colorado.

Powder
    River basin

The Powder River basin is located in northeast Wyoming. The
    Powder River basin includes large areas with multiple coal seam
    potential, targeting thick coal bed methane formations at
    shallow depths. We have a significant inventory of undrilled
    locations, providing long-term drilling opportunities.

Mid-Continent
    properties

The Mid-Continent properties are located in the southeastern
    Oklahoma portion of the Arkoma basin and the Barnett Shale in
    the Fort Worth basin of Texas.

Other
    properties

Other properties are primarily comprised of interests in the
    Green River basin in southwestern Wyoming. Also included is
    exploration activity and other miscellaneous activity.

    statistics

We focus on lower-risk development drilling. Our development
    drilling success rate was approximately 99 percent in each
    of 2008, 2007 and 2006. The following table summarizes domestic
    drilling activity by number and type of well for the periods

We also successfully drilled four exploratory wells in 2008. In
    addition, two exploratory wells drilled in prior years were
    determined to be unsuccessful in 2008.

Because we currently have a low-risk drilling program in proven
    basins, the main component of risk that we manage is price risk.
    Exploration & Production natural gas hedges for 2009
    domestic natural gas production consist of NYMEX fixed price
    contracts of

106 MMcf/d

(whole year) and approximately

490 MMcf/d

in regional collars (whole year). Our natural gas production
    hedges in 2008 consisted of

70 MMcf/d

in NYMEX fixed price hedges and

434 MMcf/d

in regional collars. A collar is an option contract that sets a
    gas price floor and ceiling for a certain volume of natural gas.
    Hedging decisions are made considering the overall Williams
    commodity risk exposure and are not executed independently by
    Exploration & Production; there are expected future
    gas purchases for other Williams entities that when taken as a
    net position may offset price risk related to
    Exploration & Production’s expected future gas
    sales. In February 2007, we entered into a five-year unsecured
    credit agreement with certain banks in order to reduce margin
    requirements related to our hedging activities as well as lower
    transaction fees. Margin requirements, if any, under this new
    facility are dependent on the level of hedging with the banks
    and on natural gas reserves value. In June 2008, we amended this
    agreement to extend the facility through year end 2013.

Acquisitions &
    divestitures

In January 2008, we sold a contractual right to a production
    payment on certain future international hydrocarbon production
    for $148 million. As a result of the contract termination,
    we have no further interests associated with the crude oil
    concession, which is located in Peru. We obtained these
    interests through our acquisition of Barrett Resources
    Corporation in 2001.

In May 2008, we acquired certain undeveloped leasehold acreage,
    producing properties and gathering facilities in the Piceance
    basin for $285 million. In July 2008, a third party
    exercised its contractual option to purchase, on the same terms
    and conditions, an interest in a portion of the acquired assets
    for $71 million. We received this $71 million in
    October 2008.

In September 2008, we increased our position in the
    Fort Worth basin by acquiring certain undeveloped leasehold
    acreage and producing properties for $147 million subject
    to post-closing adjustments. This acquisition is



consistent with our growth strategy of leveraging our horizontal
    drilling expertise by acquiring and developing low-risk
    properties in the Barnett Shale formation.

Through other transactions totaling approximately
    $111 million, Exploration & Production expanded
    its acreage position and producing properties in the
    Fort Worth basin in north-central Texas and also expanded
    its acreage position in the Highlands area of the Piceance basin
    and in the Paradox basin.

Other
    information

In 1993, Exploration & Production conveyed a net
    profits interest in certain of its properties to the Williams
    Coal Seam Gas Royalty Trust. Substantially all of the production
    attributable to the properties conveyed to the trust was from
    the Fruitland coal formation and constituted coal seam gas. We
    subsequently sold trust units to the public in an underwritten
    public offering and retained 3,568,791 trust units then
    representing 36.8 percent of outstanding trust units. We
    have previously sold trust units on the open market, with our
    last sales in June 2005. As of February 1, 2009, we own
    789,291 trust units.

International
    exploration and production interests

We also have investments in international oil and gas interests.
    If combined with our domestic proved reserves, our international
    interests would make up approximately 3 percent of our
    total proved reserves.

Gas
    Pipeline

We own and operate, a combined total of approximately
    14,000 miles of pipelines with a total annual throughput of
    approximately 2,700 trillion British Thermal Units of natural
    gas and

peak-day

delivery capacity of approximately 12 MMdt of gas. Gas
    Pipeline consists of Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Company, LLC
    (Transco) and Northwest Pipeline GP (Northwest Pipeline). Gas
    Pipeline also holds interests in joint venture interstate and
    intrastate natural gas pipeline systems including a
    50 percent interest in Gulfstream Natural Gas System,
    L.L.C. Gas Pipeline also includes WMZ.

Transco

Transco is an interstate natural gas transportation company that
    owns and operates a 10,100-mile natural gas pipeline system
    extending from Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi and the offshore
    Gulf of Mexico through Alabama, Georgia, South Carolina, North
    Carolina, Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey to
    the New York City metropolitan area. The system serves customers
    in Texas and 11 southeast and Atlantic seaboard states,
    including major metropolitan areas in Georgia, North Carolina,
    Washington, D.C., New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania.

Pipeline
    system and customers

At December 31, 2008, Transco’s system had a mainline
    delivery capacity of approximately 4.7 MMdt of natural gas
    per day from its production areas to its primary markets. Using
    its Leidy Line along with market-area storage and transportation
    capacity, Transco can deliver an additional 3.8 MMdt of
    natural gas per day for a system-wide delivery capacity total of
    approximately 8.5 MMdt of natural gas per day.
    Transco’s system includes 45 compressor stations, four
    underground storage fields, and a liquefied natural gas (LNG)
    storage facility. Compression facilities at sea level-rated
    capacity total approximately 1.5 million horsepower.

Transco’s major natural gas transportation customers are
    public utilities and municipalities that provide service to
    residential, commercial, industrial and electric generation end
    users. Shippers on Transco’s system include public
    utilities, municipalities, intrastate pipelines, direct
    industrial users, electrical generators, gas marketers and
    producers. One customer accounted for approximately
    11 percent and another customer accounted for approximately
    10 percent of Transco’s total revenues in 2008.
    Transco’s firm transportation agreements are generally
    long-term agreements with various expiration dates and account
    for the major portion of Transco’s business. Additionally,
    Transco offers storage services and interruptible transportation
    services under short-term agreements.



Transco has natural gas storage capacity in four underground
    storage fields located on or near its pipeline system or market
    areas and operates two of these storage fields. Transco also has
    storage capacity in an LNG storage facility and operates the
    facility. The total usable gas storage capacity available to
    Transco and its customers in such underground storage fields and
    LNG storage facility and through storage service contracts is
    approximately 204 billion cubic feet of gas. In October
    2008, the FERC approved Transco’s request to abandon its
    Hester storage facility, which is not in operation. Hester is
    not included in the capacity described above. Storage capacity
    permits Transco’s customers to inject gas into storage
    during the summer and off-peak periods for delivery during peak
    winter demand periods.

Transco
    expansion projects

The pipeline projects listed below are future pipeline projects
    for which we have customer commitments.

Sentinel
    Expansion Project

The Sentinel Expansion Project involves an expansion of our
    existing natural gas transmission system from the Leidy Hub in
    Clinton County, Pennsylvania and from the Pleasant Valley
    interconnection with Cove Point LNG in Fairfax County, Virginia
    to various delivery points requested by the shippers under the
    project. The capital cost of the project is estimated to be up
    to approximately $200 million. Phase I was placed into
    service in December 2008. Phase II is expected to be placed
    into service by November 2009.

Mobile
    Bay South Expansion Project

The Mobile Bay South Expansion Project involves the addition of
    compression at Transco’s Station 85 in Choctaw County,
    Alabama to allow Transco to provide firm transportation service
    southbound on the Mobile Bay line from Station 85 to various
    delivery points. The capital cost of the project is estimated to
    be up to approximately $37 million. Transco plans to place
    the project into service by May 2010.

    North Expansion Project

The 85 North Expansion Project involves an expansion of our
    existing natural gas transmission system from Station 85 in
    Choctaw County, Alabama to various delivery points as far north
    as North Carolina. The capital cost of the project is estimated
    to be $248 million. Transco plans to place the project into
    service in phases, in July 2010 and May 2011.

Transco’s facilities are divided into eight rate zones.
    Five are located in the production area, and three are located
    in the market area. Long-haul transportation involves gas that
    Transco receives in one of the production-area zones and
    delivers to a market-area zone. Market-area transportation
    involves gas that Transco both receives and



delivers within the market-area zones. Production-area
    transportation involves gas that Transco both receives and
    delivers within the production-area zones.

Northwest
    Pipeline

Northwest Pipeline is an interstate natural gas transportation
    company that owns and operates a natural gas pipeline system
    extending from the San Juan basin in northwestern New
    Mexico and southwestern Colorado through Colorado, Utah,
    Wyoming, Idaho, Oregon and Washington to a point on the Canadian
    border near Sumas, Washington. Northwest Pipeline provides
    services for markets in California, Arizona, New Mexico,
    Colorado, Utah, Nevada, Wyoming, Idaho, Oregon and Washington
    directly or indirectly through interconnections with other
    pipelines.

Pipeline
    system and customers

At December 31, 2008, Northwest Pipeline’s system,
    having long-term firm transportation agreements including
    peaking service of approximately 3.6 Bcf of natural gas per
    day, was composed of approximately 3,900 miles of mainline
    and lateral transmission pipelines and 41 transmission
    compressor stations having a combined sea level-rated capacity
    of approximately 473,000 horsepower.

In 2008, Northwest Pipeline served a total of 136 transportation
    and storage customers. We transport and store natural gas for a
    broad mix of customers, including local natural gas distribution
    companies, municipal utilities, direct industrial users,
    electric power generators and natural gas marketers and
    producers. The largest customer of Northwest Pipeline in 2008
    accounted for approximately 20.7 percent of its total
    operating revenues. No other customer accounted for more than
    10 percent of Northwest Pipeline’s total operating
    revenues in 2008. Northwest Pipeline’s firm transportation
    and storage contracts are generally long-term contracts with
    various expiration dates and account for the major portion of
    Northwest Pipeline’s business. Additionally, Northwest
    Pipeline offers interruptible and short-term firm transportation
    service.

As a part of its transportation services, Northwest Pipeline
    utilizes underground storage facilities in Utah and Washington
    enabling it to balance daily receipts and deliveries. Northwest
    Pipeline also owns and operates an LNG storage facility in
    Washington that provides service for customers during a few days
    of extreme demands. These storage facilities have an aggregate
    firm delivery capacity of approximately 700 MMcf of gas per
    day.

Northwest
    Pipeline expansion projects

The pipeline projects listed below were completed during 2008 or
    are future pipeline projects for which we have customer
    commitments.

Colorado
    Hub Connection Project

Northwest Pipeline has proposed installing a new

27-mile,

24-inch

diameter lateral to connect the Meeker/White River Hub near
    Meeker, Colorado to its mainline near Sand Springs, Colorado.
    This project is referred to as the Colorado Hub Connection (CHC
    Project). It is estimated that the construction of the CHC
    Project will cost up to $60 million with service targeted
    to commence in November 2009. Northwest Pipeline will combine
    the lateral capacity with 341 MDth per day of existing mainline
    capacity from various receipt points for delivery to Ignacio,
    Colorado, including approximately 98 MDth per day of capacity
    that was sold on a short-term basis. Approximately 243 MDth per
    day of this capacity is held by Pan-Alberta Gas under a contract
    that terminates on October 31, 2012.

In addition to providing greater opportunity for contract
    extensions for the short-term firm and Pan-Alberta capacity, the
    CHC Project provides direct access to additional natural gas
    supplies at the Meeker/White River Hub for Northwest
    Pipeline’s on-system and off-system markets. Northwest
    Pipeline has entered into precedent agreements with terms
    ranging between eight and fifteen years at maximum rates for all
    of the short-term firm and Pan-Alberta capacity resulting in the
    successful re-contracting of the capacity out to 2018 and
    beyond. In September 2008, Northwest Pipeline filed an
    application for FERC certification and is awaiting necessary
    regulatory approvals. If Northwest Pipeline does not proceed
    with the CHC Project, Northwest



Pipeline will seek recovery of any shortfall in annual capacity
    reservation revenues from our remaining customers in a future
    rate proceeding. Northwest Pipeline does expect to collect
    maximum rates for the new CHC Project capacity commitments and
    seek approval to recover the CHC Project costs in any future
    rate case filed with the FERC.

Sundance
    Trail Expansion

In February 2008, Northwest Pipeline initiated an open season
    for the proposed Sundance Trail Expansion project that resulted
    in the execution of an agreement for 150 MDth per day of firm
    transportation service from the Meeker/White River Hub in
    Colorado for delivery to the Opal Hub in Wyoming. The project
    will include construction of approximately 16 miles of

30-inch

loop
    between Northwest Pipeline’s existing Green River and Muddy
    Creek compressor stations in Wyoming as well as an upgrade to
    Northwest Pipeline’s existing Vernal compressor station,
    with service targeted to commence in November 2010. The total
    project is estimated to cost up to $65 million, including
    the cost of replacing existing compression at the Vernal
    compressor station which will enhance the efficiency of
    Northwest Pipeline’s system. The Sundance Trail Expansion
    will utilize available capacity on the CHC lateral and the
    existing Piceance lateral in conjunction with available and
    expanded mainline capacity. The Sundance Trail Expansion remains
    subject to certain conditions, including receiving the necessary
    regulatory approvals. Northwest Pipeline expects to collect
    maximum system rates, and will seek approval to roll-in the
    Sundance Trail Expansion costs in any future rate case filed
    with the FERC.

Gulfstream
    Natural Gas System, L.L.C. (Gulfstream)

Gulfstream is a natural gas pipeline system extending from the
    Mobile Bay area in Alabama to markets in Florida. Gas Pipeline
    and Spectra Energy, through their respective subsidiaries, each
    holds a 50 percent ownership interest in Gulfstream and
    provides operating services for Gulfstream. At December 31,
    2008, our equity investment in Gulfstream was $525 million.

Gulfstream
    expansion projects

Gulfstream placed the Phase III expansion project in
    service on September 1, 2008. The project extended the
    pipeline system into South Florida and fully subscribed the
    remaining 345 Mdt/d of firm capacity on the existing pipeline
    system on a long-term basis. The estimated capital cost of this
    project is $118 million, with Gas Pipeline’s share
    being 50 percent of such costs. Service under the
    Gulfstream Phase IV expansion project began during the
    fourth quarter of 2008. The project is fully subscribed on a
    long-term basis and is the first incremental expansion of
    Gulfstream’s mainline capacity. The estimated capital cost
    of this expansion is $192 million, with Gas Pipeline’s
    share being 50 percent of such costs.



WMZ

WMZ was formed to own and operate natural gas transportation and
    storage assets. We currently own an approximate
    45.7 percent limited partnership interest and a
    2 percent general partner interest in WMZ. WMZ provides us
    with lower cost of capital that is expected to enable growth of
    our Gas Pipeline business. WMZ also creates a vehicle to
    monetize our qualifying assets. Such transactions, which are
    subject to approval by the boards of directors of Williams and
    WMZ’s general partner, allow us to retain control of the
    assets through our ownership interest in WMZ. A subsidiary of
    ours, Williams Pipeline GP LLC, serves as the general partner of
    WMZ. The initial asset of WMZ is a 35 percent interest in
    Northwest Pipeline.

Midstream
    Gas & Liquids

Our Midstream segment, one of the nation’s largest natural
    gas gatherers and processors, has primary service areas
    concentrated in major producing basins in Colorado, New Mexico,
    Wyoming, the Gulf of Mexico, Venezuela and western Canada.
    Midstream’s primary businesses — natural gas
    gathering, treating, and processing; NGL fractionation, storage
    and transportation; and oil transportation — fall
    within the middle of the process of taking natural gas and crude
    oil from the wellhead to the consumer. NGLs, ethylene and
    propylene are extracted/produced at our plants, including our
    Canadian and Gulf Coast olefins plants. These products are used
    primarily for the manufacture of petrochemicals, home heating
    fuels and refinery feedstock.

Some of our assets are owned through our interest in WPZ.

Key variables for our business will continue to be:

•

Retaining and attracting customers by continuing to provide
    reliable services;

•

Revenue growth associated with additional infrastructure either
    completed or currently under construction;

•

Disciplined growth in our core service areas and new step-out
    areas;

•

Prices impacting our commodity-based processing and olefin
    activities.

Domestic
    gathering, processing and treating

Our domestic gathering systems receive natural gas from
    producers’ oil and natural gas wells and gather these
    volumes to gas processing, treating or redelivery facilities.
    Typically, natural gas, in its raw form, is not acceptable for
    transportation in major interstate natural gas pipelines or for
    commercial use as a fuel. In addition, natural gas contains
    various amounts of NGLs, which generally have a higher value
    when separated from the natural gas stream. Our processing and
    treating plants remove water vapor, carbon dioxide and other
    contaminants and our processing plants extract the NGLs. NGL
    products include:

•

Ethane, primarily used in the petrochemical industry as a
    feedstock for ethylene production, one of the basic building
    blocks for plastics;

•

Propane, used for heating, fuel and as a petrochemical feedstock
    in the production of ethylene and propylene, another building
    block for petrochemical-based products such as carpets, packing
    materials and molded plastic parts;

•

Normal butane, iso-butane and natural gasoline, primarily used
    by the refining industry as blending stocks for motor gasoline
    or as a petrochemical feedstock.

Although a significant portion of our gas processing services
    are performed for a volumetric-based fee, a portion of our gas
    processing agreements are commodity-based and include two
    distinct types of commodity exposure. The first type includes
    “keep whole” processing agreements whereby we own the
    rights to the value from NGLs recovered at our plants and have
    the obligation to replace the lost heating value with natural
    gas. Under these agreements, we are exposed to the spread
    between NGL prices and natural gas prices. The second type
    consists of “percent of liquids” agreements whereby we
    receive a portion of the extracted liquids with no direct
    exposure to the price of natural gas. Under these agreements, we
    are only exposed to NGL price movements. NGLs we retain in



connection with these types of processing agreements are
    referred to as our equity NGL production. Our gathering and
    processing agreements have terms ranging from

month-to-month

to the life of the producing lease. Generally, our gathering and
    processing agreements are long-term agreements.

Our domestic gas gathering and processing customers are
    generally natural gas producers who have proved

and/or

producing natural gas fields in the areas surrounding our
    infrastructure. During 2008, these operations gathered and
    processed gas for approximately 230 gas gathering and processing
    customers. Our top six gathering and processing customers
    accounted for about 50 percent of our domestic gathering
    and processing revenue.

In addition to our natural gas assets, we own and operate three
    deepwater crude oil pipelines and a deepwater floating
    production platform in the Gulf of Mexico. Our crude oil
    transportation revenues are typically volumetric-based fee
    arrangements. However, a substantial portion of our marketing
    revenues are recognized from purchase and sale arrangements
    whereby we purchase oil from producers at the receipt points of
    our crude oil pipelines for an index-based price and sell the
    oil back to the producers at delivery points at the same
    index-based price. Our offshore floating production platform
    provides centralized services to deepwater producers such as
    compression, separation, production handling, water removal and
    pipeline landings. Revenue sources have historically included a
    combination of fixed-fee, volumetric-based fee and cost
    reimbursement arrangements. Fixed fees associated with the
    resident production at our Devils Tower facility are recognized
    on a units of production basis.

Geographically, our Midstream natural gas assets are positioned
    to maximize commercial and operational synergies with our other
    assets. For example, most of our offshore gathering and
    processing assets attach and process or condition natural gas
    supplies delivered to the Transco pipeline. Also, our gathering
    and processing facilities in the San Juan Basin handle
    about 87 percent of our Exploration & Production
    group’s wellhead production in this basin. Both our
    San Juan Basin and Southwest Wyoming systems deliver
    residue gas volumes into Northwest Pipeline’s interstate
    system in addition to third party interstate systems.

West
    Region domestic gathering, processing and treating

We own

and/or

operate domestic gas gathering, processing and treating assets
    within the western states of Wyoming, Colorado and New Mexico.

In the Rocky Mountain area, our assets include:

•

Approximately 3,500 miles of gathering pipelines serving
    the Wamsutter and southwest Wyoming areas in Wyoming;

•

Opal and Echo Springs processing plants with a combined daily
    inlet capacity of over

1,800 MMcf/d

and NGL processing capacity of nearly 100 Mbbls/d.

In the Four Corners area, our assets include:

•

Approximately 3,800 miles of gathering pipelines serving
    the San Juan Basin in New Mexico and Colorado;

•

Ignacio, Kutz and Lybrook processing plants with a combined
    daily inlet capacity of

765 MMcf/d

and NGL processing capacity of approximately 40 Mbbls/d;

•

Milagro and Esperanza natural gas treating plants, which remove
    carbon dioxide but do not extract NGLs, with a combined daily
    inlet capacity of

750 MMcf/d.

At our Milagro facility, we also use the steam generated by
    gas-driven turbines to produce approximately 60 mega-watts per
    day of electricity which we primarily sell into the local
    electrical grid.

As we enter the Piceance Basin in Colorado, our initial
    infrastructure includes:

•

Parachute Lateral, a

38-mile,

30-inch

diameter line transporting gas from the Parachute area to the
    Greasewood Hub and White River Hub in northwest Colorado. Our
    new Willow Creek processing plant (see expansion projects below)
    will process gas flowing through the Parachute Lateral in
    addition to processing gas from other sources. In an arrangement
    approved by the FERC, Midstream is leasing the



pipeline to Gas Pipeline, who will continue to operate the
    Parachute Lateral until completion of a planned FERC abandonment
    filing;

•

PGX pipeline delivering NGLs previously transported by truck
    from Exploration & Production’s existing
    Parachute area processing plants to a major NGL transportation
    pipeline system.

West
    region expansion projects

Our two major expansion projects include the new Willow Creek
    facility and additional capacity at our Echo Springs facility.

•

The Willow Creek processing plant is a

450 MMcf/d

cryogenic natural gas processing plant in western
    Colorado’s Piceance Basin, where Exploration &
    Production has its most significant volume of natural gas
    production, reserves and development activity. The plant is
    designed to recover 25 Mbbls/d of NGLs and the plant’s
    inlet processing capacity is expected to be full at

start-up

expected in late 2009.

•

We expect to significantly increase the processing and NGL
    production capacities at our Echo Springs cryogenic natural gas
    processing plant in Wyoming. The addition of a fourth cryogenic
    processing train will add approximately

350 MMcf/d

of processing capacity and 30 Mbbls/d of NGL production
    capacity, nearly doubling Echo Spring’s capacities in both
    cases. We expect to begin construction on the fourth train at
    Echo Springs during the second half of 2009 and to bring the
    additional capacity online during late 2010, subject to all
    applicable permitting.

Gulf
    region domestic gathering, processing and treating

We own

and/or

operate domestic gas gathering and processing assets and crude
    oil pipelines primarily within the onshore and offshore shelf
    and deepwater areas in and around the Gulf Coast states of
    Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama. We own:

•

Over 700 miles of onshore and offshore natural gas
    gathering pipelines, including:

•

The

115-mile

deepwater Seahawk gas pipeline in the western Gulf of Mexico,
    flowing into our Markham processing plant and serving the
    Boomvang and Nansen field areas;

•

The

139-mile

Canyon Chief gas pipeline, now including the new

37-mile

Blind Faith extension, in the eastern Gulf of Mexico, flowing
    into our Mobile Bay processing plant and serving the Devils
    Tower, Triton, Goldfinger, Bass Lite and Blind Faith fields;

•

Mobile Bay, Markham, and Cameron Meadows processing plants with
    a combined daily inlet capacity of nearly

1,500 MMcf/d

and NGL handling capacity of 65 Mbbls/d;

•

Canyon Station offshore gas production system fixed-leg
    platform, which brings natural gas to specifications allowable
    by major interstate pipelines but does not extract NGLs, with a
    daily inlet capacity of

500 MMcf/d;

•

Three deepwater crude oil pipelines with a combined length of
    300 miles and capacity of 300 Mbbls/d including:

•

BANJO pipeline running parallel to the Seahawk gas pipeline
    delivering production from two producer-owned spar-type floating
    production systems; and delivering production to our
    shallow-water platform at Galveston Area Block A244 (GA-A244)
    and then onshore through ExxonMobil’s Hoover Offshore Oil
    Pipeline System (HOOPS);

•

Alpine pipeline in the central Gulf of Mexico, serving the
    Gunnison field, and delivering production to GA-A244 and then
    onshore through HOOPS under a joint tariff agreement;

•

Mountaineer oil pipeline which connects to similar production
    sources as our Canyon Chief pipeline and, now including the new
    Blind Faith extension, ultimately delivering production to
    ChevronTexaco’s Empire Terminal in Plaquemines Parish,
    Louisiana;

•

Devils Tower floating production platform located in Mississippi
    Canyon Block 773, approximately 150 miles
    south-southwest of Mobile, Alabama and serving production from
    the Devils Tower, Triton, Goldfinger and Bass Lite fields.
    Located in 5,610 feet of water, it is one of the
    world’s deepest dry tree



spars. The platform, which is operated by ENI Petroleum on our
    behalf, is capable of handling

210 MMcf/d

of natural gas and 60 Mbbls/d of oil.

Gulf
    region expansion projects

The deepwater Gulf continues to be an attractive growth area for
    our Midstream business. Since 1997, we have invested over
    $1.5 billion in new midstream assets in the Gulf of Mexico.
    These facilities provide both onshore and offshore services
    through pipelines, platforms and processing plants. The new
    facilities could also attract incremental gas volumes to
    Transco’s pipeline system in the southeastern United States.

Our current major expansion projects in the Gulf region include:

•

In the deepwater of the Gulf of Mexico, we completed
    construction of

37-mile

extensions of both of our oil and gas pipelines from our Devils
    Tower spar to the Blind Faith discovery located in Mississippi
    Canyon in the eastern deepwater of the Gulf of Mexico. The
    pipelines have been commissioned and production began flowing in
    the fourth quarter of 2008;

•

In the western deepwater of the Gulf of Mexico, we continued
    construction activities on our Perdido Norte project which will
    include an expansion of our onshore Markham gas processing
    facility and oil and gas lines that would expand the scale of
    our existing infrastructure.

Venezuela

Our Venezuelan investments involve gas compression and an equity
    interest in a gas processing and NGL fractionation operation. We
    own controlling interests and operate three gas compressor
    facilities which provide roughly 65 percent of the gas
    injections in eastern Venezuela. These facilities help stabilize
    the reservoir and enhance the recovery of crude oil by
    re-injecting natural gas at high pressures. The three gas
    compressor facilities, owned within two of our Venezuelan
    subsidiaries, had a net book value of $324 million at
    December 31, 2008 and are held as security on
    $177 million of non-recourse debt at December 31,
    2008. We own controlling interests of 70% and 66.67% in these
    two subsidiaries.

Our Venezuelan assets were constructed and are currently
    operated for the exclusive benefit of the Venezuelan state-owned
    oil company, Petróleos de Venezuela S.A. under long-term
    contracts. These significant contracts have a remaining term
    between 9 and 12 years and our revenues are based on a
    combination of fixed capital payments, throughput volumes and,
    in the case of one of the gas compression facilities, a minimum
    throughput guarantee. The Venezuelan government continues its
    public criticism of U.S. economic and political policy, has
    implemented unilateral changes to existing energy related
    contracts, and has expropriated privately held assets within the
    energy and telecommunications sector. The continued threat of
    nationalization of certain energy-related assets in Venezuela
    could have a material negative impact on our results of
    operations. The economic situation resulting from lower
    commodity prices could jeopardize the Venezuelan oil industry
    and may further exacerbate political tension in Venezuela. We
    may not receive adequate compensation, or any compensation, if
    our assets in Venezuela are nationalized.

We also own a 49.25 percent interest in Accroven SRL which
    includes two

400 MMcf/d

NGL extraction plants, a 50 Mbbls/d NGL fractionation plant and
    associated storage and refrigeration facilities. Our equity
    investment had a book value of $69 million at
    December 31, 2008.

Olefins

In the Gulf of Mexico region, we own a


/


interest in and are the operator of an ethane cracker at
    Geismar, Louisiana, with a total production capacity of
    1.3 billion pounds of ethylene and 90 million pounds
    of propylene per year. Our feedstock for the ethane cracker is
    ethane and propane; as a result, we are exposed to the price
    spread between ethane and propane, and ethylene and propylene.
    We also own ethane and propane pipeline systems and a refinery
    grade propylene splitter with a production capacity of
    approximately 500 million pounds per year of propylene and
    its related pipeline system in Louisiana. At our propylene
    splitter, we purchase refinery grade propylene and fractionate
    it into polymer grade propylene and propane; as a result we are
    exposed to the price spread between those commodities.



Our Canadian operations include an olefin liquids extraction
    plant located near Ft. McMurray, Alberta and an olefin
    fractionation facility near Edmonton, Alberta. Our facilities
    extract olefinic liquids from the off-gas produced by a third
    party oil sands bitumen upgrading process. Our arrangement with
    the third-party upgrade is a “keep whole” type where
    we remove a mix of NGLs and olefins from the off-gas and return
    the equivalent heating value back to the third party in the form
    of natural gas. We then fractionate, treat, store, terminal and
    sell the propane, propylene, butane, butylenes and condensate
    recovered from this process. Our commodity price exposure is the
    spread between the price for natural gas and the NGL and olefin
    products we produce. We continue to be the only olefins
    fractionator in western Canada and the only treater/processor of
    oil sands upgrader off-gas. These operations extract
    petrochemical feedstocks from upgrader off-gas streams allowing
    the upgraders to burn cleaner natural gas streams and reduce
    overall air emissions. The extraction plant has processing
    capacity in excess of

100 MMcf/d

with the ability to recover in excess of 15 Mbbls/d of
    olefin and NGL products.

NGL and
    olefin marketing services

In addition to our gathering, processing and olefin production
    operations, we market NGLs and olefin products to a wide range
    of users in the energy and petrochemical industries. The NGL
    marketing business transports and markets equity NGLs from the
    production at our domestic processing plants, and also markets
    NGLs on behalf of third-party NGL producers, including some of
    our fee-based processing customers, and the NGL volumes owned by
    Discovery Producer Services L.L.C. The NGL marketing business
    bears the risk of price changes in these NGL volumes while they
    are being transported to final sales delivery points. In order
    to meet sales contract obligations, we may purchase products in
    the spot market for resale. The majority of domestic sales are
    based on supply contracts of one year or less in duration. The
    production from our Canadian facilities is marketed in Canada
    and in the United States.

Other

We own interests in

and/or

operate NGL fractionation and storage assets. These assets
    include two partially owned NGL fractionation facilities: one
    near Conway, Kansas and the other in Baton Rouge, Louisiana that
    have a combined capacity in excess of 167 Mbbls/d. We also
    own approximately 20 million barrels of NGL storage
    capacity in central Kansas near Conway.

We own an equity interest in and operate the facilities of
    Discovery Producer Services LLC and its subsidiary Discovery Gas
    Transmission Services LLC (collectively, Discovery) through our
    interest in WPZ. Discovery’s assets include a

WPZ

WPZ was formed in 2005 to engage in gathering, transporting,
    processing and treating natural gas and fractionating and
    storing NGLs. We currently own approximately a 23.6 percent
    limited partnership interest including the interests of the
    general partner, Williams Partners GP LLC, which is wholly owned
    by us, and incentive distribution rights. WPZ provides us with
    an alternative source of equity capital. WPZ also creates a
    vehicle to monetize our qualifying assets. Such transactions,
    which are subject to approval by the boards of directors of both
    Williams and WPZ’s general partner, allow us to retain
    control of the assets through our ownership interest in WPZ and
    operation of the assets. WPZ’s asset portfolio includes
    Williams Four Corners LLC, certain ownership interests in
    Wamsutter LLC, a 60 percent interest in Discovery, three
    integrated NGL storage facilities near Conway, Kansas, a
    50 percent interest in an NGL fractionator near Conway,
    Kansas and the Carbonate Trend sour gas gathering pipeline off
    the coast of Alabama.

Gas
    Marketing Services

Gas Marketing Services (Gas Marketing) primarily supports our
    natural gas businesses by providing marketing and risk
    management services, which includes marketing and hedging the
    gas produced by Exploration & Production, and
    procuring fuel and shrink gas and hedging natural gas liquids
    sales for Midstream. Gas Marketing also provides similar
    services to third parties, such as producers. In addition, Gas
    Marketing manages various natural gas-related contracts such as
    transportation, storage, related hedges and proprietary trading
    positions, including certain legacy natural gas contracts and
    positions.

Gas Marketing’s 2008 natural gas purchase volumes include
    1.4Bcf/d of gas produced by Exploration & Production
    and another 1.0 Bcf/d from third party/other sources. This
    natural gas was in turn marketed and sold to third parties
    (2.0 Bcf/d) and to Midstream (.4 Bcf/d).

Our Exploration & Production and Midstream segments
    may execute commodity hedges with Gas Marketing. In turn, Gas
    Marketing may execute offsetting derivative contracts with
    unrelated third parties.

As a result of the sale of a substantial portion of our Power
    business in the fourth quarter of 2007, Gas Marketing is also
    responsible for certain remaining legacy natural gas contracts
    and positions. During 2008, we substantially reduced the overall
    legacy positions remaining.

Additional
    Business Segment Information

Our ongoing business segments are accounted for as continuing
    operations in the accompanying financial statements and notes to
    financial statements included in Part II.

Operations related to certain assets in “Discontinued
    Operations” have been reclassified from their traditional
    business segment to “Discontinued Operations” in the
    accompanying financial statements and notes to financial
    statements included in Part II.

We perform certain management, legal, financial, tax,
    consultation, information technology, administrative and other
    services for our subsidiaries.

Our principal sources of cash are from dividends and advances
    from our subsidiaries, investments, payments by subsidiaries for
    services rendered, interest payments from subsidiaries on cash
    advances and, if needed, external financings, sales of master
    limited partnership units to the public, and net proceeds from
    asset sales. The amount of dividends available to us from
    subsidiaries largely depends upon each subsidiary’s
    earnings and operating capital requirements. The terms of
    certain of our subsidiaries’ borrowing arrangements limit
    the transfer of funds to us.

We believe that we have adequate sources and availability of raw
    materials and commodities for existing and anticipated business
    needs. In support of our energy commodity activities, primarily
    conducted through Gas Marketing Services, our counterparties
    require us to provide various forms of credit support such as
    margin, adequate assurance amounts and pre-payments for gas
    supplies. Our pipeline systems are all regulated in various ways
    resulting in the financial return on the investments made in the
    systems being limited to standards permitted by the regulatory
    agencies. Each of the pipeline systems has ongoing capital
    requirements for efficiency and mandatory improvements, with
    expansion opportunities also necessitating periodic capital
    outlays.



REGULATORY
    MATTERS

Exploration & Production.

Our
    Exploration & Production business is subject to
    various federal, state and local laws and regulations on
    taxation and payment of royalties, and the development,
    production and marketing of oil and gas, and environmental and
    safety matters. Many laws and regulations require drilling
    permits and govern the spacing of wells, rates of production,
    water discharge, prevention of waste and other matters. Such
    laws and regulations have increased the costs of planning,
    designing, drilling, installing, operating and abandoning our
    oil and gas wells and other facilities. In addition, these laws
    and regulations, and any others that are passed by the
    jurisdictions where we have production, could limit the total
    number of wells drilled or the allowable production from
    successful wells, which could limit our reserves.

Gas Pipeline.

Gas Pipeline’s interstate
    transmission and storage activities are subject to FERC
    regulation under the Natural Gas Act of 1938 (NGA) and under the
    Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978, and, as such, its rates and
    charges for the transportation of natural gas in interstate
    commerce, its accounting, and the extension, enlargement or
    abandonment of its jurisdictional facilities, among other
    things, are subject to regulation. Each gas pipeline company
    holds certificates of public convenience and necessity issued by
    the FERC authorizing ownership and operation of all pipelines,
    facilities and properties for which certificates are required
    under the NGA. Each gas pipeline company is also subject to the
    Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act of 1968, as amended, and the
    Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2002, which regulates safety
    requirements in the design, construction, operation and
    maintenance of interstate natural gas transmission facilities.
    FERC Standards of Conduct govern how our interstate pipelines
    communicate and do business with gas marketing employees. Among
    other things, the Standards of Conduct require that interstate
    pipelines not operate their systems to preferentially benefit
    gas marketing functions.

Each of our interstate natural gas pipeline companies
    establishes its rates primarily through the FERC’s
    ratemaking process. Key determinants in the ratemaking process
    are:

•

Costs of providing service, including depreciation expense;

•

Allowed rate of return, including the equity component of the
    capital structure and related income taxes; and

•

Volume throughput assumptions.

The allowed rate of return is determined in each rate case. Rate
    design and the allocation of costs between the demand and
    commodity rates also impact profitability. As a result of these
    proceedings, certain revenues previously collected may be
    subject to refund.

Midstream Gas & Liquids.

For our
    Midstream segment, onshore gathering is subject to regulation by
    states in which we operate and offshore gathering is subject to
    the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (OCSLA). Of the states
    where Midstream gathers gas, currently only Texas actively
    regulates gathering activities. Texas regulates gathering
    primarily through complaint mechanisms under which the state
    commission may resolve disputes involving an individual
    gathering arrangement. Although offshore gathering facilities
    are not subject to the NGA, offshore transmission pipelines are
    subject to the NGA, and in recent years the FERC has taken a
    broad view of offshore transmission, finding many shallow-water
    pipelines to be jurisdictional transmission. Most gathering
    facilities offshore are subject to the OCSLA, which provides in
    part that outer continental shelf pipelines “must provide
    open and nondiscriminatory access to both owner and non-owner
    shippers.”

Midstream also owns interests in and operates two offshore
    transmission pipelines that are regulated by the FERC because
    they are deemed to transport gas in interstate commerce. Black
    Marlin Pipeline Company provides transportation service for
    offshore Texas production in the High Island area and redelivers
    that gas to intrastate pipeline interconnects near Texas City.
    Discovery provides transportation service for offshore Louisiana
    production from the South Timbalier, Grand Isle, Ewing Bank and
    Green Canyon (deepwater) areas to an onshore processing facility
    and downstream interconnect points with major interstate
    pipelines. FERC regulation requires all terms and conditions of
    service, including the rates charged, to be filed with and
    approved by the FERC before any changes can go into effect. In
    2007, Black Marlin filed and settled a major rate change
    application before the FERC, resulting in increased rates for
    service. In November 2007, Discovery filed a settlement in lieu
    of a rate change filing, which the FERC approved effective
    January 1, 2008, for all parties, except one protestor,
    Exxon Mobil Gas



and Power Marketing Company. Among other things, the settlement
    increases Discovery’s rates for service, although most
    volumes flowing before the settlement became effective are not
    affected by the rate change due to life of lease rates and
    commitments.

Our Midstream Canadian assets are regulated by the Energy
    Resources Conservation Board (ERCB) and Alberta Environment. The
    regulatory system for the Alberta oil and gas industry
    incorporates a large measure of self-regulation, providing that
    licensed operators are held responsible for ensuring that their
    operations are conducted in accordance with all provincial
    regulatory requirements. For situations in which non-compliance
    with the applicable regulations is at issue, the ERCB and
    Alberta Environment have implemented an enforcement process with
    escalating consequences.

Gas Marketing Services.

Our Gas Marketing
    business is subject to a variety of laws and regulations at the
    local, state and federal levels, including the FERC and the
    Commodity Futures Trading Commission regulations. In addition,
    natural gas markets continue to be subject to numerous and
    wide-ranging federal and state regulatory proceedings and
    investigations. We are also subject to various federal and state
    actions and investigations regarding, among other things, market
    structure, behavior of market participants, market prices, and
    reporting to trade publications. We may be liable for refunds
    and other damages and penalties as a result of ongoing actions
    and investigations. The outcome of these matters could affect
    our creditworthiness and ability to perform contractual
    obligations as well as other market participants’
    creditworthiness and ability to perform contractual obligations
    to us.

See Note 16 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements for further details on our regulatory matters.

ENVIRONMENTAL
    MATTERS

Our generation facilities, processing facilities, natural gas
    pipelines, and exploration and production operations are subject
    to federal environmental laws and regulations as well as the
    state and tribal laws and regulations adopted by the
    jurisdictions in which we operate. We could incur liability to
    governments or third parties for any unlawful discharge of oil,
    gas or other pollutants into the air, soil, or water, as well as
    liability for clean up costs. Materials could be released into
    the environment in several ways including, but not limited to:

•

From a well or drilling equipment at a drill site;

•

Leakage from gathering systems, pipelines, processing or
    treating facilities, transportation facilities and storage tanks;

•

Damage to oil and gas wells resulting from accidents during
    normal operations; and

•

Blowouts, cratering and explosions.

Because the requirements imposed by environmental laws and
    regulations are frequently changed, we cannot assure you that
    laws and regulations enacted in the future, including changes to
    existing laws and regulations, will not adversely affect our
    business. In addition, we may be liable for environmental damage
    caused by former operators of our properties.

We believe compliance with environmental laws and regulations
    will not have a material adverse effect on capital expenditures,
    earnings or competitive position. However, environmental laws
    and regulations could affect our business in various ways from
    time to time, including incurring capital and maintenance
    expenditures, fines and penalties, and creating the need to seek
    relief from the FERC for rate increases to recover the costs of
    certain capital expenditures and operation and maintenance
    expenses.

For a discussion of specific environmental issues, see
    “Environmental” under Management’s Discussion and
    Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and
    “Environmental Matters” in Note 16 of our Notes
    to Consolidated Financial Statements.



COMPETITION

Exploration & Production.

Our
    Exploration & Production segment competes with other
    oil and gas concerns, including major and independent oil and
    gas companies in the development, production and marketing of
    natural gas. We compete in areas such as acquisition of oil and
    gas properties and obtaining necessary equipment, supplies and
    services. We also compete in recruiting and retaining skilled
    employees.

Gas Pipeline.

The natural gas industry has
    undergone significant change over the past two decades. A
    highly-liquid competitive commodity market in natural gas and
    increasingly competitive markets for natural gas services,
    including competitive secondary markets in pipeline capacity,
    have developed. As a result, pipeline capacity is being used
    more efficiently, and peaking and storage services are
    increasingly effective substitutes for annual pipeline capacity.

Local distribution company (LDC) and electric industry
    restructuring by states have affected pipeline markets. Pipeline
    operators are increasingly challenged to accommodate the
    flexibility demanded by customers and allowed under tariffs, but
    the changes implemented at the state level have not required
    renegotiation of LDC contracts. The state plans have in some
    cases discouraged LDCs from signing long-term contracts for new
    capacity.

States are in the process of developing new energy plans that
    may require utilities to encourage energy saving measures and
    diversify their energy supplies to include renewable sources.
    This could lower the growth of gas demand.

These factors have increased the risk that customers will reduce
    their contractual commitments for pipeline capacity. Future
    utilization of pipeline capacity will also depend on competition
    from LNG imported into markets and new pipelines from the
    Rockies and other new producing areas, many of which are
    utilizing master limited partnership structures with a lower
    cost of capital, and on growth of natural gas demand.

Midstream Gas & Liquids.

In our
    Midstream segment, we face regional competition with varying
    competitive factors in each basin. Our gathering and processing
    business competes with other midstream companies, interstate and
    intrastate pipelines, producers and independent gatherers and
    processors. We primarily compete with five to ten companies
    across all basins in which we provide services. Numerous factors
    impact any given customer’s choice of a gathering or
    processing services provider, including rate, location, term,
    timeliness of services to be provided, pressure obligations and
    contract structure. We also compete in recruiting and retaining
    skilled employees. In 2005, we formed WPZ to help compete
    against other master limited partnerships for midstream
    projects. By virtue of the master limited partnership structure,
    WPZ provides us with an alternative source of equity capital.

Gas Marketing Services.

In our Gas Marketing
    Services segment, we compete directly with large independent
    energy marketers, marketing affiliates of regulated pipelines
    and utilities, and natural gas producers. We also compete with
    brokerage houses, energy hedge funds and other energy-based
    companies offering similar services.

EMPLOYEES

At February 1, 2009, we had approximately
    4,704 full-time employees including 924 at the corporate
    level, 798 at Exploration & Production, 1,726 at Gas
    Pipeline, 1,232 at Midstream Gas & Liquids, and 24 at
    Gas Marketing Services. None of our employees are represented by
    unions or covered by collective bargaining agreements.

Forward-looking statements are based on numerous assumptions,
    uncertainties and risks that could cause future events or
    results to be materially different from those stated or implied
    in this report. Many of the factors that will determine these
    results are beyond our ability to control or project. Specific
    factors which could cause actual results to differ from those in
    the forward-looking statements include:

•

Availability of supplies (including the uncertainties inherent
    in assessing, estimating, acquiring and developing future
    natural gas reserves), market demand, volatility of prices, and
    the availability and costs of capital;

•

Inflation, interest rates, fluctuation in foreign exchange, and
    general economic conditions (including the recent economic
    slowdown and the disruption of global credit markets and the
    impact of these events on our customers and suppliers);

•

The strength and financial resources of our competitors;

•

Development of alternative energy sources;

•

The impact of operational and development hazards;

•

Costs of, changes in, or the results of laws, government

Additional risks described in our filings with the SEC.

Given the uncertainties and risk factors that could cause our
    actual results to differ materially from those contained in any
    forward-looking statement, we caution investors not to unduly
    rely on our forward-looking statements. We disclaim any
    obligations to and do not intend to update the above list or to
    announce publicly the result of any revisions to any of the
    forward-looking statements to reflect future events or
    developments.

In addition to causing our actual results to differ, the factors
    listed above and referred to below may cause our intentions to
    change from those statements of intention set forth in this
    report. Such changes in our intentions may also cause our
    results to differ. We may change our intentions, at any time and
    without notice, based upon changes in such factors, our
    assumptions or otherwise.

Because forward-looking statements involve risks and
    uncertainties, we caution that there are important factors, in
    addition to those listed above, that may cause actual results to
    differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking
    statements. These factors are described in the following section.

RISK
    FACTORS

You should carefully consider the following risk factors in
    addition to the other information in this report. Each of these
    factors could adversely affect our business, operating results,
    and financial condition as well as adversely affect the value of
    an investment in our securities.

Risks
    Inherent to our Industry and Business

The
    long-term financial condition of our natural gas transportation
    and midstream businesses is dependent on the continued
    availability of natural gas supplies in the supply basins that
    we access, demand for those supplies in our traditional markets,
    and the prices of and market demand for natural
    gas.

The development of the additional natural gas reserves that are
    essential for our gas transportation and midstream businesses to
    thrive requires significant capital expenditures by others for
    exploration and development drilling and the installation of
    production, gathering, storage, transportation and other
    facilities that permit natural gas to be produced and delivered
    to our pipeline systems. Low prices for natural gas, regulatory
    limitations, or the lack of available capital for these projects
    could adversely affect the development and production of
    additional reserves, as well as gathering, storage, pipeline
    transportation and import and export of natural gas supplies,
    adversely impacting our ability to fill the capacities of our
    gathering, transportation and processing facilities.

Production from existing wells and natural gas supply basins
    with access to our pipeline will also naturally decline over
    time. The amount of natural gas reserves underlying these wells
    may also be less than anticipated, and the rate at which
    production from these reserves declines may be greater than
    anticipated. Additionally, the competition for natural gas
    supplies to serve other markets could reduce the amount of
    natural gas supply for our customers. Accordingly, to maintain
    or increase the contracted capacity or the volume of natural gas
    transported on our pipeline and cash flows associated with the
    transportation of natural gas, our customers must compete with
    others to obtain adequate supplies of natural gas. In addition,
    if natural gas prices in the supply basins connected to our
    pipeline systems are higher than prices in other natural gas
    producing regions, our ability to compete with other
    transporters may be negatively impacted on a short-term basis,
    as well as with respect to our long-term recontracting
    activities. If new supplies of natural gas are not obtained to
    replace the natural decline in volumes from existing supply
    areas, or if natural gas supplies are diverted to



serve other markets, the overall volume of natural gas
    transported and stored on our system would decline, which could
    have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
    condition and results of operations. In addition, new LNG import
    facilities built near our markets could result in less demand
    for our gathering and transportation facilities.

Significant
    prolonged changes in natural gas prices could affect supply and
    demand and cause a termination of our transportation and storage
    contracts or a reduction in throughput on our
    system.

Higher natural gas prices over the long term could result in a
    decline in the demand for natural gas and, therefore, in our
    long-term transportation and storage contracts or throughput on
    our Gas Pipelines’ systems. Also, lower natural gas prices
    over the long term could result in a decline in the production
    of natural gas resulting in reduced contracts or throughput on
    our Gas Pipelines’ systems. As a result, significant
    prolonged changes in natural gas prices could have a material
    adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of
    operations and cash flows.

Significant
    capital expenditures are required to replace our
    reserves.

Our exploration, development and acquisition activities require
    substantial capital expenditures. Historically, we have funded
    our capital expenditures through a combination of cash flows
    from operations and debt and equity issuances. Future cash flows
    are subject to a number of variables, including the level of
    production from existing wells, prices of natural gas, and our
    success in developing and producing new reserves. If our cash
    flow from operations is not sufficient to fund our capital
    expenditure budget, we may not be able to access additional bank
    debt, issue debt or equity securities or access other methods of
    financing on an economic basis to meet our capital expenditure
    budget. As a result, our capital expenditure plans may have to
    be adjusted.

Failure
    to replace reserves may negatively affect our
    business.

The growth of our Exploration & Production business
    depends upon our ability to find, develop or acquire additional
    natural gas reserves that are economically recoverable. Our
    proved reserves generally decline when reserves are produced,
    unless we conduct successful exploration or development
    activities or acquire properties containing proved reserves, or
    both. We may not be able to find, develop or acquire additional
    reserves on an economic basis. If natural gas prices increase,
    our costs for additional reserves would also increase,
    conversely if natural gas prices decrease, it could make it more
    difficult to fund the replacement of our reserves.

Exploration
    and development drilling may not result in commercially
    productive reserves.

Our past success rate for drilling projects should not be
    considered a predictor of future commercial success. We do not
    always encounter commercially productive reservoirs through our
    drilling operations. The new wells we drill or participate in
    may not be productive and we may not recover all or any portion
    of our investment in wells we drill or participate in. The cost
    of drilling, completing and operating a well is often uncertain,
    and cost factors can adversely affect the economics of a
    project. Our efforts will be unprofitable if we drill dry wells
    or wells that are productive but do not produce enough reserves
    to return a profit after drilling, operating and other costs.
    Further, our drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed or
    canceled as a result of a variety of factors, including:

•

Increases in the cost of, or shortages or delays in the
    availability of, drilling rigs and equipment, skilled labor,
    capital or transportation;

•

Unexpected drilling conditions or problems;

•

Regulations and regulatory approvals;

•

Changes or anticipated changes in energy prices; and

•

Compliance with environmental and other governmental
    requirements.



Estimating
    reserves and future net revenues involves uncertainties.
    Negative revisions to reserve estimates, oil and gas prices or
    assumptions as to future natural gas prices may lead to
    decreased earnings, losses or impairment of oil and gas assets,
    including related goodwill.

Reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating
    underground accumulations of oil and gas that cannot be measured
    in an exact manner. Reserves that are “proved
    reserves” are those estimated quantities of crude oil,
    natural gas, and natural gas liquids that geological and
    engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty are
    recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing
    economic and operating conditions, but should not be considered
    as a guarantee of results for future drilling projects.

The process relies on interpretations of available geological,
    geophysical, engineering and production data. There are numerous
    uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved
    reserves and in projecting future rates of production and timing
    of developmental expenditures, including many factors beyond the
    control of the producer. The reserve data included in this
    report represent estimates. In addition, the estimates of future
    net revenues from our proved reserves and the present value of
    such estimates are based upon certain assumptions about future
    production levels, prices and costs that may not prove to be
    correct.

Quantities of proved reserves are estimated based on economic
    conditions in existence during the period of assessment. Changes
    to oil and gas prices in the markets for such commodities may
    have the impact of shortening the economic lives of certain
    fields because it becomes uneconomic to produce all recoverable
    reserves on such fields, which reduces proved property reserve
    estimates.

If negative revisions in the estimated quantities of proved
    reserves were to occur, it would have the effect of increasing
    the rates of depreciation, depletion and amortization on the
    affected properties, which would decrease earnings or result in
    losses through higher depreciation, depletion and amortization
    expense. These revisions, as well as revisions in the
    assumptions of future cash flows of these reserves, may also be
    sufficient to trigger impairment losses on certain properties
    which would result in a non-cash charge to earnings. The
    revisions could also possibly affect the evaluation of
    Exploration & Production’s goodwill for
    impairment purposes. At December 31, 2008, we had
    approximately $1 billion of goodwill on our balance sheet.

Certain
    of our services are subject to long-term, fixed-price contracts
    that are not subject to adjustment, even if our cost to perform
    such services exceeds the revenues received from such
    contracts.

Our natural gas transportation and midstream businesses provide
    some services pursuant to long-term, fixed price contracts. It
    is possible that costs to perform services under such contracts
    will exceed the revenues we collect for our services. Although
    most of the services provided by our interstate gas pipelines
    are priced at cost-based rates that are subject to adjustment in
    rate cases, under FERC policy, a regulated service provider and
    a customer may mutually agree to sign a contract for service at
    a “negotiated rate” that may be above or below the
    FERC regulated cost-based rate for that service. These
    “negotiated rate” contracts are not generally subject
    to adjustment for increased costs that could be produced by
    inflation or other factors relating to the specific facilities
    being used to perform the services.

We
    depend on certain key customers for a significant portion of our
    revenues. The loss of any of these key customers or the loss of
    any contracted volumes could result in a decline in our
    business.

Our Gas Pipelines rely on a limited number of customers for a
    significant portion of their revenues. The loss of even a
    portion of our contracted volumes, as a result of competition,
    creditworthiness, inability to negotiate extensions or
    replacements of contracts or otherwise, could have a material
    adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of
    operations and cash flows.

We are
    exposed to the credit risk of our customers.

We are exposed to the credit risk of our customers in the
    ordinary course of our business. Generally our customers are
    rated investment grade, are otherwise considered credit worthy,
    are required to make pre-payments, or provide security to
    satisfy credit concerns. However, we cannot predict to what
    extent our business would be impacted by deteriorating
    conditions in the economy, including declines in our
    customers’ creditworthiness. While



we monitor these situations carefully and attempt to take
    appropriate measures to protect ourselves, it is possible that
    we may have to write down or write off doubtful accounts. Such
    write-downs or write-offs could negatively affect our operating
    results for the period in which they occur, and, if significant,
    could have a material adverse effect on our operating results
    and financial condition.

The
    failure of new sources of natural gas production or liquid
    natural gas (LNG) import terminals to be successfully developed
    in North America could increase natural gas prices and reduce
    the demand for our services.

New sources of natural gas production in the United States and
    Canada, particularly in areas of shale development are expected
    to become an increasingly significant component of future
    natural gas supplies in North America. Additionally, increases
    in LNG supplies are expected to be imported through new LNG
    import terminals, particularly in the Gulf Coast region. If
    these additional sources of supply are not developed, natural
    gas prices could increase and cause consumers of natural gas to
    turn to alternative energy sources, which could have a material
    adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of
    operations and cash flows.

Our
    drilling, production, gathering, processing, storage and
    transporting activities involve numerous risks that might result
    in accidents, and other operating risks and
    hazards.

Our operations are subject to all the risks and hazards
    typically associated with the development and exploration for,
    and the production and transportation of oil and gas. These
    operating risks include, but are not limited to:

•

Fires, blowouts, cratering and explosions;

•

Uncontrollable releases of oil, natural gas or well fluids;

•

Pollution and other environmental risks;

•

Natural disasters;

•

Aging infrastructure;

•

Damage inadvertently caused by third party activity, such as
    operation of construction equipment; and

•

Terrorist attacks or threatened attacks on our facilities or
    those of other energy companies.

These risks could result in loss of human life, personal
    injuries, significant damage to property, environmental
    pollution, impairment of our operations and substantial losses
    to us. In accordance with customary industry practice, we
    maintain insurance against some, but not all, of these risks and
    losses, and only at levels we believe to be appropriate. The
    location of certain segments of our pipelines in or near
    populated areas, including residential areas, commercial
    business centers and industrial sites, could increase the level
    of damages resulting from these risks. In spite of our
    precautions, an event such as those described above could cause
    considerable harm to people or property, and could have a
    material adverse effect on our financial condition and results
    of operations, particularly if the event is not fully covered by
    insurance. Accidents or other operating risks could further
    result in loss of service available to our customers. Such
    circumstances, including those arising from maintenance and
    repair activities, could result in service interruptions on
    segments of our pipeline infrastructure. Potential customer
    impacts arising from service interruptions on segments of our
    pipeline infrastructure could include limitations on the
    pipeline’s ability to satisfy customer requirements,
    obligations to provide reservations charge credits to customers
    in times of constrained capacity, and solicitation of existing
    customers by others for potential new pipeline projects that
    would compete directly with existing services. Such
    circumstances could materially impact our ability to meet
    contractual obligations and retain customers, with a resulting
    negative impact on our business, financial condition, results of
    operations and cash flows.

We do
    not insure against all potential losses and could be seriously
    harmed by unexpected liabilities or by the ability of the
    insurers we do use to satisfy our claims.

We are not fully insured against all risks inherent to our
    business, including environmental accidents that might occur. In
    addition, we do not maintain business interruption insurance in
    the type and amount to cover all possible risks of loss. We
    currently maintain excess liability insurance with limits of
    $610 million per occurrence and in the



aggregate annually and a deductible of $2 million per
    occurrence. This insurance covers us and our affiliates for
    legal and contractual liabilities arising out of bodily injury,
    personal injury or property damage, including resulting loss of
    use to third parties. This excess liability insurance includes
    coverage for sudden and accidental pollution liability for full
    limits, with the first $135 million of insurance also
    providing gradual pollution liability coverage for natural gas
    and NGL operations. Pollution liability coverage excludes:
    release of pollutants subsequent to their disposal; release of
    substances arising from the combustion of fuels that result in
    acidic deposition, and testing, monitoring,

clean-up,

containment, treatment or removal of pollutants from property
    owned, occupied by, rented to, used by or in the care, custody
    or control of us or our affiliates.

We do not insure onshore underground pipelines for physical
    damage, except at river crossings and at certain locations such
    as compressor stations. We maintain coverage of
    $300 million per occurrence for physical damage to onshore
    assets and resulting business interruption caused by terrorist
    acts. We also maintain coverage of $100 million per
    occurrence for physical damage to offshore assets caused by
    terrorist acts, except for our Devils Tower spar where we
    maintain terrorism limits of $300 million per occurrence
    for property damage and $105 million per occurrence for
    resulting business interruption. Also, all of our insurance is
    subject to deductibles. If a significant accident or event
    occurs for which we are not fully insured, it could adversely
    affect our operations and financial condition. We may not be
    able to maintain or obtain insurance of the type and amount we
    desire at reasonable rates. Changes in the insurance markets
    subsequent to the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks and
    hurricanes Katrina, Rita, Gustav and Ike have impacted the
    availability of certain types of coverage at reasonable rates,
    and we may elect to self insure a portion of our asset
    portfolio. We cannot assure you that we will in the future be
    able to obtain the levels or types of insurance we would
    otherwise have obtained prior to these market changes or that
    the insurance coverage we do obtain will not contain large
    deductibles or fail to cover certain hazards or cover all
    potential losses. The occurrence of any operating risks not
    fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect
    on our business, financial condition, results of operations and
    cash flows.

In addition, certain insurance companies that provide coverage
    to us, including American International Group, Inc., have
    experienced negative developments that could impair their
    ability to pay any of our potential claims. As a result, we
    could be exposed to greater losses than anticipated and may have
    to obtain replacement insurance, if available, at a greater cost.

Execution
    of our capital projects subjects us to construction risks,
    increases in labor and materials costs and other risks that may
    adversely affect financial results.

A significant portion of our growth in the gas pipeline and
    midstream business areas is accomplished through the
    construction of new pipelines, processing and storage
    facilities, as well as the expansion of existing facilities.
    Construction of these facilities is subject to various
    regulatory, development and operational risks, including:

•

The ability to obtain necessary approvals and permits by
    regulatory agencies on a timely basis and on acceptable terms;

•

The availability of skilled labor, equipment, and materials to
    complete expansion projects;

•

Potential changes in federal, state and local statutes and
    regulations, including environmental requirements, that prevent
    a project from proceeding or increase the anticipated cost of
    the project;

•

Impediments on our ability to acquire rights-of-way or land
    rights on a timely basis and on acceptable terms;

•

The ability to construct projects within estimated costs,
    including the risk of cost overruns resulting from inflation or
    increased costs of equipment, materials, labor, or other factors
    beyond our control, that may be material; and

•

The ability to access capital markets to fund construction
    projects.

Any of these risks could prevent a project from proceeding,
    delay its completion or increase its anticipated costs. As a
    result, new facilities may not achieve expected investment
    return, which could adversely affect results of operations,
    financial position or cash flows.



Our
    costs and funding obligations for our defined benefit pension
    plans and costs for our other post-retirement benefit plans are
    affected by factors beyond our control.

We have defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all
    of our U.S. employees and other post-retirement benefit
    plans covering certain eligible participants. The timing and
    amount of our funding requirements under the defined benefit
    pension plans depend upon a number of factors we control,
    including changes to pension plan benefits as well as factors
    outside of our control, such as asset returns, interest rates
    and changes in pension laws. Changes to these and other factors
    that can significantly increase our funding requirements could
    have a significant adverse effect on our financial condition.
    The amount of expenses recorded for our defined benefit pension
    plans and other post-retirement benefit plans is also dependent
    on changes in several factors, including market interest rates
    and the returns on plan assets. Significant changes in any of
    these factors may adversely impact our future results of
    operations.

Two of
    our subsidiaries act as the respective general partners of two
    different publicly-traded limited partnerships, Williams
    Partners L.P. and Williams Pipeline Partners L.P. As such, those
    subsidiaries’ operations may involve a greater risk of
    liability than ordinary business operations.

One of our subsidiaries acts as the general partner of WPZ and
    another subsidiary of ours acts as the general partner of WMZ.
    Each of these subsidiaries that act as the general partner of a
    publicly-traded limited partnership may be deemed to have
    undertaken fiduciary obligations with respect to the limited
    partnership of which it serves as the general partner and to the
    limited partners of such limited partnership. Activities
    determined to involve fiduciary obligations to other persons or
    entities typically involve a higher standard of conduct than
    ordinary business operations and therefore may involve a greater
    risk of liability, particularly when a conflict of interests is
    found to exist. Our control of the general partners of two
    different publicly traded partnerships may increase the
    possibility of claims of breach of fiduciary duties, including
    claims brought due to conflicts of interest (including conflicts
    of interest that may arise (i) between the two
    publicly-traded partnerships as well as (ii) between a
    publicly-traded partnership, on the one hand, and its general
    partner and that general partner’s affiliates, including
    us, on the other hand). Any liability resulting from such claims
    could be material.

Potential
    changes in accounting standards might cause us to revise our
    financial results and disclosures in the future, which might
    change the way analysts measure our business or financial
    performance.

Regulators and legislators continue to take a renewed look at
    accounting practices, financial disclosures, companies’
    relationships with their independent registered public
    accounting firms, and retirement plan practices. We cannot
    predict the ultimate impact of any future changes in accounting
    regulations or practices in general with respect to public
    companies or the energy industry or in our operations
    specifically. In addition, the Financial Accounting Standards
    Board (FASB) or the SEC could enact new accounting standards
    that might impact how we are required to record revenues,
    expenses, assets, liabilities and equity.

Our
    risk measurement and hedging activities might not be effective
    and could increase the volatility of our results.

Although we have systems in place that use various methodologies
    to quantify commodity price risk associated with our businesses,
    these systems might not always be followed or might not always
    be effective. Further, such systems do not in themselves manage
    risk, particularly risks outside of our control, and adverse
    changes in energy commodity market prices, volatility, adverse
    correlation of commodity prices, the liquidity of markets,
    changes in interest rates and other risks discussed in this
    report might still adversely affect our earnings, cash flows and
    balance sheet under applicable accounting rules, even if risks
    have been identified.

In an effort to manage our financial exposure related to
    commodity price and market fluctuations, we have entered into
    contracts to hedge certain risks associated with our assets and
    operations. In these hedging activities, we have used
    fixed-price, forward, physical purchase and sales contracts,
    futures, financial swaps and option contracts traded in the
    over-the-counter markets or on exchanges. Nevertheless, no
    single hedging arrangement can adequately address all risks
    present in a given contract. For example, a forward contract
    that would be effective in hedging commodity price volatility
    risks would not hedge the contract’s counterparty credit or
    performance risk. Therefore, unhedged risks will always continue
    to exist. While we attempt to manage counterparty credit risk
    within



guidelines established by our credit policy, we may not be able
    to successfully manage all credit risk and as such, future cash
    flows and results of operations could be impacted by
    counterparty default.

Our use of hedging arrangements through which we attempt to
    reduce the economic risk of our participation in commodity
    markets could result in increased volatility of our reported
    results. Changes in the fair values (gains and losses) of
    derivatives that qualify as hedges under SFAS No. 133,
    “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
    Activities,” (SFAS 133) to the extent that such
    hedges are not fully effective in offsetting changes to the
    value of the hedged commodity, as well as changes in the fair
    value of derivatives that do not qualify or have not been
    designated as hedges under Statement of Financial Accounting
    Standards (SFAS) 133, must be recorded in our income. This
    creates the risk of volatility in earnings even if no economic
    impact to the Company has occurred during the applicable period.

The impact of changes in market prices for natural gas on the
    average gas prices received by us may be reduced based on the
    level of our hedging strategies. These hedging arrangements may
    limit our potential gains if the market prices for natural gas
    were to rise substantially over the price established by the
    hedge. In addition, our hedging arrangements expose us to the
    risk of financial loss in certain circumstances, including
    instances in which:

•

Production is less than expected;

•

The hedging instrument is not perfectly effective in mitigating
    the risk being hedged; and

•

The counterparties to our hedging arrangements fail to honor
    their financial commitments.

Our
    investments and projects located outside of the United States
    expose us to risks related to the laws of other countries, and
    the taxes, economic conditions, fluctuations in currency rates,
    political conditions and policies of foreign governments. These
    risks might delay or reduce our realization of value from our
    international projects.

We currently own and might acquire

and/or

dispose of material energy-related investments and projects
    outside the United States. The economic and political conditions
    in certain countries where we have interests or in which we
    might explore development, acquisition or investment
    opportunities present risks of delays in construction and
    interruption of business, as well as risks of war,
    expropriation, nationalization, renegotiation, trade sanctions
    or nullification of existing contracts and changes in law or tax
    policy, that are greater than in the United States. The
    uncertainty of the legal environment in certain foreign
    countries in which we develop or acquire projects or make
    investments could make it more difficult to obtain non-recourse
    project financing or other financing on suitable terms, could
    adversely affect the ability of certain customers to honor their
    obligations with respect to such projects or investments and
    could impair our ability to enforce our rights under agreements
    relating to such projects or investments. Recent events in
    certain South American countries, particularly the continued
    threat of nationalization of certain energy-related assets in
    Venezuela, could have a material negative impact on our results
    of operations. We may not receive adequate compensation, or any
    compensation, if our assets in Venezuela are nationalized.

Operations and investments in foreign countries also can present
    currency exchange rate and convertibility, inflation and
    repatriation risk. In certain situations under which we develop
    or acquire projects or make investments, economic and monetary
    conditions and other factors could affect our ability to convert
    to U.S. dollars our earnings denominated in foreign
    currencies. In addition, risk from fluctuations in currency
    exchange rates can arise when our foreign subsidiaries expend or
    borrow funds in one type of currency, but receive revenue in
    another. In such cases, an adverse change in exchange rates can
    reduce our ability to meet expenses, including debt service
    obligations. We may or may not put contracts in place designed
    to mitigate our foreign currency exchange risks. We have some
    exposures that are not hedged and which could result in losses
    or volatility in our results of operations.

Our
    operating results for certain segments of our business might
    fluctuate on a seasonal and quarterly basis.

Revenues from certain segments of our business can have seasonal
    characteristics. In many parts of the country, demand for
    natural gas and other fuels peaks during the winter. As a
    result, our overall operating results in the future might
    fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis. Demand for natural
    gas and other fuels could vary



significantly from our expectations depending on the nature and
    location of our facilities and pipeline systems and the terms of
    our natural gas transportation arrangements relative to demand
    created by unusual weather patterns. Additionally, changes in
    the price of natural gas could benefit one of our business
    units, but disadvantage another. For example, our
    Exploration & Production business may benefit from
    higher natural gas prices, and Midstream, which uses gas as a
    feedstock, may not.

Risks
    Related to Strategy and Financing

Our
    debt agreements impose restrictions on us that may adversely
    affect our ability to operate our business.

Certain of our debt agreements contain covenants that restrict
    or limit, among other things, our ability to create liens
    supporting indebtedness, sell assets, make certain
    distributions, and incur additional debt. In addition, our debt
    agreements contain, and those we enter into in the future may
    contain, financial covenants and other limitations with which we
    will need to comply. Our ability to comply with these covenants
    may be affected by many events beyond our control, and we cannot
    assure you that our future operating results will be sufficient
    to comply with the covenants or, in the event of a default under
    any of our debt agreements, to remedy that default.

Our failure to comply with the covenants in our debt agreements
    and other related transactional documents could result in events
    of default. Upon the occurrence of such an event of default, the
    lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under a
    particular facility to be immediately due and payable and
    terminate all commitments, if any, to extend further credit. An
    event of default or an acceleration under one debt agreement
    could cause a cross-default or cross-acceleration of another
    debt agreement. Such a cross-default or cross-acceleration could
    have a wider impact on our liquidity than might otherwise arise
    from a default or acceleration of a single debt instrument. If
    an event of default occurs, or if other debt agreements
    cross-default, and the lenders under the affected debt
    agreements accelerate the maturity of any loans or other debt
    outstanding to us, we may not have sufficient liquidity to repay
    amounts outstanding under such debt agreements.

Our ability to repay, extend or refinance our existing debt
    obligations and to obtain future credit will depend primarily on
    our operating performance, which will be affected by general
    economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory,
    business and other factors, many of which are beyond our
    control. Our ability to refinance existing debt obligations or
    obtain future credit will also depend upon the current
    conditions in the credit markets and the availability of credit
    generally. If we are unable to meet our debt service obligations
    or obtain future credit on favorable terms, if at all, we could
    be forced to restructure or refinance our indebtedness, seek
    additional equity capital or sell assets. We may be unable to
    obtain financing or sell assets on satisfactory terms, or at all.

Events
    in the global credit markets created a shortage in the
    availability of credit and have led to credit market
    volatility.

In 2008, global credit markets experienced a shortage in overall
    liquidity and a resulting disruption in the availability of
    credit. While we cannot predict the occurrence of future
    disruptions or the duration of the current volatility in the
    credit markets, we believe cash on hand and cash provided by
    operating activities, as well as availability under our existing
    financing agreements will provide us with adequate liquidity.
    However, our ability to borrow under our existing financing
    agreements, including our bank credit facilities, could be
    negatively impacted if one or more of our lenders fail to honor
    its contractual obligation to lend to us. Continuing volatility
    or additional disruptions, including the bankruptcy or
    restructuring of certain financial institutions, may adversely
    affect the availability of credit already arranged and the
    availability and cost of credit in the future.

The
    continuation of recent economic conditions, including
    disruptions in the global credit markets, could adversely affect
    our results of operations.

The slowdown in the economy and the significant disruptions and
    volatility in global credit markets have the potential to
    negatively impact our businesses in many ways. Included among
    these potential negative impacts are reduced demand and lower
    prices for our products and services, increased difficulty in
    collecting amounts owed to us by our customers and a reduction
    in our credit ratings (either due to tighter rating standards or
    the negative impacts described above), which could result in
    reducing our access to credit markets, raising the cost of such
    access or requiring us to provide additional collateral to our
    counterparties.



A
    downgrade of our current credit ratings could impact our
    liquidity, access to capital and our costs of doing business,
    and maintaining current credit ratings is within the control of
    independent third parties.

A downgrade of our credit rating might increase our cost of
    borrowing and would require us to post additional collateral
    with third parties, negatively impacting our available
    liquidity. Our ability to access capital markets would also be
    limited by a downgrade of our credit rating and other
    disruptions. Such disruptions could include:

•

Economic downturns;

•

Deteriorating capital market conditions;

•

Declining market prices for natural gas, natural gas liquids and
    other commodities;

•

Terrorist attacks or threatened attacks on our facilities or
    those of other energy companies; and

•

The overall health of the energy industry, including the
    bankruptcy or insolvency of other companies.

Credit rating agencies perform independent analysis when
    assigning credit ratings. The analysis includes a number of
    criteria including, but not limited to, business composition,
    market and operational risks, as well as various financial
    tests. Credit rating agencies continue to review the criteria
    for industry sectors and various debt ratings and may make
    changes to those criteria from time to time. Our corporate
    family credit rating and the credit ratings of Transco and
    Northwest Pipeline were raised to investment grade in 2007 by
    Standard & Poor’s, Moody’s Corporation, and
    Fitch Ratings, Ltd., and our senior unsecured debt ratings were
    raised to investment grade by Moody’s and Fitch. No
    assurance can be given that the credit rating agencies will
    continue to assign us investment grade ratings even if we meet
    or exceed their criteria for investment grade ratios or that our
    senior unsecured debt rating will be raised to investment grade
    by all of the credit rating agencies.

Prices
    for natural gas liquids, natural gas and other commodities are
    volatile and this volatility could adversely affect our
    financial results, cash flows, access to capital and ability to
    maintain existing businesses.

Our revenues, operating results, future rate of growth and the
    value of certain segments of our businesses depend primarily
    upon the prices we receive for NGLs, natural gas, or other
    commodities, and the differences between prices of these
    commodities. Price volatility can impact both the amount we
    receive for our products and services and the volume of products
    and services we sell. Prices affect the amount of cash flow
    available for capital expenditures and our ability to borrow
    money or raise additional capital.

The markets for NGLs, natural gas and other commodities are
    likely to continue to be volatile. Wide fluctuations in prices
    might result from relatively minor changes in the supply of and
    demand for these commodities, market uncertainty and other
    factors that are beyond our control, including:

•

Worldwide and domestic supplies of and demand for natural gas,
    NGLs, petroleum, and related commodities;

•

Turmoil in the Middle East and other producing regions;

•

The activities of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
    Countries;

•

Terrorist attacks on production or transportation assets;

•

Weather conditions;

•

The level of consumer demand;

•

The price and availability of other types of fuels;

•

The availability of pipeline capacity;

•

Supply disruptions, including plant outages and transportation
    disruptions;

•

The price and level of foreign imports;



•

Domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes;

•

Volatility in the natural gas markets;

•

The overall economic environment;

•

The credit of participants in the markets where products are
    bought and sold; and

•

The adoption of regulations or legislation relating to climate
    change.

We
    might not be able to successfully manage the risks associated
    with selling and marketing products in the wholesale energy
    markets.

Our portfolio of derivative and other energy contracts may
    consist of wholesale contracts to buy and sell commodities,
    including contracts for natural gas, NGLs and other commodities
    that are settled by the delivery of the commodity or cash
    throughout the United States. If the values of these contracts
    change in a direction or manner that we do not anticipate or
    cannot manage, it could negatively affect our results of
    operations. In the past, certain marketing and trading companies
    have experienced severe financial problems due to price
    volatility in the energy commodity markets. In certain instances
    this volatility has caused companies to be unable to deliver
    energy commodities that they had guaranteed under contract. If
    such a delivery failure were to occur in one of our contracts,
    we might incur additional losses to the extent of amounts, if
    any, already paid to, or received from, counterparties. In
    addition, in our businesses, we often extend credit to our
    counterparties. Despite performing credit analysis prior to
    extending credit, we are exposed to the risk that we might not
    be able to collect amounts owed to us. If the counterparty to
    such a transaction fails to perform and any collateral that
    secures our counterparty’s obligation is inadequate, we
    will suffer a loss. A general downturn in the economy and
    tightening of global credit markets could cause more of our
    counterparties to fail to perform than we have expected.

Risks
    Related to Regulations that Affect our Industry

Our
    natural gas sales, transmission, and storage operations are
    subject to government regulations and rate proceedings that
    could have an adverse impact on our results of
    operations.

Our interstate natural gas sales, transportation, and storage
    operations conducted through our Gas Pipelines business are
    subject to the FERC’s rules and regulations in accordance
    with the NGA and the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978. The
    FERC’s regulatory authority extends to:

•

Transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate
    commerce;

•

Rates, operating terms and conditions of service, including
    initiation and discontinuation of services;

•

Certification and construction of new facilities;

•

Acquisition, extension, disposition or abandonment of facilities;

•

Accounts and records;

•

Depreciation and amortization policies;

•

Relationships with marketing functions within Williams involved
    in certain aspects of the natural gas business; and

•

Market manipulation in connection with interstate sales,
    purchases or transportation of natural gas.

Regulatory actions in these areas can affect our business in
    many ways, including decreasing tariff rates and revenues,
    decreasing volumes in our pipelines, increasing our costs and
    otherwise altering the profitability of our business. Regulatory
    decisions could also affect our costs for compression,
    processing and dehydration of natural gas, which could have a
    negative effect on our results of operations.

The FERC has taken certain actions to strengthen market forces
    in the natural gas pipeline industry that have led to increased
    competition throughout the industry. In a number of key markets,
    interstate pipelines are now facing



competitive pressure from other major pipeline systems, enabling
    local distribution companies and end users to choose a
    transportation provider based on considerations other than
    location.

Costs
    of environmental liabilities and complying with existing and
    future environmental regulations, including those related to
    greenhouse gas emissions, could exceed our current
    expectations.

Our operations are subject to extensive environmental regulation
    pursuant to a variety of federal, provincial, state and
    municipal laws and regulations. Such laws and regulations
    impose, among other things, restrictions, liabilities and
    obligations in connection with the generation, handling, use,
    storage, extraction, transportation, treatment and disposal of
    hazardous substances and wastes, in connection with spills,
    releases and emissions of various substances into the
    environment, and in connection with the operation, maintenance,
    abandonment and reclamation of our facilities.

Compliance with environmental laws requires significant
    expenditures, including for clean up costs and damages arising
    out of contaminated properties. In addition, the possible
    failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations might
    result in the imposition of fines and penalties. We are
    generally responsible for all liabilities associated with the
    environmental condition of our facilities and assets, whether
    acquired or developed, regardless of when the liabilities arose
    and whether they are known or unknown. In connection with
    certain acquisitions and divestitures, we could acquire, or be
    required to provide indemnification against, environmental
    liabilities that could expose us to material losses, which may
    not be covered by insurance. In addition, the steps we could be
    required to take to bring certain facilities into compliance
    could be prohibitively expensive, and we might be required to
    shut down, divest or alter the operation of those facilities,
    which might cause us to incur losses. Although we do not expect
    that the costs of complying with current environmental laws will
    have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or
    results of operations, no assurance can be given that the costs
    of complying with environmental laws in the future will not have
    such an effect.

Legislative and regulatory responses related to climate change
    create financial risk. The United States Congress and certain
    states have for some time been considering various forms of
    legislation related to greenhouse gas emissions. Increased
    public awareness and concern may result in more state, regional

and/or

federal requirements to reduce or mitigate the emission of
    greenhouse gases. Numerous states have announced or adopted
    programs to stabilize and reduce greenhouse gases and similar
    federal legislation has been introduced in both houses of
    Congress. Our pipeline, exploration and production and gas
    processing facilities may be subject to regulation under climate
    change policies introduced at either the state or federal level
    within the next few years. There is a possibility that, when and
    if enacted, the final form of such legislation could increase
    our costs of compliance with environmental laws. If we are
    unable to recover or pass through all costs related to complying
    with climate change regulatory requirements imposed on us, it
    could have a material adverse effect on our results of
    operations. To the extent financial markets view climate change
    and emissions of greenhouse gases as a financial risk, this
    could negatively impact our cost of and access to capital.

We make assumptions and develop expectations about possible
    expenditures related to environmental conditions based on
    current laws and regulations and current interpretations of
    those laws and regulations. If the interpretation of laws or
    regulations, or the laws and regulations themselves, change, our
    assumptions may change. Our regulatory rate structure and our
    contracts with customers might not necessarily allow us to
    recover capital costs we incur to comply with the new
    environmental regulations. Also, we might not be able to obtain
    or maintain from time to time all required environmental
    regulatory approvals for certain development projects. If there
    is a delay in obtaining any required environmental regulatory
    approvals or if we fail to obtain and comply with them, the
    operation of our facilities could be prevented or become subject
    to additional costs, resulting in potentially material adverse
    consequences to our results of operations.

Competition
    in the markets in which we operate may adversely affect our
    results of operations.

We have numerous competitors in all aspects of our businesses,
    and additional competitors may enter our markets. Other
    companies with which we compete may be able to respond more
    quickly to new laws or regulations or emerging technologies, or
    to devote greater resources to the construction, expansion or
    refurbishment of their facilities than we can. In addition,
    current or potential competitors may make strategic acquisitions
    or have greater



financial resources than we do, which could affect our ability
    to make investments or acquisitions. There can be no assurance
    that we will be able to compete successfully against current and
    future competitors and any failure to do so could have a
    material adverse effect on our businesses and results of
    operations.

We may
    not be able to maintain or replace expiring natural gas
    transportation and storage contracts at favorable rates or on a
    long-term basis.

Our primary exposure to market risk for our Gas Pipelines occurs
    at the time the terms of their existing transportation and
    storage contracts expire and are subject to termination.
    Although none of our Gas Pipelines’ material contracts are
    terminable in 2009, upon expiration of the terms we may not be
    able to extend contracts with existing customers to obtain
    replacement contracts at favorable rates or on a long-term
    basis. The extension or replacement of existing contracts
    depends on a number of factors beyond our control, including:

•

The level of existing and new competition to deliver natural gas
    to our markets;

•

The growth in demand for natural gas in our markets;

•

Whether the market will continue to support long-term firm
    contracts;

•

Whether our business strategy continues to be successful;

•

The level of competition for natural gas supplies in the
    production basins serving us; and

•

The effects of state regulation on customer contracting
    practices.

Any failure to extend or replace a significant portion of our
    existing contracts may have a material adverse effect on our
    business, financial condition, results of operations and cash
    flows.

If
    third-party pipelines and other facilities interconnected to our
    pipeline and facilities become unavailable to transport natural
    gas, our revenues could be adversely affected.

We depend upon third-party pipelines and other facilities that
    provide delivery options to and from our natural gas pipeline
    and storage facilities. Because we do not own these third-party
    pipelines or facilities, their continuing operation is not
    within our control. If these pipelines or other facilities were
    to become unavailable due to repairs, damage to the facility,
    lack of capacity, increased credit requirements or rates charged
    by such pipelines or facilities or for any other reason, our
    ability to operate efficiently and continue shipping natural gas
    to end-use markets could be restricted, thereby reducing our
    revenues. Further, although there are laws and regulations
    designed to encourage competition in wholesale market
    transactions, some companies may fail to provide fair and equal
    access to their transportation systems or may not provide
    sufficient transportation capacity for other market
    participants. Any temporary or permanent interruption at any key
    pipeline interconnect causing a material reduction in volumes
    transported on our pipeline or stored at our facilities could
    have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
    condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Our
    businesses are subject to complex government regulations. The
    operation of our businesses might be adversely affected by
    changes in these regulations or in their interpretation or
    implementation, or the introduction of new laws or regulations
    applicable to our businesses or our customers.

Existing regulations might be revised or reinterpreted, new laws
    and regulations might be adopted or become applicable to us, our
    facilities or our customers, and future changes in laws and
    regulations might have a detrimental effect on our business.
    Specifically, the Colorado Oil & Gas Conservation
    Commission has enacted new rules effective in April 2009
    which will increase our costs of permitting and environmental
    compliance and may affect our ability to meet our anticipated
    drilling schedule and therefore may have a material effect on
    our results of operations.

Legal
    and regulatory proceedings and investigations relating to the
    energy industry and capital markets have adversely affected our
    business and may continue to do so.

Public and regulatory scrutiny of the energy industry and of the
    capital markets has resulted in increased regulation being
    either proposed or implemented. Such scrutiny has also resulted
    in various inquiries, investigations



and court proceedings in which we are a named defendant. Both
    the shippers on our pipelines and regulators have rights to
    challenge the rates we charge under certain circumstances. Any
    successful challenge could materially affect our results of
    operations.

Certain inquiries, investigations and court proceedings are
    ongoing and continue to adversely affect our business as a
    whole. We might see these adverse effects continue as a result
    of the uncertainty of these ongoing inquiries and proceedings,
    or additional inquiries and proceedings by federal or state
    regulatory agencies or private plaintiffs. In addition, we
    cannot predict the outcome of any of these inquiries or whether
    these inquiries will lead to additional legal proceedings
    against us, civil or criminal fines or penalties, or other
    regulatory action, including legislation, which might be
    materially adverse to the operation of our business and our
    revenues and net income or increase our operating costs in other
    ways. Current legal proceedings or other matters against us
    arising out of our ongoing and discontinued operations including
    environmental matters, disputes over gas measurement, royalty
    payments, shareholder class action suits, regulatory appeals and
    similar matters might result in adverse decisions against us.
    The result of such adverse decisions, either individually or in
    the aggregate, could be material and may not be covered fully or
    at all by insurance.

Risks
    Related to Employees, Outsourcing of Non-Core Support
    Activities, and Technology

Institutional
    knowledge residing with current employees nearing retirement
    eligibility might not be adequately preserved.

In certain segments of our business, institutional knowledge
    resides with employees who have many years of service. As these
    employees reach retirement age, we may not be able to replace
    them with employees of comparable knowledge and experience. In
    addition, we may not be able to retain or recruit other
    qualified individuals and our efforts at knowledge transfer
    could be inadequate. If knowledge transfer, recruiting and
    retention efforts are inadequate, access to significant amounts
    of internal historical knowledge and expertise could become
    unavailable to us.

Failure
    of or disruptions to our outsourcing relationships might
    negatively impact our ability to conduct our
    business.

Some studies indicate a high failure rate of outsourcing
    relationships. Although we have taken steps to build a
    cooperative and mutually beneficial relationship with our
    outsourcing providers and to closely monitor their performance,
    a deterioration in the timeliness or quality of the services
    performed by the outsourcing providers or a failure of all or
    part of these relationships could lead to loss of institutional
    knowledge and interruption of services necessary for us to be
    able to conduct our business. The expiration of such agreements
    or the transition of services between providers could lead to
    similar losses of institutional knowledge or disruptions.

Certain of our accounting, information technology, application
    development, and help desk services are currently provided by an
    outsourcing provider from service centers outside of the United
    States. The economic and political conditions in certain
    countries from which our outsourcing providers may provide
    services to us present similar risks of business operations
    located outside of the United States previously discussed,
    including risks of interruption of business, war, expropriation,
    nationalization, renegotiation, trade sanctions or nullification
    of existing contracts and changes in law or tax policy, that are
    greater than in the United States.

Risks
    Related to Weather, other Natural Phenomena and Business
    Disruption

Our
    assets and operations can be adversely affected by weather and
    other natural phenomena.

Our assets and operations, including those located offshore, can
    be adversely affected by hurricanes, floods, earthquakes,
    tornadoes and other natural phenomena and weather conditions
    including extreme temperatures, making it more difficult for us
    to realize the historic rates of return associated with these
    assets and operations. Insurance may be inadequate, and in some
    instances, we may be unable to obtain insurance on commercially
    reasonable terms, if at all. A significant disruption in
    operations or a significant liability for which we were not
    fully insured could have a material adverse effect on our
    business, results of operations and financial condition.



In addition, there is a growing belief that emissions of
    greenhouse gases may be linked to global climate change. Climate
    change creates physical and financial risk. Our customers’
    energy needs vary with weather conditions. To the extent weather
    conditions are affected by climate change or demand is impacted
    by regulations associated with climate change, customers’
    energy use could increase or decrease depending on the duration
    and magnitude of the changes, leading to either increased
    investment or decreased revenues.

Acts
    of terrorism could have a material adverse effect on our
    financial condition, results of operations and cash
    flows.

Our assets and the assets of our customers and others may be
    targets of terrorist activities that could disrupt our business
    or cause significant harm to our operations, such as full or
    partial disruption to our ability to produce, process, transport
    or distribute natural gas, natural gas liquids or other
    commodities. Acts of terrorism as well as events occurring in
    response to or in connection with acts of terrorism could cause
    environmental repercussions that could result in a significant
    decrease in revenues or significant reconstruction or
    remediation costs, which could have a material adverse effect on
    our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

    and Midstream segments, we generally own our facilities,
    although a substantial portion of our pipeline and gathering
    facilities is constructed and maintained pursuant to
    rights-of-way, easements, permits, licenses or consents on and
    across properties owned by others. In our
    Exploration & Production segment, the majority of our
    ownership interest in exploration and production properties is
    held as working interests in oil and gas leaseholds.

Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations

General

We are primarily a natural gas company, engaged in finding,
    producing, gathering, processing, and transporting natural gas.
    Our operations are located principally in the United States and
    are organized into the following reporting segments:
    Exploration & Production, Gas Pipeline, Midstream
    Gas & Liquids (Midstream), and Gas Marketing Services.
    (See Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
    and Part I Item 1 for further discussion of these
    segments.)

Unless indicated otherwise, the following discussion and
    analysis of critical accounting estimates, results of
    operations, and financial condition and liquidity relates to our
    current continuing operations and should be read in conjunction
    with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto
    included in Part II Item 8 of this document.

Overview
    of 2008

Our plan for 2008 was focused on continued disciplined growth.
    Objectives and highlights of this plan included:

Objectives

Highlights

Continuing to improve both
    EVA

®

and segment profit.

2008 segment profit of $2.9 billion, an increase of $749
    million from 2007, contributed to improving our
    EVA

®

.

Continuing to increase natural gas production and reserves.

We invested $2.5 billion in capital expenditures in Exploration
    & Production, increasing average daily domestic production
    by approximately 20 percent over last year while adding 602
    billion cubic feet equivalent in net reserves. Total year-end
    2008 proved domestic natural gas reserves are 4.3 trillion cubic
    feet equivalent, up 5 percent from year-end 2007 reserves.

Increasing the scale of our gathering and processing business in
    key growth basins.

We invested $608 million in capital expenditures in Midstream,
    primarily Deepwater Gulf expansion projects and gas-processing
    capacity in the western United States.

Continue to invest in expansion projects on our interstate
    natural gas pipelines.

We invested $306 million in capital expenditures in Gas Pipeline
    during 2008.

Our 2008

income from continuing operations

increased to
    $1.3 billion, as compared to $847 million in 2007. Our

net cash provided by operating activities

was almost
    $3.4 billion in 2008 compared to $2.2 billion in 2007.

While these annual measures are favorable compared to the prior
    year, the overall trend of results was significantly different
    when considering the first three quarters of the year versus the
    last quarter. Through September 30, 2008, our
    Exploration & Production business benefited from
    increased levels of production and higher net realized average
    natural gas prices, while our Midstream business realized higher
    margins from a favorable energy commodity price environment.
    However, energy commodity prices declined sharply during the
    last months of 2008, contributing to significantly lower fourth
    quarter operating results for these segments. The impact of the
    declining energy commodity prices on our consolidated results
    was partially mitigated by:

•

Strong earnings from Gas Pipeline, which benefited from new
    rates enacted during 2007, and the nature of its contracts;

•

Hedge positions at Exploration & Production related to
    a significant portion of its production;

•

Fee-based revenues from certain gathering and processing
    services at Midstream.



See additional discussion in Results of Operations.

Other
    Significant 2008 Events

We completed our stock repurchase program by reaching the
    $1 billion limit authorized by our Board of Directors. (See
    Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.)

Exploration & Production increased its positions by
    acquiring undeveloped leasehold acreage, producing properties
    and gathering facilities in the Piceance basin and undeveloped
    leasehold acreage and producing properties in the
    Fort Worth basin. See additional discussion in Results of
    Operations — Segments, Exploration &
    Production.

We recognized pre-tax income of $183 million in

income
    from discontinued operations

related to our former Alaska
    operations. (See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements.)

Exploration & Production recognized pre-tax income of
    $148 million related to the sale of a contractual right to
    a production payment on certain future international hydrocarbon
    production. See additional discussion in Results of
    Operations — Segments, Exploration & Production.

Williams Pipeline Partners L.P. completed its initial public
    offering. See additional discussion in Results of
    Operations — Segments, Gas Pipeline.

In September 2008, Hurricanes Gustav and Ike impacted our
    operations, primarily at Midstream. As a result, we estimate
    that our segment profit for 2008 was decreased by approximately
    $60 million to $85 million due to downtime and charges
    for repairs and property insurance deductibles. See additional
    discussion in Results of Operations — Segments, Gas
    Pipeline and Midstream Gas & Liquids.

The overall decline in equity markets in 2008 negatively
    impacted our employee benefit plan assets and will significantly
    increase our net periodic benefit expense in future periods.
    (See Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.)

Outlook
    for 2009

We expect the overall economic recession and related lower
    energy commodity price environment as well as the challenging
    financial markets to continue throughout the year. This is
    expected to result in sharply lower results of operations and
    cash flow from operations  compared to 2008 levels and could
    also result in a further reduction in capital expenditures. The
    impacts could include the future nonperformance of
    counterparties or impairments of goodwill and long-lived assets.
    Considering this environment, our plan for 2009 is built around
    the transition from significant growth to a focus on sustaining
    our current operations and reducing costs where appropriate.
    However, we believe we are well positioned to capture growth
    opportunities when commodity prices strengthen and as economic
    conditions improve. Although we expect a reduction in capital
    expenditures compared to the prior year, near-term investment in
    our businesses will remain significant and focused on completing
    major projects, meeting legal, regulatory,

and/or

contractual commitments, and maintaining a reduced level of
    natural gas production development.

We will continue to operate with a focus on
    EVA

®

and invest in our businesses in a way that meets customer needs
    and enhances our competitive position by:

•

Continuing to invest our gathering and processing and interstate
    natural gas pipeline systems, primarily through the completion
    of projects currently underway;

•

Continuing to invest in our natural gas production development,
    although at a lower level than in recent years;

•

Retaining the flexibility to adjust our planned levels of
    capital and investment expenditures in response to changes in
    economic conditions, as well as seizing attractive opportunities.

Potential risks

and/or

obstacles that could impact the execution of our plan include:

•

Lower than anticipated commodity prices;



•

Lower than expected levels of cash flow from operations;

•

Availability of capital;

•

Counterparty credit and performance risk;

•

Decreased drilling success at Exploration & Production;

•

Decreased drilling success or abandonment of projects by third
    parties served by Midstream and Gas Pipeline;

•

Additional general economic, financial markets, or industry
    downturn;

•

Changes in the political and regulatory environments;

•

Exposure associated with our efforts to resolve regulatory and
    litigation issues (see Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements).

We continue to address these risks through utilization of
    commodity hedging strategies, focused efforts to resolve
    regulatory issues and litigation claims, disciplined investment
    strategies, and maintaining at least $1 billion in
    liquidity from cash and cash equivalents and unused revolving
    credit facilities. In addition, we utilize master netting
    agreements and collateral requirements with our counterparties.

We have completed a review of potential changes to our company
    structure with a goal of enhancing shareholder value and
    determined to leave our company structure unchanged. Major
    factors in our decision were the sharp decline in energy
    commodity prices and a further deterioration in the
    macroeconomic environment since the initiation of the review in
    early November 2008. Our business mix and strong credit profile
    position us to weather the challenging economic and market
    conditions in 2009 and benefit as the economy recovers.

Modernization
    of Oil & Gas Reporting Requirements

The SEC has revised its oil and gas reserves reporting
    requirements effective for fiscal years ending on or after
    December 31, 2009, with early adoption prohibited. These
    changes include:

•

Expanding the definition of oil and gas reserves and providing
    clarification of certain concepts and technologies used in the
    reserve estimation process.

•

Allowing optional disclosure of probable and possible reserves
    and permitting optional disclosure of price sensitivity analysis.

•

Modifying prices used to estimate reserves for SEC disclosure
    purposes to a

12-month

average price instead of a

single-day,

period-end price.

•

Requiring certain additional disclosures around proved
    undeveloped reserves, internal controls used to ensure
    objectivity of the estimation process, and qualifications of
    those preparing

and/or

auditing the reserves.

Historically, the reserves calculated based on the SEC’s
    reporting requirements were also used to calculate depletion on
    our producing properties, as required by SFAS 69,
    “Disclosures about Oil and Gas Producing Activities”
    (SFAS 69). However, the change in the SEC reporting
    requirements has not yet been adopted by the FASB. The SEC has
    announced its intent to discuss potential amendments to
    SFAS 69 with the FASB so that the reserves disclosed remain
    consistent with the reserves used to calculate depletion on our
    producing properties. Any such change would impact our future
    financial results. The SEC has indicated that it may delay the
    effective date of the revised reporting requirements if the FASB
    does not make conforming amendments by December 31, 2009.



Critical
    Accounting Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
    generally accepted accounting principles requires management to
    make estimates and assumptions. We have discussed the following
    accounting estimates and assumptions as well as related
    disclosures with our Audit Committee. We believe that the nature
    of these estimates and assumptions is material due to the
    subjectivity and judgment necessary, or the susceptibility of
    such matters to change, and the impact of these on our financial
    condition or results of operations.

Impairments
    of Long-Lived Assets and Goodwill

We evaluate our long-lived assets for impairment when we believe
    events or changes in circumstances indicate that we may not be
    able to recover the carrying value. Our computations utilize
    judgments and assumptions that may include the estimated fair
    value of the asset, undiscounted future cash flows, discounted
    future cash flows, and the current and future economic
    environment in which the asset is operated.

Based on our assessment of the undiscounted and discounted cash
    flows on natural gas-producing properties and associated
    unproved leasehold costs in the Arkoma basin,
    Exploration & Production recorded an impairment charge
    of $129 million in December 2008. Significant judgments and
    assumptions in this impairment analysis included year-end
    natural gas reserves quantities, estimates of future natural gas
    prices using a forward NYMEX curve adjusted for locational basis
    differentials, drilling plans, capital costs, and a pre-tax
    discount rate of 15 percent. The recorded impairment was
    largely the result of lower forward pricing estimates at
    year-end and lower reserve estimates resulting from lower
    year-end prices.

In addition to those long-lived assets for which impairment
    charges were recorded (see Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements), certain others were reviewed for which no
    impairment was required. These reviews included
    Exploration & Production’s properties in other
    basins and utilized inputs consistent with those described above
    for the Arkoma basin. Certain assets within our Midstream
    segment were also evaluated for impairment utilizing judgments
    and assumptions including future fees, margins and volumes. The
    use of alternate judgments

and/or

assumptions could result in the recognition of different levels
    of impairment charges in the consolidated financial statements.

We have goodwill of approximately $1 billion at
    Exploration & Production primarily resulting from a
    2001 acquisition. We assess goodwill for impairment annually as
    of the end of the year. For purposes of our assessment, the
    reporting unit is Exploration & Production’s
    domestic operations. As of December 31, 2008, the estimated
    fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value,
    including goodwill, indicating no impairment of
    Exploration & Production’s goodwill.

We estimated the fair value of the reporting unit on a
    stand-alone basis primarily by valuing proved and unproved
    reserves. We used an income approach (discounted cash flows) for
    valuing reserves. The significant inputs into the valuation of
    proved reserves included reserve quantities, forward natural gas
    prices, anticipated drilling and operating costs, anticipated
    production curves and appropriate discount rates. Unproved
    reserves were valued using similar assumptions adjusted further
    for the uncertainty associated with these reserves.

In estimating the inputs, management must make assumptions that
    require judgments and are subject to change in response to
    changing market conditions and other future events. Significant
    assumptions in valuing proved reserves included reserve
    quantities of more than 4.3 Tcfe, natural gas prices,
    adjusted for locational differences, averaging approximately
    $5.80 per Mcfe and a pre-tax discount rate of 15 percent.

We further reviewed the estimated fair value of the stand-alone
    reporting unit by reconciling the sum of the fair values of all
    our businesses to our total market capitalization, including a
    control premium. In estimating the fair value of our businesses
    and a control premium, we considered a range of market
    comparables from historical sales transactions of energy
    companies. Market capitalization was based on our traded stock
    price for a reasonably short period of time before and after
    December 31, 2008. In evaluating these items in our
    reconciliation analysis, management considered a range of
    reasonable judgments. This reconciliation allowed management to
    consider market expectations in corroborating the reasonableness
    of the estimated stand-alone fair value of the
    Exploration & Production reporting unit.



We also perform interim assessments of goodwill if impairment
    triggering events or circumstances are present. Examples of
    impairment triggering events or circumstances include:

•

The testing for recoverability of a significant long-lived asset
    group within the reporting unit;

•

Recent operating losses or negative cash flows at the reporting
    unit level;

•

A decline in natural gas prices or reserve quantities;

•

Not meeting internal forecasts, or downward adjustments to
    future forecasts;

•

A decline in enterprise market capitalization below our
    consolidated stockholders’ equity;

•

Industry trends.

We cannot predict future market conditions and events that might
    adversely affect the estimated fair value of the
    Exploration & Production reporting unit and possibly
    the reported value of goodwill. The estimated fair value of the
    reporting unit is significantly affected by natural gas prices,
    reserve quantities and market expectations for required rates of
    return. Further declines in natural gas prices would lower our
    estimates of fair value. There are numerous uncertainties
    inherent in estimating quantities of reserves that could affect
    our reserve quantities. Low prices for natural gas, regulatory
    limitations, or the lack of available capital for projects could
    adversely affect the development and production of additional
    reserves. Given the significant challenges affecting our
    businesses and the energy industry in 2009, these factors could
    impact us and require us to assess goodwill for possible
    impairment more frequently during 2009.

Subsequent to December 31, 2008, as a result of overall
    market and energy commodity price declines, we have witnessed
    periodic reductions in our total market capitalization below our
    December 31, 2008, consolidated stockholders’ equity
    balance. If our total market capitalization is below our
    consolidated stockholders’ equity balance at a future
    reporting date, we consider this an indicator of potential
    impairment of goodwill under recent SEC communications and our
    accounting considerations. We utilize market capitalization in
    corroborating our assessment of the fair value of our
    Exploration & Production reporting unit. Considering
    this, it is reasonably possible that we may be required to
    conduct an interim goodwill impairment evaluation, which could
    result in a material impairment of our goodwill.

Accounting
    for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

We review our energy contracts to determine whether they are, or
    contain derivatives. We further assess the appropriate
    accounting method for any derivatives identified, which could
    include:

•

Qualifying for and electing cash flow hedge accounting, which
    recognizes changes in the fair value of the derivative in other
    comprehensive income (to the extent the hedge is effective)
    until the hedged item is recognized in earnings;

•

Qualifying for and electing accrual accounting under the normal
    purchases and normal sales exception, or;

•

Applying mark-to-market accounting, which recognizes changes in
    the fair value of the derivative in earnings.

If cash flow hedge accounting or accrual accounting is not
    applied, a derivative is subject to mark-to-market accounting.
    Determination of the accounting method involves significant
    judgments and assumptions, which are further described below.

The determination of whether a derivative contract qualifies as
    a cash flow hedge includes an analysis of historical market
    price information to assess whether the derivative is expected
    to be highly effective in offsetting the cash flows attributed
    to the hedged risk. We also assess whether the hedged forecasted
    transaction is probable of occurring. This assessment requires
    us to exercise judgment and consider a wide variety of factors
    in addition to our intent, including internal and external
    forecasts, historical experience, changing market and business
    conditions, our financial and operational ability to carry out
    the forecasted transaction, the length of time until the
    forecasted transaction is projected to occur, and the quantity
    of the forecasted transaction. In addition, we compare actual
    cash flows to those that were expected from the underlying risk.
    If a hedged forecasted transaction is not probable of occurring,
    or if the derivative contract is not expected to be highly
    effective, the derivative does not qualify for hedge accounting.



For derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, we must
    periodically assess whether they continue to qualify for hedge
    accounting. We prospectively discontinue hedge accounting and
    recognize future changes in fair value directly in earnings if
    we no longer expect the hedge to be highly effective, or if we
    believe that the hedged forecasted transaction is no longer
    probable of occurring. If the forecasted transaction becomes
    probable of not occurring, we reclassify amounts previously
    recorded in other comprehensive income into earnings in addition
    to prospectively discontinuing hedge accounting. If the
    effectiveness of the derivative improves and is again expected
    to be highly effective in offsetting the cash flows attributed
    to the hedged risk, or if the forecasted transaction again
    becomes probable, we may prospectively re-designate the
    derivative as a hedge of the underlying risk.

Derivatives for which the normal purchases and normal sales
    exception has been elected are accounted for on an accrual
    basis. In determining whether a derivative is eligible for this
    exception, we assess whether the contract provides for the
    purchase or sale of a commodity that will be physically
    delivered in quantities expected to be used or sold over a
    reasonable period in the normal course of business. In making
    this assessment, we consider numerous factors, including the
    quantities provided under the contract in relation to our
    business needs, delivery locations per the contract in relation
    to our operating locations, duration of time between entering
    the contract and delivery, past trends and expected future
    demand, and our past practices and customs with regard to such
    contracts. Additionally, we assess whether it is probable that
    the contract will result in physical delivery of the commodity
    and not net financial settlement.

Since our energy derivative contracts could be accounted for in
    three different ways, two of which are elective, our accounting
    method could be different from that used by another party for a
    similar transaction. Furthermore, the accounting method may
    influence the level of volatility in the financial statements
    associated with changes in the fair value of derivatives, as
    generally depicted below:

    Consolidated Financial Statements.

Oil-
    and Gas-Producing Activities

We use the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil-
    and gas-producing activities. Estimated natural gas and oil
    reserves and forward market prices for oil and gas are a
    significant part of our financial calculations. Following are
    examples of how these estimates affect financial results:

•

An increase (decrease) in estimated proved oil and gas reserves
    can reduce (increase) our unit-of-production depreciation,
    depletion and amortization rates.

•

Changes in oil and gas reserves and forward market prices both
    impact projected future cash flows from our oil and gas
    properties. This, in turn, can impact our periodic impairment
    analyses, including that for goodwill.

The process of estimating natural gas and oil reserves is very
    complex, requiring significant judgment in the evaluation of all
    available geological, geophysical, engineering, and economic
    data. After being estimated internally, 99 percent of our
    reserve estimates are either audited or prepared by independent
    experts. (See Part I Item 1 for further discussion.)
    The data may change substantially over time as a result of
    numerous factors, including additional development cost and
    activity, evolving production history, and a continual
    reassessment of the viability of production under changing
    economic conditions. As a result, material revisions to existing
    reserve estimates could occur from time to time. Such changes
    could trigger an impairment of our oil- and gas-producing
    properties

and/or

goodwill and have an impact on our depletion expense
    prospectively. For example, a change of approximately
    10 percent in our total oil and gas reserves could change
    our annual

depreciation, depletion and



amortization

expense between approximately
    $46 million and $56 million. The actual impact would
    depend on the specific basins impacted and whether the change
    resulted from proved developed, proved undeveloped or a
    combination of these reserve categories.

Forward market prices, which are utilized in our impairment
    analyses, include estimates of prices for periods that extend
    beyond those with quoted market prices. This forward market
    price information is consistent with that generally used in
    evaluating our drilling decisions and acquisition plans. These
    market prices for future periods impact the production economics
    underlying oil and gas reserve estimates. The prices of natural
    gas and oil are volatile and change from period to period, thus
    impacting our estimates. Significant unfavorable changes in the
    forward price curve could result in an impairment of our oil and
    gas properties

and/or

goodwill.

Contingent
    Liabilities

We record liabilities for estimated loss contingencies,
    including environmental matters, when we assess that a loss is
    probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.
    Revisions to contingent liabilities are generally reflected in
    income when new or different facts or information become known
    or circumstances change that affect the previous assumptions
    with respect to the likelihood or amount of loss. Liabilities
    for contingent losses are based upon our assumptions and
    estimates and upon advice of legal counsel, engineers, or other
    third parties regarding the probable outcomes of the matter. As
    new developments occur or more information becomes available,
    our assumptions and estimates of these liabilities may change.
    Changes in our assumptions and estimates or outcomes different
    from our current assumptions and estimates could materially
    affect future results of operations for any particular quarterly
    or annual period. See Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements.

Valuation
    of Deferred Tax Assets and Tax Contingencies

We have deferred tax assets resulting from certain investments
    and businesses that have a tax basis in excess of the book basis
    and from tax carry-forwards generated in the current and prior
    years. We must evaluate whether we will ultimately realize these
    tax benefits and establish a valuation allowance for those that
    may not be realizable. This evaluation considers tax planning
    strategies, including assumptions about the availability and
    character of future taxable income. At December 31, 2008,
    we have $639 million of deferred tax assets for which a
    $15 million valuation allowance has been established. When
    assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider
    forecasts of future company performance, the estimated impact of
    potential asset dispositions and our ability and intent to
    execute tax planning strategies to utilize tax carryovers. The
    ultimate amount of deferred tax assets realized could be
    materially different from those recorded, as influenced by
    potential changes in jurisdictional income tax laws and the
    circumstances surrounding the actual realization of related tax
    assets.

We regularly face challenges from domestic and foreign tax
    authorities regarding the amount of taxes due. These challenges
    include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions
    and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. We
    evaluate the liability associated with our various filing
    positions by applying the two step process of recognition and
    measurement as required by FASB Interpretation No. 48,
    “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an
    interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109”
    (FIN 48). The ultimate disposition of these contingencies
    could have a significant impact on operating results and net
    cash flows. To the extent we were to prevail in matters for
    which accruals have been established or were required to pay
    amounts in excess of our accrued liability, our effective tax
    rate in a given financial statement period may be materially
    impacted.

See Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
    for additional information regarding FIN 48.

Pension
    and Postretirement Obligations

We have employee benefit plans that include pension and other
    postretirement benefits. Net periodic benefit expense and
    obligations are impacted by various estimates and assumptions.
    These estimates and assumptions include the expected long-term
    rates of return on plan assets, discount rates, expected rate of
    compensation increase, health care cost trend rates, and
    employee demographics, including retirement age and mortality.
    These assumptions are reviewed annually and adjustments are made
    as needed. The assumptions utilized to compute expense and the
    benefit obligations are shown in Note 7 of Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements. The following table



presents the estimated increase (decrease) in net periodic
    benefit expense and obligations resulting from a
    one-percentage-point change in the specified assumption.

The expected long-term rates of return on plan assets are
    determined by combining a review of historical returns realized
    within the portfolio, the investment strategy included in the
    plans’ Investment Policy Statement, and capital market
    projections for the asset classifications in which the portfolio
    is invested as well as the weightings of each asset
    classification. The credit crisis and subsequent economic
    downturn have negatively impacted the markets and our 2008
    investment returns largely mirror market performance. While the
    market downturn has impacted short-term investment performance,
    these expected rates of return are long-term in nature and are
    not significantly impacted by short-term market swings. Changes
    to our asset allocation would also impact these expected rates
    of return. Our expected long-term rate of return on plan assets
    used for our pension plans was 7.75 percent for 2006
    through 2008 and 8.5 percent for 2003 through 2005. Over
    the past ten years, our actual average return on plan assets for
    our pension plans has been approximately 2.1 percent. The
    2008 return on plan assets for our pension plans was a loss of
    approximately 34.1 percent, which significantly impacted
    the ten-year average rate of return on plan assets. The 2007
    ten-year average rate of return on plan assets for the pension
    plans was approximately 7.7 percent. As described in
    Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, the
    asset allocation is being changed during 2009 with a slightly
    higher percentage of plan assets being allocated to debt
    securities and cash and cash equivalents. Therefore, our 2009
    expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption is
    expected to slightly decrease.

The discount rates are used to measure the benefit obligations
    of our pension and other postretirement benefit plans. The
    objective of the discount rates is to determine the amount, if
    invested at the December 31 measurement date in a portfolio of
    high-quality debt securities, that will provide the necessary
    cash flows when benefit payments are due. Increases in the
    discount rates decrease the obligation and, generally, decrease
    the related expense. The discount rates for our pension and
    other postretirement benefit plans are determined separately
    based on an approach specific to our plans and their respective
    expected benefit cash flows as described in Note 7 of Notes
    to Consolidated Financial Statements. Our discount rate
    assumptions are impacted by changes in general economic and
    market conditions that affect interest rates on long-term
    high-quality debt securities as well as by the duration of our
    plans’ liabilities.

The expected rate of compensation increase represents average
    long-term salary increases. An increase in this rate causes the
    pension obligation and expense to increase.

The assumed health care cost trend rates are based on our actual
    historical cost rates that are adjusted for expected changes in
    the health care industry. An increase in this rate causes the
    other postretirement benefit obligation and expense to increase.

Fair
    Value Measurements

On January 1, 2008, we adopted SFAS No. 157,
    “Fair Value Measurements” (SFAS No. 157),
    for our assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value
    on a recurring basis, primarily our energy derivatives. See
    Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for
    disclosures regarding SFAS No. 157, including
    discussion of the fair value hierarchy levels and valuation
    methodologies.



Certain of our energy derivative assets and liabilities and
    other assets trade in markets with lower availability of pricing
    information requiring us to use unobservable inputs and are
    considered Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. At
    December 31, 2008, 22 percent of the total assets
    measured at fair value and 2 percent of the total
    liabilities measured at fair value are included in Level 3.
    For Level 2 transactions, we do not make significant
    adjustments to observable prices in measuring fair value as we
    do not generally trade in inactive markets.

The determination of fair value also incorporates the time value
    of money and credit risk factors including the credit standing
    of the counterparties involved, the existence of master netting
    arrangements, the impact of credit enhancements (such as cash
    deposits and letters of credit) and our nonperformance risk on
    our liabilities. Currently, our approach is to apply a credit
    spread, based on the credit rating of the counterparty, against
    the net derivative asset with that counterparty. For net
    derivative liabilities we apply our own credit rating. We derive
    the credit spreads by using the corporate industrial credit
    curves for each rating category and building a curve based on
    certain points through time for each rating category. The spread
    comes from the discount factor of the individual corporate
    curves versus the discount factor of the LIBOR curve. At
    December 31, 2008, the credit reserve is $6 million on
    our net derivative assets and $15 million on our net
    derivative liabilities. Considering these factors and that we do
    not have significant risk from our net credit exposure to
    derivative counterparties, the impact of credit risk is not
    significant to the overall fair value of our derivatives
    portfolio.

As of December 31, 2008, 77 percent of our derivatives
    portfolio expires in the next 12 months and 99 percent
    of our derivatives portfolio expires in the next 36 months.
    Our derivatives portfolio is largely comprised of

exchange-traded

products or like products where price transparency has not
    historically been a concern. Due to the nature of the markets in
    which we transact and the short tenure of our derivatives
    portfolio, we do not believe it is necessary to make an
    adjustment for illiquidity. We regularly analyze the liquidity
    of the markets based on the prevalence of broker pricing and
    exchange pricing for products in our derivatives portfolio.

The instruments included in Level 3 at December 31,
    2008, predominantly consist of options that hedge future sales
    of production from our Exploration & Production
    segment, are structured as costless collars and are financially
    settled. The options are valued using an industry standard
    Black-Scholes option pricing model. Certain inputs into the
    model are generally observable, such as commodity prices and
    interest rates, whereas a significant input, implied volatility
    by location, is unobservable. The impact of volatility on
    changes in the overall fair value of the options structured as
    collars is mitigated by the offsetting nature of the put and
    call positions. The change in the overall fair value of
    instruments included in Level 3 primarily results from
    changes in commodity prices. The hedges are accounted for as
    cash flow hedges where net unrealized gains and losses from
    changes in fair value are recorded, to the extent effective, in

other comprehensive income (loss)

and subsequently impact
    earnings when the underlying hedged production is sold.

Exploration & Production has an unsecured credit
    agreement through December 2013 with certain banks that, so long
    as certain conditions are met, serves to reduce our usage of
    cash and other credit facilities for margin requirements related

2008 vs.

Our consolidated results in 2008 have improved significantly
    compared to 2007. However, these results were considerably
    influenced by favorable results in the first three quarters of
    the year, followed by a sharp decline in the fourth quarter due
    to a rapid decline in energy commodity prices.

The increase in

revenues

is primarily due to higher
    production revenues at Exploration & Production
    resulting from both higher net realized average prices and
    increased production volumes sold. Midstream also experienced
    higher olefin production revenues primarily due to higher
    average prices and volumes as well as increased natural gas
    liquid (NGL) production revenues resulting from higher average
    prices, partially offset by lower volumes. Additionally, Gas
    Marketing Services revenues increased primarily due to favorable
    price movements on derivative positions economically hedging the
    anticipated withdrawals of natural gas from storage and the
    absence of a loss recognized on a legacy derivative sales
    contract in 2007.



The increase in

costs and operating expenses

is primarily
    due to increased costs associated with our olefin and NGL
    production businesses at Midstream. Higher depreciation,
    depletion, and amortization and higher operating taxes at
    Exploration & Production also contributed to the
    increase in expenses.

The increase in

selling, general and administrative expenses

(

SG&A)

primarily includes the impact of higher
    staffing and compensation at our Exploration &
    Production and Midstream segments in support of increased
    operational activities.

Other (income) expense

—

net

within

operating income

in 2008 includes:

•

Gain of $148 million on the sale of a contractual right to
    a production payment on certain future international hydrocarbon
    production at Exploration & Production;

•

Net gains of $49 million on foreign currency exchanges at
    Midstream;

•

Income of $32 million related to the partial settlement of
    our Gulf Liquids litigation at Midstream;

•

Gain of $10 million on the sale of certain south Texas
    assets at Gas Pipeline;

•

Income of $17 million resulting from involuntary conversion
    gains at Midstream;

•

Impairment charges totaling $143 million related to certain
    natural gas producing properties at Exploration &
    Production;

•

Expense of $23 million related to project development costs
    at Gas Pipeline.

Other (income) expense

—

net

within

operating income

in 2007 includes:

•

Income of $18 million associated with payments received for
    a terminated firm transportation agreement on Northwest
    Pipeline’s Grays Harbor lateral;

•

Income of $17 million associated with a change in estimate
    related to a regulatory liability at Northwest Pipeline;

•

Income of $12 million related to a favorable litigation
    outcome at Midstream;

•

Income of $8 million due to the reversal of a planned major
    maintenance accrual at Midstream;

•

Expense of $20 million related to an accrual for litigation
    contingencies at Gas Marketing Services;

•

Expense of $10 million related to an impairment of the
    Carbonate Trend pipeline at Midstream.

The increase in

operating income

reflects improved
    operating results at Exploration & Production due to
    higher net realized average prices, natural gas production
    growth and a gain of $148 million on the sale of a
    contractual right to a production payment, partially offset by
    increased operating costs and $143 million of property
    impairments in 2008. The increase also reflects improved results
    at Gas Marketing Services primarily due to favorable price
    movements on derivative positions economically hedging the
    anticipated withdrawals of natural gas from storage and the
    absence of a loss recognized on a legacy derivative sales
    contract in 2007. Partially offsetting these increases is a
    decrease in

operating income

at Midstream primarily due
    to a sharp decline in energy commodity prices in the latter part
    of 2008.

Interest accrued

—

net

decreased
    primarily due to increased capitalized interest resulting from
    an increased level of capital expenditures. The decrease was
    also a result of lower interest rates on debt issuances that
    occurred late in the fourth quarter of 2007 and in the first
    half of 2008 for which the proceeds were primarily used to
    retire existing debt bearing higher interest rates. While our
    overall debt balances have been relatively comparable, the net
    effect of these retirements and issuances has resulted in lower
    rates.

The decrease in

investing income

is primarily due to a
    decrease in interest income largely resulting from lower average
    interest rates in 2008 compared to 2007.

Minority interest in income of consolidated subsidiaries

increased primarily reflecting the growth in the minority
    interest holdings of Williams Partners L.P. and Williams
    Pipeline Partners L.P. in late 2007 and early 2008, respectively.



Provision for income taxes

increased primarily due to
    higher pre-tax income partially offset by a reduction in our
    estimate of the effective deferred state tax rate. See
    Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a
    reconciliation of the effective tax rate compared to the federal
    statutory rate for both periods.

See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
    for a discussion of the items in

income (loss) from
    discontinued operations.

2007 vs.

The increase in

revenues

is due primarily to higher
    Midstream revenues associated with increased NGL and olefins
    marketing revenues and increased production of olefins and NGLs.
    Exploration & Production experienced higher revenues
    also due to increases in production volumes and net realized
    average prices. Additionally, Gas Pipeline revenues increased
    primarily due to increased rates in effect since the first
    quarter of 2007. These increases are partially offset by a
    mark-to-market loss recognized at Gas Marketing Services on a
    legacy derivative natural gas sales contract that we expect to
    assign to another party in 2008 under an asset transfer
    agreement that we executed in December 2007.

The increase in

costs and operating expenses

is due
    primarily to increased NGL and olefins marketing purchases and
    increased costs associated with our olefins production business
    at Midstream. Additionally, Exploration & Production
    experienced higher depreciation, depletion and amortization and
    lease operating expenses due primarily to higher production
    volumes.

The increase in

SG&A

is primarily due to increased
    staffing in support of increased drilling and operational
    activity at Exploration & Production, the absence of a
    $25 million gain in 2006 related to the sale of certain
    receivables at Gas Marketing Services, and a $9 million
    charge related to certain international receivables at Midstream.

Other (income) expense

—

net

within

operating income

in 2006 includes:

•

A $73 million accrual for a Gulf Liquids litigation
    contingency;

•

Income of $9 million due to a settlement of an
    international contract dispute at Midstream.

The increase in

general corporate expenses

is
    attributable to various factors, including higher
    employee-related costs, increased levels of charitable
    contributions and information technology expenses. The higher
    employee-related costs are primarily the result of higher stock
    compensation expense. (See Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements.)

The

securities litigation settlement and related costs

is
    primarily the result of our 2006 settlement related to

class-action

securities litigation filed on behalf of purchasers of our
    securities between July 24, 2000 and July 22, 2002.
    (See Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.)

The increase in

operating income

reflects record high NGL
    margins at Midstream, continued strong natural gas production
    growth at Exploration & Production, the positive
    effect of new rates at Gas Pipeline, and the absence of 2006
    litigation expenses associated with shareholder lawsuits and
    Gulf Liquids litigation.

Interest accrued — net

includes a decrease of
    $19 million in interest expense associated with our Gulf
    Liquids litigation contingency, offset by changes in our debt
    portfolio, most significantly the issuance of new debt in
    December 2006 by Williams Partners L.P.

The increase in

investing income

is due to:

•

A $27 million increase in interest income primarily
    associated with larger cash and cash equivalent balances
    combined with slightly higher rates of return in 2007 compared
    to 2006;

•

Increased equity earnings of $38 million due largely to
    increased earnings of our Gulfstream Natural Gas System, L.L.C.
    (Gulfstream), Discovery Producer Services LLC (Discovery) and
    Aux Sable Liquid Products, L.P. (Aux Sable) investments;



•

The absence of a $16 million impairment in 2006 of a
    Venezuelan cost-based investment at Exploration &
    Production;

•

$14 million of gains from sales of cost-based investments
    in 2007.

These increases are partially offset by the absence of a
    $7 million gain on the sale of an international investment
    in 2006.

Early debt retirement costs

in 2007 includes
    $19 million of premiums and fees related to the December
    2007 repurchase of senior unsecured notes.

Early debt
    retirement costs

in 2006 includes $27 million in
    premiums and fees related to the January 2006 debt conversion
    and $4 million of accelerated amortization of debt expenses
    related to the retirement of the debt secured by assets of
    Williams Production RMT Company.

Minority interest in income of consolidated subsidiaries

increased primarily due to the growth in the minority
    interest holdings of Williams Partners L.P.

Provision for income taxes

was significantly higher in
    2007 due primarily to higher pre-tax earnings. See Note 5
    of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a
    reconciliation of the effective tax rate compared to the federal
    statutory rate for both periods.

See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
    for a discussion of the items in

income (loss) from
    discontinued operations.

Results
    of Operations — Segments

We are currently organized into the following segments:
    Exploration & Production, Gas Pipeline, Midstream, Gas
    Marketing Services, and Other. Other primarily consists of
    corporate operations. Our management currently evaluates
    performance based on segment profit (loss) from operations. (See
    Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.)

Exploration &
    Production

Overview
    of 2008

In 2008, segment revenues and segment profit for
    Exploration & Production improved significantly
    compared to 2007. The 2008 results benefited from higher
    production levels coupled with higher natural gas prices through
    the first three quarters of the year. However, the results were
    negatively impacted by a significant decline in natural gas
    prices in the fourth quarter. The potential impact of sustained
    lower natural gas prices is discussed further in the following

Outlook for 2009

section.

We’ve remained focused on continuing our domestic
    development drilling program in our growth basins. Accordingly,
    we:

•

Benefited from increased domestic net realized average prices
    for the total year of 2008, which increased by approximately
    28 percent compared to 2007. The domestic net realized
    average price for 2008 was $6.48 per thousand cubic feet of gas
    equivalent (Mcfe) compared to $5.08 per Mcfe in 2007. Net
    realized average prices include market prices, net of fuel and
    shrink and hedge positions, less gathering and transportation
    expenses. The domestic net realized average price for the fourth
    quarter 2008 was $4.43 per Mcfe reflecting the significant
    decline in natural gas prices.

•

Increased average daily domestic production levels by
    approximately 20 percent compared to 2007. The average
    daily domestic production for 2008 was approximately
    1,094 million cubic feet of gas equivalent (MMcfe) compared
    to 913 MMcfe in 2007. The increased production is primarily
    due to increased development within the Piceance, Powder River,
    and Fort Worth basins.

•

Drilled 1,783 gross domestic development wells in 2008 with
    a success rate of approximately 99 percent. This
    contributed to total net additions of 602 billion cubic
    feet equivalent (Bcfe) in net reserves — a replacement
    rate for our domestic production of 148 percent. Capital
    expenditures for domestic drilling, development, and acquisition
    activity in 2008 were approximately $2.5 billion compared
    to $1.7 billion in



2007. Capital expenditures for 2008 include acquisitions in the
    Piceance and Fort Worth basins discussed in

Significant
    events

below.

The benefits of higher net realized average prices and higher
    production volumes were partially offset by increased operating
    costs. The increase in operating costs was primarily due to the
    impact of increased production volumes and prices on operating
    taxes and higher well service and lease service costs. In
    addition, higher production volumes coupled with higher
    capitalized drilling costs increased depreciation, depletion,
    and amortization expense.

Significant
    events

In January 2008, we sold a contractual right to a production
    payment on certain future international hydrocarbon production
    for $148 million. As a result of the contract termination,
    we have no further interests associated with the crude oil
    concession, which is located in Peru. We had obtained these
    interests through our acquisition of Barrett Resources
    Corporation in 2001.

In May 2008, we acquired certain undeveloped leasehold acreage,
    producing properties and gathering facilities in the Piceance
    basin for $285 million. A third party subsequently
    exercised its contractual option to purchase, on the same terms
    and conditions, an interest in a portion of the acquired assets
    for $71 million.

In September 2008, we increased our position in the
    Fort Worth basin by acquiring certain undeveloped leasehold
    acreage and producing properties for $147 million. This
    acquisition is consistent with our growth strategy of leveraging
    our horizontal drilling expertise by acquiring and developing
    low-risk properties.

Based on our assessment of undiscounted and discounted future
    cash flows, which considered year-end natural gas reserve
    quantities, we recorded an impairment of $129 million in
    December 2008 related to our properties in the Arkoma basin. In
    September 2008, we recorded a $14 million impairment due to
    unfavorable drilling results, also in the Arkoma basin.

In December 2008, the Wyoming Supreme Court ruled against us on
    our appeal of the Wyoming State Board of Equalization’s
    decision to uphold an assessment by the Wyoming Department of
    Audit related to severance and ad valorem taxes for the years
    2000 through 2002. Related to this decision, we adjusted our
    estimated liability for the periods from 2000 through 2008,
    which resulted in a charge of $34 million. (See Note 4
    of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.)

Outlook
    for 2009

Considering the previously discussed significant decline in
    natural gas prices, we expect segment revenues and segment
    profit in 2009 to be significantly lower than in 2008. As a
    result, we plan to reduce capital expenditures and deploy fewer
    drilling rigs in 2009 compared to 2008 which will reduce the
    number of wells drilled. We have the following expectations and
    objectives for 2009:

•

Continuing our development drilling program in the Piceance,
    Fort Worth, Powder River and San Juan basins through
    our planned capital expenditures projected between
    $950 million and $1.05 billion.

•

Slight growth in our annual average daily domestic production
    level compared to 2008, with fourth quarter 2009 volumes likely
    to be less than the prior comparable period.

•

Declines in the costs of services and materials associated with
    development activities as demand for these resources decline.
    However, in the first quarter of 2009, we estimate we will incur
    between $25 million and $35 million in expense from
    contract penalties associated with the reduction in drilling
    rigs deployed.

Risks to achieving our expectations include unfavorable natural
    gas market price movements which are impacted by numerous
    factors, including weather conditions, domestic natural gas
    production levels and demand, and the downturn in the global
    economy. A further significant decline in natural gas prices
    would impact these expectations for 2009.

In addition, changes in laws and regulations may impact our
    development drilling program. For example, the Colorado
    Oil & Gas Conservation Commission has enacted new
    rules effective in April 2009 which will increase our costs of
    permitting and environmental compliance and potentially delay
    drilling permits. The new rules include



additional environmental and operational requirements before
    permit approvals are granted, tracking of certain chemicals
    brought on location, increased wildlife stipulations, new pit
    and waste management procedures and increased notifications and
    approvals from surface landowners.

Commodity
    Price Risk Strategy

To manage the commodity price risk and volatility of owning
    producing gas properties, we enter into derivative forward sales
    contracts that fix the sales price relating to a portion of our
    future production using NYMEX and basis fixed-price contracts
    and collar agreements.

For 2009, we have the following agreements and contracts for our
    daily domestic production, shown at weighted average volumes and
    basin-level weighted average prices:

    into service in 2009.

2008 vs.

The increase in total

segment revenues

is primarily due
    to the following:

•

$919 million, or 53 percent, increase in domestic
    production revenues reflecting $571 million associated with
    a 28 percent increase in net realized average prices and
    $348 million associated with a 20 percent increase in
    production volumes sold. The impact of hedge positions on
    increased net realized average prices includes the effect of
    fewer volumes hedged by fixed-price contracts. The increase in
    production volumes reflects an increase in the number of
    producing wells primarily from the Piceance, Powder River,



and Fort Worth basins. Production revenues in 2008 and 2007
    include approximately $85 million and $53 million,
    respectively, related to natural gas liquids and approximately
    $62 million and $40 million, respectively, related to
    condensate.

•

$151 million increase in revenues for gas management
    activities related to gas sold on behalf of certain outside
    parties, which is substantially offset by a similar increase in

segment costs and expenses

. This increase is primarily
    due to increases in natural gas prices and volumes sold.

•

$17 million favorable change related to hedge
    ineffectiveness due to $1 million in net unrealized gains
    from hedge ineffectiveness in 2008 compared to $16 million
    in net unrealized losses in 2007.

Total

segment costs and expenses

increased
    $591 million, primarily due to the following:

•

$202 million higher depreciation, depletion and
    amortization expense primarily due to higher production volumes
    and increased capitalized drilling costs.

•

$149 million increase in expenses for gas management
    activities related to gas purchased on behalf of certain outside
    parties, which is offset by a similar increase in

segment
    revenues

.

•

$143 million of property impairments in 2008 in the Arkoma
    basin as previously discussed.

•

$118 million higher operating taxes primarily due to both
    higher average market prices and higher domestic production
    volumes sold and the $34 million charge related to the
    Wyoming severance and ad valorem tax issue previously discussed.

•

$61 million higher lease operating expenses from the
    increased number of producing wells primarily within the
    Piceance, Powder River, and Fort Worth basins combined with
    increased prices for well and lease service expenses and higher
    facility expenses.

•

$28 million higher SG&A expenses primarily due to
    increased staffing in support of increased drilling and
    operational activity, including higher compensation. The higher
    SG&A expenses also include an increase of $11 million
    in bad debt expense.

•

$17 million higher gathering expenses due to higher
    domestic production volumes.

•

$17 million of expense in 2008 related to the write-off of
    certain exploratory drilling costs for our domestic and
    international operations.

These increases are partially offset by the $148 million
    gain associated with the previously discussed sale of our Peru
    interests in 2008.

The $504 million increase in s

egment profit

is
    primarily due to the 28 percent increase in domestic net
    realized average prices and the 20 percent increase in
    domestic production volumes sold, partially offset by the
    increase in total

segment costs and expenses

.

2007 vs.

The increase in total

segment revenues

is primarily due
    to the following:

•

$487 million, or 39 percent, increase in domestic
    production revenues reflecting $264 million associated with
    a 21 percent increase in production volumes sold and
    $223 million associated with a 15 percent increase in
    net realized average prices. The increase in production volumes
    reflects an increase in the number of producing wells primarily
    from the Piceance and Powder River basins. The impact of hedge
    positions on increased net realized average prices includes both
    the expiration of a portion of fixed-price hedges that are lower
    than the current market prices and higher than current market
    prices related to basin-specific collars entered into during the
    period. Production revenues in 2007 include approximately
    $53 million related to natural gas liquids. In 2006,
    approximately $29 million of similar revenues were
    classified within other revenues.

•

$144 million increase in revenues for gas management
    activities related to gas sold on behalf of certain outside
    parties which is offset by a similar increase in

segment
    costs and expenses

.



These increases were partially offset by a $30 million
    unfavorable change related to hedge ineffectiveness due to
    $16 million in net unrealized losses from hedge
    ineffectiveness in 2007 compared to $14 million in net
    unrealized gains in 2006.

Total

segment costs and expenses

increased
    $409 million, primarily due to the following:

•

$173 million higher depreciation, depletion and
    amortization expense primarily due to higher production volumes
    and increased capitalized drilling costs.

•

$144 million increase in expenses for gas management
    activities related to gas purchased on behalf of certain outside
    parties which is offset by a similar increase in

segment
    revenues

.

•

$46 million higher lease operating expenses from the
    increased number of producing wells primarily within the
    Piceance, Powder River, and Fort Worth basins in
    combination with higher well service expenses, facility
    expenses, equipment rentals, maintenance and repair services,

$36 million higher

SG&A expenses

primarily due
    to increased staffing in support of increased drilling and
    operational activity, including higher compensation. In
    addition, we incurred higher insurance and information
    technology support costs related to the increased activity.
    First quarter 2007 also includes approximately $5 million
    of expenses associated with a correction of costs incorrectly
    capitalized in prior periods.

The $204 million increase in s

Gas
    Pipeline

Overview

Gas Pipeline’s strategy to create value focuses on
    maximizing the utilization of our pipeline capacity by providing
    high quality, low cost transportation of natural gas to large
    and growing markets.

Gas Pipeline’s interstate transmission and storage
    activities are subject to regulation by the FERC and as such,
    our rates and charges for the transportation of natural gas in
    interstate commerce, and the extension, expansion or abandonment
    of jurisdictional facilities and accounting, among other things,
    are subject to regulation. The rates are established through the
    FERC’s ratemaking process. Changes in commodity prices and
    volumes transported have little near-term impact on revenues
    because the majority of cost of service is recovered through
    firm capacity reservation charges in transportation rates. As a
    result, the recent decline in energy commodity prices has not
    significantly impacted our results of operations.

Significant events of 2008 include:

Gas
    Pipeline master limited partnership

In 2008, Williams Pipeline Partners L.P. completed its initial
    public offering. We own approximately 47.7 percent of the
    interests, including the interests of the general partner, which
    is wholly owned by us, and incentive distribution rights. We
    consolidate Williams Pipeline Partners L.P. within our Gas
    Pipeline segment due to our control through the general partner.
    (See Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.)
    Gas Pipeline’s segment profit includes 100 percent of
    Williams Pipeline Partners L.P.’s segment profit with the
    minority interest’s share presented below segment profit.

Status of
    rate case

During 2006, Transco filed a general rate case with the FERC
    designed to recover increases in costs. The new rates were
    effective, subject to refund, on March 1, 2007. On
    November 28, 2007, Transco filed a formal stipulation and
    agreement with the FERC resolving all substantive issues in
    their pending 2006 rate case. On March 7, 2008, the



FERC approved the agreement without modification. The agreement
    became effective June 1, 2008 and required refunds were
    issued in July 2008.

Hurricane
    Ike

In September 2008, Hurricane Ike impacted several onshore and
    offshore facilities on Transco’s interstate natural gas
    pipeline system resulting in varying degrees of damage. However,
    Transco has continued to meet its customer commitments while
    running at lower-than-normal volumes. We expect the majority of
    associated costs will be recoverable through insurance, with the
    remainder recoverable through Transco’s rates. We also
    expect the premiums for insuring our assets in the Gulf of
    Mexico region against weather events to significantly increase
    in 2009.

Gulfstream
    Phase III expansion project

In June 2007, our equity method investee, Gulfstream Natural Gas
    System, L.L.C. (Gulfstream), received FERC approval to extend
    its existing pipeline approximately 34 miles within
    Florida. Construction began in April 2008 and the expansion was
    placed into service in September 2008. The extension fully
    subscribed the remaining 345 Mdt/d of firm capacity on the
    existing pipeline. Gulfstream’s estimated cost of this
    project is $118 million.

Gulfstream
    Phase IV expansion project

In September 2007, Gulfstream received FERC approval to
    construct 17.8 miles of

20-inch

pipeline and to install a new compressor facility. Construction
    began in December 2007. The pipeline expansion was placed into
    service in the fourth quarter of 2008, and the compressor
    facility was placed into service in January 2009. The expansion
    increased capacity by 155 Mdt/d. Gulfstream’s estimated
    cost of this project is $192 million.

Sentinel
    expansion project

In August 2008, we received FERC approval to construct an
    expansion in the northeast United States. The cost of the
    project is estimated to be up to $200 million. We placed
    Phase I into service in December 2008 increasing capacity by 40
    Mdt/d. Phase II will provide an additional 102 Mdt/d and is
    expected to be placed into service by November 2009.

Colorado
    Hub Connection project

In September 2008, we filed an application with the FERC to
    construct a

27-mile

pipeline to provide increased access to the Rockies natural gas
    supplies. The estimated cost of the project is $60 million
    with service targeted to commence in November 2009. We will
    combine the lateral capacity with 341 Mdt/d of existing mainline
    capacity from various receipt points for delivery to Ignacio,
    Colorado, including approximately 98 Mdt/d of capacity that was
    sold on a short-term basis.

Outlook
    for 2009

In addition to the Gulfstream Phase IV compressor facility,
    Phase II of the Sentinel expansion project, and the
    Colorado Hub Connection project previously discussed, we have
    several other proposed projects to meet customer demands.
    Subject to regulatory approvals, construction of some of these
    projects could begin as early as 2009.

2008 vs.

Segment revenues

increased $24 million, or
    1 percent, due primarily to a $52 million increase in
    transportation revenues resulting primarily from Transco’s
    new rates, which were effective March 2007, and expansion
    projects that Transco placed into service in the fourth quarter
    of 2007. In addition,

segment revenues

increased
    $28 million due to transportation imbalance settlements
    (offset in

costs and operating expenses

). Partially
    offsetting these increases is the absence of $59 million
    associated with a 2007 sale of excess inventory gas (offset in

costs and operating expenses

).

Costs and operating expenses

decreased $11 million,
    or 1 percent, due primarily to the absence of
    $59 million associated with a 2007 sale of excess inventory
    gas (offset in

). The decrease is
    partially offset by an increase in costs of $28 million
    associated with transportation imbalance settlements (offset in

segment revenues

) and higher rental expense related to
    the Parachute lateral that was transferred to Midstream in
    December 2007.

Other income

—

net

changed unfavorably
    by $31 million due primarily to the absence of
    $18 million of income recognized in 2007 associated with
    payments received for a terminated firm transportation agreement
    on Northwest Pipeline’s Grays Harbor lateral and the
    absence of $17 million of income recorded in 2007 for a
    change in estimate related to a regulatory liability at
    Northwest Pipeline. In addition, project development costs were
    $21 million higher in 2008. Partially offsetting these
    unfavorable changes is a $10 million gain in 2008 on the
    sale of certain south Texas assets by Transco and a
    $9 million gain in 2008 on the sale of excess inventory gas.

The $16 million, or 2 percent, increase in

segment
    profit

is due primarily to the favorable changes in segment
    revenues and costs and operating expenses as well as slightly
    higher equity earnings from Gulfstream. These increases are
    partially offset by the unfavorable change in

2007 vs.

Revenues

increased $262 million, or 19 percent,
    due primarily to a $173 million increase in transportation
    revenues and a $25 million increase in storage revenues
    resulting primarily from new rates effective in the first
    quarter of 2007. In addition, revenues increased
    $59 million due to the sale of excess inventory gas.

Costs and operating expenses

increased $86 million,

•

An increase of $59 million associated with the sale of
    excess inventory gas;

•

An increase in depreciation expense of $30 million due to
    property additions;

•

An increase in personnel costs of $10 million due primarily
    to higher compensation as well as an increase in number of

Midstream
    Gas & Liquids

Overview
    of 2008

Midstream’s ongoing strategy is to safely and reliably
    operate large-scale midstream infrastructure where our assets
    can be fully utilized and drive low

per-unit

costs. We focus on consistently attracting new business by
    providing highly reliable service to our customers.

Significant events during 2008 include the following:

In the first three quarters of 2008, segment revenues and
    segment profit improved considerably compared to 2007. However,
    these results were followed by a steep decline in the fourth
    quarter due to a rapid decline in NGL and olefin prices.
    Compared to the prior year, our combined margins associated with
    the production and marketing of NGLs declined 70 percent in
    the fourth quarter and 15 percent for the year. Compared to
    the prior year, our combined margin from our olefin production
    and marketing business unit declined 81 percent in the
    fourth quarter and 18 percent for the year. The ongoing
    impact of sustained lower commodity prices is discussed further
    in the following Outlook for 2009 section.

Volatile
    commodity prices

Domestic
    Gathering and Processing Per-Unit NGL Margin with Production
    and

Sales Volumes by Quarter

(excludes partially owned plants)

During the first three quarters of 2008, strong

per-unit

NGL
    margins driven by higher crude prices, which impact NGL prices,
    in relationship to natural gas prices contributed significantly
    to our realized margins. During the fourth quarter, NGL and
    natural gas prices, along with most other energy commodities,
    were significantly impacted by the weakening economy and
    experienced a sharp decline. Although average annual natural gas
    prices increased from 2007 to 2008, we continued to benefit from
    favorable gas price differentials in the Rocky Mountain area
    which contributed to realized

per-unit

margins that were generally greater than that of the industry
    benchmarks for gas processed in the Henry Hub area and for
    liquids fractionated and sold at Mont Belvieu, Texas.

Our average realized NGL

per-unit

margin at our processing plants during 2008 was 61 cents per
    gallon (cpg), compared to 55 cpg in 2007. The increase in our
    NGL

per-unit

margin is partially due to a change in the mix of NGL products
    sold. Due to third-party NGL pipeline capacity restrictions
    during the third quarter of 2008 and to unfavorable ethane
    economics in the fourth quarter of 2008, we reduced our
    recoveries of ethane in those periods.



Because we typically realize lower

per-unit

margins for ethane versus other NGLs, if we had produced the
    same mix of ethane and non-ethane NGLs during 2008 as we
    generally have in prior years, the average

per-unit

margin in 2008 would have been lower. NGL margins have exceeded
    our rolling five-year average for the last seven quarters, in
    spite of strong NGL margins in 2007 and early 2008 that have
    significantly increased our rolling five-year average from 26
    cpg at the end of the 2007 to 37 cpg at the end of 2008.

NGL margins are defined as NGL revenues less BTU replacement
    cost, plant fuel, transportation and fractionation.

Per-unit

NGL
    margins are calculated based on sales of our own equity volumes
    at the processing plants. Our domestic gathering and processing
    plants recognize NGL margins on our NGL equity volumes based
    upon market-based transfer prices to our NGL marketing business.
    The NGL marketing business transports and markets those equity
    volumes, and also markets NGLs on behalf of third-party NGL
    producers, including some of our fee-based processing customers,
    and the NGL volumes produced by Discovery Producer Services
    L.L.C. The NGL marketing business bears the risk of price
    changes in these NGL volumes while they are being transported to
    final sales delivery points, as well as the impact of lower of
    cost or market write-downs on ending inventory balances.

NGL
    marketing margins impacted by sharp decline in prices

In late 2007, the NGL marketing business sold the majority of
    our equity volumes in the West region to a third-party directly
    from the plants, which reduced our average inventory levels in
    the latter part of 2007. In early 2008, our NGL marketing
    business began to transport these volumes on a third-party
    pipeline for sale at downstream markets, which increased our
    inventory levels. Inventory volumes also increased during 2008
    due to the previously discussed hurricane-related suspension of
    operations at a third-party fractionation facility at Mont
    Belvieu, Texas.

During 2006 and 2007, NGL price changes did not significantly
    affect in-transit inventory values. However in 2008 due to
    significantly and rapidly declining NGL prices, primarily during
    the fourth quarter, combined with higher average inventory
    levels, our NGL marketing business experienced a marketing loss
    of $78 million.

NGL sales
    volume constrained

Primarily during the third quarter of 2008, we experienced
    restrictions on the volume of NGLs we could deliver to
    third-party pipelines in our West region. These restrictions
    were caused by a lack of third-party NGL pipeline transportation
    capacity which resulted in us reducing our recovery of ethane to
    accommodate these restrictions. In the fourth quarter of 2008,
    these restrictions were alleviated as we were able to deliver
    NGL volumes from our Wyoming plants into the new Overland Pass
    NGL pipeline.

Due to unfavorable ethane economics during the fourth quarter of
    2008, we elected to temporarily suspend ethane recoveries at
    certain plants which further reduced our NGL sales volumes.
    While reducing the recovery of ethane did benefit our overall
    average realized NGL

per-unit

margins as previously described, it negatively impacted our NGL
    volumes and operating profit.

Hurricanes
    Gustav and Ike

As a result of Hurricanes Gustav and Ike in September 2008, not
    only did our Gulf Coast region facilities experience reduced
    volumes and damage, but our West region was also negatively
    impacted. We estimate that our segment profit for 2008 was
    decreased by approximately $60 million to $85 million
    due to downtime and charges for repairs and property insurance
    deductibles associated with Hurricanes Gustav and Ike. Other
    than the Cameron Meadows natural gas processing plant and the
    Discovery offshore gathering system, our major gathering and
    processing assets in the Gulf of Mexico returned to full
    operations by the end of the third quarter. The Cameron Meadows
    plant sustained significant damage from Hurricane Ike.
    Operations are suspended while we evaluate the timing and extent
    of the required repairs. The Discovery offshore system, which we
    operate and own a 60 percent equity interest in, also
    sustained hurricane damage and was not accepting offshore gas
    from producers while repairs were being made. The mainline of
    the Discovery offshore system was repaired and returned to
    service in January 2009. In the West region, we had to store NGL
    inventories due to the hurricane-related suspension of
    operations at a third-party fractionation facility at Mont
    Belvieu, Texas. A portion of this inventory was sold in the
    fourth quarter of 2008, and we expect to sell the remaining
    excess inventory in 2009. While we expect business interruption
    insurance to largely mitigate any losses associated with outages
    beyond 60 days, the timing to resolve these claims



is uncertain. We expect the cost of insuring our assets in the
    Gulf Coast region against weather events to significantly
    increase in 2009.

Williams
    Partners L.P.

We own approximately 23.6 percent of Williams Partners
    L.P., including the interests of the general partner, which is
    wholly owned by us, and incentive distribution rights. We
    consolidate Williams Partners L.P. within the Midstream segment
    due to our control through the general partner. (See Note 1
    of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.) Midstream’s
    segment profit includes 100 percent of Williams Partners
    L.P.’s segment profit, with the minority interest’s
    share presented below segment profit.

Outlook
    for 2009

The following factors could impact our business in 2009.

Commodity
    price changes

•

Margins in our NGL and olefins business are highly dependent
    upon continued demand within the global economy. NGL products
    are currently the preferred feedstock for ethylene and propylene
    olefin production, which are the building blocks of polyethylene
    or plastics. Forecasted domestic and global demand for
    polyethylene has weakened with the recent instability in the
    global economy. A continued slow down in domestic and global
    economies could further reduce the demand for the petrochemical
    products we produce in both Canada and the United States.

•

As evidenced by recent events, NGL, crude and natural gas prices
    are highly volatile. NGL price changes have historically tracked
    with changes in the price of crude oil; however ethane prices
    have recently disassociated from crude prices. As NGL prices,
    especially ethane, decline, we expect lower

per-unit

NGL
    margins in 2009 compared to 2008. Additionally, we anticipate
    periods when it is not economical to recover ethane, which will
    further reduce our segment profit.

•

Although natural gas prices declined significantly during the
    fourth-quarter of 2008, which reduced our costs associated with
    the production of NGLs, NGL margins were compressed as NGL
    prices fell more than natural gas prices. However, we expect
    continued favorable gas price differentials in the Rocky
    Mountain area to partially mitigate such

per-unit

margin declines.

•

In our olefin production business, we continue to maintain a
    cost advantage as our propylene and ethylene olefin production
    processes use NGL-based feedstocks, which are less expensive
    than other olefin production processes that use alternative
    crude-based feedstocks. However, margins have narrowed and we
    anticipate results from our olefins production business for the
    2009 year to be below 2008 levels.

•

Fee-based revenues generally reduce our exposure to commodity
    price risks, but may also reduce our profitability compared to
    keep-whole arrangements in high margin environments. Certain of
    our gas processing contracts contain provisions that allow
    customers to periodically elect processing services on either a
    fee-basis or a keep-whole or percent-of-liquids basis. If
    customers switch from keep-whole to fee-based processing, we
    expect a reduction in our NGL equity sales volumes in 2009
    compared to 2008.

Gathering
    and processing volumes

•

Natural gas supplies supporting our gathering and processing
    volumes are dependent upon producer drilling activities. The
    current credit crisis and economic downturn, together with the
    low commodity price environment, are expected to reduce certain
    producer drilling activities. Although our customers in the West
    region are generally large producers and we anticipate they will
    continue with some level of drilling plans, certain reductions
    are expected in 2009. A significant decline in drilling activity
    would likely reduce our gathered volumes and volumes available
    for both fee-based and keep-whole processing.

•

We expect higher fee revenues, depreciation and operating
    expenses in our Gulf Coast region as our Devils Tower
    infrastructure expansions serving the Blind Faith and Bass Lite
    prospects move into a full



year of operation in 2009. While we expect to continue to
    connect new supplies in the deepwater, this increase is expected
    to be partially offset by lower volumes in other Gulf Coast
    areas due to natural declines.

Allocation
    of capital to expansion projects

Given the current economic conditions and the volatility of the
    commodity price environment, we will continually prioritize and
    balance our capital expenditures against the demand for our
    services.

Completed
    expansion projects

•

In the eastern deepwater of the Gulf of Mexico, we completed
    construction of

37-mile

extensions of both of our oil and gas pipelines from our Devils
    Tower spar to the Blind Faith prospect located in Mississippi
    Canyon. The pipelines have been commissioned and production
    began flowing in the fourth quarter of 2008.

Ongoing
    commitments

•

In the western deepwater of the Gulf of Mexico, we expect to
    spend $205 million on our major expansion projects in 2009,
    including the Perdido Norte project, which will include an
    expansion of our Markham gas processing facility and oil and gas
    lines that will expand the scale of our existing infrastructure.
    We expect this project to begin contributing to our segment
    profit at the end of 2009.

•

In the West Region, we expect to spend $260 million on our
    major expansion projects in 2009, including the Willow Creek
    facility and additional capacity at our Echo Springs facility.

Other
    factors for consideration

•

The current economic and commodity price environment may cause
    financial difficulties for certain of our customers. Many of our
    marketing counterparties are in the petrochemicals industry,
    which has been under severe stress from the current economic
    downturn. Although we actively manage our credit exposure
    through certain collateral or payment terms and arrangements,
    continued economic downturn may result in significant credit or
    bad debt losses.

•

We expect significant savings in certain NGL transportation
    costs in the West region due to the transition from our previous
    shipping arrangement to transportation on the Overland Pass
    pipeline. NGL volumes from our Wyoming plants began to flow into
    the Overland Pass pipeline in the fourth quarter of 2008,
    relieving pipeline capacity constraints and resulting in an
    expected increase in NGL volumes for 2009.

•

Our Venezuelan operations are operated for the exclusive benefit
    of the Venezuelan state-owned oil company, Petróleos de
    Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA). As energy commodity prices have sharply
    declined, PDVSA has failed to make regular payments to many
    service providers, including us. At December 31, 2008, we
    had a net receivable of $57 million from PDVSA, none of
    which was 60 days old or older at that date. This does not
    include $15 million owed to our 49 percent equity
    investee, Accroven, of which $5 million was 60 days
    old or older at December 31, 2008. We continue to monitor
    the situation and are actively seeking resolution with PDVSA.
    The collection of receivables from PDVSA has historically been
    slower and more time consuming than our other customers due to
    their policies and the political unrest in Venezuela. We expect,
    at this time, that the amounts will ultimately be paid. The
    failure of PDVSA to make payments to service providers, however,
    could jeopardize the Venezuelan oil industry and thereby
    unfavorably impact all service providers, including us.

In addition, the economic situation resulting from lower
    commodity prices may further exacerbate political tension in
    Venezuela. The Venezuelan government continues its public
    criticism of U.S. economic and political policy, has
    implemented unilateral changes to existing energy related
    contracts, and has expropriated privately held assets within the
    energy and telecommunications sector. The continued threat of
    nationalization of certain energy-related assets in Venezuela
    could have a material negative impact on our results of
    operations. We may not receive adequate compensation for our
    interest in these assets, or any compensation, if our assets in
    Venezuela are nationalized. We own 70 percent and



66.67 percent controlling interests in the two subsidiaries
    that hold these assets. See Note 11 of Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of the
    non-recourse debt related to these assets.

    expense

. These charges represent any overhead cost not
    directly attributable to one of the specific asset groups noted
    in this discussion.

2008 vs.

The increase in

segment revenues

is largely due to:

•

A $210 million increase in revenues in our olefins
    production business due primarily to higher average product
    prices and also to higher volumes sold associated with the
    increase of our ownership interest in the Geismar olefins
    facility effective July 2007.

•

A $163 million increase in revenues associated with the
    production of NGLs due primarily to higher average NGL prices,
    partially offset by lower volumes. Lower volumes resulted from
    reduced ethane recoveries at the plants during the third and
    fourth quarters of 2008 compared to higher volumes during 2007
    as we transitioned from shipping volumes through a pipeline for
    sale downstream to product sales at the plant.

•

A $69 million increase in fee-based revenues due primarily
    to the West region, Venezuela, the deepwater Gulf Coast region
    and at our Conway fractionation and storage facilities.

Segment costs and expenses

increased $569 million,
    or 14 percent, primarily as a result of:

•

A $213 million increase in costs in our olefins production
    business due to higher feedstock prices and also to higher
    volumes produced associated with the increase of our ownership
    interest in the Geismar olefins facility effective July 2007.
    The increase also includes a $10 million higher charge to
    write down the value of olefin inventories.

•

A $191 million increase in costs associated with the
    production of NGLs due primarily to higher average natural gas
    prices.

•

A $126 million increase in NGL, olefin and crude marketing
    purchases due primarily to higher average NGL and crude prices,
    partially offset by lower volumes as discussed in the revenue
    section above. The increase also includes a $19 million
    higher charge in 2008 to write down the value of NGL and olefin
    inventories.

•

A $107 million increase in operating costs including higher
    depreciation, repair costs and property insurance deductibles
    related to the hurricanes, gas transportation expenses in the
    eastern Gulf of Mexico, employee costs, and higher costs
    associated with the increase of our ownership interest in the
    Geismar olefins facility.



These increases are partially offset by:

•

A $44 million favorable change related to foreign currency
    exchange gains primarily due to the revaluation of current
    assets held in U.S. dollars within our Canadian operations.

•

$32 million of income related to the partial settlement of
    our Gulf Liquids litigation (see Note 16 of Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements).

•

A $16 million favorable change due to higher involuntary
    conversion gains in 2008 related to insurance recoveries in
    excess of the carrying value of our Ignacio and Cameron Meadows
    plants.

The decrease in Midstream’s

segment profit

reflects
    the previously described changes in

segment revenues

and

segment costs and expenses

. A more detailed analysis of
    the segment profit of certain Midstream operations is presented
    as follows.

Domestic
    gathering & processing

The decrease in

domestic gathering & processing
    segment profit

includes a $49 million decrease in the
    West region and a $7 million decrease in the Gulf Coast
    region.

The decrease in our West region’s

segment profit

includes:

•

A $45 million decrease in NGL margins due to a significant
    increase in costs associated with the production of NGLs
    reflecting higher natural gas prices and lower volumes sold. The
    decrease in volumes sold is due primarily to restricted
    transportation capacity, unfavorable ethane economics, an
    increase in inventory during 2008, hurricane-related disruptions
    at a third-party fractionation facility, and lower equity
    volumes as processing agreements change from keep-whole to
    fee-based. These decreases were partially offset by a full year
    of production from the fifth train at our Opal processing plant,
    which began production in the first quarter of 2007.

•

A $35 million increase in operating costs driven by higher
    turbine and engine overhaul expenses, depreciation expense and
    employee costs.

•

The absence of a $12 million favorable litigation outcome
    in 2007.

•

A $24 million increase in fee revenues including new lease
    revenues from Gas Pipeline for the Parachute lateral transferred
    to Midstream in December 2007.

•

A $12 million involuntary conversion gain related to our
    Ignacio plant. These insurance recoveries were used to rebuild
    the plant.

The decrease in the Gulf Coast region’s

segment profit

is primarily due to $39 million higher operating costs
    including higher depreciation, gas transportation expenses and
    hurricane repair and property insurance deductibles. These
    increases are partially offset by $18 million higher NGL
    margins and $8 million higher fee revenues due primarily to
    connecting new supplies in the deepwater.

Venezuela

Segment profit

for our Venezuela assets increased due to
    higher fee revenues and lower bad debt expense, partially offset
    by lower currency exchange gains.

NGL
    marketing, olefins and other

The significant components of the decrease in

segment profit

of our other operations include:

•

$123 million in lower margins related to the marketing of
    NGLs and olefins due primarily to the impact of a significant
    and rapid decline in NGL and olefin prices during the fourth
    quarter of 2008 on a higher volume of product inventory in
    transit. This also includes a $19 million charge to write
    down the value of NGL and olefin inventories.



•

$33 million higher operating costs including higher costs
    associated with the increase of our ownership interest in the
    Geismar olefins facility effective July 2007 and hurricane
    damage repair expense at the Geismar plant.

These increases are partially offset by:

•

A $56 million favorable change in foreign currency exchange
    gains related to the revaluation of current assets held in
    U.S. dollars within our Canadian operations.

•

$32 million of income related to the partial settlement of
    our Gulf Liquids litigation (see Note 16 of Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements).

2007 vs.

The increase in

segment revenues

is largely due to:

•

A $528 million increase in revenues from the marketing of
    NGLs and olefins.

•

A $303 million increase in revenues from our olefins
    production business.

•

A $244 million increase in revenues associated with the
    production of NGLs.

These increases are partially offset by a $35 million
    decrease in fee revenues.

Segment costs and expenses

increased $645 million,
    or 18 percent, primarily as a result of:

•

A $491 million increase in NGL and olefin marketing
    purchases.

•

A $257 million increase in costs from our olefins
    production business.

•

A $37 million increase in operating expenses including
    higher depreciation, maintenance, gathering fuel expenses and
    operating taxes.

•

$24 million higher general and administrative expenses.

•

A $10 million loss on impairment of the Carbonate Trend
    pipeline and an $8 million loss on impairment of other
    assets.

•

The absence of $11 million of net gains on the sales of
    assets in 2006.

These increases are partially offset by:

•

The absence of a 2006 charge of $73 million related to our
    Gulf Liquids litigation (see Note 15 of Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements).

•

A $95 million decrease in costs associated with the
    production of NGLs due primarily to lower natural gas prices.

•

$12 million income in 2007 from a favorable litigation
    outcome.

The increase in Midstream’s

segment profit

reflects
    $339 million higher NGL margins and the absence of the
    previously mentioned $73 million Gulf Liquids litigation
    charge in 2006, as well as the other previously described
    changes in

segment revenues

and

segment costs and
    expenses

. A more detailed analysis of the segment profit of
    Midstream’s various operations is presented as follows.

Domestic
    gathering & processing

The increase in

domestic gathering and processing segment
    profit

includes a $308 million increase in the West
    region, partially offset by a $42 million decrease in the
    Gulf Coast region.



The increase in our West region’s

segment profit

primarily results from higher NGL margins, higher processing
    fee based revenues and a favorable litigation settlement,
    partially offset by higher operating expenses and lower
    gathering fee revenues. The significant components of this
    increase include the following:

•

NGL margins increased $326 million in 2007 compared to
    2006. This increase was driven by an increase in average per
    unit NGL prices, a decrease in costs associated with the
    production of NGLs reflecting lower natural gas prices and
    higher volumes due primarily to new capacity on the fifth
    cryogenic train at our Opal plant.

•

Processing fee revenues increased $12 million. Processing
    volumes are higher due to customers electing to take liquids and
    pay processing fees.

•

$12 million income in 2007 from a favorable litigation
    outcome.

•

Gathering fee revenues decreased $6 million due primarily
    to natural volume declines and the shutdown of the Ignacio plant
    in the fourth quarter of 2007 as a result of the fire.

•

Operating expenses increased $21 million including
    $9 million in higher depreciation, $9 million in
    higher treating plant and gathering fuel due primarily to the
    expiration of a favorable gas purchase contract, $5 million
    related to gas imbalance revaluation losses in the current year
    compared to gains in the prior year, $5 million higher
    leased compression costs and $4 million higher costs
    related to the Jicarilla lease arrangement. These were partially
    offset by the absence of a $7 million accounts payable
    accrual adjustment in 2006 and $5 million in lower system
    product losses.

The decrease in the Gulf Coast region’s

segment profit

is primarily a result of lower volumes from our deepwater
    facilities, losses on impairments, and the absence of gains on
    assets in 2006, partially offset by higher NGL margins and
    higher other fee revenues. The significant components of this
    decrease include the following:

•

Fee revenues from our deepwater assets decreased
    $40 million due primarily to declines in producers’
    volumes.

•

A $10 million loss on impairment of the Carbonate Trend
    pipeline and a $6 million loss on impairment of our other
    assets.

•

The absence of $8 million in gains on the sales of certain
    gathering assets and a processing plant in 2006 and
    $5 million lower involuntary conversion gains resulting
    from insurance proceeds used to rebuild the Cameron Meadows
    plant.

•

NGL margins increased $14 million driven by higher NGL
    prices, partially offset by lower NGL recoveries and an increase
    in costs associated with the production of NGLs.

•

Other fee revenues increased $8 million driven by higher
    water removal fees.

Venezuela

Segment profit

for our Venezuela assets decreased
    primarily due to the absence of a $9 million gain from the
    settlement of a contract dispute in 2006, $6 million lower
    fee revenues due primarily to the discontinuance in 2007 of
    revenue recognition related to labor escalation receivables,
    $7 million higher operating expenses, and $8 million
    higher bad debt expense related to labor escalation receivables,
    partially offset by $19 million of higher currency exchange
    gains and $1 million higher equity earnings.

NGL
    marketing, olefins and other

The significant components of the increase in

segment profit

of our other operations include the following:

•

The absence of the previously mentioned $73 million Gulf
    Liquids litigation charge in 2006.

•

$46 million in higher margins from our olefins production
    business due primarily to the increase in ownership of the
    Geismar olefins facility in July 2007 and higher prices of NGL
    products produced in our Canadian olefins operations.



•

$18 million in higher margins related to the marketing of
    olefins and $21 million in higher margins related to the
    marketing of NGLs due to more favorable changes in pricing while
    product was in transit during 2007 as compared to 2006.

•

An $8 million reversal of a maintenance accrual (see below).

•

$9 million higher Aux Sable equity earnings primarily due
    to favorable processing margins.

•

$11 million higher Discovery equity earnings primarily due
    to higher NGL margins and volumes.

These increases are partially offset by:

•

$19 million in higher foreign exchange losses related to
    the revaluation of current assets held in U.S. dollars
    within our Canadian operations.

•

The absence of a $4 million favorable transportation
    settlement in 2006.

Effective January 1, 2007, we adopted FASB Staff Position
    (FSP) No. AUG AIR-1,

Accounting for Planned Major
    Maintenance Activities.

As a result, we recognized as other
    income an $8 million reversal of an accrual for major
    maintenance on our Geismar ethane cracker. We did not apply the
    FSP retrospectively because the impact to our first quarter 2007
    and estimated full year 2007 earnings, as well as the impact to
    prior periods, is not material. We have adopted the deferral
    method for accounting for these costs going forward.

Indirect
    general and administrative expense

The increase in indirect general and administrative expense is
    due primarily to higher technical support services and other
    charges for various administrative support functions and higher
    employee expenses.

Gas
    Marketing Services

Gas Marketing Services (Gas Marketing) primarily supports our
    natural gas businesses by providing marketing and risk
    management services, which include marketing and hedging the gas
    produced by Exploration & Production, and procuring
    fuel and shrink gas and hedging natural gas liquids sales for
    Midstream. Gas Marketing also provides similar services to third
    parties, such as producers. In addition, Gas Marketing manages
    various natural gas-related contracts such as transportation,
    storage, related hedges and proprietary trading positions,
    including certain legacy natural gas contracts and positions.

Overview
    of 2008

Gas Marketing’s operating results for 2008 were primarily
    driven by higher realized margins on both storage and
    transportation contracts in addition to favorable price
    movements on derivative positions executed to hedge the
    anticipated withdrawals of natural gas from storage. These gains
    were partially offset by adjustments made to the carrying value
    of the natural gas inventories in storage reflecting a decline
    in the price of natural gas.

Outlook
    for 2009

For 2009, Gas Marketing will focus on providing services that
    support our natural gas businesses. Gas Marketing’s
    earnings may continue to reflect mark-to-market volatility from
    commodity-based derivatives that represent economic hedges but
    are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes or do not
    qualify for hedge accounting.

2008 vs.

Realized revenues

represent (1) revenue from the
    sale of natural gas and (2) gains and losses from the net
    financial settlement of derivative contracts.

Realized
    revenues in

creased $1,437 million primarily due to an
    increase in physical natural gas revenue as a result of a
    26 percent increase in average prices on physical natural
    gas sales. This is slightly offset by a decrease related to net
    financial settlements of derivative contracts.

Net forward unrealized mark-to-market gains (losses)

primarily represent changes in the fair values of certain
    derivative contracts with a future settlement or delivery date
    that are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes or do
    not qualify for hedge accounting. The favorable change of
    $342 million includes the effect of a $156 million
    loss realized in December 2007 related to a legacy derivative
    natural gas sales contract. We had previously accounted for this
    contract on an accrual basis under the normal purchases and
    normal sales exception of SFAS No. 133. We
    discontinued normal purchase and normal sales treatment because
    it was no longer probable that the contract would not be net
    settled. In addition, 2008 reflects favorable price movements on
    our derivative positions executed to hedge the anticipated
    withdrawal of natural gas from storage.

Total

segment costs and expenses

increased
    $1,439 million, primarily due to a 33 percent increase
    in average prices on physical natural gas purchases. These
    increases were partially offset by the absence of a
    $20 million accrual for litigation contingencies in 2007.

The $340 million favorable change in

segment profit
    (loss)

is primarily due to the favorable change in

net
    forward unrealized mark-to-market gains (losses)

, which
    includes the absence of a 2007 loss recognized on a legacy
    derivative natural gas sales contract. The favorable change in

segment profit (loss)

also reflects the absence of a
    $20 million accrual for litigation contingencies in 2007,
    partially offset by a decline in accrual earnings.

2007 vs.

Realized revenues

decreased $237 million primarily
    due to a decrease in net financial settlements of derivative
    contracts. This is partially offset by an increase in physical
    natural gas revenue as a result of a 9 percent increase in
    natural gas sales volumes partially offset by a 6 percent
    decrease in average prices on physical natural gas sales.

Net forward unrealized mark-to-market gains (losses)

changed unfavorably as a result of a $156 million loss
    related to a legacy derivative natural gas sales contract that
    was previously accounted for on an accrual basis under the
    normal purchases and normal sales exception of
    SFAS No. 133. In addition, losses on gas purchase
    contracts caused by a decrease in forward natural gas prices
    were greater in 2007 than in 2006.

Total

segment costs and expenses

decreased
    $274 million, primarily due to a decrease in costs and
    operating expenses reflecting a 7 percent decrease in
    average prices on physical natural gas purchases partially
    offset by a 4 percent increase in natural gas purchase
    volumes. The net decrease was also partially offset by:

•

A $20 million accrual for litigation contingencies in 2007.

•

The absence of a $25 million gain from the sale of certain
    receivables to a third party in 2006.

The $142 million unfavorable change in

segment profit
    (loss)

is primarily due to the loss recognized on a legacy
    derivative contract previously treated as a normal purchase and
    normal sale, a $20 million accrual for



litigation contingencies and the absence of a $25 million
    gain from the sale of certain receivables, partially offset by
    an improvement in accrual earnings.

Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
    Liquidity

Overview

In 2008, we continued to focus upon growth through disciplined
    investments in our natural gas businesses. Examples of this
    growth included:

•

Continued investment in Exploration &
    Production’s development drilling programs.

•

Expansion of Gas Pipeline’s interstate natural gas pipeline
    system to meet the demand of growth markets.

•

Continued investment in Midstream’s Deepwater Gulf
    expansion projects and gas processing capacity in the western
    United States.

These investments were primarily funded through our cash flow
    from operations, which totaled nearly $3.4 billion for 2008.

During the latter part of 2008, global credit markets
    experienced significant instability, our market capitalization
    declined as markets witnessed significant reductions in value
    and energy commodity prices experienced significant and rapid
    declines. While we have periodically provided for incremental
    funding needs through the issuance of debt

and/or

the
    sale of master limited partnership units, these sources of
    funding were considered economically unfavorable at
    December 31, 2008. In consideration of our liquidity under
    these conditions, we note the following:

•

We have sharply reduced our forecasted levels of capital
    expenditures and have the flexibility to make further reductions
    if needed.

•

As of December 31, 2008, we have approximately
    $1.4 billion of cash and cash equivalents and approximately
    $2.5 billion of available credit capacity under our credit
    facilities, of which $400 million expires in
    April 2009 and $100 million expires in May 2009. Our
    primary $1.5 billion credit facility does not expire until
    May 2012. Additionally, Exploration & Production has
    an unsecured credit agreement that serves to reduce our margin
    requirements related to our hedging activities. See additional
    discussion in the following Available Liquidity section.

•

We have no significant debt maturities until 2011.

•

Our credit exposure to derivative counterparties is partially
    mitigated by master netting agreements and collateral support.
    (See Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.)



Outlook

For 2009, we expect operating results and cash flows to be
    sharply reduced from 2008 levels by the continued impact of
    lower energy commodity prices. This impact is somewhat mitigated
    by certain of our cash flow streams that are substantially
    insulated from sustained lower commodity prices as follows:

•

Firm demand and capacity reservation transportation revenues
    under long-term contracts from Gas Pipeline;

•

Hedged natural gas sales at Exploration & Production
    related to a significant portion of its production;

•

Fee-based revenues from certain gathering and processing
    services at Midstream.

In addition, we expect certain costs for services and materials
    to decline in 2009 as demand for these resources declines.

Although the financial markets and energy commodity environment
    are expected to be depressed for at least the near term, we
    believe we have, or have access to, the financial resources and
    liquidity necessary to meet our requirements for working
    capital, capital and investment expenditures, and debt payments
    while maintaining a sufficient level of liquidity. In
    particular, we note the following assumptions for the coming
    year:

•

We expect to maintain liquidity of at least $1 billion from
    cash and cash equivalents and unused revolving credit facilities.

•

We expect to fund capital and investment expenditures, debt
    payments, dividends, and working capital requirements primarily
    through cash flow from operations, cash and cash equivalents on
    hand, and utilization of our revolving credit facilities as
    needed. However, we may be opportunistic in accessing the
    capital markets to build additional liquidity. We estimate our
    cash flow from operations to be between $1.9 billion and
    $2.2 billion in 2009.

We estimate capital and investment expenditures will total
    $2,150 million to $2,450 million in 2009. Of this
    total, approximately two-thirds is considered nondiscretionary
    to meet legal, regulatory,

and/or

contractual requirements or to preserve the value of existing
    assets. Included within the total estimated expenditures for
    2009 is $250 million to $300 million for compliance
    and maintenance-related projects at Gas Pipeline, including
    Clean Air Act compliance.

Potential risks associated with our planned levels of liquidity
    and the planned capital and investment expenditures discussed
    above include:

•

Lower than expected levels of cash flow from operations.

•

Sustained reductions in energy commodity prices from year-end
    2008 levels.

•

Exposure associated with our efforts to resolve regulatory and
    litigation issues (see Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements).

Liquidity

Based on our forecasted levels of cash flow from operations and
    other sources of liquidity, we expect to have sufficient
    liquidity to manage our businesses in 2009. As noted below,
    certain of our unsecured revolving and letter of credit
    facilities are scheduled to expire in 2009 and 2010. These
    facilities were originated primarily in support of our former
    power business.

Our internal and external sources of liquidity include cash
    generated from our operations, cash and cash equivalents on
    hand, and our credit facilities. Additional sources of
    liquidity, if needed, include bank financings, proceeds from the
    issuance of long-term debt and equity securities, and proceeds
    from asset sales. While most of our sources are available to us
    at the parent level, others may be available to certain of our
    subsidiaries, including equity and debt issuances from Williams
    Partners L.P. and Williams Pipeline Partners L.P., our master
    limited partnerships. Our ability to raise funds in the capital
    markets will be impacted by our financial condition, interest
    rates, market conditions, and industry conditions.



In response to the challenges encountered by many financial
    institutions, the U.S. Government has provided substantial
    support to financial institutions, some of which are providers
    under our credit facilities. We continue to closely monitor the
    credit status of all providers under our credit facilities.

Exploration & Production has an unsecured credit

Credit
    ratings

Standard & Poor’s rates our senior unsecured debt
    at BB+ and our corporate credit at BBB-with a stable ratings
    outlook. With respect to Standard & Poor’s, a
    rating of “BBB” or above indicates an investment grade
    rating. A rating below “BBB” indicates that the
    security has significant speculative characteristics. A
    “BB” rating indicates that Standard &
    Poor’s believes the issuer has the capacity to meet its
    financial commitment on the obligation, but adverse business
    conditions could lead to insufficient ability to meet financial
    commitments. Standard & Poor’s may modify its
    ratings with a “+” or a “−” sign to
    show the obligor’s relative standing within a major rating
    category.

Moody’s Investors Service rates our senior unsecured debt
    at Baa3. On November 6, 2008, Moody’s revised our
    ratings outlook to negative from stable. On February 23,
    2009, Moody’s revised our ratings outlook to stable from
    negative.  With respect to Moody’s, a rating of
    “Baa” or above indicates an investment grade rating. A
    rating below “Baa” is considered to have speculative
    elements. The “1”, “2” and “3”
    modifiers show the relative standing within a major category. A
    “1” indicates that an obligation ranks in the higher
    end of the broad rating category, “2” indicates a
    mid-range ranking, and “3” ranking at the lower end of
    the category.

Fitch Ratings rates our senior unsecured debt at BBB–. On
    November 6, 2008, Fitch revised our ratings outlook to
    evolving from stable. On February 24, 2009, Fitch revised
    our ratings outlook to stable from evolving. With respect to
    Fitch, a rating of “BBB” or above indicates an
    investment grade rating. A rating below “BBB” is
    considered speculative grade. Fitch may add a “+” or a
    “−” sign to show the obligor’s relative
    standing within a major rating category.

Credit rating agencies perform independent analyses when
    assigning credit ratings. No assurance can be given that the
    credit rating agencies will continue to assign us investment
    grade ratings even if we meet or exceed their current criteria
    for investment grade ratios. A downgrade of our credit rating
    might increase our future cost of borrowing and would require us
    to post additional collateral with third parties, negatively
    impacting our available liquidity. As of December 31, 2008,
    we estimate that a downgrade to a rating below investment grade
    would have required us to post up to $400 million in
    additional collateral with third parties.

Operating
    Activities

Our

net cash provided by operating activities

in 2008
    increased from 2007 due primarily to the increase in our
    earnings. Significant transactions impacting our

net cash
    provided by operating activities

in 2008 include:

•

$140 million of cash received related to a favorable
    resolution of matters involving pipeline transportation rates
    associated with our former Alaska operations (see Note 2 of
    Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).



•

$144 million of required refunds paid by Transco related to
    a general rate case with the FERC (see Results of
    Operations — Segments, Gas Pipeline).

Our

net cash provided by operating activities

in 2007
    increased from 2006 due primarily to the increase in our
    operating results and the absence of a $145 million
    securities litigation settlement payment in 2006. These
    increases are partially offset by increased income tax payments
    in 2007 and other changes in working capital.

Effects
    of Inflation

Our operations have benefited from relatively low inflation
    rates. Approximately 38 percent of our gross property,
    plant and equipment is at Gas Pipeline. Gas Pipeline is subject
    to regulation, which limits recovery to historical cost. While
    amounts in excess of historical cost are not recoverable under
    current FERC practices, we anticipate being allowed to recover
    and earn a return based on increased actual cost incurred to
    replace existing



assets. Cost-based regulation, along with competition and other
    market factors, may limit our ability to recover such increased
    costs. For the other operating units, operating costs are
    influenced to a greater extent by both competition for
    specialized services and specific price changes in oil and
    natural gas and related commodities than by changes in general
    inflation. Crude, natural gas, and natural gas liquids prices
    are particularly sensitive to the Organization of the Petroleum
    Exporting Countries (OPEC) production levels

and/or

the
    market perceptions concerning the supply and demand balance in
    the near future, as well as general economic conditions.
    However, our exposure to these price changes is reduced through
    the use of hedging instruments and the fee-based nature of
    certain of our services.

Environmental

We are a participant in certain environmental activities in
    various stages including assessment studies, cleanup operations

and/or

remedial processes at certain sites, some of which we currently
    do not own (see Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements). We are monitoring these sites in a coordinated
    effort with other potentially responsible parties, the
    U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), or other
    governmental authorities. We are jointly and severally liable
    along with unrelated third parties in some of these activities
    and solely responsible in others. Current estimates of the most
    likely costs of such activities are approximately
    $43 million, all of which are recorded as liabilities on
    our balance sheet at December 31, 2008. We will seek
    recovery of approximately $14 million of the accrued costs
    through future natural gas transmission rates. The remainder of
    these costs will be funded from operations. During 2008, we paid
    approximately $10 million for cleanup

and/or

remediation and monitoring activities. We expect to pay
    approximately $11 million in 2009 for these activities.
    Estimates of the most likely costs of cleanup are generally
    based on completed assessment studies, preliminary results of
    studies or our experience with other similar cleanup operations.
    At December 31, 2008, certain assessment studies were still
    in process for which the ultimate outcome may yield
    significantly different estimates of most likely costs.
    Therefore, the actual costs incurred will depend on the final
    amount, type and extent of contamination discovered at these
    sites, the final cleanup standards mandated by the EPA or other
    governmental authorities, and other factors.

We are subject to the federal Clean Air Act and to the federal
    Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, which require the EPA to issue
    new regulations. We are also subject to regulation at the state
    and local level. In September 1998, the EPA promulgated rules
    designed to mitigate the migration of ground-level ozone in
    certain states. In March 2004 and June 2004, the EPA promulgated
    additional regulation regarding hazardous air pollutants, which
    may result in additional controls. Capital expenditures
    necessary to install emission control devices on our Transco gas
    pipeline system to comply with rules were approximately
    $2 million in 2008 and are estimated to be between
    $5 million and $10 million through 2012. The actual
    costs incurred will depend on the final implementation plans
    developed by each state to comply with these regulations. We
    consider these costs on our Transco system associated with
    compliance with these environmental laws and regulations to be
    prudent costs incurred in the ordinary course of business and,
    therefore, recoverable through its rates.



Item 7A.

Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Interest
    Rate Risk

Our current interest rate risk exposure is related primarily to
    our debt portfolio. The majority of our debt portfolio is
    comprised of fixed rate debt in order to mitigate the impact of
    fluctuations in interest rates. The maturity of our long-term
    debt portfolio is partially influenced by the expected lives of
    our operating assets.

The tables below provide information about our interest rate
    risk-sensitive instruments as of December 31, 2008 and
    2007. Long-term debt in the tables represents principal cash
    flows, net of (discount) premium, and weighted-average interest
    rates by expected maturity dates. The fair value of our publicly
    traded long-term debt is valued using indicative year-end traded
    bond market prices. Private debt is valued based on market rates
    and the prices of similar securities with similar terms and
    credit ratings.

Commodity
    Price Risk

We are exposed to the impact of fluctuations in the market price
    of natural gas and natural gas liquids, as well as other market
    factors, such as market volatility and commodity price
    correlations. We are exposed to these risks in connection with
    our owned energy-related assets, our long-term energy-related
    contracts and our proprietary trading activities. We manage the
    risks associated with these market fluctuations using various
    derivatives and nonderivative energy-related contracts. The fair
    value of derivative contracts is subject to changes in
    energy-commodity market prices, the liquidity and volatility of
    the markets in which the contracts are transacted, and changes
    in interest rates. We measure the risk in our portfolios using a

value-at-risk

methodology to estimate the potential

one-day

loss
    from adverse changes in the fair value of the portfolios.



Value at risk requires a number of key assumptions and is not
    necessarily representative of actual losses in fair value that
    could be incurred from the portfolios. Our

value-at-risk

model uses a Monte Carlo method to simulate hypothetical
    movements in future market prices and assumes that, as a result
    of changes in commodity prices, there is a 95 percent
    probability that the

one-day

loss
    in fair value of the portfolios will not exceed the value at
    risk. The simulation method uses historical correlations and
    market forward prices and volatilities. In applying the

value-at-risk

methodology, we do not consider that the simulated hypothetical
    movements affect the positions or would cause any potential
    liquidity issues, nor do we consider that changing the portfolio
    in response to market conditions could affect market prices and
    could take longer than a

one-day

holding period to execute. While a

one-day

holding period has historically been the industry standard, a
    longer holding period could more accurately represent the true
    market risk given market liquidity and our own credit and
    liquidity constraints.

We segregate our derivative contracts into trading and
    nontrading contracts, as defined in the following paragraphs. We
    calculate value at risk separately for these two categories.
    Derivative contracts designated as normal purchases or sales
    under SFAS No. 133 and nonderivative energy contracts
    have been excluded from our estimation of value at risk.

Trading

Our trading portfolio consists of derivative contracts entered
    into for purposes other than economically hedging our commodity
    price-risk exposure. The fair value of our trading derivatives
    was a net liability of $29 million at December 31,
    2008. Our value at risk for contracts held for trading purposes
    was $0.2 million at December 31, 2008, and
    $1 million at December 31, 2007. During the year ended
    December 31, 2008, our value at risk for these contracts
    ranged from a high of $3.3 million to a low of
    $0.2 million.

Nontrading

Our nontrading portfolio consists of derivative contracts that
    hedge or could potentially hedge the price risk exposure from
    the following activities:

Segment

Commodity Price Risk Exposure

Exploration & Production

•   Natural gas sales

Midstream

•   Natural gas purchases

Gas Marketing Services

•   Natural gas purchases and sales

The fair value of our nontrading derivatives was a net asset of
    $511 million at December 31, 2008.

The value at risk for derivative contracts held for nontrading
    purposes was $33 million at December 31, 2008, and
    $24 million at December 31, 2007. During the year
    ended December 31, 2008, our value at risk for these
    contracts ranged from a high of $72 million to a low of
    $33 million. The increase in value at risk reflects the
    impact on our nontrading portfolio of the increase in volumes of
    Exploration & Production hedges in 2009 and 2010.
    Derivative contracts included in our assets and liabilities of
    discontinued operations are included in the nontrading
    portfolio, but these had a value at risk of zero for both
    periods.

Certain of the derivative contracts held for nontrading purposes
    are accounted for as cash flow hedges under
    SFAS No. 133. Of the total fair value of nontrading
    derivatives, SFAS No. 133 cash flow hedges had a net
    asset value of $458 million as of December 31, 2008.
    Though these contracts are included in our

value-at-risk

calculation, any change in the fair value of the effective
    portion of these hedge contracts would generally not be
    reflected in earnings until the associated hedged item affects
    earnings.

Trading
    Policy

We have policies and procedures that govern our trading and risk
    management activities. These policies cover authority and
    delegation thereof in addition to control requirements,
    authorized commodities and term and exposure limitations.

Value-at-risk

is limited in aggregate and calculated at a 95 percent
    confidence level.



Foreign
    Currency Risk

We have international investments that could affect our
    financial results if the investments incur a permanent decline
    in value as a result of changes in foreign currency exchange
    rates

and/or

the economic conditions in foreign countries.

International investments accounted for under the cost method
    totaled $17 million at December 31, 2008, and
    $24 million at December 31, 2007. These investments
    are primarily in nonpublicly traded companies for which it is
    not practicable to estimate fair value. We believe that we can
    realize the carrying value of these investments considering the
    status of the operations of the companies underlying these
    investments.

Net assets of consolidated foreign operations, whose functional
    currency is the local currency, are located primarily in Canada
    and approximate 5 percent and 7 percent of our net
    assets at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. These
    foreign operations do not have significant transactions or
    financial instruments denominated in other currencies. However,
    these investments do have the potential to impact our financial
    position, due to fluctuations in these local currencies arising
    from the process of translating the local functional currency
    into the U.S. dollar. As an example, a 20 percent
    change in the respective functional currencies against the
    U.S. dollar would have changed

stockholders’ equity

by approximately $84 million at December 31, 2008.



Item 8.

Financial
    Statements and Supplementary Data

MANAGEMENT’S
    REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

FINANCIAL REPORTING

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
    adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined
    in

Rules 13a-15(f)

and

15d-15(f)

under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Our internal
    controls over financial reporting are designed to provide
    reasonable assurance to our management and board of directors
    regarding the preparation and fair presentation of financial
    statements in accordance with accounting principles generally
    accepted in the United States. Our internal control over
    financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that
    (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in
    reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
    transactions and dispositions of our assets; (ii) provide
    reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as to permit
    preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally
    accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and
    expenditures are being made only in accordance with
    authorization of our management and board of directors; and
    (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
    timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition
    of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial
    statements.

All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have
    inherent limitations including the possibility of human error
    and the circumvention or overriding of controls. Therefore, even
    those systems determined to be effective can provide only
    reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement
    preparation and presentation.

Under the supervision and with the participation of our
    management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
    Financial Officer, we assessed the effectiveness of our internal
    control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008,
    based on the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in

Internal
    Control — Integrated Framework.

Based on our
    assessment we believe that, as of December 31, 2008, our
    internal control over financial reporting was effective.

Ernst & Young LLP, our independent registered public
    accounting firm, has audited our internal control over financial
    reporting, as stated in their report which is included in this
    Annual Report on

Form 10-K.



REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING

FIRM ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

The Board of Directors and Stockholders of

The Williams Companies, Inc.

We have audited The Williams Companies, Inc.’s internal
    control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008,
    based on criteria established in Internal Control —
    Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria).
    The Williams Companies, Inc.’s management is responsible
    for maintaining effective internal control over financial
    reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of
    internal control over financial reporting included in the
    accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over
    Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
    on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting
    based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
    that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the
    design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
    the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we
    considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
    audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, The Williams Companies, Inc. maintained, in all
    material respects, effective internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2008, based on the COSO
    criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated balance sheet of The Williams Companies, Inc. as of
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, and the related consolidated
    statements of income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows
    for each of the three years in the period ended
    December 31, 2008 of The Williams Companies, Inc. and our
    report dated February 23, 2009 expressed an unqualified
    opinion thereon.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders of

The Williams Companies, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of
    The Williams Companies, Inc. as of December 31, 2008 and
    2007, and the related consolidated statements of income,
    stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three
    years in the period ended December 31, 2008. Our audits
    also included the financial statement schedule listed in the
    index at Item 15(a). These financial statements and
    schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s
    management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
    financial statements and schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
    present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
    financial position of The Williams Companies, Inc. at
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, and the consolidated results of
    its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in
    the period ended December 31, 2008, in conformity with
    U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our
    opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when
    considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken
    as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the
    information set forth therein.

As explained in Note 5 to the consolidated financial
    statements, effective January 1, 2007 the Company adopted

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note 1.

Description
    of Business, Basis of Presentation, and Summary of Significant
    Accounting Policies

Description
    of Business

Operations of our company are located principally in the United
    States and are organized into the following reporting segments:
    Exploration & Production, Gas Pipeline, Midstream
    Gas & Liquids (Midstream), and Gas Marketing Services
    (Gas Marketing).

Exploration & Production includes natural gas
    development, production and gas management activities primarily
    in the Rocky Mountain and Mid-Continent regions of the United
    States and oil and natural gas interests in Argentina.

Gas Pipeline is comprised primarily of two interstate natural
    gas pipelines, as well as investments in natural gas
    pipeline-related companies. Gas Pipeline includes Northwest
    Pipeline GP (Northwest Pipeline), which extends from the
    San Juan basin in northwestern New Mexico and
    southwestern Colorado to Oregon and Washington, and
    Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Company, LLC (Transco), formerly
    Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corporation, which extends from
    the Gulf of Mexico region to the northeastern United States. In
    addition, we own a 50 percent interest in Gulfstream
    Natural Gas System L.L.C. (Gulfstream). Gulfstream is a natural
    gas pipeline system extending from the Mobile Bay area in
    Alabama to markets in Florida.

Midstream is comprised of natural gas gathering and processing
    and treating facilities in the Rocky Mountain and Gulf Coast
    regions of the United States, oil gathering and transportation
    facilities in the Gulf Coast region of the United States,
    majority-owned natural gas compression facilities in Venezuela,
    and assets in Canada, consisting primarily of a natural gas
    liquids extraction facility and a fractionation plant.

Gas Marketing primarily supports our natural gas businesses by
    providing marketing and risk management services, which include
    marketing and hedging the gas produced by
    Exploration & Production, and procuring fuel and
    shrink gas and hedging natural gas liquids sales for Midstream.
    Gas Marketing also provides similar services to third parties,
    such as producers. In addition, Gas Marketing manages various
    natural gas-related contracts such as transportation, storage,
    related hedges and proprietary trading positions.

Basis
    of Presentation

Prior period amounts reported for Exploration &
    Production have been adjusted to reflect the presentation of
    certain revenues and costs on a net basis. These adjustments
    reduced

revenues

and reduced

costs and operating
    expenses

by the same amount, with no net impact on segment
    profit. The reductions were $72 million in 2007 and
    $77 million in 2006.

Discontinued
    operations

In accordance with the provisions related to discontinued
    operations within Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    (SFAS) No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or
    Disposal of Long-Lived Assets” (SFAS No. 144),
    the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes
    reflect the results of operations and financial position of our
    former power business as discontinued operations. (See
    Note 2.) These operations included a 7,500-megawatt
    portfolio of power-related contracts that was sold in 2007 and
    our natural gas-fired electric generating plant located in
    Hazleton, Pennsylvania (Hazleton) that was sold in March 2008,
    in addition to other power-related assets.

Unless indicated otherwise, the information in the Notes to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements relates to our continuing
    operations.

Master
    limited partnerships

We currently own approximately 23.6 percent of Williams
    Partners L.P., including the interests of the general partner,
    which is wholly owned by us, and incentive distribution rights.
    Considering the presumption of control of



THE
    WILLIAMS COMPANIES, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

the general partner in accordance with Emerging Issues Task
    Force (EITF) Issue

No. 04-5,

“Determining Whether a General Partner, or the General
    Partners as a Group, Controls a Limited Partnership or Similar
    Entity When the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights,” we
    consolidate Williams Partners L.P. within our Midstream segment.

In January 2008, Williams Pipeline Partners L.P. completed its
    initial public offering of 16.25 million common units at a
    price of $20 per unit. In February 2008, the underwriters
    exercised their right to purchase an additional
    1.65 million common units at the same price. The initial
    asset of the partnership is a 35 percent interest in
    Northwest Pipeline. Upon completion of these transactions, we
    now own approximately 47.7 percent of the interests in
    Williams Pipeline Partners L.P., including the interests of the
    general partner, which is wholly owned by us, and incentive
    distribution rights. In accordance with EITF Issue

No. 04-5,

we consolidate Williams Pipeline Partners L.P. within our Gas
    Pipeline segment due to our control through the general partner.

Summary
    of Significant Accounting Policies

Principles
    of consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
    our corporate parent and our majority-owned or controlled
    subsidiaries and investments. We apply the equity method of
    accounting for investments in unconsolidated companies in which
    we and our subsidiaries own 20 to 50 percent of the voting
    interest, or otherwise exercise significant influence over
    operating and financial policies of the company.

Use of
    estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
    requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
    affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial
    statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ
    from those estimates.

Significant estimates and assumptions include:

•

Impairment assessments of investments, long-lived assets and
    goodwill;

•

Litigation-related contingencies;

•

Valuations of derivatives;

•

Hedge accounting correlations and probability;

•

Environmental remediation obligations;

•

Realization of deferred income tax assets;

•

Valuation of Exploration & Production’s reserves;

•

Asset retirement obligations;

•

Pension and postretirement valuation variables.

These estimates are discussed further throughout these notes.

Cash and
    cash equivalents

Our

cash and cash equivalents

balance includes amounts
    primarily invested in funds with high-quality, short-term
    securities and instruments that are issued or guaranteed by the
    U.S. government. These have maturity dates of three months
    or less when acquired.



THE
    WILLIAMS COMPANIES, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Restricted
    cash

Current restricted cash is included in

other current assets
    and deferred charges

in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and
    consists primarily of collateral required by certain loan
    agreements for our Venezuelan operations, and escrow accounts
    established to fund payments required by our California
    settlement. (See Note 16.) Noncurrent restricted cash is
    included in

other assets and deferred charges

in the
    Consolidated Balance Sheet and relates primarily to certain
    borrowings by our Venezuelan operations as previously mentioned
    and letters of credit. We do not expect this cash to be released
    within the next twelve months. The current and noncurrent
    restricted cash is primarily invested in short-term money market
    accounts with financial institutions.

The classification of restricted cash is determined based on the
    expected term of the collateral requirement and not necessarily
    the maturity date of the investment.

Auction
    rate securities

An auction rate security is an instrument with a long-term
    underlying maturity, but for which an auction is conducted
    periodically, as specified, to reset the interest rate and allow
    investors to buy or sell the instrument. Our Consolidated
    Statement of Cash Flows reflects the gross amount of the

purchases of auction rate securities

and the

proceeds
    from sales of auction rate securities

. At December 31,
    2008, we are no longer purchasing auction rate securities. Our
    remaining auction rate securities balance as of
    December 31, 2008, was $7 million.

Accounts
    receivable

Accounts receivable

are carried on a gross basis, with no
    discounting, less the allowance for doubtful accounts. We
    estimate the allowance for doubtful accounts based on existing
    economic conditions, the financial conditions of the customers
    and the amount and age of past due accounts. Receivables are
    considered past due if full payment is not received by the
    contractual due date. Interest income related to past due
    accounts receivable is generally recognized at the time full
    payment is received or collectibility is assured. Past due
    accounts are generally written off against the allowance for
    doubtful accounts only after all collection attempts have been
    exhausted.

Inventory
    valuation

All

inventories

are stated at the lower of cost or
    market. We determine the cost of certain natural gas inventories
    held by Transco using the

last-in,

first-out (LIFO) cost method. We determine the cost of the
    remaining inventories primarily using the average-cost method.
    LIFO inventory at December 31, 2008, was $11 million.

Property,
    plant and equipment

Property, plant and equipment

is recorded at
    cost.  We base the carrying value of these assets on
    estimates, assumptions and judgments relative to capitalized
    costs, useful lives and salvage values.

As regulated entities, Northwest Pipeline and Transco provide
    for depreciation using the straight-line method at Federal
    Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC)-prescribed rates. See
    Note 9 for depreciation rates used for major regulated gas
    plant facilities.

Depreciation for nonregulated entities is provided primarily on
    the straight-line method over estimated useful lives, except as
    noted below for oil and gas exploration and production
    activities. See Note 9 for the estimated useful lives
    associated with our nonregulated assets.

Gains or losses from the ordinary sale or retirement of
    property, plant and equipment for regulated pipelines are
    credited or charged to accumulated depreciation; other gains or
    losses are recorded in

other (income) expense — net

included in

operating income

.



THE
    WILLIAMS COMPANIES, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Ordinary maintenance and repair costs are generally expensed as
    incurred. Costs of major renewals and replacements are
    capitalized as

property, plant, and equipment

—

net

.

Oil and gas exploration and production activities are accounted
    for under the successful efforts method. Costs incurred in
    connection with the drilling and equipping of exploratory wells,
    as applicable, are capitalized as incurred. If proved reserves
    are not found, such costs are charged to expense. Other
    exploration costs, including lease rentals, are expensed as
    incurred. All costs related to development wells, including
    related production equipment and lease acquisition costs, are
    capitalized when incurred.

Depreciation, depletion and
    amortization

is provided under the units of production
    method on a field basis.

We record an asset and a liability upon incurrence equal to the
    present value of each expected future asset retirement
    obligation (ARO). The ARO asset is depreciated in a manner
    consistent with the depreciation of the underlying physical
    asset. We measure changes in the liability due to passage of
    time by applying an interest method of allocation. This amount
    is recognized as an increase in the carrying amount of the
    liability and as a corresponding accretion expense included in

other (income) expense

—

, except for regulated entities, for
    which the liability is offset by a regulatory asset.

Goodwill

Goodwill

represents the excess of cost over fair value of
    the assets of businesses acquired. It is evaluated annually for
    impairment by first comparing our management’s estimate of
    the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value,
    including goodwill. If the carrying value of the reporting unit
    exceeds its fair value, a computation of the implied fair value
    of the goodwill is compared with its related carrying value. If
    the carrying value of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the
    implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is
    recognized in the amount of the excess. We have

goodwill

of approximately $1 billion at December 31, 2008
    and 2007, attributable to our Exploration & Production
    segment.

When a reporting unit is sold or classified as held for sale,
    any goodwill of that reporting unit is included in its carrying
    value for purposes of determining any impairment or gain/loss on
    sale. If a portion of a reporting unit with goodwill is sold or
    classified as held for sale and that asset group represents a
    business, a portion of the reporting unit’s goodwill is
    allocated to and included in the carrying value of that asset
    group. None of the operations sold during the periods reported
    represented reporting units with goodwill or businesses within
    reporting units to which goodwill was required to be allocated.

Judgments and assumptions are inherent in our management’s
    estimate of future cash flows used to determine the estimate of
    the reporting unit’s fair value. The use of alternate
    judgments

and/or

assumptions could result in the recognition of different levels
    of impairment charges in the financial statements.

Subsequent to December 31, 2008, as a result of overall
    market and energy commodity price declines, we have witnessed
    periodic reductions in our total market capitalization below our
    December 31, 2008, consolidated stockholders’ equity
    balance. If our total market capitalization is below our
    consolidated stockholders’ equity balance at a future
    reporting date, we consider this an indicator of potential
    impairment of goodwill under recent SEC communications and our
    accounting considerations. We utilize market capitalization in
    corroborating our assessment of the fair value of our
    Exploration & Production reporting unit. Considering
    this, it is reasonably possible that we may be required to
    conduct an interim goodwill impairment evaluation, which could
    result in a material impairment of our goodwill.

Treasury

using the average-cost method.

Derivative
    instruments and hedging activities

We utilize derivatives to manage our commodity price risk. These
    instruments consist primarily of futures contracts, swap
    agreements, option contracts, and forward contracts involving
    short- and long-term purchases and sales of a physical energy
    commodity.

We report the fair value of derivatives, except for those for
    which the normal purchases and normal sales exception has been
    elected, on the Consolidated Balance Sheet in

derivative
    assets

and

derivative liabilities

as either current
    or noncurrent. We determine the current and noncurrent
    classification based on the timing of expected future cash flows
    of individual contracts. We report these amounts on a gross
    basis. Additionally, we report cash collateral receivables and
    payables with our counterparties on a gross basis.

The accounting for changes in the fair value of a commodity
    derivative is governed by SFAS No. 133,
    “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
    Activities,” (SFAS No. 133), as amended and
    depends on whether the derivative has been designated in a
    hedging relationship and whether we have elected the normal
    purchases and normal sales exception. The accounting for the
    change in fair value can be summarized as follows:

Derivative Treatment

Accounting Method

Normal purchases and normal sales exception

Accrual accounting

Designated in a qualifying hedging relationship

Hedge accounting

All other derivatives

Mark-to-market accounting

We may elect the normal purchases and normal sales exception for
    certain short- and long-term purchases and sales of a physical
    energy commodity. Under accrual accounting, any change in the
    fair value of these derivatives is not reflected on the balance
    sheet after the initial election of the exception.

We have also designated a hedging relationship for certain
    commodity derivatives. For a derivative to qualify for
    designation in a hedging relationship, it must meet specific
    criteria and we must maintain appropriate documentation. We
    establish hedging relationships pursuant to our risk management
    policies. We evaluate the hedging relationships at the inception
    of the hedge and on an ongoing basis to determine whether the
    hedging relationship is, and is expected to remain, highly
    effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value or cash
    flows attributable to the underlying risk being hedged. We also
    regularly assess whether the hedged forecasted transaction is
    probable of occurring. If a derivative ceases to be or is no
    longer expected to be highly effective, or if we believe the
    likelihood of occurrence of the hedged forecasted transaction is
    no longer probable, hedge accounting is discontinued
    prospectively, and future changes in the fair value of the
    derivative are recognized currently in

revenues

.

For commodity derivatives designated as a cash flow hedge, the
    effective portion of the change in fair value of the derivative
    is reported in

other comprehensive income (loss)

and
    reclassified into earnings in the period in which the hedged
    item affects earnings. Any ineffective portion of the
    derivative’s change in fair value is recognized currently
    in

revenues

. Gains or losses deferred in

accumulated
    other comprehensive loss

associated with terminated
    derivatives, derivatives that cease to be highly effective
    hedges, derivatives for which the forecasted transaction is
    reasonably possible but no longer probable of occurring, and
    cash flow hedges that have been otherwise discontinued remain in

accumulated other comprehensive loss

until the hedged
    item affects earnings. If it becomes probable that the
    forecasted transaction designated as the hedged item in a cash
    flow hedge will not occur, any gain or loss deferred in

accumulated other comprehensive loss

is recognized in

revenues

at that time. The change in likelihood is a
    judgmental decision that includes qualitative assessments made
    by management.

For commodity derivatives that are not designated in a hedging
    relationship, and for which we have not elected the normal
    purchases and normal sales exception, we report changes in fair
    value currently in

“Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus as an
    Agent,” including whether we act as principal in the
    transaction; whether we have the risks and rewards of ownership,
    including credit risk; and whether we have latitude in
    establishing prices.

Gas
    Pipeline revenues

Gas Pipeline revenues are primarily from services pursuant to
    long-term firm transportation and storage agreements. These
    agreements provide for a demand charge based on the volume of
    contracted capacity and a commodity charge based on the volume
    of gas delivered, both at rates specified in our FERC tariffs.
    We recognize revenues for demand charges ratably over the
    contract period regardless of the volume of natural gas that is
    transported or stored. Revenues for commodity charges, from both
    firm and interruptible transportation services, and storage
    injection and withdrawal services, are recognized when natural
    gas is delivered at the agreed upon delivery point or when
    natural gas is injected or withdrawn from the storage facility.

In the course of providing transportation services to customers,
    we may receive different quantities of gas from shippers than
    the quantities delivered on behalf of those shippers. The
    resulting imbalances are primarily settled through the purchase
    and sale of gas with our customers under terms provided for in
    our FERC tariffs. Revenue is recognized from the sale of gas
    upon settlement of the transportation and exchange imbalances.

As a result of the ratemaking process, certain revenues
    collected by us may be subject to possible refunds upon final
    orders in pending rate proceedings with the FERC. We record
    estimates of rate refund liabilities considering our and other
    third-party regulatory proceedings, advice of counsel and
    estimated total exposure, as discounted and risk weighted, as
    well as collection and other risks.

Exploration &
    Production revenues

Revenues from the domestic production of natural gas in
    properties for which Exploration & Production has an
    interest with other producers are recognized based on the actual
    volumes sold during the period. Any differences between volumes
    sold and entitlement volumes, based on Exploration &
    Production’s net working interest, that are determined to
    be nonrecoverable through remaining production are recognized as
    accounts receivable or accounts payable, as appropriate.
    Cumulative differences between volumes sold and entitlement
    volumes are not significant.

Midstream
    revenues

Natural gas gathering and processing services are performed
    under volumetric-based fee contracts, keep-whole agreements and
    percent-of-liquids arrangements. Revenues under volumetric-based
    fee contracts are

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

recorded when services have been performed. Under keep-whole and
    percent-of-liquids processing contracts, we retain the rights to
    all or a portion of the natural gas liquids (NGLs) extracted
    from the producers’ natural gas stream and recognize
    revenues when the extracted NGLs are sold and delivered.

We have olefins extraction operations where we retain certain
    products extracted from the producers’ off-gas stream and
    we recognize revenues when the extracted products are sold and
    delivered to our purchasers. We also produce olefins from
    purchased feed-stock, and we recognize revenues when the olefins
    are sold and delivered.

We also market NGLs and olefins. Revenues from marketing NGLs
    and olefins are recognized when the products have been sold and
    delivered.

Gas
    Marketing revenues

Revenues for sales of natural gas are recognized when the
    product is sold and delivered.

All other
    revenues

Revenues generally are recorded when services are performed or
    products have been delivered.

Impairment
    of long-lived assets and investments

We evaluate the long-lived assets of identifiable business
    activities for impairment when events or changes in
    circumstances indicate, in our management’s judgment, that
    the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. Except
    for proved and unproved properties discussed below, when an
    indicator of impairment has occurred, we compare our
    management’s estimate of undiscounted future cash flows
    attributable to the assets to the carrying value of the assets
    to determine whether an impairment has occurred and we apply a
    probability-weighted approach to consider the likelihood of
    different cash flow assumptions and possible outcomes including
    selling in the near term or holding for the remaining estimated
    useful life. If an impairment of the carrying value has
    occurred, we determine the amount of the impairment recognized
    in the financial statements by estimating the fair value of the
    assets and recording a loss for the amount that the carrying
    value exceeds the estimated fair value.

For assets identified to be disposed of in the future and
    considered held for sale in accordance with
    SFAS No. 144, we compare the carrying value to the
    estimated fair value less the cost to sell to determine if
    recognition of an impairment is required. Until the assets are
    disposed of, the estimated fair value, which includes estimated
    cash flows from operations until the assumed date of sale, is
    recalculated when related events or circumstances change.

Proved properties, including developed and undeveloped, are
    assessed for impairment using estimated future undiscounted cash
    flows on a field basis. If the undiscounted cash flows are less
    than the book value of the assets, then a subsequent analysis is
    performed using discounted cash flows. Estimating future cash
    flows involves the use of complex judgments such as estimation
    of the proved and unproven oil and gas reserve quantities, risk
    associated with the different categories of oil and gas
    reserves, timing of development and production, expected future
    commodity prices, capital expenditures, and production costs.

Unproved properties include lease acquisition costs and costs of
    acquired unproven reserves. Individually significant lease
    acquisition costs are assessed annually, or as conditions
    warrant, for impairment considering our future drilling plans,
    the remaining lease term and recent drilling results. Lease
    acquisition costs that are not individually significant are
    aggregated, and the portion of such costs estimated to be
    nonproductive, based on historical experience or other
    information, is amortized over the average holding period. A
    majority of the costs of acquired unproven reserves are
    associated with areas to which proved developed producing
    reserves are also attributed. Generally, economic recovery of
    unproven reserves in such areas is not yet supported by actual
    production or conclusive formation tests, but may be confirmed
    by our continuing development program. Ultimate recovery of
    potentially recoverable reserves in areas with established
    production generally has greater probability



THE
    WILLIAMS COMPANIES, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

than in areas with limited or no prior drilling activity. Costs
    of acquired unproven reserves are assessed annually, or as
    conditions warrant, for impairment using estimated future
    discounted cash flows on a field basis and considering our
    future drilling plans. If the unproved properties are determined
    to be productive, the appropriate related costs are transferred
    to proved oil and gas properties.

We evaluate our investments for impairment when events or
    changes in circumstances indicate, in our management’s
    judgment, that the carrying value of such investments may have
    experienced an other-than-temporary decline in value. When
    evidence of loss in value has occurred, we compare our estimate
    of fair value of the investment to the carrying value of the
    investment to determine whether an impairment has occurred. If
    the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value and we
    consider the decline in value to be other-than-temporary, the
    excess of the carrying value over the fair value is recognized
    in the consolidated financial statements as an impairment.

Judgments and assumptions are inherent in our management’s
    estimate of undiscounted future cash flows and an asset’s
    fair value. Additionally, judgment is used to determine the
    probability of sale with respect to assets considered for
    disposal. The use of alternate judgments

and/or

assumptions could result in the recognition of different levels
    of impairment charges in the consolidated financial statements.

Capitalization
    of interest

We capitalize interest during construction on major projects
    with construction periods of at least three months and a total
    project cost in excess of $1 million. Interest is
    capitalized on borrowed funds and, where regulation by the FERC
    exists, on internally generated funds as a component of

other

. The rates used by regulated
    companies are calculated in accordance with FERC rules. Rates
    used by nonregulated companies are based on the average interest
    rate on debt.

Employee
    stock-based awards

Compensation cost for share-based awards is based on the grant
    date fair value. Total stock-based compensation expense for the
    years ending December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006, was
    $31 million, $70 million and $44 million,
    respectively, of which $1 million, $9 million and
    $3 million, respectively, is included in

income (loss)
    from discontinued operations

. Measured but unrecognized
    stock-based compensation expense at December 31, 2008, was
    approximately $57 million, which does not include the
    effect of estimated forfeitures of $3 million. This amount
    is comprised of approximately $7 million related to stock
    options and approximately $50 million related to restricted
    stock units. These amounts are expected to be recognized over a
    weighted-average period of 1.8 years.

Income
    taxes

We include the operations of our subsidiaries in our
    consolidated tax return. Deferred income taxes are computed
    using the liability method and are provided on all temporary
    differences between the financial basis and the tax basis of our
    assets and liabilities. Our management’s judgment and
    income tax assumptions are used to determine the levels, if any,
    of valuation allowances associated with deferred tax assets.

Earnings
    (loss) per common share

Basic earnings (loss) per common share

is based on the
    sum of the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding
    and vested restricted stock units.

Diluted earnings (loss)
    per common share

includes any dilutive effect of stock
    options, nonvested restricted stock units and, for applicable
    periods presented, convertible debt, unless otherwise noted.

Foreign
    currency translation

Certain of our foreign subsidiaries and equity method investees
    use their local currency as their functional currency. These
    foreign currencies include the Canadian dollar, British pound
    and Euro. Assets and liabilities of certain foreign subsidiaries
    and equity investees are translated at the spot rate in effect
    at the applicable reporting date, and the combined statements of
    operations and our share of the results of operations of our
    equity affiliates are translated into the U.S. dollar at
    the average exchange rates in effect during the applicable
    period. The resulting cumulative translation adjustment is
    recorded as a separate component of

other comprehensive
    income (loss)

Transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional
    currency are recorded based on exchange rates at the time such
    transactions arise. Subsequent changes in exchange rates result
    in transaction gains and losses which are reflected in the
    Consolidated Statement of Income.

Issuance
    of equity of consolidated subsidiary

Sales of residual equity interests in a consolidated subsidiary
    are accounted for as capital transactions. No adjustments to
    capital are made for sales of preferential interests in a
    subsidiary. No gain or loss is recognized on these transactions.

Recent
    Accounting Standards

In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
    (FASB) issued SFAS No. 157, “Fair Value
    Measurements” (SFAS No. 157). This Statement
    establishes a framework for fair value measurements in the
    financial statements by providing a definition of fair value,
    provides guidance on the methods used to estimate fair value and
    expands disclosures about fair value measurements.
    SFAS No. 157 was effective for fiscal years beginning
    after November 15, 2007. In February 2008, the FASB issued
    FASB Staff Position (FSP)

No. FAS 157-2,

permitting entities to delay application of
    SFAS No. 157 to fiscal years beginning after
    November 15, 2008, for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial
    liabilities, except for items that are recognized or disclosed
    at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis
    (at least annually). On January 1, 2008, we applied
    SFAS No. 157 to our assets and liabilities that are
    measured at fair value on a recurring basis, primarily our
    energy derivatives. See Note 14 for discussion of the
    adoption. Beginning January 1, 2009, we will prospectively
    apply SFAS No. 157 fair value measurement guidance to
    nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities that are not
    recognized or disclosed on a recurring basis when such fair
    value measurements are required. Had we not elected to defer
    portions of SFAS No. 157, fair value measurements for
    nonfinancial items occurring in 2008 where
    SFAS No. 157 would have been applied include
    long-lived assets measured at fair value for impairment
    purposes, measuring the fair value of a reporting unit for
    purposes of assessing goodwill for impairment and the initial
    measurement at fair value of asset retirement obligations.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141(R)
    “Business Combinations” (SFAS No. 141(R)).
    SFAS No. 141(R) applies to all business combinations
    and establishes guidance for recognizing and measuring
    identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed,
    noncontrolling interests in the acquiree and goodwill. Most of
    these items are recognized at their full fair value on the
    acquisition date, including acquisitions where the acquirer
    obtains control but less than 100 percent ownership in the
    acquiree. SFAS No. 141(R) also requires expensing of
    restructuring and acquisition-related costs as incurred and
    establishes disclosure requirements to enable the evaluation of
    the nature and financial effects of the business combination.
    SFAS No. 141(R) is effective for business combinations
    with an acquisition date in fiscal years beginning after
    December 15, 2008. We will apply this standard for any
    business combinations after the effective date.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160,
    “Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial
    Statements — an amendment of Accounting Research
    Bulletin No. 51” (SFAS No. 160).
    SFAS No. 160 establishes accounting and reporting
    standards for noncontrolling ownership interests in subsidiaries
    (previously referred to as minority interests). Noncontrolling
    ownership interests in consolidated subsidiaries will be
    presented in the

consolidated balance sheet within stockholders’ equity as a
    separate component from the parent’s equity. Consolidated
    net income will now include earnings attributable to both the
    parent and the noncontrolling interests. Earnings per share will
    continue to be based on earnings attributable to only the parent
    company and does not change upon adoption of
    SFAS No. 160. SFAS No. 160 provides guidance
    on accounting for changes in the parent’s ownership
    interest in a subsidiary, including transactions where control
    is retained and where control is relinquished.
    SFAS No. 160 also requires additional disclosure of
    information related to amounts attributable to the parent for
    income from continuing operations, discontinued operations and
    extraordinary items and reconciliations of the parent and
    noncontrolling interests’ equity of a subsidiary. The
    Statement will be applied prospectively to transactions
    involving noncontrolling interests, including noncontrolling
    interests that arose prior to the effective date, as of the
    beginning of the fiscal year it is initially adopted. However,
    the presentation of noncontrolling interests within
    stockholders’ equity and the inclusion of earnings
    attributable to the noncontrolling interests in consolidated net
    income requires retrospective application to all periods
    presented. Beginning January 1, 2009, we will apply
    SFAS No. 160 prospectively with the exception of the
    presentation and disclosure requirements which must be applied
    retrospectively for all periods presented.

In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161,
    “Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging
    Activities — an amendment of FASB Statement
    No. 133” (SFAS No. 161).
    SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative
    Instruments and Hedging Activities,

”

currently
    establishes the disclosure requirements for derivative
    instruments and hedging activities. SFAS No. 161
    amends and expands the disclosure requirements of Statement 133
    with enhanced quantitative, qualitative and credit risk
    disclosures. The Statement requires quantitative disclosure in a
    tabular format about the fair values of derivative instruments,
    gains and losses on derivative instruments and information about
    where these items are reported in the financial statements. Also
    required in the tabular presentation is a separation of hedging
    and nonhedging activities. Qualitative disclosures include
    outlining objectives and strategies for using derivative
    instruments in terms of underlying risk exposures, use of
    derivatives for risk management and other purposes and
    accounting designation, and an understanding of the volume and
    purpose of derivative activity. Credit risk disclosures provide
    information about credit risk related contingent features
    included in derivative agreements. SFAS No. 161 also
    amends SFAS No. 107, “Disclosures about Fair
    Value of Financial Instruments,” to clarify that
    disclosures about concentrations of credit risk should include
    derivative instruments. This Statement is effective for
    financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods
    beginning after November 15, 2008, with early application
    encouraged. We plan to apply this Statement beginning in 2009.
    This Statement encourages, but does not require, comparative
    disclosures for earlier periods at initial adoption. The
    application of this Statement will increase the disclosures in
    our Consolidated Financial Statements.

In June 2008, the FASB issued FSP

No. EITF 03-6-1,

“Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share-Based
    Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities”. FSP No.

EITF 03-6-1

requires that unvested share-based payment awards containing
    nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents
    (whether paid or unpaid) be considered participating securities
    and included in the computation of earnings per share (EPS)
    pursuant to the two-class method of FASB Statement No. 128,
    “Earnings per Share.” FSP No.

EITF 03-6-1

is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years
    beginning after December 15, 2008, and interim periods
    within those years. All prior-period EPS data presented shall be
    adjusted retrospectively to conform to this FSP. Early
    application is not permitted. This FSP will not have a material
    impact on our EPS attributable to the common stockholders.

In June 2008, the FASB issued EITF Issue

No. 07-5,

“Determining Whether an Instrument (or Embedded Feature) is
    Indexed to an Entity’s Own Stock”

(EITF 07-5).

EITF 07-5

clarifies how to determine whether certain instruments or
    embedded features are indexed to an entity’s own stock.

EITF 07-5

provides that an entity should evaluate the instrument’s
    settlement provisions and contingent exercise provisions, if
    any, to determine whether an equity-linked financial instrument
    (or embedded feature) is indexed to its own stock.

EITF 07-5

concludes that contingent exercise and settlement provisions in
    equity-linked financial instruments (or embedded features) are
    consistent with being indexed to an entity’s own stock if
    they are based on variables that would be inputs to a fair value
    option or forward pricing model and they do not increase the
    instruments’ exposure to those variables. The

    this Issue in its first fiscal year beginning after
    December 15, 2008, including interim periods within those
    fiscal years. Early application is prohibited. We have
    outstanding convertible debentures. This Issue will not have an
    impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.

In September 2008, the FASB issued

EITF 08-5,

“Issuer’s Accounting for Liabilities Measured at Fair
    Value with a Third-Party Credit Enhancement”

(EITF 08-5).

The objective of this Issue is to determine an issuer’s
    unit of accounting for a liability issued with an inseparable
    third-party credit enhancement when it is measured or disclosed
    at fair value on a recurring basis. The issuer of a liability
    with a third-party credit enhancement that is inseparable from
    the liability shall not include the effect of the credit
    enhancement in the fair value measurement of the liability. An
    issuer shall disclose the existence of a third-party credit
    enhancement on its issued liability. In accordance with

EITF 08-5,

an issuer in considering their own credit in the fair value
    measurement of a liability would ignore any third-party
    guarantee, letter of credit, or other form of credit
    enhancement. This Issue shall be effective on a prospective
    basis in the first reporting period beginning on or after
    December 15, 2008. The effect of initially applying the
    guidance in this Issue shall be included in the change in fair
    value in the period of adoption. Earlier application is
    permitted. We will apply

EITF 08-5

beginning January 1, 2009, and this Issue will not
    initially have a material impact on the valuation of our
    derivative liabilities.

In November 2008, the FASB issued

EITF 08-6,

“Accounting for Equity Method Investments
    Considerations.” The Issue clarifies that an equity method
    investor is required to continue to recognize an other-than
    temporary impairment of their investment in accordance with APB
    Opinion No. 18. Also, an equity method investor should not
    separately test an investee’s underlying assets for
    impairment. However, an equity method investor should recognize
    their share of an impairment charge recorded by an investee.
    This Issue will be effective on a prospective basis in fiscal
    years beginning on or after December 15, 2008 and interim
    periods within those fiscal years. Earlier application by an
    entity that has previously adopted an alternative accounting
    policy would not be permitted. Beginning January 1, 2009,
    we will apply the guidance provided in this Consensus as
    required.

In December 2008, the FASB issued FSP No. FAS 132(R)-1,
    “Employers’ Disclosures about Postretirement Benefit
    Plan Assets”. This FSP amends FASB Statement No. 132
    (revised 2003), “Employers’ Disclosures about Pensions
    and Other Postretirement Benefits”, to provide guidance on
    an employer’s disclosures about plan assets of a defined
    benefit pension or other postretirement plan. FSP No.
    FAS 132(R)-1 applies to an employer that is subject to the
    disclosure requirements of Statement 132(R). An employer is
    required to disclose information about how investment allocation
    decisions are made, including factors that are pertinent to an
    understanding of investment policies and strategies. An employer
    should disclose separately for pension plans and other
    postretirement benefit plans the fair value of each major
    category of plan assets as of each annual reporting date for
    which a statement of financial position is presented. Asset
    categories should be based on the nature and risks of assets in
    an employer’s plan(s). An employer is required to disclose
    information that enables users of financial statements to assess
    the inputs and valuation techniques used to develop fair value
    measurements of plan assets at the annual reporting date. For
    fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs
    (Level 3), an employer should disclose the effect of the
    measurements on changes in plan assets for the period. An
    employer should provide users of financial statements with an
    understanding of significant concentrations of risk in plan
    assets. The disclosures about plan assets required by FSP No.
    FAS 132(R)-1 shall be provided for fiscal years ending
    after December 15, 2009. Upon initial application, the
    provisions of FSP No. FAS 132(R)-1 are not required for
    earlier periods that are otherwise presented for comparative
    purposes. Earlier application of the provisions of FSP No.
    FAS 132(R)-1 is permitted. We will assess the application
    of this Statement on our disclosures in our Consolidated
    Financial Statements.

Discontinued
    Operations

The summarized results of discontinued operations and summarized
    assets and liabilities of discontinued operations primarily
    reflect our former power business except where noted otherwise.
    In November 2007, we sold substantially all of our power
    business for approximately $496 million in cash. In 2008,
    we received an additional $22 million of proceeds,
    including the final purchase price adjustments and
    $8 million from the sale of Hazleton.

Income (loss) from discontinued operations before income
    taxes

for the year ended December 31, 2008, includes
    $140 million of gains from the favorable resolution of
    matters involving pipeline transportation rates associated with
    our former Alaska operations and $54 million of income from
    a reduction of remaining amounts accrued in excess of our
    obligation associated with the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System
    Quality Bank. (See Note 16.) These gains are partially
    offset by a $10 million charge from a settlement primarily
    related to the sale of natural gas liquids pipeline systems in
    2002 and a charge of $11 million associated with an
    oil purchase contract related to our former Alaska refinery.

Income (loss) from discontinued operations before income
    taxes

for the year ended December 31, 2007, includes a
    gain of $429 million (reported in

revenues

of
    discontinued operations) associated with the reclassification of
    deferred net hedge gains from

accumulated other comprehensive
    income

to earnings in second-quarter 2007. This
    reclassification was based on the determination that the hedged
    forecasted transactions were probable of not occurring due to
    the sale of our power business. This gain is partially offset by
    unrealized mark-to-market losses of approximately
    $23 million.

Income (loss) from discontinued operations
    before income taxes

also includes the results of our former
    power business operations.

Income (loss) from discontinued operations before income
    taxes

for the year ended December 31, 2006, includes
    charges of $19 million for an adverse arbitration award
    related to our former chemical fertilizer business,
    $6 million for a loss contingency in connection with a
    former exploration business, and $15 million associated
    with an oil purchase contract related to our former Alaska
    refinery. Partially offsetting these charges was
    $13 million of income related to the reduction of
    contingent obligations associated with our former distributive
    power business.

Income (loss) from discontinued operations
    before income taxes

also includes the results of our former
    power business operations.

(Impairments) and gain (loss) on sales

for the year ended
    December 31, 2007, includes a pre-tax loss of approximately
    $37 million on the sale of substantially all of our power
    business. We also recognized impairments of $111 million
    related to the carrying value of certain derivative contracts
    for which we had previously elected the normal purchases and
    normal sales exception under SFAS No. 133, and,
    accordingly, were no longer recording at fair value, and
    $14 million related to Hazleton. These impairments were
    based on our comparison of the carrying value to the estimate of
    fair value less cost to sell.

Impairments of cost-based investments

for the year ended

    in an operating contract was converted to a 4 percent
    equity interest in a Venezuelan corporation which owns and
    operates oil and gas activities. Our 4 percent equity
    interest is reported as a cost method investment; previously, we
    accounted for our working interest using the proportionate
    consolidation method.

Interest income and other

for the years ended

Our consolidated subsidiary, Williams Partners L.P., owns

    investment under the equity method due to the voting provisions
    of Discovery’s limited liability company, which provide the
    other member of Discovery significant participatory rights such
    that we do not control the investment.

Differences between the carrying value of our equity investments
    and the underlying equity in the net assets of the investees is
    primarily related to impairments previously recognized.

Dividends and distributions, including those presented below,
    received from companies accounted for by the equity method were
    $167 million in 2008 and $118 million in 2007. These
    transactions reduced the carrying value of our investments.

We have guaranteed commercial letters of credit totaling

We have provided guarantees on behalf of certain entities in

Impairment
    of certain natural gas producing properties

Based on a comparison of the estimated fair value to the

    to properties in the Arkoma basin. Our impairment analysis
    included an assessment of undiscounted and discounted future

    recorded a $14 million impairment charge in 2008 due to
    unfavorable drilling results in the Arkoma basin.

State income taxes (net of federal benefit) were reduced by
    $46 million in 2008 due to a reduction in our estimate of
    the effective deferred state rate reflective of a change in the
    mix of jurisdictional attribution of taxable income.

Utilization of foreign operating loss carryovers reduced the
    provision for income taxes by $13 million, $5 million
    and $3 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

Income from continuing operations before income taxes

includes $196 million, $169 million, and
    $144 million of foreign income in 2008, 2007, and 2006,
    respectively.

During the course of audits of our business by domestic and
    foreign tax authorities, we frequently face challenges regarding
    the amount of taxes due. These challenges include questions
    regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation
    of income among various tax jurisdictions. In evaluating the
    liability associated with our various tax filing positions, we
    apply the two-step process of recognition and measurement as
    required by FASB Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting
    for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an interpretation of FASB
    Statement No. 109” (FIN 48). We adopted
    FIN 48 effective January 1, 2007. In association with
    this liability, we record an

The

at December 31, 2008 and
    December 31, 2007, serves to reduce the recognized tax
    benefit associated with foreign carryovers to an amount that
    will, more likely than not, be realized. We do not expect to be
    able to utilize our $15 million of foreign deferred tax
    assets.

The reductions in foreign carryovers and the valuation allowance
    were primarily due to the restructuring of the European
    operations of our former power business.

Undistributed earnings of certain consolidated foreign
    subsidiaries at December 31, 2008, totaled approximately
    $377 million. No provision for deferred U.S. income
    taxes has been made for these subsidiaries because we intend to
    permanently reinvest such earnings in foreign operations.

Cash payments for income taxes (net of refunds) were
    $155 million, $384 million, and $79 million in
    2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. Cash tax payments include
    settlements with taxing authorities associated with prior period
    audits of $47 million, $94 million, and
    $42 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

As of December 31, 2008, we had approximately

We recognize related interest and penalties as a component of

    $60 million of interest and penalties were included in the
    provision for income taxes during 2008 and 2007, respectively.
    Approximately $81 million and $86 million of interest
    and penalties primarily relating to uncertain tax positions have
    been accrued as of December 31, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively.

As of December 31, 2008, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS)
    examinations of our consolidated U.S. income tax returns
    for 2006 and 2007 were in process. IRS examinations for 1997
    through 2005 have been completed at the field level but the
    years remain open for certain unresolved issues. The statute of
    limitations for most states expires one year after expiration of
    the IRS statute.

Generally, tax returns for our Venezuelan, Argentine, and
    Canadian entities are open to audit from 2003 through 2008.
    Certain Canadian entities are currently under examination.

During the next twelve months, we do not expect ultimate
    resolution of any unrecognized tax benefit associated with
    domestic or international matters to have a material impact on
    our financial position.

Employee
    Benefit Plans

We have noncontributory defined benefit pension plans in which
    all eligible employees participate. Currently, eligible
    employees earn benefits primarily based on a cash balance
    formula. Various other formulas, as defined in the plan
    documents, are utilized to calculate the retirement benefits for
    plan participants not covered by the cash balance formula. At
    the time of retirement, participants may elect to receive
    annuity payments, a lump sum payment or a combination of lump
    sum and annuity payments. In addition to our pension plans, we
    currently provide subsidized retiree medical and life insurance
    benefits (other postretirement benefits) to certain eligible
    participants. Generally, employees hired after December 31,
    1991, are not eligible for the subsidized retiree medical
    benefits, except for participants that were employees of Transco
    Energy Company on December 31, 1995, and other
    miscellaneous defined participant groups. Certain of these other
    postretirement benefit plans, particularly the subsidized
    retiree medical benefit plans, provide for retiree contributions
    and contain other cost-sharing features such as deductibles,
    co-payments, and co-insurance. The accounting for these plans
    anticipates future cost-sharing that is consistent with our
    expressed intent to increase the retiree contribution level
    generally in line with health care cost increases.

    calculate the benefit obligation. The 2008 benefit obligation

actuarial loss

of $23 million for our other
    postretirement benefit plans is due primarily to the impact of
    the decrease in the discount rate used to calculate the benefit
    obligation and changes to the mortality assumptions. The 2008
    other postretirement benefits

plan amendment

of
    $38 million is due to an increase in the retirees’
    cost-sharing percentage within our subsidized retiree medical
    benefit plans. The 2007 benefit obligation

actuarial gain

of $30 million for our other postretirement benefit
    plans is due primarily to the impact of the increase in the
    discount rate used to calculate the benefit obligation and a
    decrease in the number of eligible participants in the plan.

At December 31, 2008, all of our pension plans had a
    projected benefit obligation and accumulated benefit obligation
    in excess of plan assets. At December 31, 2007, only our
    unfunded nonqualified pension plans had projected benefit
    obligations and accumulated benefit obligations in excess of
    plan assets. The projected benefit obligation of the unfunded
    nonqualified pension plans was $25 million and the
    accumulated benefit obligation was $22 million at
    December 31, 2007. There are no assets for these plans.

The current accounting rules for the determination of

net
    periodic benefit expense

allow for the delayed recognition
    of gains and losses caused by differences between actual and
    assumed outcomes for items such as estimated return on plan
    assets, or caused by changes in assumptions for items such as
    discount rates or estimated future compensation levels. The

net actuarial gain (loss)

presented in the following
    table and recorded in

accumulated other comprehensive loss

and

net regulatory assets

represents the cumulative
    net deferred gain (loss) from these types of differences or
    changes which have not yet been recognized in the Consolidated
    Statement of Income. A portion of the

net actuarial gain
    (loss)

is amortized over the participants’ average
    remaining future years of service, which is approximately
    12 years for both our pension plans and our other

The differences in the amount of actuarially determined

net
    periodic benefit expense

for our other postretirement
    benefit plans and the other postretirement benefit costs
    recovered in rates for our FERC-regulated gas pipelines are
    deferred as a regulatory asset or liability. At
    December 31, 2008, we have net regulatory assets of
    $26 million and at December 31, 2007, we had net
    regulatory liabilities of $28 million related to these
    deferrals. These amounts will be reflected in future rates based
    on the gas pipelines’ rate structures.

The discount rates for our pension and other postretirement
    benefit plans were determined separately based on an approach
    specific to our plans. The year-end discount rates were
    determined considering a yield curve comprised of high-quality
    corporate bonds published by a large securities firm and the
    timing of the expected benefit cash flows of each plan.

The expected long-term rates of return on plan assets were
    determined by combining a review of the historical returns
    realized within the portfolio, the investment strategy included
    in the plans’ Investment Policy Statement, and capital
    market projections for the asset classifications in which the
    portfolio is invested and the target weightings of each asset
    classification.

The expected return on plan assets component of

net periodic
    benefit expense

is calculated using the market-related value
    of plan assets. For assets held in our pension plans, the
    market-related value of plan assets is equal to the fair value
    of plan assets adjusted to reflect amortization of gains or
    losses associated with the difference between the expected
    return on plan assets and the actual return on plan assets over
    a five-year period. The market-related value of plan assets for
    our other postretirement benefit plans is equal to the
    unadjusted fair value of plan assets at the beginning of the
    year.

The mortality assumptions used to determine the obligations for
    our pension and other postretirement benefit plans are related
    to the experience of the plans and the best estimate of expected
    plan mortality. The selected mortality tables are among the most
    recent tables available.

Plan
    Assets

The investment policy for our pension and other postretirement
    benefit plans articulates an investment philosophy in accordance
    with ERISA, which governs the investment of the assets in a
    diversified portfolio. The investment strategy for the assets of
    the pension plans and approximately one half of the assets of
    the other postretirement benefit plans include maximizing
    returns with reasonable and prudent levels of risk. The
    investment returns on the approximate one half of remaining
    assets of the other postretirement benefit plans is subject to
    federal income tax; therefore, the investment strategy also
    includes investing in a tax efficient manner.

The following table presents the weighted-average asset
    allocations at December 31, 2008, and 2007 and target asset
    allocations at December 31, 2008, by asset category.

Included in equity securities are investments in commingled
    funds that invest entirely in equity securities and comprise
    24 percent at December 31, 2008, and 40 percent
    at December 31, 2007, of the pension plans’
    weighted-average assets, and 13 percent at
    December 31, 2008, and 29 percent at December 31,
    2007, of the other postretirement benefit plans’
    weighted-average assets. During 2008, a commingled fund held
    within the pension plans and the other postretirement benefit
    plans was replaced with direct investments in certain equity
    securities. Other assets are comprised primarily of cash and
    cash equivalents.

The assets are invested in accordance with the target
    allocations identified in the previous table. The investment
    policy provides for minimum and maximum ranges for the broad
    asset classes in the previous table. Additional target
    allocations are identified for specific classes of equity
    securities. The asset allocation ranges established by the
    investment policy are based upon a long-term investment
    perspective. The ranges are more heavily weighted toward equity
    securities since the liabilities of the pension and other
    postretirement benefit plans are long-term in nature and
    historically equity securities have significantly outperformed
    other asset classes over long periods of time. In December 2008,
    the Investment Committee voted to increase the percentage of
    assets allocated to debt securities and cash and cash
    equivalents, included within the other category in the previous
    table, to approximately

30-35 percent,

as allowed in the investment policy. The reallocation is
    expected to be completed during the first quarter of 2009. The
    Investment Committee monitors the markets and asset allocations
    and at any time may adjust the allocation to debt securities and
    cash and cash equivalents downward, closer to the target asset
    allocation shown in the previous table.

Equity security investments are restricted to high-quality,
    readily marketable securities that are actively traded on the
    major U.S. and foreign national exchanges. Investment in
    Williams’ securities or an entity in which Williams has a
    majority ownership is prohibited except where these securities

    debt securities of any one issuer. U.S. Government
    guaranteed and agency securities are exempt from this provision.

During 2008, 11 active investment managers and one passive
    investment manager managed substantially all of the pension and
    other postretirement benefit plans’ funds. Each of the
    managers had responsibility for managing a specific portion of
    these assets.

Plan
    Benefit Payments and Employer Contributions

Following are the expected benefits to be paid by the plans and
    the expected federal prescription drug subsidy to be received in
    the next ten years. These estimates are based on the same
    assumptions previously discussed and reflect future service as
    appropriate. The actuarial assumptions are based on long-term
    expectations and include, but are not limited to, assumptions as
    to average expected retirement age and form of benefit payment.
    Actual benefit payments could differ significantly from expected
    benefit payments if near-term participant behaviors differ
    significantly from the actuarial assumptions.

We expect to contribute approximately $61 million to our

    postretirement benefit plans in 2009.

Defined
    Contribution Plans

We also maintain defined contribution plans for the benefit of
    substantially all of our employees. Generally, plan participants
    may contribute a portion of their compensation on a pre-tax and
    after-tax basis in accordance with the plans’ guidelines.
    We match employees’ contributions up to certain limits. Our
    matching contributions charged to expense were $24 million,
    $22 million, and $19 million in 2008, 2007, and 2006,
    respectively. A fund within one of our defined contribution
    plans is a nonleveraged employee stock ownership plan (ESOP).
    The shares held by the ESOP are treated as outstanding when
    computing earnings per share and the dividends on the shares
    held by the ESOP are recorded as a component of retained
    earnings. Since 2006 there have been no contributions to this
    ESOP, other than dividend reinvestment, as contributions for
    purchase of our stock are no longer allowed within this defined
    contribution plan.

Asset
    Retirement Obligations

Our asset retirement obligations at December 31, 2008 and
    2007 are $644 million and $399 million, respectively.
    The increases in the obligations in 2008 are primarily due to
    revisions in our estimation of our asset retirement obligations
    in our Midstream and Gas Pipeline segments and increased asset
    additions in our Exploration and Production segment.

The accrued obligations relate to producing wells, underground
    storage caverns, offshore platforms, fractionation facilities,
    gas gathering well connections and pipelines, and gas
    transmission facilities. At the end of the useful life of each
    respective asset, we are legally obligated to plug both
    producing wells and storage caverns and remove any related
    surface equipment, remove surface equipment and restore land at
    fractionation facilities, to dismantle offshore platforms, to
    cap certain gathering pipelines at the wellhead connection and
    remove any related surface equipment, and to remove certain
    components of gas transmission facilities from the ground.

SFAS No. 143 requires measurements of asset retirement
    obligations to include, as a component of future expected costs,
    an estimate of the price that a third party would demand, and
    could expect to receive, for bearing the uncertainties inherent
    in the obligations, sometimes referred to as a market-risk
    premium. We have no examples of credit-worthy third parties in
    the energy industry who are willing to assume this type of risk
    for a determinable price. Therefore, because we cannot
    reasonably estimate such a market-risk premium, we excluded it
    from our estimates of ARO liabilities.

Pursuant to its 2008 rate case settlement, Transco deposits a
    portion of its collected rates into an external trust (ARO
    Trust) that is specifically designated to fund future asset
    retirement obligations. Transco is also required to make annual
    deposits into the trust through 2012. The trust is reported as a
    component of

other assets and deferred charges

and has a
    carrying value of $13 million as of December 31, 2008.

    Transco each have access to $400 million under the credit
    facility to the extent not otherwise utilized by us. Lehman
    Commercial Paper Inc., which is committed to fund up to
    $70 million of our $1.5 billion credit facility, filed
    for bankruptcy in 2008. We expect that our ability to borrow
    under the credit facility is reduced by this committed amount.
    The committed amounts of other participating banks under this
    agreement remain in effect and are not impacted by the above.
    Interest is calculated based on a choice of two methods: a
    fluctuating rate equal to the lender’s base rate plus an
    applicable margin, or a periodic fixed rate equal to LIBOR plus
    an applicable margin. We are required to pay a commitment fee
    (currently 0.125 percent) based on the unused portion of
    the credit facility.



THE
    WILLIAMS COMPANIES, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The margins and commitment fee are generally based on the
    specific borrower’s senior unsecured long-term debt
    ratings. Significant financial covenants under the credit
    agreement include the following:

•

Our ratio of debt to capitalization must be no greater than
    65 percent. At December 31, 2008, we are in compliance
    with this covenant as our ratio of debt to capitalization, as
    calculated under this covenant, is approximately 40 percent.

•

Ratio of debt to capitalization must be no greater than
    55 percent for Northwest Pipeline and Transco. At
    December 31, 2008, they are in compliance with this
    covenant as their ratio of debt to capitalization, as calculated
    under this covenant, is approximately 36 percent for
    Northwest Pipeline and 26 percent for Transco.

We have unsecured $400 million, $100 million and
    $700 million credit facilities. The $400 million
    credit facility matures in April 2009, the $100 million
    credit facility matures in May 2009 and the $700 million
    credit facility matures in September 2010. These credit
    facilities provide for both borrowings and issuing letters of
    credit but are expected to be used primarily for issuing letters
    of credit. We are required to pay the funding bank fixed fees at
    a weighted-average interest rate of 3.64 percent, 3.64
    percent and 2.29 percent for the $400 million,
    $100 million and $700 million credit facilities,
    respectively, on the total committed amount of the facilities.
    In addition, we pay interest on any borrowings at a fluctuating
    rate comprised of either a base rate or LIBOR.

The funding bank, an affiliate of Citibank N.A., syndicated its
    associated credit risk through a private offering that allows
    for the resale of certain restricted securities to qualified
    institutional buyers. To facilitate the syndication of these
    credit facilities, the bank established trusts funded by the
    institutional investors. The assets of the trusts serve as
    collateral to reimburse the bank for our borrowings in the event
    that the credit facilities are delivered to the investors as
    described below. Thus, we have no asset securitization or
    collateral requirements under the credit facilities. Upon the
    occurrence of certain credit events, letters of credit under the
    agreement become cash collateralized creating a borrowing under
    the credit facilities. Concurrently, the funding bank can
    deliver the credit facilities to the institutional investors,
    whereby the investors replace the funding bank as lender under
    the credit facilities. Upon such occurrence, we will pay:

Williams Partners L.P. has an unsecured $450 million credit

    $200 million credit facility available for borrowings and
    letters of credit and a $250 million term loan. Under
    certain conditions, the credit facility may be increased up to
    an additional $100 million. The parent company and certain
    affiliates of Lehman Brothers Commercial Bank, who is committed
    to fund up to $12 million of this credit facility, filed
    for bankruptcy in 2008. They expect that their ability to borrow

    this agreement remain in effect and are not impacted by this
    reduction. Interest on borrowings under this agreement will be
    payable at rates per annum equal to either (1) a
    fluctuating base rate equal to the lender’s prime rate plus
    the applicable margin, or (2) a periodic fixed rate equal
    to LIBOR plus the applicable margin. At December 31, 2008,
    they had a $250 million term loan outstanding and no
    amounts outstanding under the $200 million credit facility.
    Significant financial covenants under this credit agreement
    include the following:

•

Williams Partners L.P. is required to maintain a ratio of
    indebtedness to EBITDA (each as defined in the credit agreement)
    of no greater than 5.0 to 1.0. At December 31, 2008, they
    are in compliance with this covenant as their ratio is 2.98.

    At December 31, 2008, they are in compliance with this
    covenant as their ratio is 5.13.

However, since the ratios are calculated on a rolling

Exploration &
    Production’s credit agreement

Exploration & Production has an unsecured credit
    agreement with certain banks in order to reduce margin
    requirements related to our hedging activities as well as lower
    transaction fees. The agreement extends through December 2013.
    Under the credit agreement, Exploration & Production
    is not required to post collateral as long as the value of its
    domestic natural gas reserves, as determined under the
    provisions of the agreement, exceeds by a specified amount
    certain of its obligations including any outstanding debt and
    the aggregate out-of-the-money positions on hedges entered into
    under the credit agreement. Exploration & Production
    is subject to additional covenants under the credit agreement
    including restrictions on hedge limits, the creation of liens,
    the incurrence of debt, the sale of assets and properties, and
    making certain payments, such as dividends, under certain

Stockholders’
    Equity

In July 2007, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase
    of up to $1 billion of our common stock. During 2007, we
    purchased 16 million shares for $526 million
    (including transaction costs) at an average cost of $33.08 per
    share. During 2008, we purchased 13 million shares of our
    common stock for $474 million (including transaction costs)
    at an average cost of $36.76 per share. We completed our
    $1 billion stock repurchase program in July 2008. Our
    overall average cost per share was $34.74. This stock repurchase
    is recorded in

treasury stock

on our Consolidated Balance
    Sheet.

In November 2005, we initiated an offer to convert our
    5.5 percent junior subordinated convertible debentures into
    our common stock. In January 2006, we converted
    $220 million of the debentures in exchange for
    20 million

shares of common stock, a $26 million cash premium, and
    $2 million of accrued interest. During 2008,
    $27 million of debentures were exchanged for 2 million
    shares of common stock. At December 31, 2008, approximately
    $53 million of 5.5 percent junior subordinated
    convertible debentures, convertible into approximately
    5 million shares of common stock, are outstanding.

At December 31, 2007, we held all of Williams Partners
    L.P.’s seven million subordinated units outstanding. In
    February 2008, these subordinated units were converted into
    common units of Williams Partners L.P. due to the achievement of
    certain financial targets that resulted in the early termination
    of the subordination period. While these subordinated units were
    outstanding, other issuances of partnership units by Williams
    Partners L.P. had preferential rights and the proceeds from
    these issuances in excess of the book basis of assets acquired
    by Williams Partners L.P. were therefore reflected as minority
    interest on our Consolidated Balance Sheet rather than as
    equity. Due to the conversion of the subordinated units, these
    original issuances of partnership units no longer have
    preferential rights and now represent the lowest level of equity
    securities issued by Williams Partners L.P. In accordance with
    our policy regarding the issuance of equity of a consolidated
    subsidiary, such issuances of nonpreferential equity are
    accounted for as capital transactions and no gain or loss is
    recognized. Therefore, as a result of the first-quarter
    conversion, we recognized a decrease to minority interest and a
    corresponding increase to stockholders’ equity of
    approximately $1.2 billion.

We maintain a Stockholder Rights Plan, as amended and restated
    on September 21, 2004, and further amended May 18,
    2007, and October 12, 2007, under which each outstanding
    share of our common stock has a right (as defined in the plan)
    attached. Under certain conditions, each right may be exercised
    to purchase, at an exercise price of $50 (subject to
    adjustment), one two-hundredth of a share of Series A
    Junior Participating Preferred Stock. The rights may be
    exercised only if an Acquiring Person acquires (or obtains the
    right to acquire) 15 percent or more of our common stock or
    commences an offer for 15 percent or more of our common
    stock. The plan contains a mechanism to divest of shares of
    common stock if such stock in excess of 14.9 percent was
    acquired inadvertently or without knowledge of the terms of the
    rights. The rights, which until exercised do not have voting
    rights, expire in 2014 and may be redeemed at a price of $.01
    per right prior to their expiration, or within a specified
    period of time after the occurrence of certain events. In the
    event a person becomes the owner of more than 15 percent of
    our common stock, each holder of a right (except an Acquiring
    Person) shall have the right to receive, upon exercise, our
    common stock having a value equal to two times the exercise
    price of the right. In the event we are engaged in a merger,
    business combination, or 50 percent or more of our assets,
    cash flow or earnings power is sold or transferred, each holder
    of a right (except an Acquiring Person) shall have the right to
    receive, upon exercise, common stock of the acquiring company
    having a value equal to two times the exercise price of the
    right.

Stock-Based
    Compensation

Plan
    Information

On May 17, 2007, our stockholders approved a plan that
    provides common-stock-based awards to both employees and
    nonmanagement directors. The plan generally contains terms and
    provisions consistent with the previous plans. The plan permits
    the granting of various types of awards including, but not
    limited to, restricted stock units and stock options and
    reserves 19 million shares for issuance. Restricted stock
    units are valued at market value on the grant date of the award
    and generally vest over three years. The purchase price per
    share for stock options may not be less than the market price of
    the underlying stock on the date of grant. Stock options
    generally become exercisable over a three-year period from the
    date of the grant and can be subject to accelerated vesting if
    certain future stock prices or if specific financial performance
    targets are achieved. Stock options generally expire
    10 years after grant. At December 31, 2008,
    33 million shares of our common stock were reserved for
    issuance pursuant to existing and future stock awards, of which
    16 million shares were available for future grants. At
    December 31, 2007, 37 million shares of our common
    stock were reserved for issuance pursuant to existing and future
    stock awards, of which 19 million shares were available for
    future grants.

Additionally, on May 17, 2007, our stockholders approved an
    Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) which authorizes up to
    2 million shares of our common stock to be available for
    sale under the plan. The ESPP enables eligible participants to
    purchase our common stock through payroll deductions not
    exceeding an annual amount of $15,000 per participant. The ESPP
    provides for offering periods during which shares may be
    purchased and continues until the earliest of: (1) the
    Board of Directors terminates the ESPP, (2) the sale of all
    shares available under the ESPP, or (3) the tenth
    anniversary of the date the Plan was approved by the
    stockholders. The first offering under the ESPP commenced on
    October 1, 2007 and ended on December 31, 2007.
    Subsequent offering periods are from January through June and
    from July through December. Generally, all employees are
    eligible to participate in the ESPP, with the exception of
    executives and international employees. The number of shares
    eligible for an employee to purchase during each offering period
    is limited to 750 shares. The purchase price of the stock
    is 85 percent of the lower closing price of either the
    first or the last day of the offering period. The ESPP requires
    a one-year holding period before the stock can be sold.
    Employees purchased 242 thousand shares at an average price of
    $17.80 per share during 2008. Approximately 1.7 million and
    2 million shares were available for purchase under the ESPP
    at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively .

    historical volatility, returns during calendar year 2002 were
    excluded as the extreme volatility during that time is not
    reasonably expected to be repeated in the future. The risk-free
    interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury Constant
    Maturity rates as of the grant date. The expected life of the
    option is based on historical exercise behavior and expected
    future experience.

Cash received from stock option exercises was $32 million,
    $56 million and $34 million during 2008, 2007 and

Fair
    Value Measurements

Adoption
    of SFAS No. 157

SFAS No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements”
    (SFAS No. 157), establishes a framework for fair value
    measurements in the financial statements by providing a
    definition of fair value, provides guidance on the methods used
    to estimate fair value and expands disclosures about fair value
    measurements. On January 1, 2008, we applied
    SFAS No. 157 for our assets and liabilities that are
    measured at fair value on a recurring basis, primarily our
    energy derivatives. Upon applying SFAS No. 157, we
    changed our valuation methodology to consider our nonperformance
    risk in estimating the fair value of our liabilities. The
    initial adoption of SFAS No. 157 had no material
    impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. In February
    2008, the FASB issued FSP

FAS 157-2,

permitting entities to delay application of
    SFAS No. 157 to fiscal years beginning after
    November 15, 2008, for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial
    liabilities, except for items that are recognized or disclosed
    at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis
    (at least annually). Beginning January 1, 2009, we will
    apply SFAS No. 157 fair value requirements to
    nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities that are not
    recognized or disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis.
    SFAS No. 157 requires two distinct transition
    approaches: (1) cumulative-effect adjustment to beginning
    retained earnings for certain financial instrument transactions
    and (2) prospectively as of the date of adoption through
    earnings or other comprehensive income, as applicable, for all
    other instruments. Upon adopting SFAS No. 157, we
    applied a prospective transition as we did not have financial
    instrument transactions that required a cumulative-effect
    adjustment to beginning retained earnings.



THE
    WILLIAMS COMPANIES, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset
    or the amount paid to transfer a liability in an orderly
    transaction between market participants (an exit price) at the
    measurement date. Fair value is a market based measurement
    considered from the perspective of a market participant. We use
    market data or assumptions that market participants would use in
    pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about risk
    and the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation. These
    inputs can be readily observable, market corroborated, or
    unobservable. We apply both market and income approaches for
    recurring fair value measurements using the best available
    information while utilizing valuation techniques that maximize
    the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of
    unobservable inputs.

SFAS No. 157 establishes a fair value hierarchy that
    prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value. The hierarchy
    gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets
    for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurement)
    and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3
    measurement). We classify fair value balances based on the
    observability of those inputs. The three levels of the fair
    value hierarchy are as follows:

•

Level 1 — Quoted prices in active markets for
    identical assets or liabilities that we have the ability to
    access. Active markets are those in which transactions for the
    asset or liability occur in sufficient frequency and volume to
    provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. Our
    Level 1 primarily consists of financial instruments that
    are exchange traded, including certain instruments that were
    part of sales transactions in 2007 and remain to be assigned to
    the purchaser. These unassigned instruments are entirely offset
    by reciprocal positions entered into directly with the
    purchaser. These reciprocal positions have also been included in
    Level 1.

•

Level 2 — Inputs are other than quoted prices in
    active markets included in Level 1, that are either
    directly or indirectly observable. These inputs are either
    directly observable in the marketplace or indirectly observable
    through corroboration with market data for substantially the
    full contractual term of the asset or liability being measured.
    Our Level 2 primarily consists of over-the-counter (OTC)
    instruments such as forwards and swaps.

•

Level 3 — Includes inputs that are not observable
    for which there is little, if any, market activity for the asset
    or liability being measured. These inputs reflect
    management’s best estimate of the assumptions market
    participants would use in determining fair value. Our
    Level 3 consists of instruments valued using industry
    standard pricing models and other valuation methods that utilize
    unobservable pricing inputs that are significant to the overall
    fair value. Instruments in this category primarily include OTC
    options.

In valuing certain contracts, the inputs used to measure fair
    value may fall into different levels of the fair value
    hierarchy. For disclosure purposes, assets and liabilities are
    classified in their entirety in the fair value hierarchy level
    based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the
    overall fair value measurement. Our assessment of the
    significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement
    requires judgment and may affect the placement within the fair
    value hierarchy levels.

    individual positions and then adjust on a portfolio level to a
    point within the bid and ask range that represents our best
    estimate of fair value. For offsetting positions by location,
    the mid-market price is used to measure both the long and short
    positions.

The determination of fair value also incorporates the time value
    of money and credit risk factors including the credit standing
    of the counterparties involved, master netting arrangements, the
    impact of credit enhancements (such as cash deposits and letters
    of credit) and our nonperformance risk on our liabilities.

Exchange-traded contracts include New York Mercantile Exchange
    and Intercontinental Exchange contracts and are valued based on
    quoted prices in these active markets and are classified within
    Level 1.

Contracts for which fair value can be estimated from executed
    transactions or broker quotes corroborated by other market data
    are generally classified within Level 2. These broker
    quotes are based on observable market prices at which
    transactions could currently be executed. In certain instances
    where these inputs are not observable for all periods,
    relationships of observable market data and historical
    observations are used as a means to estimate fair value. Where
    observable inputs are available for substantially the full term
    of the asset or liability, the instrument is categorized in
    Level 2. Our derivatives portfolio is largely comprised of

exchange-traded

products or like products and the tenure of our derivatives
    portfolio is short with 99 percent expiring in the next
    36 months. Due to the nature of the products and tenure, we
    are consistently able to obtain market pricing. All pricing is
    reviewed on a daily basis and is formally validated with broker
    quotes and documented on a monthly basis by management.

Certain instruments trade in less active markets with lower
    availability of pricing information requiring valuation models
    using inputs that may not be readily observable or corroborated
    by other market data. These instruments are classified within
    Level 3 when these inputs have a significant impact on the
    measurement of fair value. The fair value of options is
    estimated using an industry standard Black-Scholes option
    pricing model. Certain inputs into the model are generally
    observable, such as commodity prices and interest rates, whereas
    other model inputs, such as implied volatility by location, is
    unobservable and requires judgment in estimating. The

    Instruments

Fair-value
    methods

We use the following methods and assumptions in estimating our
    fair-value disclosures for financial instruments:

Cash and cash equivalents and restricted
    cash

:  The carrying amounts reported in the
    balance sheet approximate fair value due to the short-term
    maturity of these instruments.

Notes and other noncurrent receivables, margin deposits, and
    customer margin deposits payable

:  The carrying
    amounts reported in the balance sheet approximate fair value as
    these instruments have interest rates approximating market.

Cost-based investments and other
    securities

:  This includes cost-based investments,
    auction rate securities, ARO Trust investments and
    held-to-maturity securities. These are carried at fair value
    with the exception of certain international investments that are
    not publicly traded. In 2007, auction rate securities and
    held-to-maturity securities are reported in

other current
    assets and deferred charges

in the Consolidated Balance
    Sheet. In 2008, auction rate securities are classified within

investments

in the Consolidated Balance Sheet due to
    auction failures. The ARO Trust investments are classified as
    available-for-sale and are reported in

other assets and
    deferred charges

in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. (See
    Note 9.)

Long-term debt

:  The fair value of our publicly
    traded long-term debt is valued using indicative year-end traded
    bond market prices. Private debt is valued based on market rates
    and the prices of similar securities with



THE
    WILLIAMS COMPANIES, INC.

NOTES TO

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

similar terms and credit ratings. At December 31, 2008 and
    2007, approximately 95 percent and 90 percent,
    respectively, of our long-term debt was publicly traded.

Guarantees

:  The

guarantees

represented
    in the table below consist primarily of guarantees we have
    provided in the event of nonpayment by our previously owned
    communications subsidiary, Williams Communications Group
    (WilTel), on certain lease performance obligations. To estimate
    the fair value of the guarantees, the estimated default rate is
    determined by obtaining the average cumulative issuer-weighted
    corporate default rate for each guarantee based on the credit
    rating of WilTel’s current owner and the term of the
    underlying obligation. The default rates are published by
    Moody’s Investors Service.

Energy derivatives

:  Energy derivatives include
    futures, forwards, swaps, and options. See Note 14 for
    discussion of valuation of our energy derivatives.

Energy
    Derivatives

Our energy derivative contracts include the following:

Futures contracts

:  Futures contracts are
    standardized commitments through an organized commodity exchange
    to either purchase or sell a commodity at a future date for a
    specified price. Futures are generally settled in cash, but may
    be settled through delivery of the underlying commodity. The
    fair value of these contacts is generally determined using
    quoted prices.

Forward contracts

:  Forward contracts are
    over-the-counter commitments to either purchase or sell a
    commodity at a future date for a specified price, which involve
    physical delivery of energy commodities, and may contain either
    fixed or variable pricing terms. Forward contracts are generally
    valued based on prices of the underlying energy commodities over
    the contract life and contractual or notional volumes with the
    resulting expected future cash flows discounted to a present
    value using a risk-free market interest rate.



THE
    WILLIAMS COMPANIES, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Swap agreements

: Swap agreements require us to make
    payments to (or receive payments from) counterparties based upon
    the differential between a fixed and variable price or between
    variable prices of energy commodities at different locations.
    Swap agreements are generally valued based on prices of the
    underlying energy commodities over the contract life and
    contractual or notional volumes with the resulting expected
    future cash flows discounted to a present value using a
    risk-free market interest rate.

Option contracts

:  Physical and financial
    option contracts give the buyer the right to exercise the option
    and receive the difference between a predetermined strike price
    and a market price at the date of exercise. An option to
    purchase and an option to sell can be combined in an instrument
    called a collar to set a minimum and maximum transaction price.
    These contracts are generally valued based on option pricing
    models considering prices of the underlying energy commodities
    over the contract life, volatility of the commodity prices,
    contractual volumes, estimated volumes under option and other
    arrangements, and a risk-free market interest rate.

Energy
    commodity cash flow hedges

We are exposed to market risk from changes in energy commodity
    prices within our operations. We utilize derivatives to manage
    our exposure to the variability in expected future cash flows
    from forecasted purchases and sales of natural gas and
    forecasted sales of NGLs attributable to commodity price risk.
    Certain of these derivatives have been designated as cash flow
    hedges under SFAS No. 133.

Our Exploration & Production segment produces, buys
    and sells natural gas at different locations throughout the
    United States. To reduce exposure to a decrease in revenues from
    fluctuations in natural gas market prices, we enter into natural
    gas futures contracts, swap agreements, and financial option
    contracts to mitigate the price risk on forecasted sales of
    natural gas. We have also entered into basis swap agreements to
    reduce the locational price risk associated with our producing
    basins. Exploration & Production’s cash flow
    hedges are expected to be highly effective in offsetting cash
    flows attributable to the hedged risk during the term of the
    hedge. However, ineffectiveness may be recognized primarily as a
    result of locational differences between the hedging derivative
    and the hedged item.

Our Midstream segment produces, buys and sells NGLs at different
    locations throughout the United States. Our Midstream segment
    also buys the required fuel and shrink needed to generate NGLs.
    To reduce exposure to a decrease in revenues from fluctuations
    in NGL market prices, we may hedge price risk by entering into
    NGL swap agreements, financial forward contracts, and financial
    option contracts to mitigate the price risk on forecasted sales
    of NGLs. Midstream’s cash flow hedges are expected to be
    highly effective in offsetting cash flows attributable to the
    hedged risk during the term of the hedge. However,
    ineffectiveness may be recognized primarily as a result of
    locational differences between the hedging derivative and the
    hedged item. Midstream does not have any commodity-related cash
    flow hedges at December 31, 2008.

Changes in the fair value of our cash flow hedges are deferred
    in other comprehensive income and are reclassified into

revenues

in the same period or periods in which the
    hedged forecasted purchases or sales affect earnings, or when it
    is probable that the hedged forecasted transaction will not
    occur by the end of the originally specified time period. During
    2008, we reclassified approximately $2 million of net
    losses from other comprehensive income to earnings as a result
    of the discontinuance of cash flow hedges because the forecasted
    transaction did not occur by the end of the originally specified
    time period. In second-quarter 2007, we recognized a net gain of
    $429 million (reported in

revenues

of discontinued
    operations) associated with the reclassification of deferred net
    hedge gains of our former power business from

accumulated
    other comprehensive income/loss

to earnings. This
    reclassification was based on the determination that the hedged
    forecasted transactions were probable of not occurring. See
    Note 2 for further discussion. Approximately
    $2 million and $14 million of net losses from hedge
    ineffectiveness are included in

revenues

during 2008 and
    2007, respectively. For 2008 and 2007, there are no derivative
    gains or losses excluded from the assessment of hedge
    effectiveness. As of December 31, 2008, we have hedged
    portions of future cash flows associated with anticipated energy
    commodity purchases and sales for up to four years. Based on
    recorded values at December 31, 2008, approximately
    $189 million of net gains (net of income



THE
    WILLIAMS COMPANIES, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

tax provision of $115 million) will be reclassified into
    earnings within the next year. These recorded values are based
    on market prices of the commodities as of December 31,
    2008. Due to the volatile nature of commodity prices and changes
    in the creditworthiness of counterparties, actual gains or
    losses realized in 2009 will likely differ from these values.
    These gains or losses will offset net losses or gains that will
    be realized in earnings from previous unfavorable or favorable
    market movements associated with underlying hedged transactions.

Other
    energy derivatives

Our Gas Marketing Services and Exploration &
    Production segments have other energy derivatives that have not
    been designated or do not qualify as SFAS No. 133
    hedges. As such, the net change in their fair value is
    recognized in

revenues

in the Consolidated Statement of
    Income. Even though they do not qualify for hedge accounting
    (see

derivative instruments and hedging activities

in
    Note 1 for a description of hedge accounting), certain of
    these derivatives hedge our future cash flows on an economic
    basis.

Other
    energy-related contracts

We also hold significant nonderivative energy-related contracts,
    such as storage and transportation agreements, in our Gas
    Marketing Services portfolio. These have not been included in
    the financial instruments table above or in our Consolidated
    Balance Sheet because they are not derivatives as defined by
    SFAS No. 133.

Guarantees

In addition to the guarantees and payment obligations discussed
    elsewhere in these footnotes (see Notes 3 and 16), we have
    issued guarantees and other similar arrangements as discussed
    below.

In connection with agreements executed to resolve take-or-pay
    and other contract claims and to amend gas purchase contracts,
    Transco entered into certain settlements with producers that may
    require the indemnification of certain claims for additional
    royalties that the producers may be required to pay as a result
    of such settlements. Transco, through its agent, Gas Marketing
    Services, continues to purchase gas under contracts which
    extend, in some cases, through the life of the associated gas
    reserves. Certain of these contracts contain royalty
    indemnification provisions that have no carrying value.
    Producers have received certain demands and may receive other
    demands, which could result in claims pursuant to royalty
    indemnification provisions. Indemnification for royalties will
    depend on, among other things, the specific lease provisions
    between the producer and the lessor and the terms of the
    agreement between the producer and Transco. Consequently, the
    potential maximum future payments under such indemnification
    provisions cannot be determined. However, management believes
    that the probability of material payments is remote.

In connection with the 1993 public offering of units in the
    Williams Coal Seam Gas Royalty Trust (Royalty Trust), our
    Exploration & Production segment entered into a gas
    purchase contract for the purchase of natural gas in which the
    Royalty Trust holds a net profits interest. Under this
    agreement, we guarantee a minimum purchase price that the
    Royalty Trust will realize in the calculation of its net profits
    interest. We have an annual option to discontinue this minimum
    purchase price guarantee and pay solely based on an index price.
    The maximum potential future exposure associated with this
    guarantee is not determinable because it is dependent upon
    natural gas prices and production volumes. No amounts have been
    accrued for this contingent obligation as the index price
    continues to exceed the minimum purchase price.

We are required by certain lenders to ensure that the interest
    rates received by them under various loan agreements are not
    reduced by taxes by providing for the reimbursement of any taxes
    required to be paid by the lender. The maximum potential amount
    of future payments under these indemnifications is based on the
    related borrowings. These indemnifications generally continue
    indefinitely unless limited by the underlying tax regulations
    and have no carrying value. We have never been called upon to
    perform under these indemnifications.



THE
    WILLIAMS COMPANIES, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

We have provided guarantees in the event of nonpayment by our
    previously owned communications subsidiary, WilTel, on certain
    lease performance obligations that extend through 2042. The
    maximum potential exposure is approximately $42 million at
    December 31, 2008, and $44 million at
    December 31, 2007. Our exposure declines systematically
    throughout the remaining term of WilTel’s obligations. The
    carrying value of these guarantees is approximately
    $38 million at December 31, 2008.

Former managing directors of Gulf Liquids are involved in
    litigation related to the construction of gas processing plants.
    Gulf Liquids has indemnity obligations to the former managing
    directors for legal fees and potential losses that may result
    from this litigation. Claims against these former managing
    directors have been settled and dismissed after payments on
    their behalf by directors and officers insurers. Some unresolved
    issues remain between us and these insurers, but no amounts have
    been accrued for any potential liability.

We have guaranteed the performance of a former subsidiary of our
    wholly owned subsidiary MAPCO Inc., under a coal supply
    contract. This guarantee was granted by MAPCO Inc. upon the sale
    of its former subsidiary to a third-party in 1996. The
    guaranteed contract provides for an annual supply of a minimum
    of 2.25 million tons of coal. Our potential exposure is
    dependent on the difference between current market prices of
    coal and the pricing terms of the contract, both of which are
    variable, and the remaining term of the contract. Given the
    variability of the terms, the maximum future potential payments
    cannot be determined. We believe that our likelihood of
    performance under this guarantee is remote. In the event we are
    required to perform, we are fully indemnified by the purchaser
    of MAPCO Inc.’s former subsidiary. This guarantee expires
    in December 2010 and has no carrying value.

Natural gas customers include pipelines, distribution companies,
    producers, gas marketers and industrial users primarily located
    in the eastern and northwestern United States, Rocky Mountains,
    Gulf Coast, Venezuela and Canada. As a general policy,
    collateral is not required for receivables, but customers’
    financial condition and credit worthiness are evaluated
    regularly.

Our Venezuelan operations are operated for the exclusive benefit
    of PDVSA. As energy commodity prices have sharply declined,
    PDVSA has failed to make regular payments to many service
    providers, including us. Included within

sale of natural gas
    and related products and services

in the table above at
    December 31, 2008, is a $57 million net receivable
    from PDVSA, none of which was 60 days old or older at that
    date. We continue to



THE
    WILLIAMS COMPANIES, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

monitor the situation and are actively seeking resolution with
    PDVSA. The collection of receivables from PDVSA has historically
    been slower and more time consuming than our other customers due
    to their policies and the political unrest in Venezuela. We
    expect, at this time, that the amounts will ultimately be paid.

Derivative
    assets and liabilities

We have a risk of loss as a result of counterparties not
    performing pursuant to the terms of their contractual
    obligations. Counterparty performance can be influenced by
    changes in the economy and regulatory issues, among other
    factors. Risk of loss results from items including credit
    considerations and the regulatory environment for which a
    counterparty transacts. We attempt to minimize credit-risk
    exposure to derivative counterparties and brokers through formal
    credit policies, consideration of credit ratings from public
    ratings agencies, monitoring procedures, master netting
    agreements and collateral support under certain circumstances.
    Additional collateral support could include letters of credit,
    payment under margin agreements, and guarantees of payment by
    credit worthy parties.

We also enter into master netting agreements to mitigate
    counterparty performance and credit risk. During 2008 and 2007,
    we did not incur any significant losses due to counterparty
    bankruptcy filings.

The gross credit exposure from our derivative contracts, a
    portion of which is included in assets of discontinued
    operations (see Note 2), as of December 31, 2008, is

Our ten largest net counterparty positions represent
    approximately 99 percent of our net credit exposure from
    derivatives and are all with investment grade counterparties.
    Included within this group are five counterparty positions,
    representing 72 percent of our net credit exposure from
    derivatives, associated with Exploration &
    Production’s hedging facility. (See Note 11.) Under
    certain conditions, the terms of this credit agreement may
    require the participating financial institutions to deliver
    collateral support with a designated collateral agent (which is
    another participating financial institution in the agreement).
    The level of collateral support required is dependent on whether
    the net position of the counterparty financial institution
    exceeds specified thresholds. The thresholds may be subject to
    prescribed reductions based changes in the credit rating of the
    counterparty financial institution.

At December 31, 2008, the designated collateral agent held
    $198 million of collateral support on our behalf under
    Exploration & Production’s hedging facility. In
    addition, we held collateral support, including letters of
    credit, of $36 million related to our other derivative
    positions.

Revenues

In 2008, 2007 and 2006, there were no customers for which our
    sales exceeded 10 percent of our consolidated revenues.

Issues
    Resulting from California Energy Crisis

Our former power business was engaged in power marketing in
    various geographic areas, including California. Prices charged
    for power by us and other traders and generators in California
    and other western states in 2000 and 2001 were challenged in
    various proceedings, including those before the
    U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). These
    challenges included refund proceedings, summer 2002

90-day

contracts, investigations of alleged market manipulation
    including withholding, gas indices and other gaming of the
    market, new long-term power sales to the State of California
    that were subsequently challenged and civil litigation relating
    to certain of these issues. We have entered into settlements
    with the State of California (State Settlement), major
    California utilities (Utilities Settlement), and others that
    substantially resolved each of these issues with these parties.

As a result of a June 2008 U.S. Supreme Court decision,
    certain contracts that we entered into during 2000 and
    2001 may be subject to partial refunds depending on the
    results of further proceedings at the FERC. These contracts,
    under which we sold electricity, totaled approximately
    $89 million in revenue. While we are not a party to the
    cases involved in the U.S. Supreme Court decision, the
    buyer of electricity from us is a party to the cases and claims
    that we must refund to the buyer any loss it suffers due to the
    FERC’s reconsideration of the contract terms at issue in
    the decision. The FERC has directed the parties to provide
    additional information on certain issues remanded by the
    U.S. Supreme Court, but delayed the submission of this
    information to permit the parties to explore possible
    settlements of the contractual disputes.

Certain other issues also remain open at the FERC and for other
    nonsettling parties.

Refund
    proceedings

Although we entered into the State Settlement and Utilities
    Settlement, which resolved the refund issues among the settling
    parties, we continue to have potential refund exposure to
    nonsettling parties, such as the counterparty to the contracts
    described above and various California end users that did not
    participate in the Utilities Settlement. As a part of the
    Utilities Settlement, we funded escrow accounts that we
    anticipate will satisfy any ultimate refund determinations in
    favor of the nonsettling parties including interest on refund
    amounts that we might owe to settling and nonsettling parties.
    We are also owed interest from counterparties in the California
    market during the refund period for which we have recorded a
    receivable totaling approximately $24 million at
    December 31, 2008. Collection of the interest and the
    payment of interest on refund amounts from the escrow accounts
    is



THE
    WILLIAMS COMPANIES, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

subject to the conclusion of this proceeding. Therefore, we
    continue to participate in the FERC refund case and related
    proceedings.

Challenges to virtually every aspect of the refund proceedings,
    including the refund period, continue to be made. Because of our
    settlements, we do not expect that the final resolution of
    refund obligations will have a material impact on us. Despite
    two FERC decisions that will affect the refund calculation,
    significant aspects of the refund calculation process remain
    unsettled, and the final refund calculation has not been made.

    price indices have been brought against us and others, in each
    case seeking an unspecified amount of damages. We are currently
    a defendant in:

•

State court litigation in California brought on behalf of
    certain business and governmental entities that purchased gas
    for their use.

•

Class action litigation and other litigation originally filed in
    state court in Colorado, Kansas, Missouri, Tennessee and
    Wisconsin brought on behalf of direct and indirect purchasers of
    gas in those states.

•

A Missouri class action and the cases from other jurisdictions
    were transferred to the federal court in Nevada. In 2008, the
    federal court in Nevada granted summary judgment in the Colorado
    case in favor of us and most of the other defendants, and on
    January 8, 2009, the court denied the plaintiffs’
    request for reconsideration of the Colorado dismissal. We expect
    that the Colorado plaintiffs will appeal.

•

On October 29, 2008, the Tennessee appellate court reversed
    the state court’s dismissal of the plaintiffs’ claims
    on federal preemption grounds and sent the case back to the
    lower court for further proceedings. We and other defendants
    appealed the reversal to the Tennessee Supreme Court.

•

On January 13, 2009, the Missouri state court dismissed a
    case for lack of standing. We expect that the decision will be
    appealed.

Environmental
    Matters

Continuing
    operations

Since 1989, our Transco subsidiary has had studies underway to
    test certain of its facilities for the presence of toxic and
    hazardous substances to determine to what extent, if any,
    remediation may be necessary. Transco has responded to data
    requests from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
    (EPA) and state agencies regarding such potential contamination
    of certain of its sites. Transco has identified polychlorinated
    biphenyl (PCB) contamination in compressor systems, soils and
    related properties at certain compressor station sites. Transco
    has also been involved in negotiations with the EPA and state
    agencies to develop screening, sampling and cleanup programs. In
    addition, Transco commenced negotiations with certain
    environmental authorities and other parties concerning
    investigative and remedial actions relative to potential mercury
    contamination at certain gas metering sites. The costs of any
    such remediation will depend upon the scope of the remediation.
    At December 31, 2008, we had accrued liabilities of
    $5 million related to PCB contamination, potential mercury
    contamination, and other toxic and hazardous substances. Transco
    has been identified as a potentially responsible party at
    various Superfund and state waste disposal sites. Based on
    present volumetric estimates and other factors, we have
    estimated our aggregate exposure for remediation of these sites
    to be less than $500,000, which is included in the environmental
    accrual discussed above. We expect that these costs will be
    recoverable through Transco’s rates.

Beginning in the mid-1980s, our Northwest Pipeline subsidiary
    evaluated many of its facilities for the presence of toxic and
    hazardous substances to determine to what extent, if any,
    remediation might be necessary. Consistent with other natural
    gas transmission companies, Northwest Pipeline identified PCB
    contamination in air compressor systems, soils and related
    properties at certain compressor station sites. Similarly,
    Northwest Pipeline identified

hydrocarbon impacts at these facilities due to the former use of
    earthen pits and mercury contamination at certain gas metering
    sites. The PCBs were remediated pursuant to a Consent Decree
    with the EPA in the late 1980s and Northwest Pipeline conducted
    a voluntary

clean-up

of
    the hydrocarbon and mercury impacts in the early 1990s. In 2005,
    the Washington Department of Ecology required Northwest Pipeline
    to reevaluate its previous mercury

clean-ups

in
    Washington. Consequently, Northwest Pipeline is conducting
    additional remediation activities at certain sites to comply
    with Washington’s current environmental standards. At
    December 31, 2008, we have accrued liabilities of
    $9 million for these costs. We expect that these costs will
    be recoverable through Northwest Pipeline’s rates.

In March 2008, the EPA issued a new air quality standard for
    ground level ozone. The new standard will likely impact the
    operations of our interstate gas pipelines and cause us to incur
    additional capital expenditures to comply. At this time we are
    unable to estimate the cost of these additions that may be
    required to meet the new regulations. We expect that costs
    associated with these compliance efforts will be recoverable
    through rates.

We also accrue environmental remediation costs for natural gas
    underground storage facilities, primarily related to soil and
    groundwater contamination. At December 31, 2008, we have
    accrued liabilities totaling $6 million for these costs.

In April 2007, the New Mexico Environment Department’s Air
    Quality Bureau (NMED) issued an NOV to Williams Four Corners,
    LLC (Four Corners) that alleged various emission and reporting
    violations in connection with our Lybrook gas processing
    plant’s flare and leak detection and repair program. In
    December 2007, the NMED proposed a penalty of approximately
    $3 million. In July 2008, the NMED issued an NOV to Four
    Corners that alleged air emissions permit exceedances for three
    glycol dehydrators at one of our compressor facilities and
    proposed a penalty of approximately $103,000. We are discussing
    the proposed penalties with the NMED.

In March 2008, the EPA proposed a penalty of $370,000 for
    alleged violations relating to leak detection and repair program
    delays at our Ignacio gas plant in Colorado and for alleged
    permit violations at a compressor station. We met with the EPA
    and are exchanging information in order to resolve the issues.

In September 2007, the EPA requested, and our Transco subsidiary
    later provided, information regarding natural gas compressor
    stations in the states of Mississippi and Alabama as part of the
    EPA’s investigation of our compliance with the Clean Air
    Act. On March 28, 2008, the EPA issued NOVs alleging
    violations of Clean Air Act requirements at these compressor
    stations. We met with the EPA in May 2008 and submitted our
    response denying the allegations in June 2008.

Former
    operations, including operations classified as
    discontinued

In connection with the sale of certain assets and businesses, we
    have retained responsibility, through indemnification of the
    purchasers, for environmental and other liabilities existing at
    the time the sale was consummated, as described below.

Agrico

In connection with the 1987 sale of the assets of Agrico
    Chemical Company, we agreed to indemnify the purchaser for
    environmental cleanup costs resulting from certain conditions at
    specified locations to the extent such costs exceed a specified
    amount. At December 31, 2008, we have accrued liabilities
    of $9 million for such excess costs.

Other

At December 31, 2008, we have accrued environmental
    liabilities of $14 million related primarily to our:

•

Potential indemnification obligations to purchasers of our
    former retail petroleum and refining operations;

•

Former propane marketing operations, bio-energy facilities,
    petroleum products and natural gas pipelines;



THE
    WILLIAMS COMPANIES, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

•

Discontinued petroleum refining facilities; and

•

Former exploration and production and mining operations.

Certain of our subsidiaries have been identified as potentially
    responsible parties at various Superfund and state waste
    disposal sites. In addition, these subsidiaries have incurred,
    or are alleged to have incurred, various other hazardous
    materials removal or remediation obligations under environmental
    laws.

Summary
    of environmental matters

Actual costs incurred for these matters could be substantially
    greater than amounts accrued depending on the actual number of
    contaminated sites identified, the actual amount and extent of
    contamination discovered, the final cleanup standards mandated
    by the EPA and other governmental authorities and other factors,
    but the amount cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.

Other
    Legal Matters

Will
    Price (formerly Quinque)

In 2001, fourteen of our entities were named as defendants in a
    nationwide class action lawsuit in Kansas state court that had
    been pending against other defendants, generally pipeline and
    gathering companies, since 2000. The plaintiffs alleged that the
    defendants have engaged in mismeasurement techniques that
    distort the heating content of natural gas, resulting in an
    alleged underpayment of royalties to the class of producer
    plaintiffs and sought an unspecified amount of damages. The
    fourth amended petition, which was filed in 2003, deleted all of
    our defendant entities except two Midstream subsidiaries. All
    remaining defendants have opposed class certification and a
    hearing on plaintiffs’ second motion to certify the class
    was held in April 2005. We are awaiting a decision from the
    court. The amount of any possible liability cannot be reasonably
    estimated at this time.

Grynberg

In 1998, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) informed us
    that Jack Grynberg, an individual, had filed claims on behalf of
    himself and the federal government, in the United States
    District Court for the District of Colorado under the False
    Claims Act against us and certain of our wholly owned
    subsidiaries. The claims sought an unspecified amount of
    royalties allegedly not paid to the federal government, treble
    damages, a civil penalty, attorneys’ fees, and costs. In
    connection with our sales of Kern River Gas Transmission in 2002
    and Texas Gas Transmission Corporation in 2003, we agreed to
    indemnify the purchasers for any liability relating to this
    claim, including legal fees. The maximum amount of future
    payments that we could potentially be required to pay under
    these indemnifications depends upon the ultimate resolution of
    the claim and cannot currently be determined. Grynberg had also
    filed claims against approximately 300 other energy companies
    alleging that the defendants violated the False Claims Act in
    connection with the measurement, royalty valuation and purchase
    of hydrocarbons. In 1999, the DOJ announced that it would not
    intervene in any of the Grynberg cases. Also in 1999, the Panel
    on Multi-District Litigation transferred all of these cases,
    including those filed against us, to the federal court in
    Wyoming for pre-trial purposes. The District Court dismissed all
    claims against us and our wholly owned subsidiaries. The matter
    is on appeal to the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals.

In August 2002, Jack J. Grynberg, and Celeste C. Grynberg,
    Trustee on Behalf of the Rachel Susan Grynberg Trust, and the
    Stephen Mark Grynberg Trust, served us and one of our
    Exploration & Production subsidiaries with a complaint
    in state court in Denver, Colorado. The plaintiffs alleged we
    used mismeasurement techniques that distorted the British
    Thermal Unit heating content of natural gas resulting in the
    underpayment of royalties to them and other independent natural
    gas producers. They also alleged we took inappropriate
    deductions from the gross value of their natural gas and made
    other royalty valuation errors. Under various theories of
    relief, they were seeking actual damages between $2 million
    and $20 million based on interest rate variations and
    punitive damages in the amount of approximately $1 million.
    In 2005, the parties agreed to dismiss mismeasurement claims. In
    September



THE
    WILLIAMS COMPANIES, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

2008, the court ruled in our favor on motions for summary
    judgment dismissing various claims. Trial on the remaining
    breach of contract and accounting claims occurred in November
    2008. The jury found against us and awarded less than
    $2 million, which we believe materially concludes the
    matter. The plaintiffs seek to increase the total award by
    approximately $1 million, which we have contested.

Securities
    class actions

Numerous shareholder class action suits were filed against us in
    2002 in the United States District Court for the Northern
    District of Oklahoma. The majority of the suits alleged that we
    and co-defendants, WilTel, previously a subsidiary known as
    Williams Communications, and certain corporate officers, acted
    jointly and separately to inflate the price of WilTel
    securities. WilTel was dismissed as a defendant as a result of
    its bankruptcy.

On July 6, 2007, the court granted various defendants’
    motions for summary judgment and entered judgment for us and the
    other defendants in the WilTel matter. On February 18,
    2009, the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the lower
    court’s decision. The plaintiffs might seek rehearing
    before the Tenth Circuit or request a writ of certiorari from
    the United States Supreme Court. Any obligation of ours to the
    WilTel equity holders as a result of a settlement, or as a
    result of trial in the event of a successful appeal of the
    court’s judgment, will not likely be covered by insurance
    because our insurance coverage has been fully utilized by the
    settlement described above. The extent of any such obligation is
    presently unknown and cannot be estimated, but it is reasonably
    possible that our exposure could materially exceed amounts
    accrued for this matter.

TAPS
    Quality Bank

One of our subsidiaries, Williams Alaska Petroleum, Inc. (WAPI),
    has been engaged in administrative litigation being conducted
    jointly by the FERC and the Regulatory Commission of Alaska
    (RCA) concerning the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System (TAPS) Quality
    Bank. In 2004, the FERC and RCA presiding administrative law
    judges rendered their joint and individual initial decisions,
    and we accrued approximately $134 million based on our
    computation and assessment of ultimate ruling terms that were
    considered probable. Our additional potential refund liability
    terminated on March 31, 2004, when WAPI sold the Alaska
    refinery and ceased shipping on the TAPS pipeline. We
    subsequently accrued additional amounts for interest.

In 2006, the FERC entered its final order, which the RCA
    adopted. On February 15, 2008, the Alaska Supreme Court
    upheld the RCA’s order and on March 16, 2008, the D.C.
    Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the FERC’s order. We have
    paid substantially all amounts invoiced by the Quality Bank
    Administrator and third parties, except certain disputed amounts
    which remain accrued.

In 2008, we concluded that the likelihood of successful appeal
    by the counterparties was remote, and we reduced remaining
    amounts accrued in excess of our estimated remaining obligation
    by $54 million. On January 12, 2009, this matter
    concluded when the U.S. Supreme Court denied a
    counterparty’s request for a writ of certiorari to appeal
    the ruling of the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.

Gulf
    Liquids litigation

Gulf Liquids contracted with Gulsby Engineering Inc. (Gulsby)
    and Gulsby-Bay (a joint venture between Gulsby and Bay Ltd.) for
    the construction of certain gas processing plants in Louisiana.
    National American Insurance Company (NAICO) and American Home
    Assurance Company provided payment and performance bonds for the
    projects. In 2001, the contractors and sureties filed multiple
    cases in Louisiana and Texas against Gulf Liquids and us.

In 2006, at the conclusion of the consolidated trial of the
    asserted contract and tort claims, the jury returned its actual
    and punitive damages verdict against us and Gulf Liquids. Based
    on our interpretation of the jury verdicts, we recorded a charge
    based on our estimated exposure for actual damages of
    approximately $68 million plus potential interest of
    approximately $20 million. In addition, we concluded that
    it was reasonably possible that any ultimate



THE
    WILLIAMS COMPANIES, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

judgment might have included additional amounts of approximately
    $199 million in excess of our accrual, which primarily
    represented our estimate of potential punitive damage exposure
    under Texas law.

From May through October 2007, the court entered seven
    post-trial orders in the case (interlocutory orders) which,
    among other things, overruled the verdict award of tort and
    punitive damages as well as any damages against us. The court
    also denied the plaintiffs’ claims for attorneys’
    fees. On January 28, 2008, the court issued its judgment
    awarding damages against Gulf Liquids of approximately
    $11 million in favor of Gulsby and approximately
    $4 million in favor of Gulsby-Bay. Gulf Liquids, Gulsby,
    Gulsby-Bay, Bay Ltd., and NAICO appealed the judgment. In
    February 2009, we settled with certain of these parties and
    reduced our liability as of December 31, 2008, by
    $43 million, including $11 million of interest. If the
    judgment is upheld on appeal, our remaining liability will be
    substantially less than the amount of our accrual for these
    matters.

Wyoming
    severance taxes

In August 2006, the Wyoming Department of Audit (DOA) assessed
    our subsidiary, Williams Production RMT Company, additional
    severance tax and interest for the production years 2000 through
    2002. In addition, the DOA notified us of an increase in the
    taxable value of our interests for ad valorem tax purposes. We
    disputed the DOA’s interpretation of the statutory
    obligation and appealed this assessment to the Wyoming State
    Board of Equalization (SBOE). The SBOE upheld the assessment and
    remanded it to the DOA to address the disallowance of a credit.
    We appealed to the Wyoming Supreme Court. In December 2008, the
    Wyoming Supreme Court ruled against us. The negative assessment
    for the

2000-2002

time period resulted in additional severance and ad valorem
    taxes of $4 million. We have accrued a total liability of
    $39 million related to this matter representing our
    exposure, including interest, through the end of 2008. We have
    petitioned for rehearing of a portion of the ruling.

Royalty
    litigation

In September 2006, royalty interest owners in Garfield County,
    Colorado, filed a class action suit in Colorado state court
    alleging that we improperly calculated oil and gas royalty
    payments, failed to account for the proceeds that we received
    from the sale of gas and extracted products, improperly charged
    certain expenses, and failed to refund amounts withheld in
    excess of ad valorem tax obligations. The plaintiffs claim that
    the class might be in excess of 500 individuals and seek an
    accounting and damages. The parties have reached a partial
    settlement agreement for an amount that was previously accrued.
    The partial settlement has received preliminary approval by the
    court, and we anticipate trial in late 2009 on remaining issues
    related to royalty payment calculation and obligations under
    specific lease provisions. We are not able to estimate the
    amount of any additional exposure at this time.

Certain other royalty matters are currently being litigated by
    other producers with a federal regulatory agency in Colorado and
    with a state agency in New Mexico. Although we are not a party
    to these matters, the final outcome of those cases might lead to
    a future unfavorable impact on our results of operations.

Other
    Divestiture Indemnifications

Pursuant to various purchase and sale agreements relating to
    divested businesses and assets, we have indemnified certain
    purchasers against liabilities that they may incur with respect
    to the businesses and assets acquired from us. The indemnities
    provided to the purchasers are customary in sale transactions
    and are contingent upon the purchasers incurring liabilities
    that are not otherwise recoverable from third parties. The
    indemnities generally relate to breach of warranties, tax,
    historic litigation, personal injury, environmental matters,
    right of way and other representations that we have provided.

At December 31, 2008, we do not expect any of the
    indemnities provided pursuant to the sales agreements to have a
    material impact on our future financial position. However, if a
    claim for indemnity is brought against us in the future, it may
    have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in
    the period in which the claim is made.



THE
    WILLIAMS COMPANIES, INC.

NOTES TO

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

In addition to the foregoing, various other proceedings are
    pending against us which are incidental to our operations.

Summary

Litigation, arbitration, regulatory matters, and environmental
    matters are subject to inherent uncertainties. Were an
    unfavorable ruling to occur, there exists the possibility of a
    material adverse impact on the results of operations in the
    period in which the ruling occurs. Management, including
    internal counsel, currently believes that the ultimate
    resolution of the foregoing matters, taken as a whole and after
    consideration of amounts accrued, insurance coverage, recovery
    from customers or other indemnification arrangements, will not
    have a material adverse effect upon our future financial
    position.

Commitments

Commitments for construction and acquisition of property, plant
    and equipment are approximately $472 million at
    December 31, 2008.

Segment
    Disclosures

Our reportable segments are strategic business units that offer
    different products and services. The segments are managed
    separately because each segment requires different technology,
    marketing strategies and industry knowledge. Our master limited
    partnerships, Williams Partners L.P. and Williams Pipeline
    Partners L.P., are consolidated within our Midstream and Gas
    Pipeline segments, respectively. (See Note 1.) Other
    primarily consists of corporate operations.

Performance
    Measurement

We currently evaluate performance based on

segment profit
    (loss)

from operations, which includes

segment revenues

from external and internal customers,

segment costs and
    expenses, equity earnings (losses)

and

income (loss) from
    investments

. The accounting policies of the segments are the
    same as those described in Note 1. Intersegment sales are
    generally accounted for at current market prices as if the sales
    were to unaffiliated third parties.

The primary types of costs and operating expenses by segment can
    be generally summarized as follows:

•

Exploration & Production — depletion,
    depreciation and amortization, lease operating expenses and
    operating taxes;

•

Gas Pipeline — depreciation and operation and
    maintenance expenses;

•

Midstream Gas & Liquids — commodity
    purchases (primarily for NGL, crude and olefin marketing,
    shrink, feedstock and fuel), depreciation, and operation and
    maintenance expenses;

•

Gas Marketing Services — commodity purchases primarily
    in support of commodity marketing and risk management activities.

Energy commodity hedging by our business units may be done
    through intercompany derivatives with our Gas Marketing Services
    segment which, in turn, enters into offsetting derivative
    contracts with unrelated third parties. Gas Marketing Services
    bears the counterparty performance risks associated with the
    unrelated third parties in these transactions. Additionally,
    Exploration & Production may enter into transactions
    directly with third parties under their credit agreement. (See
    Note 11.) Exploration & Production bears the
    counterparty performance risks associated with the unrelated
    third parties in these transactions.

External revenues of our Exploration & Production
    segment include third-party oil and gas sales, which are more
    than offset by transportation expenses and royalties due third
    parties on intersegment sales.

(1)

The 2008 increase in Exploration & Production’s
    total assets is due to an increase in property, plant and
    equipment — net as a result of increased drilling
    activity.

(2)

The decrease in Gas Marketing Services’ total assets for
    2008 and 2007 is due primarily to the fluctuations in derivative
    assets as a result of the impact of changes in commodity prices
    on existing forward derivative contracts. Gas Marketing
    Services’ derivative assets are substantially offset by
    their derivative liabilities.

    Production reporting unit and excludes the $148 million
    gain on sale of a contractual right to a production payment on
    certain future international hydrocarbon production.

•

Prior period amounts have been adjusted to reflect the
    presentation of certain revenues and costs on a net basis. These
    adjustments reduced other revenues and reduced other expenses by
    the same amount, with no net impact on segment profit. The
    reductions were $72 million in 2007 and $77 million in
    2006.

•

Oil and gas revenues consist primarily of natural gas production
    sold to the Gas Marketing Services subsidiary and includes the
    impact of hedges, including intercompany hedges.

•

Other revenues and other expenses consist of activities within
    the Exploration & Production segment that are not a
    direct part of the producing activities. These nonproducing
    activities include acquisition and disposition of other working
    interest gas and the movement of gas from the wellhead to the
    tailgate of the respective plants for sale to the Gas Marketing
    Services subsidiary or third-party purchasers. In addition,
    other revenues include recognition of income from transactions
    which transferred certain nonoperating benefits to a third party.

The SEC defines proved oil and gas reserves

(Rule 4-10(a)

of

Regulation S-X)

as the estimated quantities of crude oil, natural gas, and
    natural gas liquids which geological and engineering data
    demonstrate with reasonable certainty are recoverable in future
    years from known reservoirs under existing economic and
    operating conditions. Our proved reserves consist of two
    categories, proved developed reserves and proved undeveloped
    reserves. Proved developed reserves are currently producing
    wells and wells awaiting minor sales connection expenditure,
    recompletion, additional perforations or borehole stimulation
    treatments. Proved undeveloped reserves are those reserves which
    are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage
    or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is
    required for recompletion. Proved reserves on undrilled acreage
    are limited to those drilling units offsetting productive units
    that are reasonably certain of production when drilled or where
    it can be demonstrated with certainty that there is continuity
    of production from the existing productive formation.

•

Approximately one-half of the revisions for 2008 relate to the
    impact of lower average year-end natural gas prices used in 2008
    compared to the prior year.

•

Natural gas reserves are computed at 14.73 pounds per square
    inch absolute and 60 degrees Fahrenheit. Crude oil reserves are
    insignificant and have been included in the proved reserves on a
    basis of billion cubic feet equivalents (Bcfe).

Standardized
    Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows Relating to Proved
    Oil and Gas Reserves

The following is based on the estimated quantities of proved
    reserves and the year-end prices and costs. The average year-end
    natural gas prices used in the following estimates were $4.41,
    $5.78, and $4.81 per MMcfe at December 31, 2008, 2007, and
    2006, respectively. Future income tax expenses have been
    computed considering available carry forwards and credits and
    the appropriate statutory tax rates. The discount rate of
    10 percent is as prescribed by SFAS No. 69.
    Continuation of year-end economic conditions also is assumed.
    The calculation is



THE
    WILLIAMS COMPANIES, INC.

SUPPLEMENTAL
    OIL AND GAS DISCLOSURES — (Continued)

(Unaudited)

based on estimates of proved reserves, which are revised over
    time as new data becomes available. Probable or possible
    reserves, which may become proved in the future, are not
    considered. The calculation also requires assumptions as to the
    timing of future production of proved reserves, and the timing
    and amount of future development and production costs. Of the
    $3,772 million of future development costs, approximately
    72 percent is estimated to be spent in 2009, 2010 and 2011.

Numerous uncertainties are inherent in estimating volumes and
    the value of proved reserves and in projecting future production
    rates and timing of development expenditures. Such reserve
    estimates are subject to change as additional information
    becomes available. The reserves actually recovered and the
    timing of production may be substantially different from the
    reserve estimates.

Item 9A.

Controls
    and Procedures

Disclosure
    Controls and Procedures

Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
    Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls
    and procedures (as defined in

Rules 13a-15(e)

and

15d-15(e)

of
    the Securities Exchange Act (Disclosure Controls) will prevent
    all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well
    conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not
    absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system
    are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect
    the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits
    of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because
    of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no
    evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all
    control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the
    company have been detected. These inherent limitations include
    the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty,
    and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or
    mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the
    individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more
    people, or by management override of the control. The design of
    any system of controls also is based in part upon certain
    assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can
    be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its
    stated goals under all potential future conditions. Because of
    the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system,
    misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be
    detected. We monitor our Disclosure Controls and make
    modifications as necessary; our intent in this regard is that
    the Disclosure Controls will be modified as systems change and
    conditions warrant.

An evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation
    of our Disclosure Controls was performed as of the end of the
    period covered by this report. This evaluation was performed
    under the supervision and with the participation of our
    management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
    Financial Officer. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief
    Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that
    these Disclosure Controls are effective at a reasonable
    assurance level.
