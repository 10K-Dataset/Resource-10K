GENERAL

We are a natural gas company originally incorporated under the
    laws of the state of Nevada in 1949 and reincorporated under the
    laws of the state of Delaware in 1987. We were founded in 1908
    when two Williams brothers began a construction company in
    Fort Smith, Arkansas.

We continue to use Economic Value
    Added

®

(EVA

®

)


as the basis for disciplined decision making around the use of
    capital.
    EVA

®

is a tool that considers both financial earnings and a cost of
    capital in measuring performance. It is based on the idea that
    earning profits from an economic perspective requires that a
    company cover not only all of its operating expenses but also
    all of its capital costs. The two main components of
    EVA

®

are net operating profit after taxes and a charge for the
    opportunity cost of capital. We derive these amounts by making
    various adjustments to our reported results and financial
    position, and by applying a cost of capital. We look for
    opportunities to improve
    EVA

®

because we believe there is a strong correlation between
    EVA

®

improvement and creation of shareholder value.

Today, we primarily find, produce, gather, process and transport
    natural gas. We also manage a wholesale power business. Our
    operations are concentrated in the Pacific Northwest, Rocky
    Mountains, Gulf Coast, Southern California and Eastern Seaboard.

In 2006 we focused on continued disciplined growth. During 2006
    we:

•

Continued to improve both
    EVA

®

and segment profit;

•

Invested in our natural gas businesses in a way that improves
    EVA

®

,
    meets customer needs, and enhances our competitive position;

•

Continued to increase natural gas production in a responsible
    manner;

•

Accelerated additional asset transactions between us and
    Williams Partners L.P., our master limited partnership;

    HIGHLIGHTS

In November 2005, we initiated an offer to convert our
    5.5 percent junior subordinated convertible debentures into
    our common stock. In January 2006, we converted approximately
    $220.2 million of the debentures in exchange for
    20.2 million shares of common stock, a $25.8 million
    cash premium, and $1.5 million of accrued interest.

In April 2006, Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corporation
    (Transco) issued $200 million aggregate principal amount of
    6.4 percent senior unsecured notes due 2016 to certain
    institutional investors in a private debt placement. In October
    2006, Transco completed an offer to exchange all of these notes
    for substantially identical notes registered under the
    Securities Act of 1933, as amended.

In April 2006, we retired a secured floating-rate term loan for
    $488.9 million, including outstanding principal and accrued
    interest. The loan was due in 2008 and secured by substantially
    all of the assets of Williams Production RMT Company. The loan
    was retired using a combination of cash and revolving credit
    borrowings.

In May 2006, we replaced our $1.275 billion secured
    revolving credit facility with a $1.5 billion unsecured
    revolving credit facility. The new facility contains similar
    terms and financial covenants as the secured facility, but
    contains certain additional restrictions. (See Note 11 of
    Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.)

In May 2006, our Board of Directors approved a regular quarterly
    dividend of 9 cents per share of common stock, which reflects an
    increase of 20 percent compared with the 7.5 cents per
    share paid in each of the three prior quarters.

In June 2006, Northwest Pipeline Corporation (Northwest
    Pipeline) issued $175 million aggregate principal amount of
    7 percent senior unsecured notes due 2016 to certain
    institutional investors in a private debt placement. In October
    2006, Northwest Pipeline Corporation completed an offer to
    exchange all of these notes for substantially identical notes
    registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.

In June 2006, we reached an

agreement-in-principle

to settle

class-action

securities litigation filed on behalf of purchasers of our
    securities between July 24, 2000, and July 22, 2002,
    for a total payment of $290 million to plaintiffs. We
    funded our $145 million portion of the settlement with

cash-on-hand

in November 2006, with the balance funded through insurance
    proceeds. We recorded a pre-tax charge for approximately
    $161 million in second-quarter 2006. This settlement did
    not have a material effect on our liquidity position. (See
    Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.)

In June 2006, Williams Partners L.P. acquired 25.1 percent
    of our interest in Williams Four Corners LLC for
    $360 million. The acquisition was completed after Williams
    Partners L.P. successfully closed a $150 million private
    debt offering of senior unsecured notes due 2011 and an equity
    offering of approximately $225 million in net proceeds. In
    December 2006, Williams Partners L.P. acquired the remaining
    74.9 percent interest in Williams Four Corners LLC for
    $1.223 billion. The acquisition was completed after
    Williams Partners L.P. successfully closed a $600 million
    private debt offering of senior unsecured notes due 2017, a
    private equity offering of approximately $350 million of
    common and Class B units, and a public equity offering of
    approximately $294 million in net proceeds. The debt and
    equity issued by Williams Partners L.P. is reported as a
    component of our consolidated debt balance and minority interest
    balance, respectively. Williams Four Corners LLC owns certain
    gathering, processing and treating assets in the San Juan
    Basin in Colorado and New Mexico.



On July 31, 2006, and August 1, 2006, we received a
    verdict in civil litigation related to a contractual dispute
    surrounding certain natural gas processing facilities known as
    Gulf Liquids. We recorded a pre-tax charge for approximately
    $88 million in second quarter 2006 related to this loss
    contingency. (See Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements.)

Northwest Pipeline and Transco have each filed a general rate
    case with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC).
    Northwest Pipeline reached a settlement in its pending rate
    case. The settlement is subject to FERC approval, which is
    expected by mid-2007. The new transportation and storage rates
    for both pipelines will be effective, subject to refund, in the
    first quarter of 2007.

In December 2006, Northwest Pipeline completed and placed into
    service its capacity replacement project in the state of
    Washington. The project involved abandoning 268 miles of

26-inch

pipeline and replacing it with approximately 80 miles of

36-inch

pipeline constructed in four sections along the same pipeline
    corridor. Additionally, Northwest Pipeline modified five
    existing compressor stations which created additional net
    horsepower.

Our property insurance coverage levels and premiums were revised
    during the second quarter of 2006. In general, our coverage
    levels have decreased while our premiums have increased. These
    changes reflect general trends in our industry due to
    hurricane-related damages in recent years.

BUSINESS
    SEGMENTS

Substantially all our operations are conducted through our
    subsidiaries. To achieve organizational and operating
    efficiencies, our activities are primarily operated through the
    following business segments:

•

Exploration & Production

— produces,
    develops and manages natural gas reserves primarily located in
    the Rocky Mountain and Mid-Continent regions of the United
    States and is comprised of several wholly owned and partially
    owned subsidiaries including Williams Production Company LLC and
    Williams Production RMT Company.

•

Gas Pipeline

— includes our interstate natural
    gas pipelines and pipeline joint venture investments organized
    under our wholly owned subsidiary, Williams Gas Pipeline
    Company, LLC.

•

Midstream Gas & Liquids

— includes our
    natural gas gathering, treating and processing business and is
    comprised of several wholly owned and partially owned
    subsidiaries including Williams Field Services Group LLC and
    Williams Natural Gas Liquids, Inc. Midstream also includes
    Williams Partners L.P., our master limited partnership formed in
    2005.

•

Power

— manages our wholesale power and natural
    gas commodity businesses through purchases, sales and other
    related transactions, under our wholly owned subsidiary Williams
    Power Company, Inc. and its subsidiaries.

•

Other

— primarily consists of corporate
    operations.  Other also includes our interest in
    Longhorn Partners Pipeline, L.P. (Longhorn).

This report is organized to reflect this structure.

Detailed discussion of each of our business segments follows.



Exploration &
    Production

Our Exploration & Production segment, which is
    comprised of several wholly owned and partially owned
    subsidiaries, including Williams Production Company LLC and
    Williams Production RMT Company (RMT), produces, develops, and
    manages natural gas reserves primarily located in the Rocky
    Mountain (primarily New Mexico, Wyoming and Colorado) and
    Mid-Continent (Oklahoma and Texas) regions of the United States.
    We specialize in natural gas production from tight-sands
    formations and coal bed methane reserves in the Piceance,
    San Juan, Powder River, Arkoma, Green River and
    Fort Worth basins. Over 99 percent of
    Exploration & Production’s domestic reserves are
    natural gas. Our Exploration & Production segment also
    has international oil and gas interests, which include a
    69 percent equity interest in Apco Argentina, Inc. (Apco
    Argentina), an oil and gas exploration and production company
    with operations in Argentina, and a four percent interest in
    Petrowayu S.A., a Venezuelan corporation that is the operator of
    a 100 percent interest in the La Concepcion block
    located in Western Venezuela.

Exploration & Production’s primary strategy is to
    utilize its expertise in the development of tight-sands, shale,
    and coal bed methane reserves. Exploration &
    Production’s current proved undeveloped and probable
    reserves provide us with strong capital investment opportunities
    for several years into the future. Exploration &
    Production’s goal is to drill its existing proved
    undeveloped reserves, which comprise over 47 percent of
    proved reserves and to drill in areas of probable reserves. In
    addition, Exploration & Production provides a
    significant amount of equity production that is gathered

and/or

processed by our Midstream facilities in the San Juan basin.

Information for our Exploration & Production segment
    relates only to domestic activity unless otherwise noted. We use
    the terms “gross” to refer to all wells or acreage in
    which we have at least a partial working interest and
    “net” to refer to our ownership represented by that
    working interest.

No major discovery or other favorable or adverse event has
    caused a significant change in estimated gas reserves since
    year-end 2006. We have not filed on a recurring basis estimates
    of our total proved net oil and gas reserves with any
    U.S. regulatory authority or agency other than the
    Department of Energy (DOE) and the SEC. The estimates furnished
    to the DOE have been consistent with those furnished to the SEC,
    although Exploration & Production has not yet filed any
    information with respect to its estimated total reserves at
    December 31, 2006, with the DOE. Certain estimates filed
    with the DOE may not necessarily be directly comparable due to
    special DOE reporting requirements, such as the requirement to
    report gross operated reserves only. The underlying estimated
    reserves for the DOE did not differ by more than five percent
    from the underlying estimated reserves utilized in preparing the
    estimated reserves reported to the SEC.



Approximately 98 percent of our year-end 2006 United States
    proved reserves estimates were audited in each separate basin by
    Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc. (NSAI). When
    compared on a

well-by-well

basis, some of our estimates are greater and some are less than
    the estimates of NSAI. However, in the opinion of NSAI, the
    estimates of our proved reserves are in the aggregate reasonable
    by basin and have been prepared in accordance with generally
    accepted petroleum engineering and evaluation principles. These
    principles are set forth in the Standards Pertaining to the
    Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserve Information
    promulgated by the Society of Petroleum Engineers. NSAI is
    satisfied with our methods and procedures in preparing the
    December 31, 2006 reserve estimates and saw nothing of an
    unusual nature that would cause NSAI to take exception with the
    estimates, in the aggregate, as prepared by us. Reserves
    estimates related to properties underlying the Williams Coal
    Seam Gas Royalty Trust which comprise another approximately two
    percent of our total U.S. proved reserves were prepared by
    Miller and Lents, LTD.

Oil and
    gas properties

Following is a discussion of our oil and gas properties for our
    significant areas.

Piceance
    basin

The Piceance basin is located in northwestern Colorado. In 2006,
    we drilled 494 gross wells of which we operate 477, and
    owned working interests in a total of 1,889 gross producing
    wells at year-end. We produced a net of approximately
    152 Bcfe of natural gas from the Piceance basin during
    2006. Our estimated proved reserves in this basin at year-end
    2006 were 2,469 Bcfe. The Piceance basin is our largest area of
    concentrated development comprising approximately
    67 percent of our proved reserves at December 31,
    2006. This area has approximately 1,500 undrilled proved
    locations in inventory. Within this basin, we are also the owner
    and operator of a natural gas gathering and processing system.
    In March 2005 we entered into a contract with
    Helmerich & Payne for the operation of 10 new
    FlexRig

®

drilling rigs, each for a term of three years. By December 2006,
    all 10 of these rigs were operating in the Piceance basin. We
    also have 15 rigs operating in the Piceance basin under contract
    with other vendors, for a total of 25 rigs operating in the
    Piceance basin by December 2006.

San
    Juan basin

The San Juan basin is located in northwest New Mexico and
    southwest Colorado. In 2006, we participated in the drilling of
    214 gross wells, of which we operate 56 and owned working
    interests in a total of 2,864 gross producing wells at
    year-end. We produced a net of approximately 56 Bcfe of
    natural gas from the San Juan basin during 2006. Our
    estimated proved reserves in the San Juan basin at year-end
    2006 were 614 Bcfe.

Powder
    River basin

The Powder River basin is located in northeast Wyoming. In 2006,
    we drilled 858 gross wells of which we operate 449, and
    owned working interests in a total of 4,454 gross producing
    wells at year-end. We produced a net of approximately
    52 Bcfe of natural gas from the Powder River basin during
    2006. Our estimated proved reserves in this basin at year-end
    2006 were 372 Bcfe. The Powder River basin comprises
    approximately 10 percent of our proved reserves at
    December 31, 2006. The Powder River basin includes large
    areas with multiple coal seam potential, targeting thick coal
    bed methane formations at shallow depths. We have a significant
    inventory of undrilled locations, providing long-term drilling
    opportunities.

Mid-Continent
    properties

The Mid-Continent properties are located in the southeastern
    Oklahoma portion of the Arkoma basin and the Barnett Shale in
    the Fort Worth basin of Texas. In 2006, we drilled
    112 gross wells, of which we operate 61 and owned working
    interests in a total of 475 gross producing wells at year-end.
    We produced a net of approximately 11 Bcfe of natural gas
    from the Mid-Continent in 2006. Our estimated proved reserves in
    the Arkoma and Fort Worth basins at year-end 2006 were
    167 Bcfe.



The following table summarizes our leased acreage as of
    December 31, 2006:

623,538

At December 31, 2006, we owned working interests in
    9,965 gross wells producing hydrocarbons (4,890 net).

Operating
    statistics

We focus on lower-risk development drilling. Our drilling
    success rate was 99 percent in 2006, 2005 and 2004. The
    following tables summarize domestic drilling activity by number
    and type of well for the periods indicated:

1,384


Substantially all our natural gas production is currently being
    sold to Power at prevailing market prices. Power then resells
    the majority of our production to unrelated third parties.
    Because we currently have a low-risk drilling program in proven
    basins, the main component of risk that we manage is price risk.
    We have recently entered into a five-year unsecured credit
    agreement with certain banks in order to reduce margin
    requirements related to our hedging activities as well as lower
    transaction fees. Margin requirements, if any, under this new
    facility are dependent on the level of hedging with the banks
    and on natural gas reserves value. Exploration &
    Production natural gas hedges for 2007 consist of derivative
    contracts with Power that hedge 172 BBtud in fixed price
    hedges (whole year) and approximately 270 BBtud in NYMEX and
    regional collars (whole year) for projected 2007 domestic
    natural gas production. Power then enters into offsetting
    derivative contracts with unrelated third parties. Our natural
    gas production hedges in 2006 consisted of 299 BBtud in fixed
    price hedges and 64 BBtud in NYMEX collars and an additional 50
    BBtud in regional collars. A collar is a financial instrument
    that sets a gas price floor and ceiling for a certain volume of
    natural gas. Hedging decisions are made considering the overall
    Williams commodity risk exposure and are not executed
    independently by Exploration & Production; there are
    gas purchase hedging contracts executed on behalf of other
    Williams entities which taken as a net position may counteract
    Exploration & Production gas sales hedging derivatives.

The following table summarizes our domestic sales and cost
    information for the years indicated:

Exploration & Production expanded its acreage position
    and purchased producing properties in the Fort Worth basin
    in north-central Texas through transactions totaling
    approximately $64 million.



Other
    information

In 1993, Exploration & Production conveyed a net
    profits interest in certain of its properties to the Williams
    Coal Seam Gas Royalty Trust. Substantially all of the production
    attributable to the properties conveyed to the trust was from
    the Fruitland coal formation and constituted coal seam gas. We
    subsequently sold trust units to the public in an underwritten
    public offering and retained 3,568,791 trust units then
    representing 36.8 percent of outstanding trust units. We
    have previously sold trust units on the open market, with our
    last sales in June 2005. As of February 1, 2007, we own
    789,291 trust units. We sold no additional trust units during
    2006.

International
    exploration and production interests

We also have investments in international oil and gas interests.
    If combined with our domestic proved reserves, our international
    interests would make up 4.2 percent of our total proved
    reserves.

Gas
    Pipeline

We own and operate, through Williams Gas Pipeline Company, LLC
    and its subsidiaries, a combined total of approximately
    14,400 miles of pipelines with a total annual throughput of
    approximately 2,500 trillion British Thermal Units of natural
    gas and

peak-day

delivery capacity of approximately 12 MMdt of gas. Gas
    Pipeline consists of Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corporation
    and Northwest Pipeline Corporation. Gas Pipeline also holds
    interests in joint venture interstate and intrastate natural gas
    pipeline systems including a 50 percent interest in
    Gulfstream Natural Gas System, L.L.C.

Transcontinental
    Gas Pipe Line Corporation (Transco)

Transco is an interstate natural gas transportation company that
    owns and operates a

10,500-mile

natural gas pipeline system extending from Texas, Louisiana,
    Mississippi and the offshore Gulf of Mexico through Alabama,
    Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, Virginia, Maryland,
    Pennsylvania, and New Jersey to the New York City metropolitan
    area. The system serves customers in Texas and 11 southeast and
    Atlantic seaboard states, including major metropolitan areas in
    Georgia, North Carolina, New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania.

Pipeline
    system and customers

At December 31, 2006, Transco’s system had a mainline
    delivery capacity of approximately 4.7 MMdt of natural gas
    per day from its production areas to its primary markets. Using
    its Leidy Line along with market-area storage and transportation
    capacity, Transco can deliver an additional 3.5 MMdt of
    natural gas per day for a system-wide delivery capacity total of
    approximately 8.2 MMdt of natural gas per day.
    Transco’s system includes 44 compressor stations, five
    underground storage fields, two liquefied natural gas (LNG)
    storage facilities. Compression facilities at a sea level-rated
    capacity total approximately 1.5 million horsepower.

Transco’s major natural gas transportation customers are
    public utilities and municipalities that provide service to
    residential, commercial, industrial and electric generation end
    users. Shippers on Transco’s system include public
    utilities, municipalities, intrastate pipelines, direct
    industrial users, electrical generators, gas marketers and
    producers. One customer accounted for approximately
    10 percent of Transco’s total revenues in 2006.
    Transco’s firm transportation agreements are generally
    long-term agreements with various expiration dates and account
    for the major portion of Transco’s business. Additionally,
    Transco offers storage services and interruptible transportation
    services under short-term agreements.

Transco has natural gas storage capacity in five underground
    storage fields located on or near its pipeline system or market
    areas and operates three of these storage fields. Transco also
    has storage capacity in an LNG storage facility and operates the
    facility. The total usable gas storage capacity available to
    Transco and its customers in such underground storage fields and
    LNG storage facility and through storage service contracts is
    approximately 216 billion cubic feet of gas. In addition,
    wholly owned subsidiaries of Transco operate and hold a
    35 percent ownership interest in Pine Needle LNG Company,
    LLC, an LNG storage facility with 4 billion cubic feet of
    storage capacity. Storage capacity permits Transco’s
    customers to inject gas into storage during the summer and
    off-peak periods for delivery during peak winter demand periods.



Transco
    expansion projects

Leidy
    to Long Island Expansion Project

The Leidy to Long Island Expansion Project will involve an
    expansion of Transco’s existing natural gas transmission
    system in Zone 6 from the Leidy Hub in Pennsylvania to Long
    Island, New York. The project will provide 100 Mdt/d of
    incremental firm transportation capacity, which has been fully
    subscribed by one shipper for a 20-year primary term. The
    project facilities will include pipeline looping in
    Pennsylvania, pipeline looping, replacement and a natural gas
    compressor facility in New Jersey and appurtenant facilities in
    New York. Transco expects that over three-quarters of the
    project expenditures will occur in 2007. Transco filed an
    application for FERC authorization of the project in December
    2005, which the FERC approved by order issued on May 18,
    2006. On October 20, 2006, Transco filed an application to
    amend the FERC authorizations to reflect Transco’s
    ownership of certain appurtenant facilities as part of the
    project and to adjust the cost of facilities and rates, which
    the FERC approved on January 11, 2007. The estimated
    capital cost of the project is approximately $141 million.
    The target in-service date for the project is November 1,
    2007.

Potomac
    Expansion Project

The Potomac Expansion Project will involve an expansion of
    Transco’s existing natural gas transmission system from
    receipt points in North Carolina to delivery points in the
    greater Baltimore and Washington, D.C. metropolitan areas.
    The project will provide 165 Mdt/d of incremental firm
    transportation capacity, which has been fully subscribed by
    shippers under long-term firm arrangements. The estimated
    capital cost of the project is approximately $74 million.
    On July 17, 2006, Transco filed an application for FERC
    approval of the project. The target in-service date for the
    project is November 1, 2007.

Sentinel
    Expansion Project

The Sentinel Expansion Project will involve an expansion of
    Transco’s existing natural gas transmission system from the
    Leidy Hub in Clinton County, Pennsylvania and from the Pleasant
    Valley Interconnection with Cove Point LNG in Fairfax County,
    Virginia to various delivery points requested by the shippers
    under the project. The project will provide 142 Mdt/d of
    incremental firm transportation capacity, which has been fully
    subscribed by the shippers under long-term firm arrangements.
    The project facilities will include pipeline looping in
    Pennsylvania and New Jersey and minor compressor station
    modifications. The estimated capital cost of the project
    excluding any customer meter station upgrades is approximately
    $140 million. In order to accommodate certain shippers,
    Transco is planning to place the incremental firm transportation
    capacity into service in two phases, the first phase commencing
    on November 1, 2008 for 67 Mdt/d of service and the second
    phase commencing on November 1, 2009 for an additional 75
    Mdt/d of service. The FERC has granted our request for a
    pre-application environmental review of the project, soliciting
    early input from citizens, governmental entities and other
    interested parties. Transco expects to file a formal application
    with the FERC in the second quarter of 2007.

Transco’s facilities are divided into eight rate zones.
    Five are located in the production area, and three are located
    in the market area. Long-haul transportation involves gas that
    Transco receives in one of the production-area zones and
    delivers to a market-area zone. Market-area transportation
    involves gas that Transco both receives and delivers within the
    market-area zones. Production-area transportation involves gas
    that Transco both receives and delivers within the
    production-area zones.

Northwest
    Pipeline Corporation (Northwest Pipeline)

Northwest Pipeline is an interstate natural gas transportation
    company that owns and operates a natural gas pipeline system
    extending from the San Juan basin in northwestern New
    Mexico and southwestern Colorado through Colorado, Utah,
    Wyoming, Idaho, Oregon and Washington to a point on the Canadian
    border near Sumas, Washington. Northwest Pipeline provides
    services for markets in California, New Mexico, Colorado, Utah,
    Nevada, Wyoming, Idaho, Oregon and Washington directly or
    indirectly through interconnections with other pipelines.

Pipeline
    system and customers

At December 31, 2006, Northwest Pipeline’s system,
    having long-term firm transportation agreements with peaking
    capacity of approximately 3.4 MMdt of natural gas per day,
    was composed of approximately 3,900 miles of mainline and
    lateral transmission pipelines and 41 transmission compressor
    stations having a combined sea level-rated capacity of
    approximately 473,000 horsepower.

In 2003, we experienced two breaks in a segment of one of our
    natural gas pipelines in western Washington. In response to
    these breaks, we received Corrective Action Orders from the
    Office of Pipeline Safety, elected to idle the pipeline segment
    until its integrity could be assured, and began the process of
    replacing the capacity served by the pipeline segment.

In September 2005 we received a FERC certificate authorizing us
    to construct and operate the “Capacity Replacement
    Project.” This project entailed the abandonment of
    approximately 268 miles of the existing

26-inch

pipeline, and the construction of approximately 80 miles of
    new

36-inch

pipeline and an additional 10,760 net horsepower of
    compression at two existing compressor stations. As of December
    2006, all of the facilities were placed in service, and
    abandonment of the

26-inch

pipeline was completed.

The rate case we filed on June 30, 2006 seeks to recover,
    among other things, the capitalized costs relating to the
    Capacity Replacement Project.

In 2006, Northwest Pipeline served a total of 141 transportation
    and storage customers. Transportation customers include
    distribution companies, municipalities, interstate and
    intrastate pipelines, gas marketers and direct industrial users.
    The two largest customers of Northwest Pipeline in 2006
    accounted for approximately 19.9 percent and
    10.9 percent, of its total operating revenues. No other
    customer accounted for more than 10 percent of Northwest
    Pipeline’s total operating revenues in 2006. Northwest
    Pipeline’s firm transportation agreements are



generally long-term agreements with various expiration dates and
    account for the major portion of Northwest Pipeline’s
    business. Additionally, Northwest Pipeline offers interruptible
    and short-term firm transportation service.

As a part of its transportation services, Northwest Pipeline
    utilizes underground storage facilities in Utah and Washington
    enabling it to balance daily receipts and deliveries. Northwest
    Pipeline also owns and operates an LNG storage facility in
    Washington that provides service for customers during a few days
    of extreme demands. These storage facilities have an aggregate
    firm delivery capacity of approximately 600 million cubic
    feet of gas per day.

Northwest
    Pipeline expansion projects

Parachute
    Lateral Project

In January 2006, we filed an application with the FERC to
    construct a

38-mile

lateral that would provide additional transportation capacity
    from the Parachute area to the Greasewood area in northwest
    Colorado. The planned lateral would increase capacity by 450
    Mdt/d through a

30-inch

diameter line and is estimated to cost $86 million. We
    anticipate beginning service on the expansion in March 2007.

Greasewood
    Lateral Project

In March 2006, we executed an agreement with a shipper for 200
    Mdt/d of capacity on a proposed new lateral to be constructed
    from the vicinity of Greasewood, Colorado, to our mainline
    system near Sands Springs, Colorado. On February 20, 2007,
    following a meeting with representatives of the shipper, we
    decided to postpone applying with the FERC for a certificate to
    construct the proposed Greasewood Lateral Project. We will be
    continuing to work with potential shippers to determine whether
    to proceed with the project at a future date.

    capacity.

Gulfstream
    Natural Gas System, L.L.C. (Gulfstream)

Gulfstream is a natural gas pipeline system extending from the
    Mobile Bay area in Alabama to markets in Florida. In December
    2001, Gulfstream filed an application with the FERC to allow
    Gulfstream to complete the construction of its approved
    facilities in phases. In May 2002, the first phase of the
    project was placed into service at a cost of approximately
    $1.5 billion. The second phase of the project was placed
    into service on February 1, 2005. The total capital cost of
    both phases of the project is approximately $1.7 billion.
    At December 31, 2006, our equity investment in Gulfstream
    was $387 million. Gas Pipeline and Spectra Energy (formerly
    known as Duke Energy), through their respective subsidiaries,
    each hold a 50 percent ownership interest in Gulfstream and
    provide operating services for Gulfstream.



Gulfstream
    expansion projects

Gulfstream has entered into a precedent agreement and a related
    firm transportation service agreement pursuant to which, subject
    to the receipt of all necessary regulatory approvals and other
    conditions precedent therein, we intend to extend the pipeline
    system into South Florida and fully subscribe the remaining 345
    Mdt/d of firm capacity on the existing pipeline system on a
    long-term basis. The estimated capital cost of this project is
    anticipated to be approximately $135 million. Gulfstream
    also has executed a precedent agreement and a related firm
    transportation service agreement pursuant to which, subject to
    the receipt of all necessary regulatory approvals and other
    conditions precedent therein, we intend to construct and fully
    subscribe on a long-term basis the first incremental expansion
    of Gulfstream’s mainline capacity, increasing the current
    mainline capacity of 1.1 MMdt/d to 1.255 MMdt/d. The
    project will include the construction of additional pipeline in
    Florida and the installation of new compression in Alabama and
    Florida. The estimated capital cost of this expansion is
    anticipated to be approximately $117 million. No
    significant increase in operations personnel is expected as a
    result of these two projects.

Midstream
    Gas & Liquids

Our Midstream segment, one of the nation’s largest natural
    gas gatherers and processors, has primary service areas
    concentrated in the major producing basins in Colorado, New
    Mexico, Wyoming, the Gulf of Mexico, Venezuela and western
    Canada. Midstream’s primary businesses — natural
    gas gathering, treating, and processing; natural gas liquids
    (NGL) fractionation, storage and transportation; and oil
    transportation — fall within the middle of the process
    of taking natural gas and crude oil from the wellhead to the
    consumer. NGLs, ethylene and propylene are extracted/produced at
    our plants, including our Canadian and Gulf Coast olefins
    plants. These products are used primarily for the manufacture of
    plastics, home heating and refinery feedstock.

Although most of our gas services are performed for a
    volumetric-based fee, a portion of our gas processing contracts
    are commodity-based and include two distinct types of commodity
    exposure. The first type includes “Keep Whole”
    processing contracts whereby we own the NGLs extracted and
    replace the lost heating value with natural gas. Under these
    contracts, we are exposed to the spread between NGLs and natural
    gas prices. The second type consists of “Percent of
    Liquids” contracts whereby we receive a portion of the
    extracted liquids with no direct exposure to the price of
    natural gas. Under these contracts, we are only exposed to NGL
    price movements.

Our Canadian and Gulf Liquids olefin facilities have commodity
    exposure. In Canada, we are exposed to the spread between the
    price for natural gas and the olefinic products we produce. In
    the Gulf Coast, our feedstock for the ethane cracker is ethane
    and propane; as a result, we are exposed to the price spread
    between ethane and propane and ethylene and propylene. In the
    Gulf Coast, we also purchase refinery grade propylene and
    fractionate it into polymer grade propylene and propane; as a
    result we are exposed to the price spread between those
    commodities.

Key variables for our business will continue to be:

•

retaining and attracting customers by continuing to provide
    reliable services;

•

revenue growth associated with additional infrastructure either
    completed or currently under construction;

•

disciplined growth in our core service areas;

•

prices impacting our commodity-based processing and olefin
    activities.

Domestic
    gathering and processing

We own

and/or

operate domestic gas gathering and processing assets primarily
    within the western states of Wyoming, Colorado and New Mexico,
    and the onshore and offshore shelf and deepwater areas in and
    around the Gulf Coast states of Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi
    and Alabama. These assets consist of approximately
    8,200 miles of gathering pipelines, nine processing plants
    (one partially owned) and five natural gas treating plants with
    a combined daily inlet capacity of nearly 6.2 billion cubic
    feet per day. Some of these assets are owned through our
    interest in Williams Partners L.P. (see Williams Partners L.P.
    section below).



Geographically, our Midstream natural gas assets are positioned
    to maximize commercial and operational synergies with our other
    assets. For example, most of our offshore gathering and
    processing assets attach and process or condition natural gas
    supplies delivered to the Transco pipeline. Also, our gathering
    and processing facilities in the San Juan basin handle
    about 85 percent of our Exploration & Production
    group’s wellhead production in this basin. Both our
    San Juan Basin and Southwest Wyoming systems deliver gas
    volumes into Northwest Pipeline’s interstate system.

In addition to these natural gas assets, we own and operate
    three crude oil pipelines totaling approximately 270 miles
    with a capacity of more than 300,000 barrels per day. This
    includes our Mountaineer, Alpine and BANJO crude oil pipeline
    systems in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico.

The BANJO oil pipeline and Seahawk gas pipeline run parallel and
    deliver production across two producer-owned spar-type floating
    production systems from the Kerr-McGee-operated Boomvang and
    Nansen field areas in the western Gulf of Mexico. These
    pipelines were placed in service on January 28, 2002.

Our 18 inch oil pipeline, Alpine, which became operational
    on December 14, 2003, is our second western gulf crude oil
    pipeline. The pipeline extends 96 miles from Garden Banks
    Block 668 in the central Gulf of Mexico to our
    shallow-water platform at Galveston Area Block A244. From this
    platform, the oil is delivered onshore through ExxonMobil’s
    Hoover Offshore Oil Pipeline System under a joint tariff
    agreement. This production is coming from the Gunnison field,
    which is located in 3,150 feet of water and operated by
    Kerr-McGee.

Our Devils Tower floating production system and associated
    pipelines were placed in service on May 5, 2004. Initially
    built to serve Dominion Exploration & Production’s
    Devils Tower field, the floating production system is located in
    Mississippi Canyon Block 773, approximately 150 miles
    south-southwest of Mobile, Alabama. During the fourth quarter of
    2005, the platform’s service expanded to include tie-backs
    of production from the Triton and Goldfinger fields in addition
    to the host Devils Tower field. Located in 5,610 feet of
    water, it is the world’s deepest dry tree spar. The
    platform, which is operated by Dominion on our behalf, is
    capable of producing 60 MMcf/d of natural gas and
    60 Mbbls/d of oil.

The Devils Tower project includes gas and oil pipelines. The

102-mile

Canyon Chief gas pipeline consists of

18-inch

diameter pipe. The

118-mile

Mountaineer oil pipeline is a combination of 18- and

20-inch

diameter pipe. The gas is delivered into Transco’s
    pipeline, and processed at our Mobile Bay plant to recover the
    NGLs. The oil is transported to ChevronTexaco’s Empire
    Terminal in Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana. These associated
    pipelines are significantly oversized relative to the Devils
    Tower spar top-side capacity.

Included in the natural gas assets listed above are the assets
    of Discovery Producer Services LLC and its subsidiary Discovery
    Gas Transmission Services LLC (Discovery). We own a partial
    interest in Discovery and operate its facilities.
    Discovery’s assets include a cryogenic natural gas
    processing plant near Larose, Louisiana, a natural gas liquids
    fractionator plant near Paradis, Louisiana and an offshore
    natural gas gathering and transportation system.

Gulf
    Coast petrochemical and olefins

We own a 5/12 interest in and are the operator for an ethane
    cracker at Geismar, Louisiana, with a total production capacity
    of 1.3 billion pounds per year of ethylene. We also own an
    ethane pipeline system in Louisiana. Our Gulf Liquids New River
    LLC (Gulf Liquids) business consists of a propylene splitter and
    its related pipeline system.

Canada

Our Canadian operations include an olefin liquids extraction
    plant located near Ft. McMurray, Alberta and an olefin
    fractionation facility near Edmonton, Alberta. Our facilities
    extract olefinic liquids from the off-gas produced from third
    party oil sands bitumen upgrading and then fractionate, treat,
    store, terminal and sell the propane, propylene, butane and
    condensate recovered from this process. We continue to be the
    only olefins fractionator in Western Canada and the only
    treater-processor of oil sands upgrader off-gas. These
    operations extract valuable petrochemical feedstocks from
    upgrader off-gas streams allowing the upgraders to burn cleaner
    natural gas streams



and reduce overall air emissions. The extraction plant has
    processing capacity in excess of 100 MMcf/d with the
    ability to recover in excess of 15 Mbbls/d of NGL products.

Venezuela

Our Venezuelan investments involve gas compression and gas
    processing and natural gas liquids fractionation operations. We
    own controlling interests and operate three gas compressor
    facilities which provide roughly 70 percent of the gas
    injections in eastern Venezuela. These facilities help stabilize
    the reservoir and enhance the recovery of crude oil by
    re-injecting natural gas at high pressures. We also own a
    49.25 percent interest in two 400 MMcf/d natural gas
    liquids extraction plants, a 50,000 barrels per day natural
    gas liquids fractionation plant and associated storage and
    refrigeration facilities.

Other

We own interests in

and/or

operate NGL fractionation and storage assets. These assets
    include two partially owned NGL fractionation facilities near
    Conway, Kansas and Baton Rouge, Louisiana that have a combined
    capacity in excess of 167,000 barrels per day. We also own
    approximately 20 million barrels of NGL storage capacity in
    central Kansas. Some of these assets are owned through our
    interest in Williams Partners L.P.

Williams
    Partners L.P.

Williams Partners L.P. (Williams Partners) was formed to engage
    in the business of gathering, transporting and processing
    natural gas and fractionating and storing NGLs. We own
    approximately 22.5 percent of Williams Partners. Williams
    Partners provides us with an acquisition currency that is
    expected to enable growth of our Midstream business. Williams
    Partners also creates a vehicle to monetize our qualifying
    assets. Such transactions, which are subject to approval by both
    our and Williams Partners’ general partner’s board of
    directors, allow us to retain control of the assets through our
    ownership interest in Williams Partners.

During 2006, Williams Partners L.P. acquired Williams Four
    Corners, LLC which includes a

3,500-mile

natural gas gathering system in the San Juan Basin in New
    Mexico and Colorado with capacity of nearly 2 billion cubic
    feet per day; the Ignacio natural gas processing plant in
    Colorado and the Kutz and Lybrook natural gas processing plants
    in New Mexico, which have a combined processing capacity of
    760 million cubic feet per day; and the Milagro and
    Esperanza natural gas treating plants in New Mexico, which are
    designed to remove carbon dioxide from up to 750 million
    cubic feet of natural gas per day.

In addition, Williams Partners owns a 40 percent equity
    investment in the Discovery gathering, transportation,
    processing and NGL fractionation system; the Carbonate Trend
    sour gas gathering pipeline; three integrated NGL storage
    facilities near Conway, Kansas; and a 50 percent interest
    in an NGL fractionator near Conway, Kansas.

Expansion
    projects

Gathering
    and processing

In May 2006, we entered into an agreement to develop new
    pipeline capacity for transporting natural gas liquids from
    production areas in southwestern Wyoming to central Kansas. The
    other party to the agreement reimbursed us for the development
    costs we incurred to date for the proposed pipeline and
    initially will own 99 percent of the pipeline, known as
    Overland Pass Pipeline Company, LLC. We retained a
    1 percent interest and have the option to increase our
    ownership to 50 percent and become the operator within two
    years of the pipeline becoming operational.

Start-up

is
    planned for early 2008. Additionally, we have agreed to dedicate
    our equity NGL volumes from our two Wyoming plants for transport
    under a long-term shipping agreement. The terms represent
    significant savings compared with the existing tariff and other
    alternatives considered.

We are constructing a fifth cryogenic processing train at our
    existing gas plant in Opal, Wyoming, which is scheduled for

start-up

in
    the first quarter of 2007. The expansion is designed to boost
    the plant’s processing capacity by more than
    30 percent to 1.45 billion cubic feet per day. Opal
    also will be able to recover a total of approximately
    67,000 barrels per day of natural gas liquids.



Gathering
    and processing — deepwater projects

The deepwater Gulf continues to be an attractive growth area for
    our Midstream business. Since 1997, we have invested almost
    $1 billion in new midstream assets in the Gulf of Mexico.
    These facilities provide both onshore and offshore services
    through pipelines, platforms and processing plants. The new
    facilities could also attract incremental gas volumes to
    Transco’s pipeline system in the southeastern United States.

Chevron and Kerr-McGee are dedicating to us the transport of
    production from their current and future ownership in a defined
    area surrounding the Blind Faith discovery in the deepwater Gulf
    of Mexico. To accommodate production from the Blind Faith
    acreage and the surrounding blocks, we have agreed to extend our
    Canyon Chief and Mountaineer pipelines to the producer-owned
    floating production facility. We expect to have the extensions
    ready for service in second quarter 2008. The approximately
    $200 million project will facilitate a

37-mile

extension of each pipeline. The agreement also creates
    opportunities for us to move natural gas from the Blind Faith
    discovery through our Mobile Bay, Alabama, processing plant and
    our Transco and Gulfstream interstate pipeline systems.
    Recovered natural gas liquids from Blind Faith also could be
    fractionated at our facilities in Baton Rouge or Paradis,
    Louisana.

Customers
    and operations

Our domestic gas gathering and processing customers are
    generally natural gas producers who have proved

and/or

producing natural gas fields in the areas surrounding our
    infrastructure. During 2006, these operations gathered and
    processed gas for approximately 220 gas gathering and processing
    customers. Our top three gathering and processing customers
    accounted for about 44 percent of our domestic gathering
    and processing revenue. Our gathering and processing agreements
    are generally long-term agreements.

In addition to our gathering and processing operations, we
    market NGLs and petrochemical products to a wide range of users
    in the energy and petrochemical industries. We provide these
    products to third parties from the production at our domestic
    facilities. The majority of domestic sales are based on supply
    contracts of less than one year in duration. The production from
    our Canadian facilities is marketed in Canada and in the United
    States.

Our Venezuelan assets were constructed and are currently
    operated for the exclusive benefit of Petróleos de
    Venezuela S.A. The significant contracts have a remaining term
    between 11 and 15 years and our revenues are based on a
    combination of fixed capital payments, throughput volumes, and,
    in the case of one of the gas compression facilities, a minimum
    throughput guarantee. The Venezuelan government has continued
    its public criticism of U.S. economic and political policy,
    has implemented unilateral changes to existing energy related
    contracts, and continues to publicly declare that additional
    energy contracts will be unilaterally amended and privately held
    assets will be expropriated, indicating that a level of
    political risk still remains.

Power

Our Power business buys, sells, stores and transports energy and
    energy-related commodities, primarily power and natural gas.
    Power’s focus is not only on its objective of maximizing
    expected cash flows, but also on executing new contracts to
    hedge its portfolio and providing services that support our
    natural gas businesses across Williams. Our contracts include
    physical forward purchases and sales, various financial
    instruments and structured transactions. Our financial
    instruments include exchange-traded futures, as well as
    exchange-traded and

over-the-counter

options and swaps. Structured transactions include tolling
    contracts, full requirements contracts, tolling resales and heat
    rate options.

Tolling contracts represent the most significant portion of our
    portfolio. Under the tolling contracts, we have the right to
    request a plant owner to convert our fuel (usually natural gas)
    to electricity in exchange for a fixed fee. We have the right to
    request approximately 7,700 megawatts of electricity under six
    tolling agreements. The table below lists the locations and
    available capacity of each of our tolling agreements. These
    capacity numbers are subject to change, and our contractual
    rights to capacity may not reflect actual availability at the
    plants.

We use portions of the electricity produced under the tolling
    agreements to supply obligations under various arrangements such
    as power sales, tolling resales, and full requirements
    contracts. Under full requirements contracts, we supply the
    electricity required by our counterparties to serve their
    customers. Through full requirements contracts, we supply
    approximately 600 to 1,500 megawatts of electricity to our
    customers in Georgia and approximately 515 to 600 megawatts of
    electricity to our customers in Pennsylvania. The amount of
    electricity we supply under these contracts varies year to year
    but is expected to grow annually. Each year, the amount of
    electricity we supply is subject to a growth cap.

Through tolling resale agreements, we enter into transactions
    that mirror, to varying degrees, some or all of our rights under
    our underlying tolling arrangements, which remain in place with
    our tolling counterparties. We have resold part of our rights
    (1,934 to 3,875 megawatts) under the California tolling
    arrangement to two counterparties for periods through 2011.
    These volumes include amounts sold under contracts executed in
    2007.

We also own two natural gas-fired electric generating plants
    located near Bloomfield, New Mexico (60 megawatts, Milagro
    facility) and in Hazleton, Pennsylvania (147 megawatts).

In 2006, we managed natural gas throughout North America with
    total physical volumes averaging 2.3 billion cubic feet per
    day. We use approximately 10 percent of this natural gas to
    fuel electric generating plants we own or in which we have
    contractual rights. We sell approximately 70 percent of
    this natural gas to customers including local distribution
    companies, utilities, producers, industrials and other gas
    marketers. With the remaining 20 percent, we procure gas
    supply for our Midstream operations.

In 2004, we substantially exited our crude oil and refined
    products activities.

Other

At December 31, 2004, we owned approximately
    94.7 percent of the Class B Interests and
    21.3 percent of the Common Interests in Longhorn Partners
    Pipeline LP (Longhorn), which owned a refined petroleum products
    pipeline from Houston, Texas to El Paso, Texas. The
    Class B Interests are preferred interests but subordinate
    to other preferred interests, and the Common Interests are
    subordinate to both.

During the first quarter of 2005, Longhorn became fully
    operational as deliveries commenced through both the Odessa and
    El Paso terminals. However, the pipeline’s throughput
    fell significantly short of management expectations. The primary
    driver behind this volume shortfall was the narrowing of the
    refined product pricing differentials between the Gulf Coast and
    El Paso markets. During the second quarter of 2005,
    Longhorn management indicated the shortfall was likely to
    continue and that the original business model was no longer
    feasible.

As a result of the

other-than-temporary

decline in fair value identified in the second quarter of 2005,
    we impaired the Common Interests by $16.2 million and the
    Class B shares by $32.7 million. After these
    adjustments, the book value of our investment in Longhorn (as of
    June 30, 2005) totaled $51.6 million, comprised
    of $25.0 million of Common Interests and $26.6 million
    of Class B shares.

During the third quarter of 2005, we provided $10 million
    of a $50 million fully collateralized bridge loan to fund
    operations of Longhorn until an economically feasible
    operational alternative was developed. In the fourth quarter of
    2005, management of Longhorn concluded that its best alternative
    would be to sell the Longhorn assets. Accordingly, they directed
    a financial advisor to solicit offers from several entities.
    After reviewing the terms and conditions of bids received, our
    management determined that a full impairment of our investment
    in the Class B and Common Interests was appropriate. This
    decision resulted in a December 31, 2005 write-down of the
    remaining $38.1 million in book value which had been
    further reduced by additional equity losses during the third and
    fourth quarters.

The management of Longhorn completed an installment sale of the
    pipeline during the third quarter of 2006, and as a result we
    received full payment of the $10 million secured bridge
    loan that we provided to Longhorn during 2005. It is uncertain
    whether we will ever receive any payments related to our
    Class B Interests or our Common



Interests, however any such amounts related to these fully
    impaired interests will only be recognized as income when
    received.

We continue to receive payments associated with the 2005
    transfer of the First Amended and Restated Pipeline Operating
    Services Agreement to a third party. The sale of the pipeline
    did not impact these ongoing payments which are recognized as
    income when received.

Additional
    business segment information

Our ongoing business segments are accounted for as continuing
    operations in the accompanying financial statements and notes to
    financial statements included in Part II.

Operations related to certain assets in “Discontinued
    Operations” sold in 2003 and 2004 have been reclassified
    from their traditional business segment to “Discontinued
    Operations” in the accompanying financial statements and
    notes to financial statements included in Part II.

Our corporate parent company performs certain management, legal,
    financial, tax, consultative, administrative and other services
    for our subsidiaries.

Our corporate parent company’s principal sources of cash
    are from external financings, dividends and advances from our
    subsidiaries, investments, payments by subsidiaries for services
    rendered, interest payments from subsidiaries on cash advances
    and net proceeds from asset sales. The amount of dividends
    available to us from subsidiaries largely depends upon each
    subsidiary’s earnings and operating capital requirements.
    The terms of certain of our subsidiaries’ borrowing
    arrangements limit the transfer of funds to our corporate parent.

We believe that we have adequate sources and availability of raw
    materials and commodities for existing and anticipated business
    needs. In support of our energy commodity activities, primarily
    conducted through Power, our counterparties require us to
    provide various forms of credit support such as margin, adequate
    assurance amounts and pre-payments for gas supplies. Our
    pipeline systems are all regulated in various ways resulting in
    the financial return on the investments made in the systems
    being limited to standards permitted by the regulatory agencies.
    Each of the pipeline systems has ongoing capital requirements
    for efficiency and mandatory improvements, with expansion
    opportunities also necessitating periodic capital outlays.

REGULATORY
    MATTERS

Exploration & Production.

Our
    Exploration & Production business is subject to various
    federal, state and local laws and regulations on taxation, the
    development, production and marketing of oil and gas, and
    environmental and safety matters. Many laws and regulations
    require drilling permits and govern the spacing of wells, rates
    of production, water discharge, prevention of waste and other
    matters. Such laws and regulations have increased the costs of
    planning, designing, drilling, installing, operating and
    abandoning our oil and gas wells and other facilities. In
    addition, these laws and regulations, and any others that are
    passed by the jurisdictions where we have production, could
    limit the total number of wells drilled or the allowable
    production from successful wells, which could limit our reserves.

Gas Pipeline.

Gas Pipeline’s interstate
    transmission and storage activities are subject to FERC
    regulation under the Natural Gas Act of 1938 (NGA) and under the
    Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978, and, as such, its rates and
    charges for the transportation of natural gas in interstate
    commerce, its accounting, and the extension, enlargement or
    abandonment of its jurisdictional facilities, among other
    things, are subject to regulation. Each gas pipeline company
    holds certificates of public convenience and necessity issued by
    the FERC authorizing ownership and operation of all pipelines,
    facilities and properties for which certificates are required
    under the NGA. Each gas pipeline company is also subject to the
    Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act of 1968, as amended, which
    regulates safety requirements in the design, construction,
    operation and maintenance of interstate natural gas transmission
    facilities. FERC Standards of Conduct govern how our interstate
    pipelines communicate and do business with their marketing
    affiliates. Among other things, the Standards of Conduct require
    that interstate pipelines not operate their systems to
    preferentially benefit their marketing affiliates.



Each of our interstate natural gas pipeline companies
    establishes its rates primarily through the FERC’s
    ratemaking process. Key determinants in the ratemaking process
    are:

•

costs of providing service, including depreciation expense;

•

allowed rate of return, including the equity component of the
    capital structure and related income taxes;

•

volume throughput assumptions.

The allowed rate of return is determined in each rate case. Rate
    design and the allocation of costs between the demand and
    commodity rates also impact profitability. As a result of these
    proceedings, certain revenues previously collected may be
    subject to refund.

Midstream.

For our Midstream segment, onshore
    gathering is subject to regulation by states in which we operate
    and offshore gathering is subject to the Outer Continental Shelf
    Lands Act (OCSLA). Of the states where Midstream gathers gas,
    currently only Texas actively regulates gathering activities.
    Texas regulates gathering primarily through complaint mechanisms
    under which the state commission may resolve disputes involving
    an individual gathering arrangement. Although gathering
    facilities located offshore are not subject to the NGA (although
    offshore transmission pipelines may be), some controversy exists
    as to how the FERC should determine whether offshore facilities
    function as gathering. These issues are currently before the
    FERC. Most gathering facilities offshore are subject to the
    OCSLA, which provides in part that outer continental shelf
    pipelines “must provide open and nondiscriminatory access
    to both owner and non-owner shippers.”

Midstream also owns and operates two offshore transmission
    pipelines that are regulated by the FERC because they are deemed
    to transport gas in interstate commerce. Black Marlin Pipeline
    Company provides transportation service for offshore Texas
    production in the High Island area and redelivers that gas to
    intrastate pipeline interconnects near Texas City. Discovery Gas
    Transmission LLC provides transportation service for offshore
    Louisiana production from the South Timbalier, Grand Isle, Ewing
    Bank and Green Canyon (deepwater) areas to an onshore processing
    facility and downstream interconnect points with major
    interstate pipelines. FERC regulation requires all terms and
    conditions of service, including the rates charged, to be filed
    with and approved by the Commission before any changes can go
    into effect. Currently, Black Marlin has a major rate change
    application pending before the Commission to increase its rates
    for service.

Our remaining Midstream Canadian assets are regulated by the
    Alberta Energy & Utilities Board (AEUB) and Alberta
    Environment. The regulatory system for the Alberta oil and gas
    industry incorporates a large measure of self-regulation,
    providing that licensed operators are held responsible for
    ensuring that their operations are conducted in accordance with
    all provincial regulatory requirements. For situations in which
    non-compliance with the applicable regulations is at issue, the
    AEUB and Alberta Environment have implemented an enforcement
    process with escalating consequences.

Power.

Our Power business is subject to a
    variety of laws and regulations at the local, state and federal
    levels, including FERC and the Commodity Futures Trading
    Commission regulation. In addition, electricity and natural gas
    markets in California and elsewhere continue to be subject to
    numerous and wide-ranging federal and state regulatory
    proceedings and investigations. We are also subject to various
    federal and state actions and investigations regarding, among
    other things, market structure, behavior of market participants,
    market prices, and reporting to trade publications. We may be
    liable for refunds and other damages and penalties as a result
    of ongoing actions and investigations. The outcome of these
    matters could affect our creditworthiness and ability to perform
    contractual obligations as well as other market
    participants’ creditworthiness and ability to perform
    contractual obligations to us.

See Note 15 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements for further details on our regulatory matters.

ENVIRONMENTAL
    MATTERS

Our generation facilities, natural gas pipelines, and
    exploration and production operations are subject to federal
    environmental laws and regulations as well as the state and
    tribal laws and regulations adopted by the jurisdictions in
    which we operate. We could incur liability to governments or
    third parties for any unlawful



discharge of oil, gas or other pollutants into the air, soil, or
    water, as well as liability for clean up costs. Materials could
    be released into the environment in several ways including, but
    not limited to:

•

from a well or drilling equipment at a drill site;

•

leakage from gathering systems, pipelines, transportation
    facilities and storage tanks;

•

damage to oil and gas wells resulting from accidents during
    normal operations;

•

blowouts, cratering and explosions.

Because the requirements imposed by environmental laws and
    regulations are frequently changed, we cannot assure you that
    laws and regulations enacted in the future, including changes to
    existing laws and regulations, will not adversely affect our
    business. In addition we may be liable for environmental damage
    caused by former operators of our properties.

We believe compliance with environmental laws and regulations
    will not have a material adverse effect on capital expenditures,
    earnings or competitive position. However, environmental laws
    and regulations could affect our business in various ways from
    time to time, including incurring capital and maintenance
    expenditures, imposing limitations on generation facility
    availability, fines and penalties, and creating the need to seek
    relief from the FERC for rate increases to recover the costs of
    certain capital expenditures and operation and maintenance
    expenses (which we believe would be granted).

For a discussion of specific environmental issues, see
    “Environmental” under Management’s Discussion and
    Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and
    “Environmental Matters” in Note 15 of our Notes
    to Consolidated Financial Statements.

COMPETITION

Exploration & Production.

Our
    Exploration & Production segment competes with other
    oil and gas concerns, including major and independent oil and
    gas companies in the development, production and marketing of
    natural gas. We compete in areas such as acquisition of oil and
    gas properties and obtaining necessary equipment, supplies and
    services. We also compete in recruiting and retaining skilled
    employees.

Gas Pipeline.

Our Gas Pipeline segment faces
    increased competition as a result of various actions taken by
    the FERC and several states in which we operate to strengthen
    market forces in the natural gas pipeline industry. In a number
    of key markets, interstate pipelines are now facing competitive
    pressures from other major pipeline systems, enabling local
    distribution companies and end users to choose a supplier or
    switch suppliers based on the short-term price of gas and the
    cost of transportation. We expect competition for natural gas
    transportation to continue to intensify in future years due to
    increased customer access to other pipelines, rates,
    competitiveness among pipelines, customers’ desire to have
    more than one transporter, shorter contract terms, regulatory
    developments, and development of LNG facilities particularly in
    our market areas. Future utilization of pipeline capacity will
    depend on competition from other pipelines and LNG facilities,
    use of alternative fuels, the general level of natural gas
    demand, and weather conditions.

Suppliers of natural gas are able to compete for any gas markets
    capable of being served by pipelines using nondiscriminatory
    transportation services provided by the pipeline companies. As
    the regulated environment has matured, many pipeline companies
    have faced reduced levels of subscribed capacity as contractual
    terms expire and customers opt to reduce firm capacity under
    contract in favor of alternative sources of transmission and
    related services. This situation, known in the industry as
    “capacity turnback,” is forcing the pipeline companies
    to evaluate the consequences of major demand reductions in
    traditional long-term contracts. It could also result in
    significant shifts in system utilization, and possible
    realignment of cost structure for remaining customers because
    all interstate natural gas pipeline companies continue to be
    authorized to charge maximum rates approved by the FERC on a
    cost of service basis. Gas Pipeline does not anticipate any
    significant financial impact from “capacity turnback.”
    We anticipate that we will be able to remarket most future
    capacity subject to future capacity turnback, although
    competition may cause some of the remarketed capacity to be sold
    at lower rates or for shorter terms.



Midstream.

In our Midstream segment, we face
    regional competition with varying competitive factors in each
    basin. Our gathering and processing business competes with other
    midstream companies, interstate and intrastate pipelines, master
    limited partnerships (MLP), producers and independent gatherers
    and processors. We primarily compete with five to ten companies
    across all basins in which we provide services. Numerous factors
    impact any given customer’s choice of a gathering or
    processing services provider, including rate, location, term,
    timeliness of well connections, pressure obligations and
    contract structure. We also compete in recruiting and retaining
    skilled employees. In 2005 we formed Williams Partners to help
    compete against other master limited partnerships for midstream
    projects. By virtue of the master limited partnership structure,
    Williams Partners provides us with an alternative and low-cost
    source of capital. We expect the alternative, low-cost capital
    will allow Williams Partners to compete with other MLPs when
    pursuing acquisition opportunities of gathering and processing
    assets.

Power.

In our Power segment, we compete
    directly with large independent energy marketers, marketing
    affiliates of regulated pipelines and utilities, and natural gas
    producers. We also compete with brokerage houses, energy hedge
    funds and other energy-based companies offering similar services.

EMPLOYEES

At February 1, 2007, we had approximately
    4,313 full-time employees including 972 at the corporate
    level, 584 at Exploration & Production, 1,694 at Gas
    Pipeline, 928 at Midstream, and 135 at Power. None of our
    employees are represented by unions or covered by collective
    bargaining agreements.

FORWARD-LOOKING
    STATEMENTS/RISK FACTORS AND CAUTIONARY STATEMENT

FOR PURPOSES OF THE “SAFE HARBOR” PROVISIONS OF

THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995

Certain matters contained in this report include
    “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of
    section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and
    Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
    amended. These statements discuss our expected future results
    based on current and pending business operations. We make those
    forward-looking statements in reliance on the safe harbor
    protections provided under the Private Securities Litigation
    Reform Act of 1995.

All statements, other than statements of historical facts,
    included in this report which address activities, events or
    developments that we expect, believe or anticipate will exist or
    may occur in the future, are forward-looking statements.
    Forward-looking statements can be identified by various forms of
    words such as “anticipates,” “believes,”
    “could,” “may,” “should,”
    “continues,” “estimates,”
    “expects,” “forecasts,” “might,”
    “planned,” “potential,”
    “projects,” “scheduled” or similar
    expressions. These forward-looking statements include, among
    others, statements regarding:

•

amounts and nature of future capital expenditures;

•

expansion and growth of our business and operations;

•

business strategy;



•

estimates of proved gas and oil reserves;

•

reserve potential;

•

development drilling potential;

•

cash flow from operations;

•

seasonality of certain business segments;

•

power, natural gas and natural gas liquids prices and demand.

Forward-looking statements are based on numerous assumptions,
    uncertainties and risks that could cause future events or
    results to be materially different from those stated or implied
    in this document. Many of the factors that will determine these
    results are beyond our ability to control or project. Specific
    factors which could cause actual results to differ from those in
    the forward-looking statements include:

•

availability of supplies (including the uncertainties inherent
    in assessing and estimating future natural gas reserves), market
    demand, volatility of prices, and increased costs of capital;

•

inflation, interest rates, fluctuation in foreign exchange, and
    general economic conditions;

•

the strength and financial resources of our competitors;

•

development of alternative energy sources;

•

the impact of operational and development hazards;

•

costs of, changes in, or the results of laws, government
    regulations including proposed climate change legislation,
    environmental liabilities, litigation, and rate proceedings;

•

changes in the current geopolitical situation;

•

risks related to strategy and financing, including restrictions
    stemming from our debt agreements and our lack of investment
    grade credit ratings;

•

risk associated with future weather conditions and acts of
    terrorism.

Given the uncertainties and risk factors that could cause our
    actual results to differ materially from those contained in any
    forward-looking statement, we caution investors not to unduly
    rely on our forward-looking statements. We disclaim any
    obligations to and do not intend to update the above list to
    announce publicly the result of any revisions to any of the
    forward-looking statements to reflect future events or
    developments.

In addition to causing our actual results to differ, the factors
    listed above and referred to below may cause our intentions to
    change from those statements of intention set forth in this
    report. Such changes in our intentions may also cause our
    results to differ. We may change our intentions, at any time and
    without notice, based upon changes in such factors, our
    assumptions, or otherwise.

Because forward-looking statements involve risks and
    uncertainties, we caution that there are important factors, in
    additions to those listed above, that may cause actual results
    to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking
    statements. These factors include the following:

RISK
    FACTORS

You should carefully consider the following risk factors in
    addition to the other information in this report. Each of these
    factors could adversely affect our business, operating results,
    and financial condition as well as adversely affect the value of
    an investment in our securities.



Risks
    Inherent to our Industry and Business

The
    long-term financial condition of our natural gas transmission
    and midstream businesses is dependent on the continued
    availability of natural gas supplies in the supply basins that
    we access, demand for those supplies in our traditional markets,
    and market demand for natural gas.

The development of the additional natural gas reserves that are
    essential for our gas transmission and midstream businesses to
    thrive requires significant capital expenditures by others for
    exploration and development drilling and the installation of
    production, gathering, storage, transportation and other
    facilities that permit natural gas to be produced and delivered
    to our pipeline systems. Low prices for natural gas, regulatory
    limitations, or the lack of available capital for these projects
    could adversely affect the development and production of
    additional reserves, as well as gathering, storage, pipeline
    transmission and import and export of natural gas supplies,
    adversely impacting our ability to fill the capacities of our
    gathering, transmission and processing facilities. Additionally,
    in some cases, new LNG import facilities built near our markets
    could result in less demand for our gathering and transmission
    facilities.

Estimating
    reserves and future net revenues involves uncertainties.
    Negative revisions to reserve estimates and oil and gas price
    declines may lead to decreased earnings, losses or impairment of
    oil and gas assets.

Reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating
    underground accumulations of oil and gas that cannot be measured
    in an exact manner. Reserves that are “proved
    reserves” are those estimated quantities of crude oil,
    natural gas, and natural gas liquids that geological and
    engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty are
    recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing
    economic and operating conditions, but should not be considered
    as a guarantee of results for future drilling projects.

The process relies on interpretations of available geological,
    geophysical, engineering and production data. There are numerous
    uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved
    reserves and in projecting future rates of production and timing
    of developmental expenditures, including many factors beyond the
    control of the producer. The reserve data included in this
    report represent estimates. In addition, the estimates of future
    net revenues from our proved reserves and the present value of
    such estimates are based upon certain assumptions about future
    production levels, prices and costs that may not prove to be
    correct over time.

Quantities of proved reserves are estimated based on economic
    conditions in existence during the period of assessment. Lower
    oil and gas prices may have the impact of shortening the
    economic lives of certain fields because it becomes uneconomic
    to produce all recoverable reserves on such fields, which
    reduces proved property reserve estimates.

If negative revisions in the estimated quantities of proved
    reserves were to occur, it would have the effect of increasing
    the rates of depreciation, depletion and amortization on the
    affected properties, which would decrease earnings or result in
    losses through higher depreciation, depletion and amortization
    expense. The revisions may also be sufficient to trigger
    impairment losses on certain properties which would result in a
    further non-cash charge to earnings. The revisions could also
    possibly affect the evaluation of Exploration &
    Production’s goodwill for impairment purposes.

Our
    past success rate for drilling projects and the historic
    performance of our exploration and production business is no
    predictor of future performance.

Our past success rate for drilling projects in 2006 should not
    be considered a predictor of future performance.

Performance of our exploration and production business is
    affected in part by factors beyond our control (any of which
    could cause the results of this business to decrease
    materially), such as:

•

regulations and regulatory approvals;

•

availability of capital for drilling projects which may be
    affected by other risk factors discussed in this report;

•

cost-effective availability of drilling rigs and necessary
    equipment;



•

availability of skilled labor;

•

availability of cost-effective transportation for products;

•

market risks (including price risks and competition) discussed
    in this report.

Our
    drilling, production, gathering, processing and transporting
    activities involve numerous risks that might result in
    accidents, and other operating risks and hazards.

Our operations are subject to all the risks and hazards
    typically associated with the development and exploration for,
    and the production and transportation of oil and gas. These
    operating risks include, but are not limited to:

•

blowouts, cratering and explosions;

•

uncontrollable flows of oil, natural gas or well fluids;

•

fires;

•

formations with abnormal pressures;

•

pollution and other environmental risks;

•

natural disasters.

In addition, there are inherent in our gas gathering, processing
    and transporting properties a variety of hazards and operating
    risks, such as leaks, spills, explosions and mechanical problems
    that could cause substantial financial losses. In addition,
    these risks could result in loss of human life, significant
    damage to property, environmental pollution, impairment of our
    operations and substantial losses to us. In accordance with
    customary industry practice, we maintain insurance against some,
    but not all, of these risks and losses, and only at levels we
    believe to be appropriate. The location of certain segments of
    our pipelines in or near populated areas, including residential
    areas, commercial business centers and industrial sites, could
    increase the level of damages resulting from these risks. In
    spite of our precautions, an event could cause considerable harm
    to people or property, and could have a material adverse effect
    on our financial condition and results of operations,
    particularly if the event is not fully covered by insurance.
    Accidents or other operating risks could further result in loss
    of service available to our customers. Such circumstances could
    materially impact our ability to meet contractual obligations
    and retain customers, with a resulting impact on our results of
    operations.

Costs
    of environmental liabilities and complying with existing and
    future environmental regulations could exceed our current
    expectations.

Our operations are subject to extensive environmental regulation
    pursuant to a variety of federal, provincial, state and
    municipal laws and regulations. Such laws and regulations
    impose, among other things, restrictions, liabilities and
    obligations in connection with the generation, handling, use,
    storage, extraction, transportation, treatment and disposal of
    hazardous substances and wastes, in connection with spills,
    releases and emissions of various substances into the
    environment, and in connection with the operation, maintenance,
    abandonment and reclamation of our facilities.

Compliance with environmental laws requires significant
    expenditures, including for clean up costs and damages arising
    out of contaminated properties. In addition, the possible
    failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations might
    result in the imposition of fines and penalties. We are
    generally responsible for all liabilities associated with the
    environmental condition of our facilities and assets, whether
    acquired or developed, regardless of when the liabilities arose
    and whether they are known or unknown. In connection with
    certain acquisitions and divestitures, we could acquire, or be
    required to provide indemnification against, environmental
    liabilities that could expose us to material losses, which may
    not be covered by insurance. In addition, the steps we could be
    required to take to bring certain facilities into compliance
    could be prohibitively expensive, and we might be required to
    shut down, divest or alter the operation of those facilities,
    which might cause us to incur losses. Although we do not expect
    that the costs of complying with current environmental laws will
    have a material adverse effect on



our financial condition or results of operations, no assurance
    can be given that the costs of complying with environmental laws
    in the future will not have such an effect.

We make assumptions and develop expectations about possible
    expenditures related to environmental conditions based on
    current laws and regulations and current interpretations of
    those laws and regulations. If the interpretation of laws or
    regulations, or the laws and regulations themselves, change, our
    assumptions may change. Our regulatory rate structure and our
    contracts with customers might not necessarily allow us to
    recover capital costs we incur to comply with the new
    environmental regulations. Also, we might not be able to obtain
    or maintain from time to time all required environmental
    regulatory approvals for certain development projects. If there
    is a delay in obtaining any required environmental regulatory
    approvals or if we fail to obtain and comply with them, the
    operation of our facilities could be prevented or become subject
    to additional costs, resulting in potentially material adverse
    consequences to our results of operations.

Our
    operating results for certain segments of our business might
    fluctuate on a seasonal and quarterly basis.

Revenues from certain segments of our business, including gas
    transmission and the sale of electric power, can have seasonal
    characteristics. In many parts of the country, demand for power
    peaks during the summer months, with market prices also peaking
    at that time. In other areas, demand for power peaks during the
    winter. In addition, demand for natural gas and other fuels
    peaks during the winter. As a result, our overall operating
    results in the future might fluctuate substantially on a
    seasonal basis. Demand for natural gas and other fuels could
    vary significantly from our expectations depending on the nature
    and location of our facilities and pipeline systems and the
    terms of our power sale agreements and natural gas transmission
    arrangements relative to demand created by unusual weather
    patterns. Additionally, changes in the price of natural gas
    could benefit one of our business units, but disadvantage
    another. For example, our Exploration & Production
    business may benefit from higher natural gas prices, and Power,
    which uses gas as a fuel source, may not.

Risks
    Related to the Current Geopolitical Situation

Our
    investments and projects located outside of the United States
    expose us to risks related to the laws of other countries, and
    the taxes, economic conditions, fluctuations in currency rates,
    political conditions and policies of foreign governments. These
    risks might delay or reduce our realization of value from our
    international projects.

We currently own and might acquire

and/or

dispose of material energy-related investments and projects
    outside the United States. The economic and political conditions
    in certain countries where we have interests or in which we
    might explore development, acquisition or investment
    opportunities present risks of delays in construction and
    interruption of business, as well as risks of war,
    expropriation, nationalization, renegotiation, trade sanctions
    or nullification of existing contracts and changes in law or tax
    policy, that are greater than in the United States. The
    uncertainty of the legal environment in certain foreign
    countries in which we develop or acquire projects or make
    investments could make it more difficult to obtain non-recourse
    project financing or other financing on suitable terms, could
    adversely affect the ability of certain customers to honor their
    obligations with respect to such projects or investments and
    could impair our ability to enforce our rights under agreements
    relating to such projects or investments. Recent events in
    certain South American countries, particularly the proposed
    nationalization of certain energy-related assets in Venezuela,
    could have a material negative impact on our results of
    operations. We may not receive adequate compensation, or any
    compensation, if our assets in Venezuela are nationalized.

Operations and investments in foreign countries also can present
    currency exchange rate and convertibility, inflation and
    repatriation risk. In certain situations under which we develop
    or acquire projects or make investments, economic and monetary
    conditions and other factors could affect our ability to convert
    to U.S. dollars our earnings denominated in foreign
    currencies. In addition, risk from fluctuations in currency
    exchange rates can arise when our foreign subsidiaries expend or
    borrow funds in one type of currency, but receive revenue in
    another. In such cases, an adverse change in exchange rates can
    reduce our ability to meet expenses, including debt service
    obligations. Foreign currency risk can also arise when the
    revenues received by our foreign subsidiaries are not in
    U.S. dollars. In such cases, a strengthening of the
    U.S. dollar or a weakening of the foreign currency could
    reduce the amount of



cash and income we receive from these foreign subsidiaries. We
    have put contracts in place designed to mitigate our most
    significant foreign currency exchange risks. We have some
    exposures that are not hedged and which could result in losses
    or volatility in our results of operations.

Risks
    Related to Strategy and Financing

Our
    debt agreements impose restrictions on us that may adversely
    affect our ability to operate our business.

Certain of our debt agreements contain covenants that restrict
    or limit among other things, our ability to create liens, sell
    assets, make certain distributions, repurchase equity and incur
    additional debt. In addition, our debt agreements contain, and
    those we enter into in the future may contain, financial
    covenants and other limitations with which we will need to
    comply. Our ability to comply with these covenants may be
    affected by many events beyond our control, and we cannot assure
    you that our future operating results will be sufficient to
    comply with the covenants or, in the event of a default under
    any of our debt agreements, to remedy that default.

Our failure to comply with the covenants in our debt agreements
    and other related transactional documents could result in events
    of default. Upon the occurrence of such an event of default, the
    lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under a
    particular facility to be immediately due and payable and
    terminate all commitments, if any, to extend further credit. An
    event of default or an acceleration under one debt agreement
    could cause a cross-default or cross-acceleration of another
    debt agreement. Such a cross-default or cross-acceleration could
    have a wider impact on our liquidity than might otherwise arise
    from a default or acceleration of a single debt instrument. If
    an event of default occurs, or if other debt agreements
    cross-default, and the lenders under the affected debt
    agreements accelerate the maturity of any loans or other debt
    outstanding to us, we may not have sufficient liquidity to repay
    amounts outstanding under such debt agreements.

Our
    lack of investment grade credit ratings increases our costs of
    doing business in certain ways and attainment of an investment
    grade rating is within the control of independent third
    parties.

Because we do not have an investment grade credit rating, our
    transactions in each of our businesses require greater credit
    assurances, both to be given from, and received by, us to
    satisfy credit support requirements. In addition, we are more
    vulnerable to the impact of market disruptions or a further
    downgrade of our credit rating that might further increase our
    cost of borrowing or further impair our ability to access
    capital markets. Such disruptions could include:

•

economic downturns;

•

deteriorating capital market conditions generally;

•

declining market prices for electricity and natural gas;

•

terrorist attacks or threatened attacks on our facilities or
    those of other energy companies;

•

the overall health of the energy industry, including the
    bankruptcy or insolvency of other companies.

Credit rating agencies perform independent analysis when
    assigning credit ratings. Given the significant changes in
    capital markets and the energy industry over the last few years,
    credit rating agencies continue to review the criteria for
    attaining investment grade ratings and make changes to those
    criteria from time to time. Our goal is to attain investment
    grade ratios. However, there is no guarantee that the credit
    rating agencies will assign us investment grade ratings even if
    we meet or exceed their criteria for investment grade ratios.

Long-term
    power generation purchase contracts without corresponding
    long-term purchase sale contracts might expose us to
    fluctuations in the wholesale power markets and negatively
    affect our results of operations.

We have entered into agreements with certain power generation
    facilities to purchase all or a substantial portion of their
    generation capacity. These facilities operate as
    “merchant” facilities, many without corresponding
    long-term power sales agreements, and therefore are exposed to
    market fluctuations. Without the benefit of such



long-term power sales agreements, we cannot be sure that we will
    be able to sell any or all of the power generated by these
    facilities at commercially attractive rates or that these power
    generation relationships will be profitable.

We sell all or a portion of the energy, capacity and other
    products from certain generation facilities to wholesale power
    markets, including energy markets operated by independent system
    operators, or ISOs, or regional transmission organizations, or
    RTOs, as well as wholesale purchasers. We are not subject to
    traditional cost-based regulation, therefore we sell electric
    generation capacity, power and ancillary services to wholesale
    purchasers at prices determined by the market. As a result, we
    are not guaranteed any rate of return on our capital investments
    through mandated rates, and our revenues and results of
    operations depend upon current and forward market prices for
    power.

Prices
    for electricity, natural gas liquids, natural gas and other
    commodities are volatile and this volatility could adversely
    affect our financial results, cash flows, access to capital and
    ability to maintain existing businesses.

Our revenues, operating results, future rate of growth and the
    value of our power and gas businesses depend primarily upon the
    prices we receive for electricity, natural gas liquids, natural
    gas, or other commodities, and the differences between prices of
    these commodities. Prices also affect the amount of cash flow
    available for capital expenditures and our ability to borrow
    money or raise additional capital. In particular, market prices
    for power, generation capacity and ancillary services tend to
    fluctuate substantially. Unlike other commodities, electricity
    can only be stored on a very limited basis and generally must be
    produced concurrently with its use. As a result, market prices
    for electricity are subject to significant volatility from
    supply and demand imbalances, especially in the day-ahead and
    spot markets.

The markets for electricity, natural gas liquids, and natural
    gas are likely to continue to be volatile. Wide fluctuations in
    prices might result from relatively minor changes in the supply
    of and demand for these commodities, market uncertainty and
    other factors that are beyond our control, including:

•

worldwide and domestic supplies of and demand for electricity,
    natural gas, petroleum, and related commodities;

•

turmoil in the Middle East and other producing regions;

•

terrorist attacks on production or transportation assets;

•

weather conditions;

•

the level of consumer demand;

•

the development of federal and state power markets, including
    actions of ISOs and RTOs;

•

the price and availability of other types of fuels;

•

the availability of pipeline capacity;

•

supply disruptions, including plant outages and transmission
    disruptions;

•

the price and level of foreign imports;

•

domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes;

•

volatility in the natural gas markets;

•

the overall economic environment;

•

the credit of participants in the markets where products are
    bought and sold.

We
    might not be able to successfully manage the risks associated
    with selling and marketing products in the wholesale energy
    markets.

Our portfolio of derivative and other energy contracts consists
    of wholesale contracts to buy and sell commodities, including
    contracts for electricity, natural gas, natural gas liquids and
    other commodities that are



settled by the delivery of the commodity or cash throughout the
    United States. If the values of these contracts change in a
    direction or manner that we do not anticipate or cannot manage,
    it could negatively affect our results of operations. In the
    past, certain marketing and trading companies have experienced
    severe financial problems due to price volatility in the energy
    commodity markets. In certain instances this volatility has
    caused companies to be unable to deliver energy commodities that
    they had guaranteed under contract. If such a delivery failure
    were to occur in one of our contracts, we might incur additional
    losses to the extent of amounts, if any, already paid to, or
    received from, counterparties. In addition, in our businesses,
    we often extend credit to our counterparties. Despite performing
    credit analysis prior to extending credit, we are exposed to the
    risk that we might not be able to collect amounts owed to us. If
    the counterparty to such a financing transaction fails to
    perform and any collateral that secures our counterparty’s
    obligation is inadequate, we will suffer a loss.

If we are unable to perform under our energy agreements, we
    could be required to pay damages. These damages generally would
    be based on the difference between the market price to acquire
    replacement energy or energy services and the relevant contract
    price. Depending on price volatility in the wholesale energy
    markets, such damages could be significant.

Risks
    Related to Regulations that Affect our Industry

Our
    natural gas sales, transmission, and storage operations are
    subject to government regulations and rate proceedings that
    could have an adverse impact on our results of
    operations.

Our interstate natural gas sales, transmission, and storage
    operations conducted through our Gas Pipelines business are
    subject to the FERC’s rules and regulations in accordance
    with the Natural Gas Act of 1938 and the Natural Gas Policy Act
    of 1978. The FERC’s regulatory authority extends to:

•

transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate
    commerce;

•

rates and charges;

•

construction;

•

acquisition, extension or abandonment of services or facilities;

•

accounts and records;

•

depreciation and amortization policies;

•

operating terms and conditions of service.

Regulatory actions in these areas can affect our business in
    many ways, including decreasing tariff rates and revenues,
    decreasing volumes in our pipelines, increasing our costs and
    otherwise altering the profitability of our business.

The FERC has taken certain actions to strengthen market forces
    in the natural gas pipeline industry that have led to increased
    competition throughout the industry. In a number of key markets,
    interstate pipelines are now facing competitive pressure from
    other major pipeline systems, enabling local distribution
    companies and end users to choose a transmission provider based
    on considerations other than location.

Competition
    in the markets in which we operate may adversely affect our
    results of operations.

We have numerous competitors in all aspects of our businesses,
    and additional competitors may enter our markets. Other
    companies with which we compete may be able to respond more
    quickly to new laws or regulations or emerging technologies, or
    to devote greater resources to the construction, expansion or
    refurbishment of their facilities than we can. In addition,
    current or potential competitors may make strategic acquisitions
    or have greater financial resources than we do, which could
    affect our ability to make investments or acquisitions. There
    can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully
    against current and future competitors and any failure to do so
    could have a material adverse effect on our businesses and
    results of operations.



Expiration
    of firm transportation agreements.

A substantial portion of the operating revenues of our Gas
    Pipelines are generated through firm transportation agreements
    that expire periodically and must be renegotiated and extended
    or replaced. We cannot give any assurance as to whether any of
    these agreements will be extended or replaced or that the terms
    of any renegotiated agreements will be as favorable as the
    existing agreements. Upon the expiration of these agreements,
    should customers turn back or substantially reduce their
    commitments, we could experience a negative effect to our
    results of operations.

Our
    revenues might decrease if we are unable to gain adequate,
    reliable and affordable access to transmission and distribution
    assets due to regulation by the FERC and regional authorities of
    wholesale market transactions for electricity and natural
    gas.

We depend on transmission and distribution facilities owned and
    operated by utilities and other energy companies to deliver the
    electricity and natural gas we buy and sell in the wholesale
    market. If transmission is disrupted, if capacity is inadequate,
    or if credit requirements or rates of such utilities or energy
    companies are increased, our ability to sell and deliver
    products might be hindered. The FERC has issued power
    transmission regulations that require wholesale electric
    transmission services to be offered on an open-access,
    non-discriminatory basis. Although these regulations are
    designed to encourage competition in wholesale market
    transactions for electricity, some companies may fail to provide
    fair and equal access to their transmission systems or may not
    provide sufficient transmission capacity to enable other
    companies to transmit electric power.

In addition, the independent system operators who oversee the
    transmission systems in regional power markets, such as
    California, have in the past been authorized to impose, and
    might continue to impose, price limitations and other mechanisms
    to address volatility in the power markets. These types of price
    limitations and other mechanisms might adversely impact the
    profitability of our wholesale power marketing and trading.
    Given the extreme volatility and lack of meaningful long-term
    price history in many of these markets and the imposition of
    price limitations by regulators, ISOs, RTOs or other marker
    operators, we can offer no assurance that we will be able to
    operate profitably in all wholesale power markets or that our
    results of operations will not be adversely affected by the
    actions of these parties.

Our
    businesses are subject to complex government regulations. The
    operation of our businesses might be adversely affected by
    changes in these regulations or in their interpretation or
    implementation.

Existing regulations might be revised or reinterpreted, new laws
    and regulations might be adopted or become applicable to us or
    our facilities, and future changes in laws and regulations might
    have a detrimental effect on our business. Over the past few
    years, certain restructured energy markets have experienced
    supply problems and price volatility. In some of these markets,
    proposals have been made by governmental agencies and other
    interested parties to re-regulate areas of these markets which
    have previously been deregulated. Various forms of market
    controls and limitations including price caps and bid caps have
    already been implemented and new controls and market
    restructuring proposals are in various stages of development,
    consideration and implementation. We cannot assure you that
    changes in market structure and regulation will not adversely
    affect our business and results of operations. We also cannot
    assure you that other proposals to re-regulate will not be made
    or that legislative or other attention to these restructured
    energy markets will not cause the deregulation process to be
    delayed or reversed or otherwise adversely affect our business
    and results of operations.

The
    outcome of pending rate cases to set the rates we can charge
    customers on certain of our pipelines might result in rates that
    do not provide an adequate return on the capital we have
    invested in those pipelines.

We have filed rate cases with the FERC to request changes to the
    rates we charge on Northwest Pipeline and Transco. Although we
    have a pending settlement of our Northwest Pipeline rate case,
    we must still obtain approval of the settlement. Therefore, the
    outcome of both rate cases remains uncertain. There is a risk
    that rates set by the FERC will be lower than is necessary to
    provide us with an adequate return on the capital we have
    invested in these



assets. There is also the risk that higher rates will cause our
    customers to look for alternative ways to transport their
    natural gas.

Legal
    and regulatory proceedings and investigations relating to the
    energy industry and capital markets have adversely affected our
    business and may continue to do so.

Public and regulatory scrutiny of the energy industry and of the
    capital markets has resulted in increased regulation being
    either proposed or implemented. Such scrutiny has also resulted
    in various inquiries, investigations and court proceedings in
    which we are a named defendant. Both the shippers on our
    pipelines and regulators have rights to challenge the rates we
    charge under certain circumstances. Any successful challenge
    could materially affect our results of operations.

Certain inquiries, investigations and court proceedings are
    ongoing and continue to adversely affect our business as a
    whole. We might see these adverse effects continue as a result
    of the uncertainty of these ongoing inquiries and proceedings,
    or additional inquiries and proceedings by federal or state
    regulatory agencies or private plaintiffs. In addition, we
    cannot predict the outcome of any of these inquiries or whether
    these inquiries will lead to additional legal proceedings
    against us, civil or criminal fines or penalties, or other
    regulatory action, including legislation, which might be
    materially adverse to the operation of our business and our
    revenues and net income or increase our operating costs in other
    ways. Current legal proceedings or other matters against us
    arising out of our ongoing and discontinued operations including
    environmental matters, disputes over gas measurement, royalty
    payments, shareholder class action suits, regulatory appeals and
    similar matters might result in adverse decisions against us.
    The result of such adverse decisions, either individually or in
    the aggregate, could be material and may not be covered fully or
    at all by insurance.

Risks
    Related to Accounting Standards

Potential
    changes in accounting standards might cause us to revise our
    financial results and disclosures in the future, which might
    change the way analysts measure our business or financial
    performance.

Accounting irregularities discovered in the past few years
    across various industries have forced regulators and legislators
    to take a renewed look at accounting practices, financial
    disclosures, companies’ relationships with their
    independent registered public accounting firms and retirement
    plan practices. We cannot predict the ultimate impact of any
    future changes in accounting regulations or practices in general
    with respect to public companies or the energy industry or in
    our operations specifically.

In addition, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) or
    the SEC could enact new accounting standards that might impact
    how we are required to record revenues, expenses, assets,
    liabilities and equity.

Risks
    Related to Market Volatility and Risk Measurement and Hedging
    Activities

Our
    risk measurement and hedging activities might not be effective
    and could increase the volatility of our results.

We manage our commodity price risk for our unregulated
    businesses as a whole. Although we have systems in place that
    use various methodologies to quantify risk, these systems might
    not always be followed or might not always be effective.
    Further, such systems do not in themselves manage risk,
    particularly risks outside of our control, and adverse changes
    in energy commodity market prices, volatility, adverse
    correlation of commodity prices, the liquidity of markets,
    changes in interest rates and other risks discussed in this
    report might still adversely affect our earnings, cash flows and
    balance sheet under applicable accounting rules, even if risks
    have been identified.

In an effort to manage our financial exposure related to
    commodity price and market fluctuations, we have entered into
    contracts to hedge certain risks associated with our assets and
    operations, including our long-term tolling agreements. In these
    hedging activities, we have used fixed-price, forward, physical
    purchase and sales contracts, futures, financial swaps and
    option contracts traded in the

over-the-counter

markets or on exchanges, as well as long-term structured
    transactions when feasible. Nevertheless, no single hedging
    arrangement can adequately address all risks present in a given
    contract. For example, a forward contract that would be
    effective



in hedging commodity price volatility risks would not hedge the
    tolling contract’s counterparty credit or performance risk.
    Therefore, unhedged risks will always continue to exist. While
    we attempt to manage counterparty credit risk within guidelines
    established by our credit policy, we may not be able to
    successfully manage all credit risk and as such, future cash
    flows and results of operations could be impacted by
    counterparty default.

Our use of hedging arrangements through which we attempt to
    reduce the economic risk of our participation in commodity
    markets could result in increased volatility of our reported
    results and could also result in reported cash flows in future
    years not reflecting the realization of increases in the fair
    value of derivatives that have already been reflected in our
    income statements. Changes in the fair values (gains and losses)
    of derivatives that qualify as hedges under
    SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative
    Instruments and Hedging Activities,”
    (SFAS 133) to the extent that such hedges are not
    fully effective in offsetting changes to the value of the hedged
    commodity, as well as changes in the fair value of derivatives
    that do not qualify as hedges under SFAS 133, must be
    recorded in our income. This creates the risk of volatility in
    earnings even if no economic impact to the Company has occurred
    during the applicable period. During the period from 2002 to
    2004 when our Power business was for sale, most changes in the
    fair value of derivatives used in our Power business were
    reflected in our earnings as net forward unrealized

mark-to-market

gains. As a result, in future periods if the cash benefits
    associated with those hedges are actually realized, the value
    will not be reflected as earnings on our income statement,
    having already been recorded as earnings in prior years.

The impact of changes in market prices for natural gas on the
    average gas prices received by us may be reduced based on the
    level of our hedging strategies. These hedging arrangements may
    limit our potential gains if the market prices for natural gas
    were to rise substantially over the price established by the
    hedge. In addition, our hedging arrangements expose us to the
    risk of financial loss in certain circumstances, including
    instances in which:

•

production is less than expected;

•

a change in the difference between published price indexes
    established by pipelines in which our hedged production is
    delivered and the reference price established in the hedging
    arrangements is such that we are required to make payments to
    our counterparties;

•

the counterparties to our hedging arrangements fail to honor
    their financial commitments.

Risks
    Related to Employees, Outsourcing of Non-Core Support
    Activities, and Technology

Institutional
    knowledge residing with current employees nearing retirement
    eligibility might not be adequately preserved.

In certain segments of our business, institutional knowledge
    resides with employees who have many years of service. As these
    employees reach retirement age, we may not be able to replace
    them with employees of comparable knowledge and experience. In
    addition, we may not be able to retain or recruit other
    qualified individuals and our efforts at knowledge transfer
    could be inadequate. If knowledge transfer, recruiting and
    retention efforts are inadequate, access to significant amounts
    of internal historical knowledge and expertise could become
    unavailable to us.

Failure
    of the outsourcing relationships might negatively impact our
    ability to conduct our business.

Some studies indicate a high failure rate of outsourcing
    relationships. Although we have taken steps to build a
    cooperative and mutually beneficial relationship with our
    outsourcing providers and to closely monitor their performance,
    a deterioration in the timeliness or quality of the services
    performed by the outsourcing providers or a failure of all or
    part of these relationships could lead to loss of institutional
    knowledge and interruption of services necessary for us to be
    able to conduct our business.



Our
    ability to receive services from outsourcing provider locations
    outside of the United States might be impacted by cultural
    differences, political instability, or unanticipated regulatory
    requirements in jurisdictions outside the United
    States.

Certain of our accounting, information technology, application
    development, and helpdesk services are currently provided by an
    outsourcing provider from service centers outside of the United
    States. The economic and political conditions in certain
    countries from which our outsourcing providers may provide
    services to us present similar risks of business operations
    located outside of the United States previously discussed,
    including risks of interruption of business, war, expropriation,
    nationalization, renegotiation, trade sanctions or nullification
    of existing contracts and changes in law or tax policy, that are
    greater than in the United States.

Our
    current information technology infrastructure is aging and may
    adversely affect our ability to conduct our
    business.

Limited capital spending for information technology
    infrastructure during

2001-2003

resulted in an aging server environment that may be less
    efficient, may require more personnel and capital resources to
    maintain and upgrade than more current systems, and may not be
    adequate for our current business needs. While efforts are
    ongoing to update the environment, the current age and condition
    of equipment could result in loss of internal and external
    communications, loss of data, inability to access data when
    needed, excessive software downtime (including downtime for
    critical software applications), and other disruptions that
    could have a material adverse impact on our business and results
    of operations.

Risks
    Related to Weather, other Natural Phenomena and Business
    Disruption

Our
    assets and operations can be adversely affected by weather and
    other natural phenomena.

Our assets and operations, including those located offshore, can
    be adversely affected by hurricanes, earthquakes, tornadoes and
    other natural phenomena and weather conditions including extreme
    temperatures, making it more difficult for us to realize the
    historic rates of return associated with these assets and
    operations.

Acts
    of terrorism could have a material adverse effect on our
    financial condition, results of operations and cash
    flows.

Our assets and the assets of our customers and others may be
    targets of terrorist activities that could disrupt our business
    or cause significant harm to our operations, such as full or
    partial disruption to our ability to generate, produce, process,
    transmit, transport or distribute electricity, natural gas or
    natural gas liquids. Acts of terrorism as well as events
    occurring in response to or in connection with acts of terrorism
    could cause environmental repercussions that could result in a
    significant decrease in revenues or significant reconstruction
    or remediation costs, which could have a material adverse effect
    on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Our common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange and
    NYSE Arca Equities Exchanges under the symbol “WMB.”
    At the close of business on February 22, 2007, we had
    approximately 11,875 holders of record of our common stock. The
    high and low closing sales price ranges (New York Stock Exchange
    composite transactions) and dividends declared by quarter for

Some of our subsidiaries’ borrowing arrangements limit the
    transfer of funds to us. These terms have not impeded, nor are
    they expected to impede, our ability to pay dividends. However,
    until January 20, 2005, the credit agreements underlying
    our two unsecured revolving credit facilities totaling
    $500 million prohibited us from paying quarterly cash
    dividends on our common stock in excess of $0.05 per share.
    On January 20, 2005, these facilities were terminated and
    replaced with two new facilities. As part of the transaction,
    the dividend restriction, along with most of the other
    restrictive covenants, was removed from the new credit
    agreements.

Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations

General

We are primarily a natural gas company, engaged in finding,
    producing, gathering, processing, and transporting natural gas.
    We also manage a wholesale power business. Our operations are
    located principally in the United States and are organized into
    the following reporting segments: Exploration &
    Production, Gas Pipeline, Midstream Gas & Liquids
    (Midstream), and Power. (See Note 1 of Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of
    reporting segments.)

Unless indicated otherwise, the following discussion of critical
    accounting estimates, discussion and analysis of results of
    operations and financial condition and liquidity relates to our
    current continuing operations and should be read in conjunction
    with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto
    included in Part II Item 8 of this document.

Overview
    of 2006

Our plan for 2006 was focused on continued disciplined growth.
    Objectives and highlights of this plan included:

Objectives

Highlights

Continuing to improve both
    EVA

®

and segment profit.

2006 segment profit increased
    $185.8 million to $1,468.3 million, which contributed
    to improving our
    EVA

®

.

Investing in our natural gas
    businesses in a way that improves
    EVA

®

,
    meets customer needs, and enhances our competitive position.

Total capital expenditures were
    approximately $2.5 billion, of which approximately
    $1.4 billion was invested in Exploration &
    Production.

Continuing to increase natural gas
    production in a responsible and efficient manner.

Exploration & Production
    increased its average daily production by approximately 21% over
    last year and also added 597 billion cubic feet equivalent
    in net reserves during 2006. Additionally, we received 2006
    industry awards including Hydrocarbon Producer of the Year and
    North America’s Best Field Rejuvenation.

Accelerating additional asset
    transactions between us and Williams Partners L.P., our master
    limited partnership.

Williams Partners L.P. acquired
    100 percent of Williams Four Corners LLC for a total of
    $1.583 billion.

Increasing the scale of our
    gathering and processing business in key growth basins.

We invested approximately
    $257 million in capital expenditures in Midstream including
    Deepwater Gulf expansion projects and completing the expansion
    of our Opal gas processing facility.

Filing new rates to enable our Gas
    Pipeline segment to create additional value.

Northwest Pipeline and Transco
    each filed a general rate case with the Federal Energy
    Regulatory Commission (FERC).

In January 2007, Northwest Pipeline reached a settlement in its
    pending rate case. The settlement is subject to FERC approval,
    which is expected by mid-2007.



Objectives

Highlights

Executing power contracts that
    reduce risk while adding new business and strengthening future
    cash flow potential.

During 2006, Power completed
    several new power sales contracts that increase the value of the
    portfolio and provide additional cash-flow certainty in future
    periods. Additionally, in early 2007, Power executed power sales
    agreements in southern California through 2011.

Our 2006

income from continuing operations

increased to
    $332.8 million, as compared to $317.4 million in 2005.
    Our

net cash provided by operating activities

was
    $1,889.6 million in 2006 compared to $1,449.9 million
    in 2005. These comparative results reflect the benefit of strong
    natural gas liquid margins partially offset with resolution of
    certain legacy litigation issues. In addition to achieving these
    results, the following represent significant actions or events
    that occurred during the year:

Recent
    Events

In June 2006, Williams Partners L.P. acquired 25.1 percent
    of our interest in Williams Four Corners LLC for
    $360 million. The acquisition was completed after Williams
    Partners L.P. successfully closed a $150 million private
    debt offering of senior unsecured notes due 2011 and an equity
    offering of approximately $225 million in net proceeds. In
    December 2006, Williams Partners L.P. acquired the remaining
    74.9 percent interest in Williams Four Corners LLC for
    $1.223 billion. The acquisition was completed after
    Williams Partners L.P. successfully closed a $600 million
    private debt offering of senior unsecured notes due 2017, a
    private equity offering of approximately $350 million of
    common and Class B units, and a public equity offering of
    approximately $294 million in net proceeds. The debt and
    equity issued by Williams Partners L.P. is reported as a
    component of our consolidated debt balance and minority interest
    balance, respectively. Williams Four Corners LLC owns certain
    gathering, processing and treating assets in the San Juan
    Basin in Colorado and New Mexico.

In December 2006, Northwest Pipeline completed and placed into
    service its capacity replacement project in the state of
    Washington. The project involved abandoning 268 miles of

26-inch

pipeline and replacing it with approximately 80 miles of

36-inch

pipeline constructed in four sections along the same pipeline
    corridor. Additionally, Northwest Pipeline modified five
    existing compressor stations and created additional net
    horsepower.

Northwest Pipeline and Transco have each filed a general rate
    case with the FERC. Northwest Pipeline reached a settlement in
    its pending rate case. The settlement is subject to FERC
    approval, which is expected by mid-2007. The new rates for
    Northwest Pipeline are effective in January 2007, subject to
    refund. The new rates for Transco are expected to be effective
    in March 2007, subject to refund.

In April 2006, Transco issued $200 million aggregate
    principal amount of 6.4 percent senior unsecured notes due
    2016 to certain institutional investors in a private debt
    placement. In October 2006, Transco completed an offer to
    exchange all of these notes for substantially identical notes
    registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.

In April 2006, we retired a secured floating-rate term loan for
    $488.9 million, including outstanding principal and accrued
    interest. The loan was due in 2008 and secured by substantially
    all of the assets of Williams Production RMT Company. The loan
    was retired using a combination of cash and revolving credit
    borrowings.

In May 2006, we replaced our $1.275 billion secured
    revolving credit facility with a $1.5 billion unsecured
    revolving credit facility. The new facility contains similar
    terms and financial covenants as the secured facility, but
    contains certain additional restrictions. (See Note 11 of
    Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.)

In May 2006, our Board of Directors approved a regular quarterly
    dividend of 9 cents per share of common stock, which reflects an
    increase of 20 percent compared with the 7.5 cents per
    share paid in each of the three prior quarters.

In June 2006, Northwest Pipeline issued $175 million
    aggregate principal amount of 7 percent senior unsecured
    notes due 2016 to certain institutional investors in a private
    debt placement. In October 2006, Northwest



Pipeline completed an offer to exchange all of these notes for
    substantially identical notes registered under the Securities
    Act of 1933, as amended.

In June 2006, we reached an

agreement-in-principle

to settle

class-action

securities litigation filed on behalf of purchasers of our
    securities between July 24, 2000, and July 22, 2002,
    for a total payment of $290 million to plaintiffs. We
    funded our $145 million portion of the settlement with

cash-on-hand

in November 2006, with the balance funded directly by our
    insurers. We recorded a pre-tax charge for approximately
    $161 million in second quarter 2006. This settlement did
    not have a material effect on our liquidity position. (See
    Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.)

On July 31, 2006, and August 1, 2006, we received a
    verdict in civil litigation related to a contractual dispute
    surrounding certain natural gas processing facilities known as
    Gulf Liquids. We recorded a pre-tax charge for approximately
    $88 million in second quarter 2006 related to this loss
    contingency. (See Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements.)

Our property insurance coverage levels and premiums were revised
    during the second quarter of 2006. In general, our coverage
    levels have decreased while our premiums have increased. These
    changes reflect general trends in our industry due to
    hurricane-related damages in recent years.

In November 2005, we initiated an offer to convert our
    5.5 percent junior subordinated convertible debentures into
    our common stock. In January 2006, we converted approximately
    $220.2 million of the debentures in exchange for
    20.2 million shares of common stock, a $25.8 million
    cash premium, and $1.5 million of accrued interest.

Outlook
    for 2007

Our plan for 2007 is focused on continued disciplined growth.
    Objectives of this plan include:

•

Continue to improve both
    EVA

®

and segment profit.

•

Invest in our natural gas businesses in a way that improves
    EVA

®

,
    meets customer needs, and enhances our competitive position.

•

Continue to increase natural gas production and reserves.

•

Increase the scale of our gathering and processing business in
    key growth basins.

•

Successfully resolving the rate cases for both Northwest
    Pipeline and Transco.

•

Execute power contracts that offset a significant percentage of
    our financial obligations associated with our tolling agreements.

Potential risks

and/or

obstacles that could prevent us from achieving these objectives
    include:

•

Volatility of commodity prices;

•

Lower than expected levels of cash flow from operations;

•

Decreased drilling success at Exploration & Production;

•

Exposure associated with our efforts to resolve regulatory and
    litigation issues (see Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements);

•

General economic and industry downturn.

We continue to address these risks through utilization of
    commodity hedging strategies, focused efforts to resolve
    regulatory issues and litigation claims, disciplined investment
    strategies, and maintaining our desired level of at least
    $1 billion in liquidity from cash and revolving credit
    facilities.



New
    Accounting Standards and Emerging Issues

Accounting standards that have been issued and are not yet
    effective may have a material effect on our Consolidated
    Financial Statements in the future. These include:

•

SFAS No. 157 “Fair Value Measurements”
    (SFAS 157). The effective date for this Statement is for
    fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. We will
    assess the impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.

•

FASB Interpretation No. 48 “Accounting for Uncertainty
    in Income Taxes — an interpretation of FASB Statement
    No. 109” (FIN 48).

FIN 48 prescribes guidance for the financial statement
    recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected
    to be taken in a tax return. To recognize a tax position, the
    enterprise determines whether it is more likely than not that
    the tax position will be sustained upon examination, including
    resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based
    on the technical merits of the position. A tax position that
    meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is measured
    to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial
    statements. The tax position is measured at the largest amount
    of benefit, determined on a cumulative probability basis, that
    is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon
    ultimate settlement.

We adopted FIN 48 as of January 1, 2007. The
    cumulative effect of applying the Interpretation will be
    reported as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained
    earnings. The net impact of the cumulative effect of adopting
    FIN 48 is expected to be in the range of a $10 million
    to $20 million decrease in retained earnings.

    to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on
    these and other recently issued accounting standards.

Critical
    Accounting Estimates

The preparation of financial statements, in conformity with
    generally accepted accounting principles, requires management to
    make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
    therein. We have discussed the following accounting estimates
    and assumptions as well as related disclosures with our Audit
    Committee. We believe that the nature of these estimates and
    assumptions is material due to the subjectivity and judgment
    necessary, or the susceptibility of such matters to change, and
    the impact of these on our financial condition or results of
    operations.

Revenue
    Recognition — Derivative Instruments and Hedging
    Activities

We hold a substantial portfolio of energy trading and nontrading
    contracts for a variety of purposes. We review these contracts
    to determine whether they are nonderivatives or derivatives. If
    they are derivatives, we further assess whether the contracts
    qualify for either cash flow hedge accounting or the normal
    purchases and normal sales exception.

The determination of whether a derivative contract qualifies as
    a cash flow hedge includes an analysis of historical market
    price information to assess whether the derivative is expected
    to be highly effective in achieving offsetting cash flows
    attributed to the hedged risk. We also assess whether the hedged
    forecasted transaction is probable of occurring. This assessment
    requires us to exercise judgment and consider a wide variety of
    factors in addition to our intent, including internal and
    external forecasts, historical experience, changing market and
    business conditions, our financial and operational ability to
    carry out the forecasted transaction, the length of time until
    the forecasted transaction is projected to occur, and the
    quantity of the forecasted transaction. In addition, we compare
    actual cash flows to those that were expected from the
    underlying risk. If a hedged forecasted transaction is not
    probable of occurring, or if the derivative contract is not
    expected to be highly effective, the derivative does not qualify
    for hedge accounting.

For derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges, we do
    not reflect changes in their fair value in earnings until the
    associated hedged item affects earnings. For those that have not
    been designated as hedges or do not qualify for hedge
    accounting, we recognize the net change in their fair value in
    income currently (marked to market).



For derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges, we
    prospectively discontinue hedge accounting and recognize future
    changes in fair value directly in earnings if we no longer
    expect the hedge to be highly effective, or if we believe that
    the hedged forecasted transaction is no longer probable of
    occurring. If the forecasted transaction becomes probable of not
    occurring, we must also reclass amounts previously recorded in
    other comprehensive income into earnings in addition to
    prospectively discontinuing hedge accounting. If the
    effectiveness of the derivative improves and is again expected
    to be highly effective in offsetting cash flows attributed to
    the hedged risk, or if the forecasted transaction again becomes
    probable, we may prospectively re-designate the derivative as a
    hedge of the underlying risk.

Derivatives for which the normal purchases and normal sales
    exception has been elected are accounted for on an accrual
    basis. In determining whether a derivative is eligible for this
    exception, we assess whether the contract provides for the
    purchase or sale of a commodity that will be physically
    delivered in quantities expected to be used or sold over a
    reasonable period in the normal course of business. In making
    this assessment, we consider numerous factors, including the
    quantities provided under the contract in relation to our
    business needs, delivery locations per the contract in relation
    to our operating locations, duration of time between entering
    the contract and delivery, past trends and expected future
    demand, and our past practices and customs with regard to such
    contracts. Additionally, we assess whether it is probable that
    the contract will result in physical delivery of the commodity
    and not net financial settlement.

The fair value of derivative contracts is determined based on
    the nature of the transaction and the market in which
    transactions are executed. We also incorporate assumptions and
    judgments about counterparty performance and credit
    considerations in our determination of their fair value.
    Contracts are executed in the following environments:

•

Organized commodity exchange or

over-the-counter

markets with quoted prices;

•

Organized commodity exchange or

over-the-counter

markets with quoted market prices but limited price
    transparency, requiring increased judgment to determine fair
    value;

•

Markets without quoted market prices.

The number of transactions executed without quoted market prices
    is limited. We estimate the fair value of these contracts by
    using readily available price quotes in similar markets and
    other market analyses. The fair value of all derivative
    contracts is continually subject to change as the underlying
    commodity market changes and our assumptions and judgments
    change.

Additional discussion of the accounting for energy contracts at
    fair value is included in Energy Trading Activities within
    Item 7 and Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements.

Oil-
    and Gas-Producing Activities

We use the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil-
    and gas-producing activities. Estimated natural gas and oil
    reserves and forward market prices for oil and gas are a
    significant part of our financial calculations. Following are
    examples of how these estimates affect financial results:

•

An increase (decrease) in estimated proved oil and gas reserves
    can reduce (increase) our

unit-of-production

depreciation, depletion and amortization rates.

•

Changes in oil and gas reserves and forward market prices both
    impact projected future cash flows from our oil and gas
    properties. This, in turn, can impact our periodic impairment
    analyses, including that for goodwill.

The process of estimating natural gas and oil reserves is very
    complex, requiring significant judgment in the evaluation of all
    available geological, geophysical, engineering, and economic
    data. After being estimated internally, 99.9 percent of our
    reserve estimates are either audited or prepared by independent
    experts. The data may change substantially over time as a result
    of numerous factors, including additional development activity,
    evolving production history, and a continual reassessment of the
    viability of production under changing economic conditions. As a
    result, material revisions to existing reserve estimates could
    occur from time to time. A revision of our reserve estimates
    within reasonably likely parameters is not expected to result in
    an impairment of our oil and



gas properties or goodwill. However, reserve estimate revisions
    would impact our depreciation and depletion expense
    prospectively. For example, a change of approximately
    10 percent in oil and gas reserves for each basin would
    change our annual

depreciation, depletion and
    amortization

expense between approximately $25 million
    and $31 million. The actual impact would depend on the
    specific basins impacted and whether the change resulted from
    proved developed, proved undeveloped or a combination of these
    reserve categories.

Forward market prices, which are utilized in our impairment
    analyses, include estimates of prices for periods that extend
    beyond those with quoted market prices. This forward market
    price information is consistent with that generally used in
    evaluating our drilling decisions and acquisition plans. These
    market prices for future periods impact the production economics
    underlying oil and gas reserve estimates. The prices of natural
    gas and oil are volatile and change from period to period, thus
    impacting our estimates. An unfavorable change in the forward
    price curve within reasonably likely parameters is not expected
    to result in an impairment of our oil and gas properties or
    goodwill.

Contingent
    Liabilities

We record liabilities for estimated loss contingencies,
    including environmental matters, when we assess that a loss is
    probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.
    Revisions to contingent liabilities are reflected in income in
    the period in which new or different facts or information become
    known or circumstances change that affect the previous
    assumptions with respect to the likelihood or amount of loss.
    Liabilities for contingent losses are based upon our assumptions
    and estimates and upon advice of legal counsel, engineers, or
    other third parties regarding the probable outcomes of the
    matter. As new developments occur or more information becomes
    available, our assumptions and estimates of these liabilities
    may change. Changes in our assumptions and estimates or outcomes
    different from our current assumptions and estimates could
    materially affect future results of operations for any
    particular quarterly or annual period. See Note 15 of Notes
    to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Valuation
    of Deferred Tax Assets and Tax Contingencies

We have deferred tax assets resulting from certain investments
    and businesses that have a tax basis in excess of the book basis
    and from tax carry-forwards generated in the current and prior
    years. We must evaluate whether we will ultimately realize these
    tax benefits and establish a valuation allowance for those that
    may not be realizable. This evaluation considers tax planning
    strategies, including assumptions about the availability and
    character of future taxable income. At December 31, 2006,
    we have approximately $926 million of deferred tax assets
    for which a $36 million valuation allowance has been
    established. When assessing the need for a valuation allowance,
    we considered forecasts of future company performance, the
    estimated impact of potential asset dispositions and our ability
    and intent to execute tax planning strategies to utilize tax
    carryovers. Based on our projections, we believe that it is
    probable that we can utilize our year-end 2006 federal tax net
    operating losses carryovers and charitable contribution
    carryovers prior to their expiration. We do not expect to be
    able to utilize $36 million of foreign deferred tax assets
    related to carryovers. See Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements for additional information regarding the
    tax carryovers. The ultimate amount of deferred tax assets
    realized could be materially different from those recorded, as
    influenced by potential changes in jurisdictional income tax
    laws and the circumstances surrounding the actual realization of
    related tax assets.

We regularly face challenges from domestic and foreign tax
    authorities regarding the amount of taxes due. These challenges
    include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions
    and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. In
    evaluating the liability associated with our various filing
    positions, we record a liability for probable tax contingencies.
    The ultimate disposition of these contingencies could have a
    significant impact on net cash flows. To the extent we were to
    prevail in matters for which accruals have been established or
    were required to pay amounts in excess of our accrued liability,
    our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may
    be materially impacted.

Pension
    and Postretirement Obligations

We have employee benefit plans that include pension and other
    postretirement benefits. Pension and other postretirement
    benefit plan expense and obligations are calculated by a
    third-party actuary and are impacted by various estimates and
    assumptions. These estimates and assumptions include the
    expected long-term rates of return



on plan assets, discount rates, expected rate of compensation
    increase, health care cost trend rates, and employee
    demographics, including retirement age and mortality. These
    assumptions are reviewed annually and adjustments are made as
    needed. The assumptions utilized to compute expense and the
    benefit obligations are shown in Note 7 of Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements. The following table presents
    the estimated increase (decrease) in pension and other
    postretirement benefit expense and obligations resulting from a
    one-percentage-point change in the specified assumption.

The expected long-term rates of return on plan assets are
    determined by combining a review of historical returns realized
    within the portfolio, the investment strategy included in the
    plans’ Investment Policy Statement, and the capital market
    projections provided by our independent investment consultant
    for the asset classifications in which the portfolio is invested
    as well as the target weightings of each asset classification.
    These rates are impacted by changes in general market
    conditions, but because they are long-term in nature, short-term
    market swings do not significantly impact the rates. Changes to
    our target asset allocation would also impact these rates. Our
    expected long-term rate of return on plan assets used for our
    pension plans is 7.75 percent for 2006 and was
    8.5 percent from

2002-2005.

Over the past ten years, our actual average return on plan
    assets for our pension plans has been approximately
    7.9 percent.

The discount rates are used to discount future benefit cash
    flows to today’s dollars. Decreases in these rates increase
    the obligation and, generally, increase the related expense. The
    discount rates for our pension and other postretirement benefit
    plans were determined separately based on an approach specific
    to our plans and their respective expected benefit cash flows as
    described in Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements. Our discount rate assumptions are impacted by
    changes in general economic and market conditions that affect
    interest rates on long-term high-quality corporate bonds.

The expected rate of compensation increase represents average
    long-term salary increases. An increase in this rate causes
    pension obligation and expense to increase.

The assumed health care cost trend rates are based on our actual
    historical cost rates that are adjusted for expected changes in
    the health care industry.

2006 vs.

The decrease in

revenues

is primarily due to lower power
    and natural gas realized revenues at Power. These revenues
    declined due to lower sales volumes associated with reducing the
    scope of our trading activities and lower natural gas sales
    prices. Partially offsetting these decreases are increased
    crude, olefin and natural gas liquid (NGL) marketing revenues
    and higher NGL production revenue at Midstream and increased
    production revenue at Exploration & Production.

The decrease in

costs and operating expenses

is largely
    due to decreased power purchase volumes and reduced natural gas
    purchase prices at Power. Partially offsetting these decreases
    are increased crude, olefin and NGL



marketing purchases and operating expenses at Midstream and
    increased depreciation, depletion and amortization and lease
    operating expense at Exploration & Production.

The increase in

selling, general and administrative
    (SG&A) expenses

is primarily due to increased personnel
    costs, insurance expense, higher information systems support
    costs and the absence of a $17.1 million reduction of
    pension expense at Gas Pipeline in 2005. Additionally,
    Exploration & Production experienced higher costs due
    to increased staffing in support of increased drilling and
    operational activity.

Other (income) expense — net

within

operating income

in 2006 includes:

•

A $72.7 million accrual for a Gulf Liquids litigation
    contingency;

•

Income of $12.7 million due to reducing contingent
    obligations associated with our former distributive power
    generation business at Power;

•

Income of $9 million due to a settlement of an
    international contract dispute at Midstream;

Other (income) expense — net

within

operating income

in 2005 includes:

•

An $82.2 million accrual for litigation contingencies at
    Power, associated primarily with agreements reached to
    substantially resolve exposure related to certain natural gas
    price and volume reporting issues;

•

Gains totaling $29.6 million on the sale of certain natural
    gas properties at Exploration & Production;

•

A gain of $9 million on a sale of land in our Other segment.

General corporate expenses

decreased primarily due to the
    absence of $13.8 million of insurance settlement charges in
    2005 associated with certain insurance coverage allocation
    issues.

The

securities litigation settlement and related costs

is
    the result of settling

class-action

securities litigation filed on behalf of purchasers of our
    securities between July 24, 2000 and July 22, 2002.

Interest accrued — net

in 2006 includes
    $22 million in interest expense associated with our Gulf
    Liquids litigation contingency.

The increase in

investing income

is due to:

•

The absence of an $87.2 million impairment in 2005 on our
    investment in Longhorn Partners Pipeline, L.P. (Longhorn);

•

The absence of a $23 million impairment in 2005 of our Aux
    Sable Liquid Products, L.P. (Aux Sable) equity investment;

•

An approximate $37 million increase in interest income
    primarily associated with increased earnings on cash and cash
    equivalent balances associated with higher rates of return;

•

Increased equity earnings of $33.3 million due largely to
    the absence of equity losses in 2006 on Longhorn and increased
    earnings of our Discovery Producer Services LLC (Discovery) and
    Aux Sable investments;

These increases are partially offset by:

•

A $16.4 million impairment of a Venezuelan cost-based
    investment at Exploration & Production;

•

The absence of an $8.6 million gain on sale of our
    remaining

Mid-America

Pipeline (MAPL) and Seminole Pipeline (Seminole) investments at
    Midstream in 2005.

Early debt retirement costs

in 2006 includes
    $25.8 million in premiums and $1.2 million in fees
    related to the January 2006 debt conversion and
    $4.4 million of accelerated amortization of debt expenses
    related to the retirement of the debt secured by assets of
    Williams Production RMT Company.

The increase in

minority interest in income of consolidated
    subsidiaries

is primarily due to the growth of Williams
    Partners L.P., our consolidated master limited partnership.



Provision for income taxes

changed favorably during the
    year. The effective income tax rate for 2006 is slightly higher
    than the federal statutory rate primarily due to state income
    taxes, the effect of taxes on foreign operations, nondeductible
    convertible debenture expenses and an accrual for income tax
    contingencies, partially offset by the favorable resolution of
    federal income tax litigation and the utilization of charitable
    contribution carryovers not previously benefited. The 2006
    effective income tax rate has been increased by an adjustment to
    increase overall deferred income tax liabilities. The effective
    income tax rate for 2005 is higher than the federal statutory
    rate due primarily to state income taxes, nondeductible
    expenses, the effect of taxes on foreign operations and the
    inability to utilize charitable contribution carryovers. The
    2005 effective income tax rate was reduced by an adjustment to
    reduce overall deferred income tax liabilities and favorable
    settlements on federal and state income tax matters. (See
    Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.)

Income (loss) from discontinued operations

in 2006
    includes:

•

An $11.9 million

net-of-tax

litigation settlement related to our former chemical fertilizer
    business;

•

A $3.7 million

net-of-tax

charge associated with the settlement of a loss contingency
    related to a former exploration business;

•

A $9.1 million

net-of-tax

charge associated with an oil purchase contract related to our
    former Alaska refinery.

Cumulative effect of change in accounting principle

in
    2005 is due to the implementation of FIN 47. (See
    Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.)

2005 vs.

The increase in revenues is due primarily to increased revenues
    at Exploration & Production due to higher natural gas
    prices and production volumes sold and gas management income,
    and at Midstream due primarily to increased NGL prices and crude
    marketing revenue. Partially offsetting these increases is
    decreased revenue at Power due primarily to the absence of crude
    and refined products activity and reduced net forward unrealized

mark-to-market

gains.

The increase in

costs and operating expenses

is due
    primarily to increased crude marketing costs and increased NGL
    costs at Midstream in addition to increased depreciation,
    depletion and amortization and gas management expense at
    Exploration & Production. Partially offsetting these
    increases are decreased costs at Power primarily due to the
    absence of crude and refined products activity.

The decrease in

SG&A expenses

is primarily due to the
    $17.1 million reduction in expenses at Gas Pipeline to
    record the cumulative impact of a correction to pension expense
    attributable to the periods 2003 and 2004 and a $9.7 reduction
    of bad debt expense at Power resulting from the sale of certain
    receivables to a third party. Partially offsetting these items
    is increased staffing costs at Exploration & Production
    in support of increased operational drilling activity.

Other (income) expense — net,

within

operating income,

in 2004 includes:

•

Income of $93.6 million from an insurance arbitration award
    associated with Gulf Liquids at Midstream;

•

Gains of $16.2 million from the sale of
    Exploration & Production’s securities, invested in
    a coal seam royalty trust, that were purchased for resale;

•

A $9.5 million gain on the sale of Louisiana olefins assets
    at Midstream;

•

A $15.4 million loss provision related to an ownership
    dispute on prior period production included at
    Exploration & Production;

•

An $11.8 million environmental expense accrual related to
    the Augusta refinery facility included in our Other segment;

•

A $9 million write-off of previously capitalized costs on
    an idled segment of Northwest Pipeline’s system included at
    Gas Pipeline.



The increase in

general corporate expenses

is due
    primarily to the $13.8 million of expense related to the
    settlement of certain insurance coverage issues and a
    $16 million increase in outside legal costs associated
    primarily with securities class action matters.

The decrease in

interest accrued — net

is due
    primarily to lower average borrowing levels in 2005 as compared
    to 2004.

The decrease in

investing income

is due primarily to a
    $76.4 increase in impairment charges on our investment in
    Longhorn, a $13.9 million increase in Longhorn equity
    losses, and the $23 million impairment of our Aux Sable
    equity investment. Partially offsetting these decreases are the
    following increases:

•

A $30.4 million increase in domestic and international
    equity earnings, excluding Longhorn and Aux Sable;

•

The absence in 2005 of a $20.8 million impairment of an
    international cost-based investment;

•

The absence in 2005 of a $16.9 million impairment of our
    Discovery equity investment;

•

The $8.6 million gain on the sale of our remaining
    interests in the MAPL and Seminole assets;

•

The absence in 2005 of a $6.5 million Longhorn
    recapitalization fee.

Early debt retirement costs

include premiums, fees and
    expenses related to the retirement of debt.

Provision for income taxes

changed unfavorably primarily
    due to increased pre-tax income in 2005 as compared to 2004. The
    effective income tax rate for 2005 is higher than the federal
    statutory rate due primarily to state income taxes,
    nondeductible expenses, the effect of taxes on foreign
    operations and the inability to utilize charitable contribution
    carryovers. The 2005 effective income tax rate has been reduced
    by an adjustment to reduce the overall deferred income tax
    liabilities and favorable settlements on federal and state
    income tax matters. The effective income tax rate for 2004 is
    higher than the federal statutory rate due primarily to state
    income taxes, a charge associated with charitable contribution
    carryovers and the effect of taxes on foreign operations. A 2004
    accrual for income tax contingencies was offset by favorable
    settlements of certain federal and state income tax matters.
    (See Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.)

Income (loss) from discontinued operations

in 2004 is
    comprised of gains on the sales of the Canadian straddle plants
    and the Alaska refinery of $189.8 million and
    $3.6 million, respectively, as well as $22 million in
    income from our Canadian straddles discontinued operation.
    Partially offsetting these are $153 million of charges to
    increase our accrued liability associated with certain Quality
    Bank litigation matters.



Results
    of Operations — Segments

We are currently organized into the following segments:
    Exploration & Production, Gas Pipeline, Midstream,
    Power, and Other. Other primarily consists of corporate
    operations. Our management currently evaluates performance based
    on segment profit (loss) from operations. (See Note 17 of
    Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.)

Exploration &
    Production

Overview
    of 2006

In 2006, we focused on our objective to rapidly expand
    development of our drilling inventory. This resulted in
    significant growth as evidenced by the following accomplishments:

•

We increased average daily domestic production levels by
    approximately 23 percent over last year, surpassing our
    goal of 15 to 20 percent. The average daily domestic
    production was approximately 752 million cubic feet of gas
    equivalent (MMcfe) compared to 612 MMcfe in 2005. The
    increased production is primarily due to increased development
    within the Piceance and Powder River basins.

Domestic
    Production

    domestic production grew 23 percent or 140 MMcfe per day over

•

We continued to increase our development drilling program during
    2006. We drilled 1,783 gross wells in 2006 compared to
    1,627 in 2005. This contributed to the addition of
    597 billion cubic feet equivalent (Bcfe) in net
    reserves — a replacement rate for our domestic
    production of 216 percent in 2006 compared to
    277 percent in 2005. Capital expenditures for domestic
    drilling, development, gathering facilities and acquisition
    activity in 2006 were approximately $1.4 billion compared
    to approximately $768 million in 2005.

The benefit of higher production volumes to operating results
    was more than offset by the downward trending of natural gas
    market prices during the year and increased operating costs. The
    increase in operating costs reflects an increase in our
    production volumes combined with a general industry condition of
    greater demand for services and products as production
    activities increase in our key basins.

Significant
    events

At December 31, 2006, all ten new

state-of-the-art

FlexRig4

®

drilling rigs have been placed into service pursuant to our
    lease agreement with Helmerich & Payne. The March 2005
    contract provided for the operation of the drilling rigs, each
    for a primary lease term of three years. This arrangement
    supports our continuing objective to



accelerate the pace of natural gas development in the Piceance
    basin through both deployment of the additional rigs and through
    the drilling and operational efficiencies of the new rigs.

In 2006, we increased our position in the Fort Worth basin
    by acquiring producing properties and undeveloped leasehold
    interests for approximately $64 million. These acquisitions
    increased our diversification into the Mid-Continent region and
    will allow us to use our horizontal drilling expertise to
    develop wells in the Barnett Shale formation.

Outlook
    for 2007

Our expectations and objectives for 2007 include:

•

Maintaining our development drilling program in our key basins
    of Piceance, Powder River, San Juan, Arkoma, and
    Fort Worth through planned capital expenditures of $1.3 to
    $1.4 billion.

•

Continuing to grow our domestic average daily production level
    with a goal of 10 to 20 percent annual growth.

Approximately 172 MMcfe, or 18 percent, of our
    forecasted 2007 daily production is hedged by NYMEX and basis
    fixed price contracts at prices that average $3.90 per Mcfe
    at a basin level. In addition, we have collar agreements for
    each month in 2007 as follows:

•

NYMEX collar agreement for approximately 15 MMcfe per day
    at a weighted-average floor price of $6.50 per Mcfe and a
    weighted-average ceiling price of $8.25 per Mcfe.

•

Northwest Pipeline/Rockies collar agreement for approximately
    50 MMcfe per day at a floor price of $5.65 per Mcfe
    and a ceiling price of $7.45 per Mcfe at a basin level.

•

El Paso/San Juan collar agreements totaling
    approximately 130 MMcfe per day at a weighted average floor
    price of $5.98 per Mcfe and a weighted average ceiling
    price of $9.63 per Mcfe at a basin level.

•

Mid-Continent (PEPL) collar agreements totaling approximately
    75 MMcfe per day at a weighted average floor price of
    $6.82 per Mcfe and a weighted average ceiling price of
    $10.80 per Mcfe at a basin level.

We have recently entered into a five-year unsecured credit
    agreement with certain banks in order to reduce margin
    requirements related to our hedging activities as well as lower
    transaction fees. Margin requirements, if any, under this new
    facility are dependent on the level of hedging and on natural
    gas reserves value.

Additional risks to achieving our expectations include weather
    conditions at certain of our locations during the first and
    fourth quarters of 2007, drilling rig availability, obtaining
    permits as planned for drilling, and market price movements.

2006 vs.

Total

segment revenues

increased $218.5 million, or
    17 percent, primarily due to the following:

•

$165 million, or 15 percent, increase in domestic
    production revenues reflecting $245 million primarily
    associated with a 23 percent increase in natural gas
    production volumes sold, offset by a decrease of
    $80 million associated with a 6 percent decrease in
    net realized average prices. The increase in production volumes
    is primarily from the Piceance and Powder River basins and the
    decrease in prices reflects the downward trending of market
    prices in the latter part of 2006.



•

$10 million increase in production revenues from our
    international operations primarily due to increases in net
    realized average prices for crude oil production volumes sold.

•

$14 million of net unrealized gains in 2006 from hedge
    ineffectiveness and forward

mark-to-market

gains on certain basis swaps not designated as hedges as
    compared to $10 million in net unrealized losses
    attributable to hedge ineffectiveness from NYMEX collars in 2005.

To manage the commodity price risk and volatility of owning
    producing gas properties, we enter into derivative sales
    contracts that fix the sales price relating to a portion of our
    future production. Approximately 40 percent of domestic
    production in 2006 was hedged by NYMEX and basis fixed price
    contracts at a weighted average price of $3.82 per Mcfe at
    a basin level compared to 47 percent hedged at a weighted
    average price of $3.99 per Mcfe in 2005. In addition,
    approximately 15 percent of domestic production was hedged
    by the following collar agreements in 2006:

•

NYMEX collar agreement for approximately 49 MMcfe per day
    at a floor price of $6.50 per Mcfe and a ceiling price of
    $8.25 per Mcfe.

•

NYMEX collar agreement for approximately 15 MMcfe per day
    at a floor price of $7.00 per Mcfe and a ceiling price of
    $9.00 per Mcfe.

•

Northwest Pipeline/Rockies collar agreement for approximately
    50 MMcfe per day at a floor price of $6.05 per Mcfe
    and a ceiling price of $7.90 per Mcfe at a basin level.

In 2005, approximately 10 percent of domestic production
    was hedged by a NYMEX collar agreement for approximately
    50 MMcfe per day at a floor price of $7.50 per Mcfe
    and a ceiling price of $10.49 per Mcfe in the first quarter
    and at a floor price of $6.75 per Mcfe and a ceiling price
    of $8.50 per Mcfe in the second, third, and fourth
    quarters, and a Northwest Pipeline/Rockies collar agreement for
    approximately 50 MMcfe per day in the fourth quarter at a
    floor price of $6.10 per Mcfe and a ceiling price of
    $7.70 per Mcfe.

Our hedges are executed with our Power segment, which, in turn,
    executes offsetting derivative contracts with unrelated third
    parties. Generally, Power bears the counterparty performance
    risks associated with unrelated third parties. Hedging decisions
    are made considering our overall commodity risk exposure and are
    not executed independently by Exploration & Production.

Total

costs and expenses

increased $257 million,
    primarily due to the following:

•

$107 million higher depreciation, depletion and
    amortization expense primarily due to higher production volumes
    and increased capitalized drilling costs;

•

$54 million higher lease operating expense primarily due to
    the increased number of producing wells and higher well service
    and industry costs due to increased demand and approximately
    $6 million for

out-of-period

expenses related to 2005. Our management has concluded that the
    effect of this item is not material to our consolidated results
    for 2006, or prior periods, or to our trend of earnings;

•

$19 million higher operating taxes primarily due to higher
    production volumes sold and increased tax rates;

•

$33 million higher selling, general and administrative
    expenses primarily due to higher compensation for additional
    staffing in support of increased drilling and operational
    activity. In addition, we incurred higher legal, insurance, and
    information technology support costs related to the increased
    activity;

•

The absence in 2006 of $29.6 million of gains on the sales
    of properties in 2005.

The $35.7 million decrease in s

egment profit

is
    primarily due to lower net realized average prices and higher

costs and expenses

as discussed previously, and the
    absence in 2006 of $29.6 million of gains on the sales of
    properties in 2005. Partially offsetting these decreases are a
    23 percent increase in domestic production volumes sold and
    an increase in income from ineffectiveness and forward
    mark-to-market gains.

Segment profit

also includes an
    $8 million increase in our international operations
    primarily due to higher revenue and equity earnings as a result
    of increases in net realized average prices for crude oil
    production volumes sold.



2005 vs.

The $491.5 million, or 63 percent increase in

segment revenues

is primarily due to an increase in
    domestic production revenues of $434 million during 2005
    reflecting higher net realized average prices and higher
    production volumes sold. Also contributing to the increase is a
    $58 million increase in revenues from gas management
    activities, offset in

costs and expenses

, and
    $13 million increased production revenues from our
    international operations. Partially offsetting these increases
    is $10 million in net unrealized losses attributable to
    NYMEX collars from hedge ineffectiveness.

The increase in domestic production revenues primarily results
    from $319 million higher revenues associated with a
    42 percent increase in net realized average prices for
    production sold as well as a $115 million increase
    associated with an 18 percent increase in average daily
    production volumes. The higher net realized average prices
    reflect the benefit of the lower volumes hedged in 2005 as
    compared to 2004 coupled with higher market prices for natural
    gas in 2005. The increase in production volumes primarily
    reflects an increase in the number of producing wells resulting
    from our successful 2005 drilling program.

Approximately 77 percent of domestic production in 2004 was
    hedged at a weighted average price of $3.65 per Mcfe at a
    basin level.

Total

costs and expenses

increased $147 million,
    primarily due to the following:

•

$62 million higher depreciation, depletion and amortization
    expense primarily due to higher production volumes and increased
    capitalized drilling costs;

•

$16 million higher lease operating expense from the
    increased number of producing wells and generally higher
    industry costs;

•

$23 million higher operating taxes primarily due to
    increased market prices and production volumes sold;

•

$18 million higher selling, general and administrative
    expenses primarily due to higher compensation and increased
    staffing in 2005 in support of increased drilling and
    operational activity;

•

$58 million higher gas management expenses associated with
    higher revenues from gas management activities, offset in

segment revenues

;

•

$11 million lower gain in 2005 than in 2004 on the sale of
    securities associated with our coal seam royalty trust that were
    previously purchased for resale.

These increased

costs and expenses

are partially offset
    by the absence in 2005 of a $15.4 million loss provision
    related to an ownership dispute on prior period production in
    2004, a $7.9 million gain on the sale of an undeveloped
    leasehold position in Colorado in the first quarter of 2005, and
    a $21.7 million gain on the sale of certain outside
    operated properties in the Powder River basin area of Wyoming in
    the third quarter of 2005.

The $351.4 million increase in s

egment profit

is
    primarily due to increased revenues from higher volumes and
    higher net realized average prices, as well as the gains on
    sales of assets, partially offset by higher expenses as
    discussed above.

Segment profit

also includes a
    $19 million increase in our international operations
    reflecting higher revenue and equity earnings resulting from
    higher net realized oil and gas prices.

Gas
    Pipeline

Overview

We operate, through our Northwest Pipeline and Transco
    subsidiaries, approximately 14,400 miles of pipeline from
    the Gulf Coast to the northeast United States and from northern
    New Mexico to the Pacific Northwest with a total annual
    throughput of approximately 2,500 trillion BTUs. Additionally,
    we hold a 50 percent interest in Gulfstream Natural Gas
    System, L.L.C. (Gulfstream). This asset, which extends from the
    Mobile Bay area in Alabama to markets in Florida, has current
    transportation capacity of 1.1 MMdt/d.

Our strategy to create value for our shareholders focuses on
    maximizing the utilization of our pipeline capacity by providing
    high quality, low cost transportation of natural gas to large
    and growing markets.



Gas Pipeline’s interstate transmission and storage
    activities are subject to regulation by the FERC and as such,
    our rates and charges for the transportation of natural gas in
    interstate commerce, and the extension, expansion or abandonment
    of jurisdictional facilities and accounting, among other things,
    are subject to regulation. The rates are established through the
    FERC’s ratemaking process. Changes in commodity prices and
    volumes transported have little impact on revenues because the
    majority of cost of service is recovered through firm capacity
    reservation charges in transportation rates.

Significant events of 2006 include:

Filing of
    rate cases

During 2006, Northwest Pipeline and Transco each filed general
    rate cases with the FERC for increases in rates due to higher
    costs in recent years. The new rates are effective, subject to
    refund, in January 2007 for Northwest Pipeline and in March 2007
    for Transco. We expect the new rates to result in significantly
    higher revenues.

In January 2007, Northwest Pipeline reached a settlement in its
    pending rate case. The settlement is subject to FERC approval,
    which is expected by mid-2007.

Gulfstream

In March 2006, our equity method investee, Gulfstream, announced
    a new long-term agreement with a Florida utility company, which
    fully subscribed the pipeline’s mainline capacity on a
    long-term basis. Under the agreement, Gulfstream will extend its
    existing pipeline approximately 35 miles within Florida.
    The agreement is subject to the approval of various authorities.
    Construction of the extension is anticipated to begin in early
    2008 with a targeted completion of summer 2008.

In May 2006, Gulfstream announced a new agreement to provide
    155 Mdt/d of natural gas to a Florida utility. In December
    2006, Gulfstream filed an application with the FERC seeking
    approval to expand its pipeline system to provide the additional
    capacity. Under this agreement, Gulfstream will construct
    approximately 17.5 miles of 20 inch pipeline and the
    installation of a new compressor facility. If approved, all of
    the facilities will be placed into service by January 2009.

Parachute
    Lateral project

In August 2006, we received FERC approval to construct a

37.6-mile

expansion that will provide additional natural gas
    transportation capacity in northwest Colorado. The planned
    expansion will increase capacity by 450 Mdt/d through the

30-inch

diameter line and is estimated to cost approximately
    $86 million. The expansion is expected to be in service in
    March 2007.

Grays
    Harbor

Effective January 2005, Duke Energy Trading and Marketing, LLC
    (Duke) terminated its firm transportation agreement related to
    Northwest Pipeline’s Grays Harbor lateral. In January 2005,
    Duke paid Northwest Pipeline $94 million for the remaining
    book value of the asset and the related income taxes. We and
    Duke have not agreed on the amount of the income taxes due
    Northwest Pipeline as a result of the contract termination. We
    have deferred the $6 million difference between the
    proceeds and net book value of the lateral pending resolution of
    the disputed early termination obligation.

On June 16, 2005, we filed a Petition for a Declaratory
    Order with the FERC requesting that it rule on our
    interpretation of our tariff to aid in resolving the dispute
    with Duke. On July 15, 2005, Duke filed a motion to
    intervene and provided comments supporting its position
    concerning the issues in dispute.

On October 4, 2006, the FERC issued its Order on Petition
    for Declaratory Order, providing clarification on issues
    relating to Duke’s obligation to reimburse us for future
    tax expenses. We reviewed the Order and filed a request for
    rehearing requesting further clarification of certain items.
    Based upon the order, as written, we do not anticipate any
    adverse impact to our results of operations or financial
    position.



Northwest
    Pipeline capacity replacement project

In September 2005, we received FERC approval to construct and
    operate approximately 80 miles of

36-inch

pipeline loop as a replacement for most of the capacity
    previously served by 268 miles of

26-inch

pipeline in the Washington state area. The capacity replacement
    as well as the abandonment of the old capacity was completed in
    December 2006. In addition to the capacity replacement, five
    existing compressor stations were modified, and we increased net
    horsepower.

Outlook
    for 2007

Leidy to
    Long Island expansion project

In May 2006, we received FERC approval to expand Transco’s
    natural gas pipeline in the northeast United States. The
    estimated cost of the project is approximately $141 million
    with three-quarters of that spending expected to occur in 2007.
    The expansion will provide 100 Mdt/d of incremental firm
    capacity and is expected to be in service by November 2007.

Potomac
    expansion project

In July 2006, we filed an application with the FERC to expand
    Transco’s existing facilities in the Mid-Atlantic region of
    the United States by constructing 16.5 miles of

42-inch

pipeline. The project will provide 165 Mdt/d of incremental
    firm capacity. The estimated cost of the project is
    approximately $74 million, with an anticipated in-service
    date of November 2007.

Significant
    2005 adjustments

Operating results for 2005 included:

•

Adjustments of $17.7 million reflected as a
    $12.1 million reduction of

costs and operating
    expenses

and a $5.6 million reduction of

SG&A
    expenses

. These cost reductions were corrections of the
    carrying value of certain liabilities that were recorded in
    prior periods. Based on a review by management, these
    liabilities were no longer required.

•

Pension expense reduction of $17.1 million in the second
    quarter of 2005 to reflect the cumulative impact of a correction
    of an error attributable to 2003 and 2004. The error was
    associated with our third-party actuarial computation of annual
    net periodic pension expense and resulted from the
    identification of errors in certain Transco participant data
    involving annuity contract information utilized for 2003 and
    2004.

•

Adjustments of $37.3 million reflected as increases in

costs and operating expenses

related to
    $32.1 million of prior period accounting and valuation
    corrections for certain inventory items and an accrual of
    $5.2 million for contingent refund obligations.

Our management concluded that the effects of these adjustments
    were not material to our consolidated results for 2005 or prior
    periods, or to our trend of earnings.

2006 vs.

Revenues

decreased $65.1 million, or 5 percent,
    due primarily to $75 million lower revenues associated with
    exchange imbalance settlements (offset in

costs and operating
    expenses

). Partially offsetting this decrease is a
    $9 million increase in revenue due to an adjustment for the
    recovery of state income tax rate changes (offset in

provision for income taxes

).



Costs and operating expenses

decreased $17 million,
    or 2 percent, due primarily to:

•

A decrease in costs of $75 million associated with exchange
    imbalance settlements (offset in

revenues

);

•

A decrease in costs of $37.3 million related to the absence
    of $32.1 million of 2005 prior period accounting and
    valuation corrections for certain inventory items and an accrual
    of $5.2 million for contingent refund obligations.

Partially offsetting these decreases are:

•

An increase in contract and outside service costs of
    $23 million due primarily to higher pipeline assessment and
    repair costs;

•

An increase in depreciation expense of $15 million due to
    property additions;

•

An increase in operating and maintenance expenses of
    $15 million;

•

An increase in operating taxes of $10 million;

•

The absence of $14.2 million of income in 2005 associated
    with the resolution of litigation;

•

The absence of $12.1 million of expense reductions during
    2005 related to the carrying value of certain liabilities.

SG&A expenses

increased $77 million, or
    92 percent, due primarily to:

•

An increase in personnel costs of $18 million;

•

The absence of a 2005 $17.1 million reduction in pension
    costs to correct an error in prior periods;

•

An increase in information systems support costs of
    $16 million;

•

An increase in property insurance expenses of $14 million;

•

The absence of $5.6 million of cost reductions in 2005 that
    related to correcting the carrying value of certain liabilities.

The $118.4 million, or 20 percent, decrease in

segment profit

is due primarily to the absence of
    significant 2005 adjustments as previously discussed, increases
    in

costs and operating expenses

and

SG&A expenses

as previously discussed, and the absence of a
    $4.6 million construction completion fee recognized in 2005
    related to our investment in Gulfstream.

2005 vs.

The $50.5 million, or 4 percent, increase in Gas
    Pipeline

revenues

is due primarily to $86 million
    higher revenues associated with exchange imbalance cash-out
    settlements (offset in

costs and operating expenses

).
    Partially offsetting this increase is $24 million lower
    transportation revenues due primarily to the termination of the
    Grays Harbor contract, and $11 million lower revenues
    associated with reimbursable costs, which are passed through to
    customers (offset in

costs and operating expenses

and

SG&A expenses

).

Costs and operating expenses

increased $109 million,
    or 16 percent, due primarily to:

•

An increase in costs of $86 million associated with
    exchange imbalances (offset in

revenues

);

•

The increase in costs of $32.1 million due to prior period
    accounting and valuation corrections related to inventory, as
    previously discussed;

•

An increase in operating and maintenance expense of
    $14 million due primarily to increased contract service
    costs, materials and supplies and rental fees;

•

The increase in costs of $5.2 million due to an accrual for
    contingent refund obligations, as previously discussed.



Partially offsetting these increases are decreases due to:

•

Income of $14.2 million associated with the resolution of
    the litigation related to recovery of gas costs;

•

The cost reduction of $12.1 million due to adjusting the
    carrying value of certain liabilities, as previously discussed;

•

Lower reimbursable costs of $5 million (offset in

revenues

).

SG&A expenses

decreased approximately
    $38 million, or 31 percent, due to the
    $17.1 million reduction in pension costs to correct a prior
    period error, $6 million lower reimbursable costs (offset
    in

revenues

), and the reversal of $5.6 million of
    prior period accruals.

Comparative

segment profit

is unchanged from 2004. The
    following are significant components of 2005 segment profit:

•

The reduction in pension costs of $17.1 million to correct
    a prior period error, as previously discussed;

•

An increase in Gulfstream equity earnings of $14 million
    due to the realization of a $4.6 million construction fee
    award on the completion of the Phase II expansion project
    coupled with increased revenues associated with the Gulfstream
    expansions;

•

Income of $14.2 million from the reversal of the
    contingency related to recovery of gas costs;

•

The $17.7 million reversal of prior period accruals;

•

The increase in costs of $32.1 million due to prior period
    accounting and valuation corrections related to inventory;

•

An increase in operating and maintenance expense of
    $14 million due primarily to increased contract service
    costs, materials and supplies and rental fees;

Midstream
    Gas & Liquids

Overview
    of 2006

Midstream’s ongoing strategy is to safely and reliably
    operate large-scale midstream infrastructure where our assets
    can be fully utilized and drive low

per-unit

costs. Our business is focused on consistently attracting new
    business by providing highly reliable service to our customers.

Significant events during 2006 included the following:

Favorable
    commodity price margins

The actual realized NGL per unit margins at our processing
    plants exceeded Midstream’s rolling five-year average for
    the last four quarters. The geographic diversification of
    Midstream assets contributed significantly to our actual
    realized unit margins resulting in margins generally greater
    than that of the industry benchmarks for gas processed in the
    Henry Hub area and fractionated and sold at Mont Belvieu. The
    largest impact was realized at our western United States gas
    processing plants, which benefited from lower regional market
    natural gas prices. During 2006, NGL production rebounded from
    levels experienced in fourth-quarter 2005 in response to
    improved gas processing spreads as crude prices, which correlate
    to NGL prices, averaged $66 per barrel and natural gas
    prices decreased.

Expansion
    efforts in growth areas

Consistent with our strategy, we continued to expand our
    midstream operations where we have large-scale assets in growth
    basins.

We continued construction at our existing gas processing plant
    located near Opal, Wyoming, to add a fifth cryogenic train
    capable of processing up to 350 MMcf/d, bringing total Opal
    capacity to approximately 1,450 MMcf/d. This plant
    expansion is being placed into service during the first quarter
    of 2007 to begin processing gas from the Pinedale Anticline
    field.

Also, we continued construction on a

37-mile

extension of our oil and gas pipelines from our Devils Tower
    spar to the Blind Faith prospect located in Mississippi Canyon.
    This extension, estimated to cost approximately
    $200 million, is expected to be ready for service by the
    second quarter of 2008.

In May 2006, we entered into an agreement to develop new
    pipeline capacity for transporting natural gas liquids from
    production areas in southwestern Wyoming to central Kansas. The
    other party to the agreement reimbursed us for the development
    costs we incurred to date for the proposed pipeline and
    initially will own 99 percent of the pipeline, known as
    Overland Pass Pipeline Company, LLC. We retained a
    1 percent interest and have the option to increase our
    ownership to 50 percent and become the operator within two
    years of the pipeline becoming operational.

Start-up

is
    planned for early 2008. Additionally, we have agreed to dedicate
    our equity NGL volumes from our two Wyoming plants for transport
    under a long-term shipping agreement. The terms represent
    significant savings compared with the existing tariff and other
    alternatives considered.

Williams
    Partners L.P. acquires Four Corners gathering and processing
    business

In June 2006, Williams Partners L.P. acquired 25.1 percent
    of our interest in Williams Four Corners LLC for
    $360 million. The acquisition was completed after Williams
    Partners L.P. closed a $150 million private debt offering
    of senior unsecured notes due 2011 and an equity offering of
    approximately $225 million in net proceeds. In December
    2006, Williams Partners L.P. acquired the remaining
    74.9 percent interest in Williams Four Corners LLC for
    $1.223 billion. The acquisition was completed after
    Williams Partners L.P. closed a $600 million private debt
    offering of senior unsecured notes due 2017, a private equity
    offering of approximately $350 million of common and
    Class B units, and a public equity offering of
    approximately $294 million in net proceeds. Williams Four
    Corners LLC owns certain gathering, processing and treating
    assets in the San Juan basin in Colorado and New Mexico.

We currently own approximately 22.5 percent of Williams
    Partners L.P., including the interests of the general partner,
    which is wholly owned by us. Considering the presumption of
    control of the general partner in accordance



with EITF Issue

No. 04-5,

Williams Partners L.P. is consolidated within the Midstream
    segment. (See Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements.) Midstream’s segment profit includes
    100 percent of Williams Partners L.P.’s segment
    profit, with the minority interest’s share deducted below
    segment profit. The debt and equity issued by Williams Partners
    L.P. is reported as a component of our consolidated debt balance
    and minority interest balance, respectively.

Gulf
    Coast operations return to normal after 2005’s
    hurricanes

In 2005, Hurricanes Dennis, Katrina and Rita caused temporary
    shut-downs of most of our facilities and our producers’
    facilities in the Gulf Coast region, which reduced product flows
    in the second half of 2005. Our major facilities resumed normal
    operations shortly after the passage of each hurricane except
    for our Devils Tower spar which returned to service in early
    November 2005 and our Cameron Meadows gas processing plant which
    returned to partial service in February 2006 and achieved full
    service in January 2007. Generally, overall product flows
    returned to pre-hurricane levels during the first quarter of
    2006.

Gulf
    Liquids litigation

We recorded pre-tax charges totalling $94.7 million
    resulting from jury verdicts in civil litigation. (See
    Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.)
    These charges reflect our estimated exposure for actual damages
    of $72.7 million, including estimated legal fees of
    $4.7 million, and potential pre-judgment interest of
    $22 million. Midstream Other segment profit reflects the
    $72.7 million charge for the estimated actual damages and
    legal fees. The matter is related to a contractual dispute
    surrounding construction in 2000 and 2001 of certain refinery
    off-gas processing facilities by Gulf Liquids. In addition, it
    is reasonably possible that any ultimate judgment may include
    additional amounts of $199 million in excess of our
    accrual, which represents our estimate of potential punitive
    damage exposure under Texas law. The jury verdicts are subject
    to trial and appellate court review. Entry of a judgment in the
    trial court is expected in the second or third quarter of 2007.
    If the trial court enters a judgment consistent with the
    jury’s verdicts against us, we will seek a reversal through
    appeal.

Outlook
    for 2007

The following factors could impact our business in 2007 and
    beyond.

•

As evidenced in recent years, natural gas and crude oil markets
    are highly volatile. NGL margins earned at our gas processing
    plants in the last four quarters were above our rolling
    five-year average, due to global economics maintaining high
    crude prices which correlate to strong NGL prices in
    relationship to natural gas prices. Forecasted domestic demand
    for ethylene and propylene, whose feedstock are ethane and
    propane, along with political instability in many of the key oil
    producing countries will continue to support unit margins in
    2007 exceeding our rolling five-year average. We do not expect
    to achieve the record levels we experienced in 2006.

•

Margins in our olefins unit are highly dependent upon continued
    economic growth within the U.S. and any significant slow down in
    the economy would reduce the demand for the petrochemical
    products we produce in both Canada and the U.S. Based on
    recent market price forecasts, we anticipate olefins unit
    margins to be slightly lower than 2006 levels.

•

Gathering and processing revenues at our facilities are expected
    to be at or above levels of previous years due to continued
    strong drilling activities in our core basins.

•

Revenues from deepwater production areas are often subject to
    risks associated with the interruption and timing of product
    flows which can be influenced by weather and other third-party
    operational issues.

•

We will continue to invest in facilities in the growth basins in
    which we provide services. We expect continued expansion of our
    gathering and processing systems in our Gulf Coast and West
    regions to keep pace with increased demand for our services.

•

We expect continued growth in the deepwater areas of the Gulf of
    Mexico to contribute to, and become a larger component of, our
    future segment revenues and segment profit. We expect these
    additional fee-



based revenues to lower our proportionate exposure to commodity
    price risks. We expect revenues from our deepwater production
    areas to decrease as volumes decline in 2007 and increase in
    2008 as the extension of our oil and gas pipelines from our
    Devils Tower spar to the Blind Faith prospect is placed into
    service.

•

In 2007 we will begin construction on our Perdido Norte project
    which includes oil and gas lines that expand the scale of our
    existing infrastructure in the western deepwater of the Gulf of
    Mexico. Additionally, we will be expanding our Markham gas
    processing facility to adequately serve this new gas production.
    The project is estimated to cost approximately $480 million
    and be in service in the third quarter of 2009.

•

We are currently negotiating with our customer in Venezuela to
    resolve approximately $14 million in past due invoices
    related to labor escalation charges. The customer is not
    disputing the index used to calculate these charges and we have
    calculated the charges according to the terms of the contract.
    The customer does, however, believe the index has resulted in a
    disproportionate escalation over time. We believe the
    receivables, net of associated reserves, are fully collectible.
    Although we believe our negotiations will be successful, failure
    to resolve this matter could ultimately trigger default
    noncompliance provisions in the services agreement.

•

The Venezuelan government continues its public criticism of
    U.S. economic and political policy, has implemented
    unilateral changes to existing energy related contracts,
    continues to publicly declare that additional energy contracts
    will be unilaterally amended, and that privately held assets
    will be expropriated, indicating that a level of political risk
    still remains.

2006 vs.

The $892.0 million increase in

segment revenues

is
    largely due to:

•

A $561 million increase in crude marketing revenues, which
    is offset by a similar change in costs, resulting from
    additional deepwater production coming on-line in November 2005;

•

A $165 million increase in revenues associated with the
    production of NGLs, primarily due to higher NGL prices combined
    with higher volumes;

•

A $137 million increase in the marketing of NGLs and
    olefins, which is offset by a similar change in costs;

•

An $83 million increase in fee-based revenues including
    $52 million in higher production handling revenues;



•

A $44 million increase in revenues in our olefins unit due
    to higher volumes.

These increases were partially offset by an $84 million
    reduction in NGL revenues due to a change in classification of
    NGL transportation and fractionation expenses from costs of
    goods sold to net revenues (offset in costs and operating
    expenses).

Segment costs and expenses

increased $707.3 million
    primarily as a result of:

•

A $561 million increase in crude marketing purchases, which
    is offset by a similar change in revenues;

•

A $137 million increase in NGL and olefins marketing
    purchases, offset by a similar change in revenues;

•

An $82 million increase in operating expenses including a
    $10.6 million accounts payable accrual adjustment, higher
    system losses, depreciation, insurance expense, personnel and
    related benefit expenses, turbine overhauls, materials and
    supplies, compression and post-hurricane inspection and survey
    costs required by a government agency;

•

A $59 million increase in other expense including the
    $68 million estimated exposure for actual damages for the
    Gulf Liquids litigation, partially offset by a $9 million
    favorable settlement of a contract dispute;

•

A $20 million increase in costs associated with production
    in our olefins unit.

These increases were partially offset by:

•

An $84 million reduction in NGL transportation and
    fractionation expenses due to the above-noted change in
    classification (offset in revenues);

•

A $77 million decrease in plant fuel and costs associated
    with the production of NGLs due primarily to lower gas prices.

The $187.1 million increase in Midstream

segment profit

is primarily due to higher NGL margins, higher deepwater
    production handling revenues, higher gathering and processing
    revenues, higher margins from our olefins unit, and a settlement
    of an international contract dispute, largely offset by the
    $72.7 million charge related to the Gulf Liquids litigation
    contingency combined with higher operating costs and lower
    margins related to the marketing of olefins and NGLs. A more
    detailed analysis of the

segment profit

of
    Midstream’s various operations is presented as follows.

Domestic
    gathering & processing

The $247.1 million increase in

domestic gathering and
    processing segment profit

includes a $143 million
    increase in the West region and a $104 million increase in
    the Gulf Coast region.

The $143 million increase in our West region’s

segment profit

primarily results from higher product
    margins and higher gathering and processing revenues, partially
    offset by higher operating expenses. The significant components
    of this increase include the following:

•

NGL margins increased $166 million compared to 2005. This
    increase was driven by a decrease in costs associated with the
    production of NGLs, an increase in average per unit NGL prices
    and higher volumes resulting from lower NGL recoveries during
    the fourth quarter of 2005 caused by intermittent periods of
    uneconomical market commodity prices and a power outage and
    associated operational issues at our Opal, Wyoming facility. NGL
    margins are defined as NGL revenues less BTU replacement cost,
    plant fuel, transportation and fractionation expense.

•

Gathering and processing fee revenues increased
    $26 million. Gathering fees are higher as a result of
    higher average

per-unit

gathering rates. Processing volumes are higher due to customers
    electing to take liquids and pay processing fees.

•

Operating expenses increased $51 million including
    $11 million in higher net system product losses as a result
    of system gains in 2005 compared to losses in 2006, a
    $7 million accounts payable accrual adjustment;
    $8 million in higher personnel and related benefit
    expenses; $6 million in higher materials



and supplies; $6 million in higher gathering fuel,
    $4 million in higher leased compression costs;
    $4 million in higher turbine overhaul costs; and
    $4 million in higher depreciation.

The $104 million increase in the Gulf Coast region’s

segment profit

is primarily a result of higher NGL
    margins, higher volumes from our deepwater facilities, partially
    offset by higher operating expenses. The significant components
    of this increase include the following:

•

NGL margins increased $77 million compared to 2005. This
    increase was driven by an increase in average per unit NGL
    prices and a decrease in costs associated with the production of
    NGLs.

•

Fee revenues from our deepwater assets increased
    $52 million as a result of $51 million in higher
    volumes flowing across the Devils Tower facility and
    $22 million in higher Devils Tower

unit-of-production

rates recognized as a result of a new reserve study. These
    increases are partially offset by a $21 million decline in
    other gathering and production handling revenues due to volume
    declines in other areas.

•

Operating expenses increased $25 million primarily as a
    result of $12 million in higher insurance costs,
    $4 million in higher depreciation expense on our deepwater
    assets, $3 million in higher net system product losses as a
    result of lower gain volumes in 2006, $2 million in
    post-hurricane inspection and survey costs required by a
    government agency, and a $1 million accounts payable
    accrual adjustment.

Venezuela

Segment profit

for our Venezuela assets increased
    $3.7 million and includes $9 million resulting from
    the settlement of a contract dispute and $1 million in
    higher revenues due to higher natural gas volumes and prices at
    our compression facility. These are partially offset by
    $4 million in higher expenses related to higher insurance,
    personnel and contract labor costs and a $2 million
    increase in the reserve for uncollectible accounts.

Other

The $58.9 million decrease in

segment profit

of our
    other operations is largely due to the $72.7 million of
    charges related to the Gulf Liquids litigation contingency
    combined with $13 million in lower margins related to the
    marketing of olefins. The decrease also reflects
    $12 million in lower margins related to the marketing of
    NGLs due to more favorable changes in pricing while product was
    in transit during 2005 as compared to 2006. These were partially
    offset by $24 million in higher margins in our olefins
    unit, $7 million in higher earnings from our equity
    investment in Discovery Producer Services, L.L.C. (Discovery),
    $7 million in higher fractionation, storage and other fee
    revenues, and a $4 million favorable transportation
    settlement.

2005 vs.

The $350.1 million increase in

segment revenues

is
    largely due to:

•

A $196 million increase in crude marketing revenues, which
    is offset by a similar change in costs, resulting from the start
    up of a deepwater pipeline in the second quarter of 2004;

•

A $72 million increase in revenues associated with
    production of NGLs, primarily due to $180 million in higher
    NGL prices partially offset by $108 million in lower sales
    volumes. The decline in sales volumes in our Gulf Coast region
    is largely due to the impact of summer hurricanes, while the
    decline in the West region is largely due to the higher levels
    of NGL rejection as well as maintenance issues with our gas
    processing facility at Opal, Wyoming;

•

A $58 million increase in the marketing of NGLs, which is
    offset by a similar change in costs, resulting from higher
    prices and additional spot sales;

•

A $21 million increase in fee-based revenues in part due to
    higher customer production volumes flowing to our West region
    and deepwater assets.

Costs and operating expenses

increased
    $364.1 million primarily as a result of:

•

A $196 million increase in crude marketing purchases, which
    is offset by a similar change in revenues;



•

A $92 million increase in costs related to the production
    of NGLs as a result of $100 million in higher natural gas
    purchases due largely to higher prices, partially offset by
    lower volumes;

•

A $58 million increase related to the marketing of NGLs and
    additional spot purchases, which is offset by a similar change
    in revenues;

•

A $33 million increase in operating expenses mostly due to
    higher fuel expense and commodity costs associated with our NGL
    storage and fractionation business and higher depreciation
    expense.

The $78.5 million decline in Midstream

segment profit

is primarily due to the absence of the $93.6 million
    gain from the Gulf Liquids’ insurance arbitration award in
    2004. The offsetting increase in segment profit is primarily due
    to higher fee revenues from our domestic gathering and
    processing and Venezuela businesses and higher earnings from our
    investment in the Discovery partnership, partially offset by
    lower NGL margins and higher operating costs. A more detailed
    analysis of the segment profit of Midstream’s various
    operations is presented below.

Domestic
    gathering & processing

The $6.1 million decrease in

domestic gathering and
    processing segment profit

includes a $30 million
    decline in the Gulf Coast region, largely offset by a
    $24 million increase in the West region.

The $24 million increase in our West region’s

segment profit

primarily results from higher gathering
    and processing fee revenues, and the absence of an asset
    write-down and other 2004 charges, offset partially by higher
    operating expenses and lower NGL margins. The significant
    drivers to these items are as follows:

•

Gathering and processing fee revenues increased $18 million
    primarily as a result of higher average

per-unit

gathering and processing rates and higher volumes in the Rocky
    Mountain production area due to increased drilling activity. A
    portion of this increase is also due to the increase in volumes
    subject to fee-based processing contracts.

•

A favorable variance due to the absence of the write-down of
    $7.6 million for an idle treating facility in 2004.

•

NGL margins decreased $6 million due to a $17 million
    impact from lower sales volumes resulting from lower fourth
    quarter 2005 NGL recoveries caused by intermittent periods of
    uneconomical market commodity prices and a power outage and
    associated operational issues at our Opal, Wyoming facility. NGL
    margins are defined as NGL revenues less BTU replacement cost,
    plant fuel, transportation and fractionation expense. The impact
    of lower volumes is partially offset by an $11 million
    impact of higher per unit NGL margins.

The $30 million decrease in the Gulf Coast region’s

segment profit

is primarily a result of higher operating
    and depreciation expenses and lower NGL margins. The significant
    components of this decline include the following:

•

Operating expenses increased $10 million primarily due to
    higher maintenance expenses related to our gathering assets,
    compressor overhauls, and an increase in hurricane-related costs
    of $2 million. Inspection and repair expenses related to
    the hurricanes were recorded as incurred up to the level of our
    insurance deductible.

•

Depreciation expense increased $13 million primarily due to
    placing in service our Devils Tower spar and associated
    deepwater gas and oil pipelines in May and June 2004,
    respectively.

•

NGL margins declined $14 million due to lower volumes,
    largely due to the impact of summer hurricanes, and the increase
    in natural gas prices. While revenues from the Devils Tower
    deepwater facility are recognized as volumes are delivered over
    the life of the reserves, cash payments from our customers are
    based on a contractual fixed fee received over a defined term.
    As a result, $44 million of cash received in 2005, which is
    included in cash flow from operations, was deferred at
    December 31, 2005 and will be recognized as revenue in
    periods subsequent to 2005. The total amount deferred for all
    years as of December 31, 2005 was $80 million.



Venezuela

Segment profit

for our Venezuela assets increased
    $9.1 million as a result of higher plant volumes and higher
    equity earnings from our investment in the ACCROVEN partnership.
    The higher equity earnings are largely due to the renegotiation
    of a power supply contract and the absence of 2004 legal fees
    associated with the Jose Terminal.

Other

The $71.7 million decrease in

segment profit

of our
    other operations is largely due to the absence of the
    $93.6 million gain from the Gulf Liquids’ insurance
    arbitration award and a $9.5 million gain on the sale of
    the Choctaw ethylene distribution assets in 2004 partially
    offset by $7 million in higher olefins and commodity
    margins, $6 million in higher earnings from our equity
    investment in the Discovery partnership, and the absence of a
    2004 $16.9 million impairment charge also related to our
    equity investment in the Discovery partnership.

Indirect
    general and administrative expense

The $9.8 million unfavorable variance for our

indirect
    general and administrative expenses

is primarily due to
    higher employee expenses and administrative costs associated
    with the creation of Williams Partners L.P.

Power

Overview
    of 2006

Power’s operating results for 2006 reflect an accrual gross
    margin loss on its nonderivative tolling contracts. Power’s
    results in 2006 were also influenced by a decrease in forward
    power prices against a net long derivative position, which
    caused net forward unrealized

mark-to-market

(MTM) losses. Power’s results do not reflect, however, cash
    flows that Power realized in 2006 from hedges for which

mark-to-market

gains or losses had been previously recognized.

In 2006, Power continued to focus on its objectives of
    minimizing financial risk, maximizing cash flow, meeting
    contractual commitments, executing new contracts to hedge its
    portfolio and providing services that support our natural gas
    businesses.

Outlook
    for 2007

For 2007, Power intends to service its customers’ needs
    while increasing the certainty of cash flows from its long-term
    tolling contracts by executing new long-term electricity and
    capacity sales contracts. In the first quarter of 2007, Power
    executed agreements to sell dispatch and tolling rights and
    supply natural gas in southern California for periods through
    2011. These contracts mirror Power’s rights under its
    California tolling agreement and represent up to
    1,920 megawatts of power.

As Power continues to apply hedge accounting in 2007, its future
    earnings may be less volatile. However, not all of Power’s
    derivative contracts qualify for hedge accounting. Application
    of hedge accounting requires quantitative and qualitative
    analysis. To qualify for hedge accounting, Power must assess
    derivatives for their expected effectiveness in offsetting the
    risk being hedged. In addition, it must assess whether the
    hedged forecasted transaction is probable of occurring. If Power
    no longer expects the hedge to be highly effective, or if it
    believes that the hedged forecasted transaction is no longer
    probable of occurring, it would discontinue hedge accounting
    prospectively and recognize future changes in fair value
    directly to earnings.

Because certain derivative contracts qualifying for hedge
    accounting were previously

marked-to-market

through earnings prior to their designation as cash flow hedges,
    the amounts recognized in future earnings under hedge accounting
    will not necessarily align with the expected cash flows to be
    realized from the settlement of those derivatives. For example,
    future earnings may reflect losses from underlying transactions,
    such as natural gas purchases and power sales associated with
    our tolling contracts, which have been hedged by derivatives. A
    portion of the offsetting gains from these hedges, however, has
    already been recognized in prior periods under

mark-to-market

accounting. So, while earnings in a reported period may not
    reflect the full amount realized from our hedges, cash flows
    will continue to reflect the total amount from both the hedged
    transactions and the



hedges. In 2006, 2005 and 2004 Power had positive cash flows
    from operations, and expects to continue to have positive cash
    flows from operations in 2007.

Even with the application of hedge accounting, Power’s
    earnings will continue to reflect

mark-to-market

volatility from unrealized gains and losses resulting from:

•

Market movements of commodity-based derivatives that represent
    economic hedges but which do not qualify for hedge accounting;

•

Ineffectiveness of cash flow hedges, primarily caused by
    locational differences between the hedging derivative and the
    hedged item or changes in the creditworthiness of counterparties;

•

Market movements of commodity-based derivatives that are held
    for trading purposes.

The fair value of Power’s tolling, full requirements,
    transportation, storage and transmission contracts is not
    reflected on the balance sheet since these contracts are not
    derivatives. Some of these contracts have a significant negative
    estimated fair value and could result in future operating
    losses. Power’s estimate of fair value may differ
    significantly from a third party’s estimate. Power’s
    estimate of fair value is based on internal valuation
    assumptions, which include assumptions of natural gas prices,
    electricity prices, price volatility, correlation of gas and
    electricity, and many other inputs. Some of these assumptions
    are readily available in the market, while others are not.

Key factors that may influence Power’s financial condition
    and operating performance include:

•

Prices of power and natural gas, including changes in the margin
    between power and natural gas prices;

•

Changes in power and natural gas price volatility;

•

Changes in power and natural gas supply and demand;

•

Changes in the regulatory environment;

•

The inability of counterparties to perform under contractual
    obligations due to their own credit constraints;

•

Changes in interest rates;

•

Changes in market liquidity, including changes in the ability to
    effectively hedge commodity price risk;

•

The inability to apply hedge accounting.

2006 vs.

The $1.4 billion decrease in

realized revenues

is
    primarily due to a decrease in power and natural gas realized
    revenues. Realized revenues represent (1) revenue from the
    sale of commodities or completion of energy-related services and
    (2) gains and losses from the net financial settlement of
    derivative contracts.

Power and natural gas realized revenues decreased primarily due
    to a 20 percent decrease in power sales volumes and a
    17 percent decrease in average natural gas sales prices.
    Power sales volumes decreased because certain long-term physical
    contracts were not replaced due to reducing the scope of trading
    activities subsequent to 2002.

Net forward unrealized

mark-to-market

gains (losses)

represent changes in the fair values of
    certain derivative contracts with a future settlement or
    delivery date that have not been designated as cash flow hedges
    and the impact of the ineffectiveness of cash flow hedges. The
    effect of changes in forward prices on power contracts not
    designated as cash flow hedges primarily caused the
    $194.3 million decrease in

net forward unrealized

mark-to-market

gains (losses).

A 2005 increase in forward power prices
    caused gains on the net forward purchase position, while a 2006
    decrease in forward power prices caused losses on the net
    forward power purchase contracts.

The $1.5 billion decrease in Power’s

cost of sales

is primarily due to a 20 percent decrease in power
    purchase volumes and an 18 percent decrease in average
    natural gas purchase prices.

The decrease in

selling, general and administrative expenses

is due primarily to increased gains from the sale of certain
    Enron receivables to a third party. Power recognized a
    $24.8 million gain in 2006 compared to a $9.7 million
    gain in 2005.

Other (income) expense — net

in 2006 includes a
    $12.7 million reduction of contingent obligations
    associated with our former distributive power generation
    business.

Other (income) expense — net

in 2005 includes:

•

An $82.2 million accrual for estimated litigation
    contingencies, primarily associated with agreements reached to
    substantially resolve exposure related to natural gas price and
    volume reporting issues (see Note 15 of Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements);

•

A $4.6 million accrual for a regulatory settlement;

•

A $23 million impairment of an equity investment (see
    Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).

The decrease in

segment loss

is primarily due to
    favorable changes in

other (income) expense — net

described above, partially offset by a decrease in gross
    margin.

2005 vs.

The $164.8 million decrease in revenues includes a
    $32.9 million decrease in

realized revenues

and a
    $131.9 million decrease in

net forward unrealized
    mark-to -market gains (losses).

The $32.9 million decrease in

realized revenues

is
    primarily due to the absence in 2005 of $471 million in
    crude and refined products realized revenues, partially offset
    by a $444 million increase in power and natural gas
    realized revenues. The absence of crude and refined products
    revenues is due to the sale of the refined products business in
    2004. Power and natural gas realized revenues increased
    primarily due to a 33 percent increase in average natural
    gas sales prices and a 17 percent increase in average power
    sales prices. Hurricane Katrina, among other factors,
    contributed to the increase in prices. A 29 percent
    decrease in power sales volumes partially offsets the increase
    in prices. Power sales volumes decreased because Power did not
    replace certain long-term physical contracts that expired or
    were terminated and because of mild weather in California, which
    resulted in lower demand.

The $131.9 million decrease in

net forward unrealized

mark-to-market

gains (losses)

is primarily due to a $165 million
    decrease associated with power and gas derivative contracts,
    partially offset by the absence in 2005 of a $38 million
    unrealized loss on the interest rate portfolio in 2004.



The decrease in power and gas unrealized

mark-to-market

gains primarily results from the impact of cash flow hedge
    accounting, which was prospectively applied to certain of
    Power’s derivative contracts beginning October 1,
    2004. Net unrealized gains of $711 million related to the
    effective portion of the hedges are reported in

accumulated
    other comprehensive loss

in 2005 compared to
    $15 million in 2004. If Power had not applied cash flow
    hedge accounting in 2005, we would have reported the
    $711 million in

revenues

instead of in

accumulated other comprehensive loss.

Also in 2005, Power
    recognized losses of $6.8 million representing a correction
    of unrealized losses associated with a prior year. Our
    management concluded that the effects of this correction are not
    material to prior periods, 2005 results, or our trend of
    earnings. Partially offsetting these decreases is the effect of
    a greater increase in forward power prices on a greater volume
    of power purchase contracts in 2005 compared to 2004, resulting
    in increased unrealized

mark-to-market

gains on net power derivatives that are not accounted for as
    cash flow hedges.

The absence in 2005 of the unrealized loss on the interest rate
    portfolio is due to the termination and liquidation of all
    remaining interest-rate derivatives in fourth quarter 2004. A
    decrease in forward interest rates caused unrealized losses in
    the interest rate portfolio in 2004.

The $77 million increase in Power’s

cost of sales

is primarily due to an increase in power and natural gas
    costs of $563 million, partially offset by a decrease in
    crude and refined products costs of $486 million. Power and
    natural gas costs increased primarily due to a 32 percent
    increase in average power purchase prices and a 44 percent
    increase in average natural gas purchase prices, partially
    offset by a 29 percent decrease in power purchase volumes.
    Hurricane Katrina, among other factors, contributed to the
    increase in prices. Costs in 2005 include approximately
    $8 million in purchases due to an outage at an electric
    generating facility that Power has access to via a fuel
    conversion service agreement. A 2004 reduction to certain
    contingent loss accruals of $10.4 million associated with
    power marketing activities in California during 2000 and 2001
    also contributes to the increase in costs. Costs in 2004 include
    $486 million of crude and refined products costs, which are
    absent in 2005 due to the sale of the refined products business
    in 2004. Costs in 2004 also reflect a $13 million payment
    made to terminate a nonderivative power sales contract.

Selling, general and administrative expenses

decreased
    primarily due to decreased employee incentive compensation and
    decreased costs for outside services. A $9.7 million
    reduction of allowance for bad debts resulting from the sale of
    certain receivables to a third party also contributed to the
    decrease in

SG&A expenses.

SG&A
    expenses

in 2004 include a $6.3 million reduction of
    allowance for bad debts resulting from a 2004 settlement with
    certain California utilities.

Other (income) expense — net

in 2004 includes
    $6.1 million in fees paid related to the sale of certain
    receivables to a third party.

Although increased gas prices favorably impacted the fair value
    of Power’s derivative natural gas hedges, the
    $333.4 million change from a

segment profit

to a

segment loss

is primarily due to the impact of cash flow
    hedge accounting. Additionally, plant outages and depressed
    margin spreads between the cost of gas and sales price of
    electricity contributed to lower

segment profit.

Accruals
    in 2005 for litigation contingencies and an impairment of an
    equity investment also contributed to the change in

segment
    profit (loss).

Partially offsetting the decrease in

segment profit

is the absence in 2005 of unrealized and
    realized losses from the interest rate portfolio, which was
    liquidated in the fourth quarter of 2004.

Other

Overview
    of 2006

While we continue to have an equity ownership interest in
    Longhorn, the management of Longhorn completed an asset sale of
    the pipeline during the third quarter of 2006. As a result, we
    received full payment of the $10 million secured bridge
    loan that we provided Longhorn during 2005. The carrying value
    of our equity investment in Longhorn is zero as of
    December 31, 2006.

We continue to receive payments associated with the 2005
    transfer of the Longhorn operating agreement to a third party.
    These payments totaled approximately $3.3 million for the
    year ended December 31, 2006. Any ongoing



payments received or through monetization of the contract will
    be recognized as income when received. These ongoing payments
    were not impacted by the sale of the pipeline.

As the table above illustrates, we are not materially engaged in
    trading activities. However, we hold a substantial portfolio of
    nontrading derivative contracts. Nontrading derivative contracts
    are those that hedge or could possibly hedge forecasted
    transactions on an economic basis. We have designated certain of
    these contracts as cash flow hedges of Power’s forecasted
    purchases of gas, its purchases and sales of power related to
    its long-term structured contracts and owned generation, and
    Exploration & Production’s forecasted sales of
    natural gas production. Certain of Power’s other
    derivatives have not been designated as or do not qualify as
    SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative
    Instruments and Hedging Activities”
    (SFAS 133) cash flow hedges. The chart below reflects
    the fair value of derivatives held for nontrading purposes as of
    December 31, 2006, for the Power and Exploration &
    Production businesses. Of the total fair value of nontrading
    derivatives, SFAS 133 cash flow hedges had a net asset
    value of $360 million as of December 31, 2006, which
    includes the existing fair value of the derivatives at the time
    of their designation as SFAS 133 cash flow hedges.

Methods
    of Estimating Fair Value

Most of the derivatives we hold settle in active periods and
    markets in which quoted market prices are available. These
    include futures contracts, option contracts, swap agreements and
    physical commodity purchases and sales in the commodity markets
    in which we transact. While an active market may not exist for
    the entire period, quoted prices can generally be obtained for
    natural gas through 2012 and power through 2011.

These prices reflect current economic and regulatory conditions
    and may change because of market conditions. The availability of
    quoted market prices in active markets varies between periods
    and commodities based upon changes in market conditions. The
    ability to obtain quoted market prices also varies greatly from
    region to region. The time periods noted above are an estimation
    of aggregate availability of quoted prices. An immaterial
    portion of our total net derivative value of $436 million
    relates to periods in which active quotes cannot be obtained. We
    estimate energy commodity prices in these illiquid periods by
    incorporating information about commodity prices in actively
    quoted markets, quoted prices in less active markets, and other
    market fundamental analysis. Modeling and other valuation
    techniques, however, are not used significantly in determining
    the fair value of our derivatives.

Counterparty
    Credit Considerations

We include an assessment of the risk of counterparty
    nonperformance in our estimate of fair value for all contracts.
    Such assessment considers (1) the credit rating of each
    counterparty as represented by public rating agencies such as
    Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s Investors
    Service, (2) the inherent default probabilities within
    these ratings, (3) the regulatory environment that the
    contract is subject to and (4) the terms of each individual
    contract.

Risks surrounding counterparty performance and credit could
    ultimately impact the amount and timing of expected cash flows.
    We continually assess this risk. We have credit protection
    within various agreements to call on additional collateral
    support if necessary. At December 31, 2006, we held
    collateral support, including letters of credit, of
    $695 million.

We also enter into master netting agreements to mitigate
    counterparty performance and credit risk. During 2006 and 2005,
    we did not incur any significant losses due to recent
    counterparty bankruptcy filings.

The gross credit exposure from our derivative contracts as of
    December 31, 2006, is summarized below.

We determine investment grade primarily using publicly available

    Standard & Poor’s rating of BBB- or Moody’s
    Investors Service rating of Baa3 in investment grade. We also
    classify counterparties that have provided sufficient
    collateral, such as cash, standby letters of credit, adequate
    parent company guarantees, and property interests, as investment
    grade.

Trading
    Policy

We have policies and procedures that govern our trading and risk
    management activities. These policies cover authority and
    delegation thereof in addition to control requirements,
    authorized commodities and term and exposure limitations.
    Power’s

value-at-risk

is limited in aggregate and calculated at a 95 percent

Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition

Outlook

We believe we have, or have access to, the financial resources
    and liquidity necessary to meet future requirements for working
    capital, capital and investment expenditures and debt payments
    while maintaining a sufficient level of liquidity to reasonably
    protect against unforeseen circumstances requiring the use of
    funds. In 2007, we expect to maintain liquidity from cash and
    cash equivalents and unused revolving credit facilities of at
    least $1 billion. We maintain adequate liquidity to manage
    margin requirements related to significant movements in
    commodity prices, unplanned capital spending needs, near term
    scheduled debt payments, and litigation and other settlements.
    We expect to fund capital and investment expenditures, debt
    payments, dividends, and working capital requirements through
    cash flow from operations, which is currently estimated to be
    between $2 billion and $2.3 billion in 2007, proceeds
    from debt issuances and sales of units of Williams Partners
    L.P., as well as cash and cash equivalents on hand as needed.

We enter 2007 positioned for growth through disciplined
    investments in our natural gas businesses. Examples of this
    planned growth include:

•

Exploration & Production will continue to maintain its
    development drilling program in its key basins of Piceance,
    Powder River, San Juan, Arkoma, and Fort Worth. During
    2006, all ten

state-of-the-art

FlexRig4

®

drilling rigs were placed in service in the Piceance basin
    pursuant to our March 2005 contract with Helmerich &
    Payne. Each rig is leased for three years.

•

Gas Pipeline will continue to expand its system to meet the
    demand of growth markets.

•

Midstream will continue to pursue significant deepwater
    production commitments and expand capacity in the western United
    States.

We estimate capital and investment expenditures will total
    approximately $2.2 billion to $2.4 billion in 2007. As
    a result of increasing our development drilling program,
    $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion of the total estimated



capital expenditures is related to Exploration &
    Production. Also within the total estimated expenditures for
    2007 is approximately $215 million to $270 million for
    maintenance-related projects at Gas Pipeline, including pipeline
    replacement and Clean Air Act compliance. Commitments for
    construction and acquisition of property, plant and equipment
    are approximately $406 million at December 31, 2006.

Potential risks associated with our planned levels of liquidity
    and the planned capital and investment expenditures discussed
    above include:

•

Lower than expected levels of cash flow from operations due to
    commodity pricing volatility. To mitigate this exposure,
    Exploration & Production has economically hedged the
    price of natural gas for approximately 172 MMcfe per day of
    its expected 2007 production. In addition, Exploration &
    Production has collar agreements for each month of 2007 which
    hedge approximately 270 MMcfe per day of expected 2007
    production. Power has entered into various sales contracts that
    economically cover substantially all of its fixed demand
    obligations through 2010.

•

Sensitivity of margin requirements associated with our
    marginable commodity contracts. As of December 31, 2006, we
    estimate our exposure to additional margin requirements through
    2007 to be no more than $521 million, using a statistical
    analysis at a 99 percent confidence level.

•

Exposure associated with our efforts to resolve regulatory and
    litigation issues (see Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements).

In August 2006, the Pension Protection Act of 2006 was signed
    into law. The Act makes significant changes to the requirements
    for employer-sponsored retirement plans, including revisions
    affecting the funding of defined benefit pension plans beginning
    in 2008. We are assessing the impact of the legislation on our
    future funding requirements, but do not expect a significant
    increase in required contributions over current levels, assuming
    long-term rates of return on assets and current discount rates
    do not experience a significant decline.

Overview

In November 2005, we initiated an offer to induce conversion of
    up to $300 million of the 5.5 percent junior
    subordinated convertible debentures into our common stock. The
    conversion was executed in January 2006 and approximately
    $220.2 million of the debentures were exchanged for common
    stock. We paid $25.8 million in premiums that are included
    in

early debt retirement costs

in the Consolidated
    Statement of Income. See Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements for further information.

In April 2006, Transco issued $200 million aggregate
    principal amount of 6.4 percent senior unsecured notes due
    2016 to certain institutional investors in a private debt
    placement to fund general corporate expenses and capital
    expenditures. In October 2006, Transco completed an exchange of
    these notes for substantially identical new notes that are
    registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.

In April 2006, we retired a secured floating-rate term loan for
    $488.9 million, including outstanding principal and accrued
    interest. The loan was due in 2008 and secured by substantially
    all of the assets of Williams Production RMT Company. The loan
    was retired using a combination of cash and revolving credit
    borrowings.

In May 2006, we replaced our $1.275 billion secured
    revolving credit facility with a $1.5 billion unsecured
    revolving credit facility. The new facility contains similar
    terms and financial covenants as the secured facility, but
    contains certain additional restrictions. (See Note 11 of
    Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.)

In June 2006, Northwest Pipeline issued $175 million
    aggregate principal amount of 7 percent senior unsecured
    notes due 2016 to certain institutional investors in a private
    debt placement to fund general corporate expenses and capital
    expenditures. In October 2006, Northwest Pipeline completed an
    exchange of these notes for substantially identical new notes
    that are registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.

In June 2006, we reached an

agreement-in-principle

to settle

class-action

securities litigation filed on behalf of purchasers of our
    securities between July 24, 2000 and July 22, 2002,
    for a total payment of $290 million to plaintiffs. On
    February 9, 2007, the court gave its final approval of the
    settlement. We recorded a pre-tax charge for approximately
    $161 million in second quarter 2006. Our portion of the
    total payment was $145 million.



On June 1, 2006, the FERC entered its final order (FERC
    Final Order) concerning the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System (TAPS)
    Quality Bank litigation. The Quality Bank Administrator will
    determine and invoice for amounts due based on the FERC Final
    Order, subject to the final disposition of the FERC Final Order
    appeals. We estimate that our net obligation could be as much as
    $116 million. (See Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements.)

In June 2006, Williams Partners L.P. acquired 25.1 percent
    of our interest in Williams Four Corners LLC for
    $360 million. The acquisition was completed after Williams
    Partners L.P. successfully closed a $150 million private
    debt offering of 7.5 percent senior unsecured notes due
    2011 and an equity offering of approximately $225 million
    in net proceeds. In December 2006, Williams Partners L.P.
    acquired the remaining 74.9 percent interest in Williams
    Four Corners LLC for $1.223 billion. The acquisition was
    completed after Williams Partners L.P. successfully closed a
    $600 million private debt offering of 7.25 percent
    senior unsecured notes due 2017, a private equity offering of
    approximately $350 million of common and Class B
    units, and a public equity offering of approximately
    $294 million in net proceeds. The debt and equity issued by
    Williams Partners L.P. is reported as a component of our
    consolidated debt balance and minority interest balance,
    respectively. Williams Four Corners LLC owns certain gathering,
    processing and treating assets in the San Juan Basin in
    Colorado and New Mexico.

Exploration & Production has recently entered into a
    five-year unsecured credit agreement with certain banks in order
    to reduce margin requirements related to our hedging activities
    as well as lower transaction fees. Margin requirements, if any,
    under this new facility are dependent on the level of hedging
    and on natural gas reserves value.

Credit
    ratings

On May 4, 2006, Standard & Poor’s raised our
    senior unsecured debt rating from a B+ to a BB- with a positive
    ratings outlook. With respect to Standard &
    Poor’s, a rating of “BBB” or above indicates an
    investment grade rating. A rating below “BBB”
    indicates that the security has significant speculative
    characteristics. A “BB” rating indicates that
    Standard & Poor’s believes the issuer has the
    capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation, but
    adverse business conditions could lead to insufficient ability
    to meet financial commitments. Standard & Poor’s
    may modify it’s ratings with a “+” or a
    “–” sign to show the obligor’s relative
    standing within a major rating category.

On June 7, 2006, Moody’s Investors Service raised our
    senior unsecured debt rating from a B1 to a Ba2 with a stable
    ratings outlook. With respect to Moody’s, a rating of
    “Baa” or above indicates an investment grade rating. A
    rating below “Baa” is considered to have speculative
    elements. A “Ba” rating indicates an obligation that
    is judged to have speculative elements and is subject to
    substantial credit risk. The “1”, “2” and
    “3” modifiers show the relative standing within a
    major category. A “1” indicates that an obligation
    ranks in the higher end of the broad rating category,
    “2” indicates a mid-range ranking, and “3”
    ranking at the lower end of the category.

On May 15, 2006, Fitch Ratings raised our senior unsecured
    rating from BB to BB+ with a stable ratings outlook. With
    respect to Fitch, a rating of “BBB” or above indicates
    an investment grade rating. A rating below “BBB” is
    considered speculative grade. A “BB” rating from Fitch
    indicates that there is a possibility of credit risk developing,
    particularly as the result of adverse economic change over time;
    however, business or financial alternatives may be available to
    allow financial commitments to be met. Fitch may add a
    “+” or a “–” sign to show the
    obligor’s relative standing within a major rating category.

Our goal is to attain investment grade ratios at some point in
    the future.

Liquidity

Our internal and external sources of liquidity include cash
    generated from our operations, bank financings, and proceeds
    from the issuance of long-term debt and equity securities, and
    proceeds from asset sales. While most of our sources are
    available to us at the parent level, others are available to
    certain of our subsidiaries, including equity and debt issuances
    from Williams Partners L.P. Our ability to raise funds in the
    capital markets will be impacted by our financial condition,
    interest rates, market conditions, and industry conditions.

    the extent not utilized by us, that we guarantee.

In addition to the above, Northwest Pipeline and Transco have
    shelf registration statements available for the issuance of up
    to $350 million aggregate principal amount of debt
    securities. The ability of Northwest Pipeline to utilize their
    registration statement to issue debt securities is restricted by
    certain covenants of its debt agreements. If the credit rating
    of Northwest Pipeline or Transco is below investment grade, they
    can only use their shelf registration statements to issue debt
    if such debt is guaranteed by us.

Williams Partners L.P. has a shelf registration statement
    available for the issuance of approximately $1.2 billion
    aggregate principal amount of debt and limited partnership unit
    securities.

In addition, at the parent-company level, we have a shelf
    registration statement that allows us to issue publicly
    registered debt and equity securities as needed. This
    registration statement, filed May 19, 2006, replaces our
    previously filed shelf registration.

Operating
    Activities

Our

net cash provided by operating activities

in 2006
    increased from 2005 due largely to higher operating income at
    Midstream, partially offset by a $145 million securities
    litigation settlement payment in fourth quarter 2006.

Our 2005

net cash provided by operating activities

decreased slightly from 2004. A primary driver in

net
    cash provided by operating activities

is

income from
    continuing operations,

which increased primarily as a result
    of higher gas production volumes and net average realized prices
    for production sold. Also contributing to the increase in income
    from continuing operations is the reduction in interest expense
    due to lower average borrowing levels.



Cash payments for interest decreased $224 million from
    2004. In addition to the changes in results of operations, net
    cash inflows from margin deposits and customer margin deposits
    payable decreased significantly from 2004. In 2004, our Power
    subsidiary issued a significant number of letters of credit to
    replace its cash margin deposits. As the letters of credit were
    issued, the counterparties returned our cash margin deposits to
    us. Due to fewer letters of credit being issued to replace cash
    margin deposits in 2005, we have fewer receipts of margin
    deposits than in 2004.

Other, including changes in noncurrent assets and
    liabilities,

includes contributions to our tax-qualified
    pension plans of $42.1 million in 2006, $52.1 million
    in 2005 and $136.8 million in 2004. It is our policy to
    make annual contributions to our tax-qualified pension plans in
    an amount at least equal to the greater of the actuarially
    computed annual normal cost plus any unfunded actuarial accrued
    liability, amortized over approximately five years, or the
    minimum required contribution under existing laws. Additional
    amounts may be contributed to increase the funded status of the
    plans. In an effort to strengthen our funded status and take
    advantage of strong cash flows, we contributed approximately
    $26.5 million, $41.1 million and $98.9 million
    more than our funding policy required in 2006, 2005 and 2004,
    respectively.

Financing
    Activities

During the first quarter of 2006, we paid $25.8 million in
    premiums for early debt retirement costs relating to the debt
    conversion previously discussed.

See Overview, within this section, for a discussion of 2006 debt
    issuances, debt retirement, and additional financing by Williams
    Partners L.P.

During January 2005, we retired $200 million of
    6.125 percent notes issued by Transco, which matured
    January 15, 2005. In the first quarter of 2005, we received
    approximately $273 million in

proceeds from the issuance
    of common stock

purchased under the FELINE PACS equity
    forward contracts. During August 2005, we completed an initial
    public offering of approximately 40 percent of our interest
    in Williams Partners L.P. resulting in net proceeds of
    $111 million.

During 2004, we repaid long-term debt through tender offers and
    early retirements. We also reduced our debt through our FELINE
    PACS exchange. This noncash exchange resulted in payments of
    fees and expenses reported as

premiums paid on tender offer,
    early debt retirements and FELINE PACS exchange.

Quarterly dividends paid on common stock increased from 7.5
    cents to 9 cents per common share during the second quarter of
    2006 and totaled $206.6 million for year ended
    December 31, 2006. For the fourth quarter of 2005,
    dividends paid on common stock were 7.5 cents per share and
    totaled $143 million for the year ended December 31,
    2005.

Investing
    Activities

During 2006, capital expenditures totaled $2,509.2 million
    and were primarily related to Exploration &
    Production’s increased drilling activity, mostly in the
    Piceance basin, and Northwest Pipeline’s capacity
    replacement project.

During 2006, we purchased $386.3 million and received
    $414.1 million from the sale of auction rate securities.
    These instruments are utilized as a component of our overall
    cash management program.

In January 2005, Northwest Pipeline received an
    $87.9 million contract termination payment, representing
    reimbursement of the net book value of the related assets.

In January 2005, we received approximately $54.7 million
    proceeds from the sale of our note with Williams Communications
    Group, our previously owned subsidiary (WilTel).

During 2005, we received $310.5 million in proceeds from
    the Gulfstream recapitalization.

In 2004, we sold all of our restricted investments resulting in
    proceeds of $851.4 million. When our $800 million
    revolving and letter of credit facility that required
    105 percent cash collateral was replaced with a new
    revolving credit facility in January 2005, we were no longer
    required to hold the restricted investments.



In 2004, we had numerous asset sales resulting in proceeds in
    2004 of $877.8 million.

Off-balance
    sheet financing arrangements and guarantees of debt or other
    commitments

In January 2005, we terminated our two unsecured revolving and
    letter of credit facilities totaling $500 million and
    replaced them with two new facilities that contain similar terms
    but fewer restrictions. In September 2005, we also entered into
    two new revolving and letter of credit facilities that have a
    similar structure. (See Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements.)

We have provided a guarantee for obligations of Williams
    Partners L.P. under the $1.5 billion unsecured revolving
    and letter of credit facility.

We have various other guarantees and commitments which are
    disclosed in Notes 3, 10, 11, 14, and 15 of Notes
    to Consolidated Financial Statements. We do not believe these
    guarantees or the possible fulfillment of them will prevent us
    from meeting our liquidity needs.

Effects
    of Inflation

Our operations in recent years have benefited from relatively
    low inflation rates. Approximately 46 percent of our gross
    property, plant and equipment is at Gas Pipeline and the
    remainder is at other operating units. Gas Pipeline is subject
    to regulation, which limits recovery to historical cost. While
    amounts in excess of historical cost are not recoverable under
    current FERC practices, we anticipate being allowed to recover
    and earn a return based on increased actual cost incurred to
    replace existing assets. Cost-based regulation, along with
    competition and other market factors, may limit our ability to
    recover such increased costs. For the other operating units,
    operating costs are influenced to a greater extent by both
    competition for specialized services and specific price changes
    in oil and natural gas and related commodities than by changes
    in general inflation. Crude, refined product, natural gas,
    natural gas liquids and power prices are particularly sensitive
    to OPEC production levels

and/or

the
    market perceptions concerning the supply and demand balance in
    the near future. However, our exposure to these price changes is
    reduced through the use of hedging instruments.

Environmental

We are a participant in certain environmental activities in
    various stages including assessment studies, cleanup operations

and/or

remedial processes at certain sites, some of which we currently
    do not own. (See Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements.) We are monitoring these sites in a coordinated
    effort with other potentially responsible parties, the
    U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), or other
    governmental authorities. We are jointly and severally liable
    along with unrelated third parties in some of these activities
    and solely responsible in others. Current estimates of the most
    likely costs of such activities are approximately
    $52 million, all of which are recorded as liabilities on
    our balance sheet at December 31, 2006. We will seek
    recovery of approximately $11 million of the accrued costs
    through future natural gas transmission rates. The remainder of
    these costs will be funded from operations. During 2006, we paid
    approximately $12 million for cleanup

and/or

remediation and monitoring activities. We expect to pay
    approximately $17 million in 2007 for these activities.
    Estimates of the most likely costs of cleanup are generally
    based on completed assessment studies, preliminary results of
    studies or our experience with other similar cleanup operations.
    At December 31, 2006, certain assessment studies were still
    in process for which the ultimate outcome may yield
    significantly different estimates of most likely costs.
    Therefore, the actual costs incurred will depend on the final
    amount, type and extent of contamination discovered at these
    sites, the final cleanup standards mandated by the EPA or other
    governmental authorities, and other factors.



We are subject to the federal Clean Air Act and to the federal
    Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, which require the EPA to issue
    new regulations. We are also subject to regulation at the state
    and local level. In September 1998, the EPA promulgated rules
    designed to mitigate the migration of ground-level ozone in
    certain states. In March 2004 and June 2004, the EPA promulgated
    additional regulation regarding hazardous air pollutants, which
    may impose additional controls. Capital expenditures necessary
    to install emission control devices on our Transco gas pipeline
    system to comply with rules were approximately $41 million
    in 2006 and are estimated to be between $35 million and
    $40 million through 2010. The actual costs incurred will
    depend on the final implementation plans developed by each state
    to comply with these regulations. We consider these costs on our
    Transco system associated with compliance with these
    environmental laws and regulations to be prudent costs incurred
    in the ordinary course of business and, therefore, recoverable
    through its rates.



Item 7A.

Qualitative
    and Quantitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Interest
    Rate Risk

Our current interest rate risk exposure is related primarily to
    our debt portfolio. The majority of our debt portfolio is
    comprised of fixed rate debt in order to mitigate the impact of
    fluctuations in interest rates. The maturity of our long-term
    debt portfolio is partially influenced by the expected lives of
    our operating assets.

The tables below provide information about our interest rate
    risk-sensitive instruments as of December 31, 2006 and
    2005. Long-term debt in the tables represents principal cash
    flows, net of (discount) premium, and weighted-average interest
    rates by expected maturity dates. The fair value of our publicly
    traded long-term debt is valued using indicative year-end traded
    bond market prices. Private debt is valued based on the prices
    of similar securities with similar terms and credit ratings.

Commodity
    Price Risk

We are exposed to the impact of fluctuations in the market price
    of natural gas, electricity, and natural gas liquids, as well as
    other market factors, such as market volatility and commodity
    price correlations, including correlations between natural gas
    and power prices. We are exposed to these risks in connection
    with our owned energy-related assets, our long-term
    energy-related contracts and our proprietary trading activities.
    We manage the risks associated with these market fluctuations
    using various derivatives and nonderivative energy-related
    contracts. The fair value of derivative contracts is subject to
    changes in energy-commodity market prices, the liquidity and
    volatility of the markets in which the contracts are transacted,
    and changes in interest rates. We measure the risk in our
    portfolios using a

value-at-risk

methodology to estimate the potential

one-day

loss
    from adverse changes in the fair value of the portfolios.

Value at risk requires a number of key assumptions and is not
    necessarily representative of actual losses in fair value that
    could be incurred from the portfolios. Our

value-at-risk

model uses a Monte Carlo method to simulate hypothetical
    movements in future market prices and assumes that, as a result
    of changes in commodity prices, there is a 95 percent
    probability that the

one-day

loss
    in fair value of the portfolios will not exceed the value at
    risk. The simulation method uses historical correlations and
    market forward prices and volatilities. In applying the

value-at-risk

methodology, we do not consider that the simulated hypothetical
    movements affect the positions



or would cause any potential liquidity issues, nor do we
    consider that changing the portfolio in response to market
    conditions could affect market prices and could take longer than
    a

one-day

holding period to execute. While a

one-day

holding period has historically been the industry standard, a
    longer holding period could more accurately represent the true
    market risk given market liquidity and our own credit and
    liquidity constraints.

We segregate our derivative contracts into trading and
    nontrading contracts, as defined in the following paragraphs. We
    calculate value at risk separately for these two categories.
    Derivative contracts designated as normal purchases or sales
    under SFAS 133 and nonderivative energy contracts have been
    excluded from our estimation of value at risk.

Trading

Our trading portfolio consists of derivative contracts entered
    into for purposes other than economically hedging our commodity
    price-risk exposure. Our value at risk for contracts held for
    trading purposes was approximately $1 million at
    December 31, 2006, and $4 million at December 31,
    2005. During the year ended December 31, 2006, our value at
    risk for these contracts ranged from a high of $4 million
    to a low of $1 million.

Nontrading

Our nontrading portfolio consists of derivative contracts that
    hedge or could potentially hedge the price risk exposure from
    the following activities:

Segment

Commodity Price Risk Exposure

Exploration & Production

• Natural gas sales

Midstream

• Natural gas purchases

Power

• Natural gas purchases
    and sales

• Electricity purchases
    and sales

The value at risk for derivative contracts held for nontrading
    purposes was $12 million at December 31, 2006, and
    $28 million at December 31, 2005. During the year
    ended December 31, 2006, our value at risk for these
    contracts ranged from a high of $25 million to a low of
    $12 million. Certain of the derivative contracts held for
    nontrading purposes are accounted for as cash flow hedges under
    SFAS 133. Though these contracts are included in our

value-at-risk

calculation, any change in the fair value of these hedge
    contracts would generally not be reflected in earnings until the
    associated hedged item affects earnings.

Foreign
    Currency Risk

We have international investments that could affect our
    financial results if the investments incur a permanent decline
    in value as a result of changes in foreign currency exchange
    rates

and/or

the economic conditions in foreign countries.

International investments accounted for under the cost method
    totaled $42 million at December 31, 2006, and
    $45 million at December 31, 2005. These investments
    are primarily in nonpublicly traded companies for which it is
    not practicable to estimate fair value. We believe that we can
    realize the carrying value of these investments considering the
    status of the operations of the companies underlying these
    investments. If a 20 percent change occurred in the value
    of the underlying currencies of these investments against the
    U.S. dollar, the fair value at December 31, 2006,
    could change by approximately $8.3 million assuming a
    direct correlation between the currency fluctuation and the
    value of the investments.

Net assets of consolidated foreign operations whose functional
    currency is the local currency are located primarily in Canada
    and approximate 6 percent of our net assets at
    December 31, 2006 and 2005. These foreign operations do not
    have significant transactions or financial instruments
    denominated in other currencies. However, these investments do
    have the potential to impact our financial position, due to
    fluctuations in these local currencies arising from the process
    of re-measuring the local functional currency into the
    U.S. dollar. As an example, a 20 percent change in the
    respective functional currencies against the U.S. dollar
    could have changed

stockholders’ equity

by
    approximately $68 million at December 31, 2006.



Item 8.

Financial
    Statements and Supplementary Data

MANAGEMENT’S
    REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

FINANCIAL REPORTING

Williams’ management is responsible for establishing and
    maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting
    (as defined in

Rules 13a-15(f)

and

15d-15(f)

under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) and for the
    assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
    financial reporting. Our internal control system was designed to
    provide reasonable assurance to our management and Board of
    Directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of
    financial statements in accordance with accounting principles
    generally accepted in the United States. Our internal control
    over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures
    that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in
    reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
    transactions and dispositions of our assets; (ii) provide
    reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as to permit
    preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally
    accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and
    expenditures are being made only in accordance with
    authorization of our management and board of directors; and
    (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
    timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition
    of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial
    statements.

All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have
    inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined
    to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with
    respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.
    Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods
    are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate
    because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
    compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Our management assessed the effectiveness of Williams’
    internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2006. In making this assessment, management
    used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in

Internal
    Control — Integrated
    Framework.

Management’s assessment included
    an evaluation of the design of our internal control over
    financial reporting and testing of the operational effectiveness
    of our internal control over financial reporting. Based on our
    assessment we believe that, as of December 31, 2006,
    Williams’ internal control over financial reporting is
    effective based on those criteria.

Ernst & Young, LLP, our independent registered public
    accounting firm, has issued an audit report on our assessment of
    the company’s internal control over financial reporting. A
    copy of this report is included in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.



REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING

FIRM ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

The Board of
    Directors and Stockholders of

The Williams Companies, Inc.

We have audited management’s assessment, included in the
    accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over
    Financial Reporting, that The Williams Companies, Inc.
    maintained effective internal control over financial reporting
    as of December 31, 2006, based on criteria established in
    Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
    (the COSO criteria). The Williams Companies, Inc.’s
    management is responsible for maintaining effective internal
    control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
    effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our
    responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s
    assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting based
    on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
    management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design
    and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
    such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
    circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
    basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that The Williams
    Companies, Inc. maintained effective internal control over
    financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, is fairly
    stated, in all material respects, based on the COSO criteria.
    Also, in our opinion, The Williams Companies, Inc. maintained,
    in all material respects, effective internal control over
    financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on the
    COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated balance sheet of The Williams Companies, Inc. as of
    December 31, 2006 and 2005, and the related consolidated
    statements of income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows
    for each of the three years in the period ended
    December 31, 2006 of The Williams Companies, Inc. and our
    report dated February 22, 2007 expressed an unqualified
    opinion thereon.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders of

The Williams Companies, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of
    The Williams Companies, Inc. as of December 31, 2006 and
    2005, and the related consolidated statements of income,
    stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three
    years in the period ended December 31, 2006. Our audits
    also included the financial statement schedule listed in the
    index at Item 15(a). These financial statements and
    schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s
    management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
    financial statements and schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
    present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
    financial position of The Williams Companies, Inc. at
    December 31, 2006 and 2005, and the consolidated results of
    its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in
    the period ended December 31, 2006, in conformity with
    U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our
    opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when
    considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken
    as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the
    information set forth therein.

As explained in Note 1 to the consolidated financial
    statements, effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted
    Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123(R),

Share-Based Payment

and as explained in Note 7 to
    the consolidated financial statements, effective
    December 31, 2006, the Company adopted Statement of
    Financial Accounting Standards No. 158,

Employers’
    Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement
    Plans.

Also, as explained in Note 9 to the consolidated
    financial statements, effective December 31, 2005, the
    Company adopted FASB Interpretation No. 47,

Accounting
    for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    effectiveness of The Williams Companies, Inc.’s internal
    control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006,
    based on criteria established in Internal Control —
    Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated
    February 22, 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Note 1.

Description
    of Business, Basis of Presentation, and Summary of Significant
    Accounting Policies

Description
    of Business

Operations of our company are located principally in the United
    States and are organized into the following reporting segments:
    Exploration & Production, Gas Pipeline, Midstream
    Gas & Liquids (Midstream), and Power.

Exploration & Production includes natural gas
    development, production and gas management activities primarily
    in the Rocky Mountain and Mid-Continent regions of the United
    States and oil and natural gas interests in Argentina.

Gas Pipeline is comprised primarily of two interstate natural
    gas pipelines, as well as investments in natural gas
    pipeline-related companies. The Gas Pipeline operating segments
    have been aggregated for reporting purposes and include
    Northwest Pipeline Corporation (Northwest Pipeline), which
    extends from the San Juan basin in northwestern New Mexico
    and southwestern Colorado to Oregon and Washington, and
    Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corporation (Transco), which
    extends from the Gulf of Mexico region to the northeastern
    United States. In addition, we own a 50 percent interest in
    Gulfstream. Gulfstream is a natural gas pipeline system
    extending from the Mobile Bay area in Alabama to markets in
    Florida.

Midstream is comprised of natural gas gathering and processing
    and treating facilities in the Rocky Mountain and Gulf Coast
    regions of the United States, oil gathering and transportation
    facilities in the Gulf Coast region of the United States,
    majority-owned natural gas compression facilities in Venezuela,
    and assets in Canada, consisting primarily of a natural gas
    liquids extraction facility and a fractionation plant.

Power is an energy services provider that buys, sells, stores,
    and transports energy and energy-related commodities, primarily
    power and natural gas, on a wholesale level. Power focuses on
    its objectives of minimizing financial risk, maximizing cash
    flow, meeting contractual commitments, executing new contracts
    to hedge its portfolio, and providing commodity marketing and
    supply services that support our natural gas businesses.

Basis
    of Presentation

Unless indicated otherwise, the information in the Notes to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements relates to our continuing
    operations.

Certain amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current
    classifications.

In February 2005, we formed Williams Partners L.P., a limited
    partnership engaged in the business of gathering, transporting
    and processing natural gas and fractionating and storing natural
    gas liquids. We currently own approximately 22.5 percent of
    Williams Partners L.P., including the interests of the general
    partner, which is wholly owned by us. Considering the
    presumption of control of the general partner in accordance with
    Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue

No. 04-5,

“Determining Whether a General Partner, or the General
    Partners as a Group, Controls a Limited Partnership or Similar
    Entity When the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights,”
    Williams Partners L.P. is consolidated within our Midstream
    segment.

Summary
    of Significant Accounting Policies

Principles
    of consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
    our corporate parent and our majority-owned or controlled
    subsidiaries and investments. We apply the equity method of
    accounting for investments in unconsolidated companies in which
    we and our subsidiaries own 20 to 50 percent of the voting
    interest, or otherwise exercise significant influence over
    operating and financial policies of the company.



THE
    WILLIAMS COMPANIES, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Use of
    estimates

Management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the
    amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and
    accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those
    estimates.

Significant estimates and assumptions include:

•

Impairment assessments of investments, long-lived assets and
    goodwill;

•

Litigation-related contingencies;

•

Valuations of derivatives;

•

Environmental remediation obligations;

•

Hedge accounting correlations and probability;

•

Realization of deferred income tax assets;

•

Valuation of Exploration & Production’s reserves;

•

Asset retirement obligations;

•

Pension and postretirement valuation variables.

These estimates are discussed further throughout these notes.

Cash and
    cash equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents includes demand and time deposits,
    certificates of deposit, and other marketable securities with
    maturities of three months or less when acquired.

Restricted
    cash

Restricted cash

within

current assets

consists
    primarily of collateral required by certain loan agreements for
    our Venezuelan operations, escrow accounts established to fund
    payments required by Power’s California settlement (see
    Note 15), and an escrow account used to collect and manage
    margin dollars.

Restricted cash

within noncurrent assets
    relates primarily to certain borrowings by our Venezuelan
    operations as previously mentioned and letters of credit. We do
    not expect this cash to be released within the next twelve
    months. The current and noncurrent

restricted cash

is
    primarily invested in short-term money market accounts with
    financial institutions.

The classification of

restricted cash

is determined based
    on the expected term of the collateral requirement and not
    necessarily the maturity date of the investment vehicle.

Auction
    rate securities

Auction rate securities are instruments with long-term
    underlying maturities, but for which an auction is conducted
    periodically, as specified, to reset the interest rate and allow
    investors to buy or sell the instruments. Because auctions
    generally occur more often than annually, and because we hold
    these investments in order to meet short-term liquidity needs,
    we classify auction rate securities as short-term and include
    them in

other current assets and deferred charges

on our
    Consolidated Balance Sheet. Consistent with our other securities
    that are classified as

available-for-sale,

our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows reflects the gross
    amount of the

purchases of auction rate securities

and
    the

proceeds from sales of auction rate securities

.

Accounts
    receivable

Accounts receivable

are carried on a gross basis, with no
    discounting, less the allowance for doubtful accounts. We
    estimate the allowance for doubtful accounts based on existing
    economic conditions, the financial conditions of



THE
    WILLIAMS COMPANIES, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

the customers and the amount and age of past due accounts.
    Receivables are considered past due if full payment is not
    received by the contractual due date. Interest income related to
    past due accounts receivable is generally recognized at the time
    full payment is received or collectibility is assured. Past due
    accounts are generally written off against the allowance for
    doubtful accounts only after all collection attempts have been
    exhausted.

Inventory
    valuation

All

inventories

are stated at the lower of cost or
    market. We determine the cost of certain natural gas inventories
    held by Transco using the

last-in,

first-out (LIFO) cost method. We determine the cost of the
    remaining inventories primarily using the average-cost method.

Property,
    plant and equipment

Property, plant and equipment

is recorded at cost. We
    base the carrying value of these assets on estimates,
    assumptions and judgments relative to capitalized costs, useful
    lives and salvage values.

As regulated entities, Northwest Pipeline and Transco provide
    for depreciation using the straight-line method at Federal
    Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC)-prescribed rates.
    Depreciation rates used for major regulated gas plant facilities
    for all years presented, are as follows:

Category of Property

Depreciation Rates

Gathering facilities

0% - 3.80%

Storage facilities

1.05% - 2.50%

Onshore transmission facilities

2.35% - 7.25%

Offshore transmission facilities

0.85% - 1.50%

Depreciation for nonregulated entities is provided primarily on
    the straight-line method over estimated useful lives, except as
    noted below for oil and gas exploration and production
    activities. The estimated useful lives are as follows:

Estimated

Useful Lives

Category of Property

(In years)

Natural gas gathering and
    processing facilities

10 to 40

Power generation facilities


Transportation equipment

3 to 30

Building and improvements

5 to 45

Right of way

4 to 40

Office furnishings and computer
    software and hardware

3 to 20

Gains or losses from the ordinary sale or retirement of
    property, plant and equipment for regulated pipelines are
    credited or charged to accumulated depreciation; other gains or
    losses are recorded in

other (income) expense —
    net

included in

operating income

.

Ordinary maintenance and repair costs are generally expensed as
    incurred. Costs of major renewals and replacements are
    capitalized as

property, plant, and equipment —
    net

.

Oil and gas exploration and production activities are accounted
    for under the successful efforts method. Costs incurred in
    connection with the drilling and equipping of exploratory wells,
    as applicable, are capitalized as incurred. If proved reserves
    are not found, such costs are charged to expense. Other
    exploration costs, including lease rentals, are expensed as
    incurred. All costs related to development wells, including
    related production equipment and lease acquisition costs, are
    capitalized when incurred. Unproved properties are evaluated
    annually, or as conditions warrant, to determine any impairment
    in carrying value.

Depreciation, depletion and
    amortization

is provided under the units of production
    method on a field basis.



THE
    WILLIAMS COMPANIES, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Proved properties, including developed and undeveloped, and
    costs associated with unproven reserves, are assessed for
    impairment using estimated future cash flows on a field basis.
    Estimating future cash flows involves the use of complex
    judgments such as estimation of the proved and unproven oil and
    gas reserve quantities, risk associated with the different
    categories of oil and gas reserves, timing of development and
    production, expected future commodity prices, capital
    expenditures, and production costs.

We record an asset and a liability equal to the present value of
    each expected future asset retirement obligation (ARO). The ARO
    asset is depreciated in a manner consistent with the
    depreciation of the underlying physical asset. We measure
    changes in the liability due to passage of time by applying an
    interest method of allocation. This amount is recognized as an
    increase in the carrying amount of the liability and as a
    corresponding accretion expense included in

other (income)
    expense — net

included in

operating income

,
    except for regulated entities, for which the liability is offset
    by a regulatory asset.

Goodwill

Goodwill

represents the excess of cost over fair value of
    the assets of businesses acquired. It is evaluated annually for
    impairment by first comparing our management’s estimate of
    the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value,
    including goodwill. If the carrying value of the reporting unit
    exceeds its fair value, a computation of the implied fair value
    of the goodwill is compared with its related carrying value. If
    the carrying value of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the
    implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is
    recognized in the amount of the excess. We have

goodwill

of approximately $1 billion at December 31, 2006, and
    2005, at our Exploration & Production segment.

When a reporting unit is sold or classified as held for sale,
    any goodwill of that reporting unit is included in its carrying
    value for purposes of determining any impairment or gain/loss on
    sale. If a portion of a reporting unit with goodwill is sold or
    classified as held for sale and that asset group represents a
    business, a portion of the reporting unit’s goodwill is
    allocated to and included in the carrying value of that asset
    group. None of the operations sold during 2005 and 2004
    represented reporting units with goodwill or businesses within
    reporting units to which goodwill was required to be allocated.

Judgments and assumptions are inherent in our management’s
    estimate of undiscounted future cash flows used to determine the
    estimate of the reporting unit’s fair value. The use of
    alternate judgments

and/or

assumptions could result in the recognition of different levels
    of impairment charges in the financial statements.

Treasury
    stock

Treasury stock

purchases are accounted for under the cost
    method whereby the entire cost of the acquired stock is recorded
    as treasury stock. Gains and losses on the subsequent reissuance
    of shares are credited or charged to

capital in excess of par
    value

using the average-cost method.

Derivative
    instruments and hedging activities

We utilize derivatives to manage our commodity price risk. These
    instruments consist primarily of futures contracts, swap
    agreements, option contracts, and forward contracts involving
    short- and long-term purchases and sales of a physical energy
    commodity. We execute most of these transactions on an organized
    commodity exchange or in

over-the-counter

markets in which quoted prices exist for active periods. For
    contracts with terms that exceed the time period for which
    actively quoted prices are available, we determine fair value by
    estimating commodity prices during the illiquid periods
    utilizing internally developed valuations incorporating
    information obtained from commodity prices in actively quoted
    markets, quoted prices in less active markets, prices reflected
    in current transactions, and other market fundamental analysis.

We report the fair value of derivatives, except for those for
    which the normal purchases and normal sales exception has been
    elected, on the Consolidated Balance Sheet in

derivative
    assets

and

derivative liabilities

as



THE
    WILLIAMS COMPANIES, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

either current or noncurrent. We determine the current and
    noncurrent classification based on the timing of expected future
    cash flows of individual contracts.

The accounting for changes in the fair value of a commodity
    derivative is governed by Statement of Financial Accounting
    Standard (SFAS) No. 133 and depends on whether the
    derivative has been designated in a hedging relationship and
    whether we have elected the normal purchases and normal sales
    exception. The accounting for the change in fair value can be
    summarized as follows:

Derivative Treatment

Accounting Method

Normal purchases and normal sales
    exception

Accrual accounting

Designated in a qualifying hedging
    relationship

Hedge accounting

All other derivatives

Mark-to-market

accounting

We have elected the normal purchases and normal sales exception
    for certain short- and long-term purchases and sales of a
    physical energy commodity. Under accrual accounting, any change
    in the fair value of these derivatives is not reflected on the
    balance sheet after the initial election of the exception. Some
    contracts had a fair value at the date of the election and are
    reflected on the balance sheet at their fair value on the date
    of the election less the amount of that fair value realized
    during settlement periods subsequent to the election. For other
    contracts, we made the election at the inception of the contract
    and thus there is no recorded fair value.

We have also designated a hedging relationship for certain
    commodity derivatives. Prior to September 2004, Power’s
    derivative contracts did not qualify for hedge accounting
    because of our stated intent to exit the Power business. In
    September 2004, we announced our decision to continue operating
    the Power business. As a result of that decision, Power’s
    derivative contracts became eligible for hedge accounting. Power
    elected cash flow hedge accounting on a prospective basis
    beginning October 1, 2004, for certain qualifying
    derivative contracts.

For a derivative to qualify for designation in a hedging
    relationship, it must meet specific criteria and we must
    maintain appropriate documentation. We establish hedging
    relationships pursuant to our risk management policies. We
    evaluate the hedging relationships at the inception of the hedge
    and on an ongoing basis to determine whether the hedging
    relationship is, and is expected to remain, highly effective in
    achieving offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows
    attributable to the underlying risk being hedged. We also
    regularly assess whether the hedged forecasted transaction is
    probable of occurring. If a derivative ceases to be or is no
    longer expected to be highly effective, or if we believe the
    likelihood of occurrence of the hedged forecasted transaction is
    no longer probable, hedge accounting is discontinued
    prospectively, and future changes in the fair value of the
    derivative are recognized currently in

revenues

.

For commodity derivatives designated as a cash flow hedge, the
    effective portion of the change in fair value of the derivative
    is reported in

other comprehensive income (loss)

and
    reclassified into earnings in the period in which the hedged
    item affects earnings. Any ineffective portion of the
    derivative’s change in fair value is recognized currently
    in

revenues

. Gains or losses deferred in

accumulated
    other comprehensive loss

associated with terminated
    derivatives, derivatives that cease to be highly effective
    hedges, derivatives for which the forecasted transaction is
    reasonably possible but no longer probable of occurring, and
    cash flow hedges that have been otherwise discontinued remain in

accumulated other comprehensive loss

until the hedged
    item affects earnings. If it becomes probable that the
    forecasted transaction designated as the hedged item in a cash
    flow hedge will not occur, any gain or loss deferred in

accumulated other comprehensive loss

is recognized in

revenues

at that time. The change in likelihood is a
    judgmental decision that includes qualitative assessments made
    by management.

For commodity derivatives that are not designated in a hedging
    relationship, and for which we have not elected the normal
    purchases and normal sales exception, we report changes in fair
    value currently in

revenues

.



THE
    WILLIAMS COMPANIES, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Certain gains and losses on derivative instruments included in
    the Consolidated Statement of Income are netted together to a
    single net gain or loss, while other gains and losses are
    reported on a gross basis. Gains and losses recorded on a net
    basis include:

•

Unrealized gains and losses on all derivatives that are not
    designated as hedges and for which we have not elected the
    normal purchases and normal sales exception;

•

The ineffective portion of unrealized gains and losses on
    derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges;

•

Realized gains and losses on all derivatives that settle
    financially;

•

Realized gains and losses on derivatives held for trading
    purposes;

•

Realized gains and losses on derivatives entered into as a
    pre-contemplated buy/sell arrangement.

Realized gains and losses on derivatives that require physical
    delivery, and which are not held for trading purposes nor were
    entered into as a pre-contemplated buy/sell arrangement, are
    recorded on a gross basis. In reaching our conclusions on this
    presentation, we evaluated the indicators in EITF Issue

No. 99-19

“Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus as an
    Agent,” including whether we act as principal in the
    transaction; whether we have the risks and rewards of ownership,
    including credit risk; and whether we have latitude in
    establishing prices.

Assessment
    of energy-related contracts for lease classification

EITF

01-8,

“Determining Whether an Arrangement Contains a Lease,”
    became effective on July 1, 2003, and provides guidance for
    determining whether certain contracts such as transportation,
    transmission, storage, full requirements, and tolling agreements
    are executory service arrangements or leases pursuant to
    SFAS No. 13, “Accounting for Leases.” The
    consensus is applied prospectively to arrangements consummated
    or modified after July 1, 2003. Prior to July 1, 2003,
    we accounted for energy-related contracts as executory service
    arrangements and continue this accounting unless a contract is
    subsequently modified and evaluated to be a lease. For executory
    service arrangements, the monthly demand payments are expensed
    as incurred. Certain of Power’s tolling agreements will
    likely be considered leases under the consensus if the tolling
    agreements are ever modified. One tolling agreement was modified
    in 2004 and is accounted for as an operating lease. For tolling
    agreements that are modified and deemed to be operating leases,
    the monthly demand payments are expensed as incurred. If the
    monthly demand payments are not incurred on a straight-line
    basis, expense is nevertheless recognized on a straight-line
    basis. If such tolling agreements are modified and deemed to be
    capital leases, the net present value of the demand payments
    would be reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as

long-term debt

and as an asset in

property, plant and
    equipment — net

.

Gas
    Pipeline revenues

Revenues from the transportation of gas are recognized in the
    period the service is provided, and revenues for sales of
    products are recognized in the period of delivery. Gas Pipeline
    is subject to FERC regulations and, accordingly, certain
    revenues collected may be subject to possible refunds upon final
    orders in pending rate cases. Gas Pipeline records estimates of
    rate refund liabilities considering Gas Pipeline and other
    third-party regulatory proceedings, advice of counsel and
    estimated total exposure, as discounted and risk weighted, as
    well as collection and other risks.

Exploration &
    Production revenues

Revenues from the domestic production of natural gas in
    properties for which Exploration & Production has an
    interest with other producers are recognized based on the actual
    volumes sold during the period. Any differences between volumes
    sold and entitlement volumes, based on Exploration &
    Production’s net working interest, that are



THE
    WILLIAMS COMPANIES, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

determined to be nonrecoverable through remaining production are
    recognized as accounts receivable or accounts payable, as
    appropriate. Cumulative differences between volumes sold and
    entitlement volumes are not significant.

Revenues,
    other than Gas Pipeline, Exploration & Production, and
    energy commodity risk management and trading
    activities

Revenues generally are recorded when services are performed or
    products have been delivered.

Impairment
    of long-lived assets and investments

We evaluate the long-lived assets of identifiable business
    activities for impairment when events or changes in
    circumstances indicate, in our management’s judgment, that
    the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. When
    an indicator of impairment has occurred, we compare our
    management’s estimate of undiscounted future cash flows
    attributable to the assets to the carrying value of the assets
    to determine whether an impairment has occurred. We apply a
    probability-weighted approach to consider the likelihood of
    different cash flow assumptions and possible outcomes including
    selling in the near term or holding for the remaining estimated
    useful life. If an impairment of the carrying value has
    occurred, we determine the amount of the impairment recognized
    in the financial statements by estimating the fair value of the
    assets and recording a loss for the amount that the carrying
    value exceeds the estimated fair value.

For assets identified to be disposed of in the future and
    considered held for sale in accordance with
    SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or
    Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,” we compare the carrying
    value to the estimated fair value less the cost to sell to
    determine if recognition of an impairment is required. Until the
    assets are disposed of, the estimated fair value, which includes
    estimated cash flows from operations until the assumed date of
    sale, is recalculated when related events or circumstances
    change.

We evaluate our investments for impairment when events or
    changes in circumstances indicate, in our management’s
    judgment, that the carrying value of such investments may have
    experienced an

other-than-temporary

decline in value. When evidence of loss in value has occurred,
    we compare our estimate of fair value of the investment to the
    carrying value of the investment to determine whether an
    impairment has occurred. If the estimated fair value is less
    than the carrying value and we consider the decline in value to
    be

other-than-temporary,

the excess of the carrying value over the fair value is
    recognized in the consolidated financial statements as an
    impairment.

Judgments and assumptions are inherent in our management’s
    estimate of undiscounted future cash flows and an asset’s
    fair value. Additionally, judgment is used to determine the
    probability of sale with respect to assets considered for
    disposal. The use of alternate judgments

and/or

assumptions could result in the recognition of different levels
    of impairment charges in the consolidated financial statements.

Capitalization
    of interest

We capitalize interest on major projects during construction.
    Interest is capitalized on borrowed funds and, where regulation
    by the FERC exists, on internally generated funds as a component
    of

other income — net

. The rates used by
    regulated companies are calculated in accordance with FERC
    rules. Rates used by unregulated companies are based on the
    average interest rate on debt. The benefit of interest
    capitalized on internally generated funds for regulated entities
    is reported in

other income — net

below

operating income

.

Additionally, Exploration & Production capitalizes
    interest on those construction projects with construction

Employee
    stock-based awards

Prior to January 1, 2006, we accounted for stock-based
    awards to employees and nonmanagement directors (see
    Note 13) under the recognition and measurement
    provisions of Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion
    No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to
    Employees,” and related interpretations, as permitted by
    Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement
    No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based
    Compensation” (SFAS No. 123). Compensation cost
    for stock options was not recognized in the Consolidated
    Statement of Income for the years prior to 2006 as all options
    granted had an exercise price equal to the market value of the
    underlying common stock on the date of the grant. Prior to
    January 1, 2006, compensation cost was recognized for
    restricted stock units. Effective January 1, 2006, we
    adopted the fair value recognition provisions of FASB Statement
    No. 123(R), “Share-Based Payment”
    (SFAS No. 123(R)), using the modified-prospective
    method. Under this method, compensation cost recognized in 2006
    includes: (1) compensation cost for all share-based
    payments granted through December 31, 2005, but for which
    the requisite service period had not been completed as of
    December 31, 2005, based on the grant date fair value
    estimated in accordance with the provisions of
    SFAS No. 123, and (2) compensation cost for most
    share-based payments granted subsequent to December 31,
    2005, based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance
    with the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R). The
    performance targets for certain performance-based restricted
    stock units have not been established and therefore expense is
    not currently recognized. Expense associated with these
    performance-based awards will be recognized in future periods
    when performance targets are established. Results for prior
    periods have not been restated.

Total stock-based compensation expense for the year ending
    December 31, 2006, was $43.9 million. This amount
    reflects a reduction of $.3 million of previously
    recognized compensation cost for restricted stock units related
    to the estimated number of awards expected to be forfeited. This
    adjustment is not considered material for reporting as a
    cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. Measured
    but unrecognized stock-based compensation expense at
    December 31, 2006, was approximately $50 million,
    which does not include the effect of estimated forfeitures of
    $1.9 million. This amount is comprised of approximately
    $13 million related to stock options and approximately
    $37 million related to restricted stock units. These
    amounts are expected to be recognized over a weighted-average
    period of 1.9 years.

As a result of adopting SFAS No. 123(R), our

income
    from continuing operations before income taxes

and

net
    income

for the year ending December 31, 2006, are
    approximately $18.4 million and $11.3 million lower,
    respectively, than if we continued to account for share-based
    compensation under APB No. 25. For the year ending
    December 31, 2006, both basic and diluted earnings per
    share are $.02 lower due to the implementation of
    SFAS No. 123(R).

Income
    taxes

We include the operations of our subsidiaries in our
    consolidated tax return. Deferred income taxes are computed
    using the liability method and are provided on all temporary
    differences between the financial basis and the tax basis of our
    assets and liabilities. Our management’s judgment and
    income tax assumptions are used to determine the levels, if any,
    of valuation allowances associated with deferred tax assets.

Earnings

Basic earnings (loss) per common share

is based on the
    sum of the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding
    and issuable restricted stock units.

Diluted earnings (loss)
    per common share

includes any dilutive effect of stock
    options, unvested restricted stock units and, for applicable
    periods presented, convertible debt, unless otherwise noted.

Foreign
    currency translation

Certain of our foreign subsidiaries and equity method investees
    use their local currency as their functional currency. These
    foreign currencies include the Canadian dollar, British pound
    and Euro. Assets and liabilities of certain foreign subsidiaries
    and equity investees are translated at the spot rate in effect
    at the applicable reporting date, and the combined statements of
    operations and our share of the results of operations of our
    equity affiliates are translated into the U.S. dollar at
    the average exchange rates in effect during the applicable
    period. The resulting cumulative translation adjustment is
    recorded as a separate component of

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional
    currency are recorded based on exchange rates at the time such
    transactions arise. Subsequent changes in exchange rates result
    in transaction gains and losses which are reflected in the
    Consolidated Statement of Income.

Issuance
    of equity of consolidated subsidiary

Sales of residual equity interests in a consolidated subsidiary
    are accounted for as capital transactions. No adjustments to
    capital are made for sales of preferential interests in a
    subsidiary. No gain or loss is recognized on these transactions.

Recent
    Accounting Standards

In September 2005, the FASB ratified EITF Issue

No. 04-13,

“Accounting for Purchases and Sales of Inventory with the
    Same Counterparty” (EITF

04-13).

The
    consensus states that two or more inventory purchase and sales
    transactions with the same counterparty that are entered into in
    contemplation of one another should be combined as a single
    exchange transaction for purposes of applying APB Opinion
    No. 29, “Accounting for Nonmonetary
    Transactions.” A nonmonetary exchange of inventory within
    the same line of business where finished goods inventory is
    transferred in exchange for the receipt of either raw materials
    or work in process inventory should be recognized at fair value
    by the entity transferring the finished goods inventory if fair
    value is determinable within reasonable limits and the
    transaction has commercial substance. All other nonmonetary
    exchanges of inventory within the same line of business should
    be recognized at the carrying amount of the inventory
    transferred. EITF

04-13

is
    effective for new arrangements entered into, and modifications
    or renewals of existing arrangements, beginning in the first
    reporting period beginning after March 15, 2006. We applied
    this Issue during 2006 with no significant impact on our
    Consolidated Financial Statements.

In February 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 155,
    “Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial Instruments, an
    amendment of FASB Statements No. 133 and 140”
    (SFAS No. 155). With regard to SFAS No. 133,
    “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
    Activities,” (SFAS No. 133) this Statement
    permits fair value remeasurement for any hybrid financial
    instrument that contains an embedded derivative that otherwise
    would require bifurcation, clarifies which interest-only and
    principal-only strips are not subject to the requirements of
    SFAS No. 133, and requires the holder of an interest
    in securitized financial assets to determine whether the
    interest is a freestanding derivative or contains an embedded
    derivative requiring bifurcation. SFAS No. 155 also
    amends SFAS No. 140, “Accounting for Transfers
    and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of
    Liabilities,” (SFAS No. 140) to eliminate a
    restriction on the passive derivative financial instruments that
    a qualifying special purpose entity may hold.
    SFAS No. 155 is effective for all financial
    instruments acquired or issued after the beginning of an
    entity’s first fiscal year that begins after
    September 15, 2006. The fair value election regarding
    hybrid financial instruments may also be applied upon adoption
    of SFAS No. 155 to hybrid financial instruments that
    had been bifurcated prior to adoption of SFAS No. 155.
    We applied the provisions of SFAS No. 155 beginning in
    January 2007 with no impact on our Consolidated Financial
    Statements.

In March 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 156,
    “Accounting for Servicing of Financial Assets, an amendment
    of FASB Statement No. 140” (SFAS No. 156).
    This Statement amends SFAS No. 140 with respect to the
    accounting for separately recognized servicing assets and
    liabilities from undertaking an obligation to service a
    financial asset by entering into a servicing contract.
    SFAS No. 156 is effective as of the beginning of an
    entity’s first fiscal year that begins after
    September 15, 2006. We applied the provisions of
    SFAS No. 156 beginning in January 2007 with no impact
    on our Consolidated Financial Statements.

In April 2006, the FASB issued a Staff Position (FSP) on a
    previously issued Interpretation (FIN), FSP FIN 46(R)-6,
    “Determining the Variability to Be Considered in Applying
    FASB Interpretation No. 46(R).” When determining the
    variability of an entity in applying FIN 46(R), a reporting
    enterprise must analyze the design of the entity and consider
    the nature of the risks in the entity, and determine the purpose
    for which the entity was created and determine the variability
    the entity is designed to create and pass along to its interest
    holders. The FSP is



THE
    WILLIAMS COMPANIES, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

effective beginning in the third quarter of 2006 on a
    prospective basis. We applied this FSP with no impact on our
    Consolidated Financial Statements.

In June 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48,
    “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an
    interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109”
    (FIN 48). The Interpretation clarifies the accounting for
    uncertainty in income taxes under FASB Statement No. 109,
    “Accounting for Income Taxes.” The Interpretation
    prescribes guidance for the financial statement recognition and
    measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a
    tax return. To recognize a tax position, the enterprise
    determines whether it is more likely than not that the tax
    position will be sustained upon examination, including
    resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based
    on the technical merits of the position. A tax position that
    meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is measured
    to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial
    statements. The tax position is measured at the largest amount
    of benefit, determined on a cumulative probability basis, that
    is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon
    ultimate settlement.

FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after
    December 15, 2006. The cumulative effect of applying the
    Interpretation must be reported as an adjustment to the opening
    balance of retained earnings in the year of adoption. We adopted
    FIN 48 beginning January 1, 2007, as required. The net
    impact of the cumulative effect of adopting FIN 48 is
    expected to be in the range of a $10 million to
    $20 million decrease in retained earnings.

In June 2006, the FASB ratified EITF

No. 06-3,

“How Taxes Collected from Customers and Remitted to
    Governmental Authorities Should Be Presented in the Income
    Statement (That Is, Gross versus Net Presentation)” (EITF

06-3).

EITF

06-3

addresses the income statement presentation of any tax collected
    from customers and remitted to a government authority and
    concludes the presentation of taxes on either a gross basis or a
    net basis is an accounting policy decision that should be
    disclosed pursuant to APB Opinion No. 22 “Disclosure
    of Accounting Policies.” This is effective for interim and
    annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2006
    and will require the financial statement disclosure of any
    significant taxes recognized on a gross basis. We are reviewing
    the presentation in our Consolidated Financial Statements and
    will apply the disclosure provisions of EITF

06-3

with
    our first quarter 2007 filing.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157,
    “Fair Value Measurements” (SFAS No. 157).
    This Statement establishes a framework for fair value
    measurements in the financial statements by providing a
    definition of fair value, provides guidance on the methods used
    to estimate fair value and expands disclosures about fair value
    measurements. SFAS No. 157 is effective for fiscal
    years beginning after November 15, 2007 and is generally
    applied prospectively. We will assess the impact of
    SFAS No. 157 on our Consolidated Financial Statements.

In September 2006, the FASB issued FSP AUG AIR-1,
    “Accounting for Planned Major Maintenance Activities”
    (FSP AUG AIR-1). This FSP addresses the planned major
    maintenance of assets and prohibits the use of the

“accrue-in-advance”

method of accounting for these activities in annual and interim
    reporting periods. The FSP continues to allow the direct
    expense, built-in overhaul and deferral methods. FSP AUG AIR-1
    requires disclosure of the method of accounting for planned
    major maintenance activities as well as information related to
    the change from the

“accrue-in-advance”

method to another method. This FSP is effective for the first
    fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2006 and should be
    applied retrospectively. We adopted this FSP in January 2007
    with no significant impact on our Consolidated Financial
    Statements.

In December 2006, the FASB issued FSP EITF

00-19-2,

“Accounting for Registration Payment Arrangements”
    (FSP EITF

00-19-2).

The FSP specifies the contingent obligation to make future
    payments or otherwise transfer consideration under a
    registration payment arrangement, whether issued as a separate
    agreement or included as a provision of a financial instrument
    or other agreement, should be recognized and measured separately
    in accordance with FASB SFAS No. 5, “Accounting
    for Contingencies” and related literature. FSP EITF

00-19-2

further clarifies that a financial instrument subject to a
    registration payment arrangement should be accounted for in
    accordance with other applicable generally accepted accounting
    principles without regard to the contingent obligation to
    transfer consideration. The FSP applies immediately to
    registration payment arrangements and the



THE
    WILLIAMS COMPANIES, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

financial instruments subject to those arrangements that are
    entered into or modified subsequent to December 21, 2006.
    Whereas, for registration payment arrangements and the financial
    instruments subject to those arrangements entered into prior to
    its issuance, the FSP applies to our financial statements for
    the fiscal year beginning in 2007. We adopted the provisions of
    FSP EITF

00-19-2

beginning in January 2007 with no impact on our Consolidated
    Financial Statements.

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159,
    “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
    Liabilities — Including an Amendment of FASB Statement
    No. 115” (SFAS No. 159).
    SFAS No. 159 establishes a fair value option
    permitting entities to elect the option to measure eligible
    financial instruments and certain other items at fair value on
    specified election dates. Unrealized gains and losses on items
    for which the fair value option has been elected will be
    reported in earnings. The fair value option may be applied on an
    instrument-by-instrument basis, with a few exceptions, is
    irrevocable and is applied only to entire instruments and not to
    portions of instruments. SFAS No. 159 is effective as
    of the beginning of the first fiscal year beginning after
    November 15, 2007 and should not be applied retrospectively
    to fiscal years beginning prior to the effective date, except as
    permitted for early adoption. Early adoption is permitted as of
    the beginning of a fiscal year provided the entity makes that
    choice in the first 120 days of the fiscal year and elects
    to simultaneously adopt the provisions of
    SFAS No. 157. At the effective date, an entity may
    elect the fair value option for eligible items existing at that
    date and the adjustment for the initial remeasurement of those
    items to fair value should be reported as a cumulative effect
    adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings. We will
    assess the impact of SFAS No. 159 on our Consolidated
    Financial Statements.

Discontinued
    Operations

The businesses discussed below represent components that have
    been sold as of December 31, 2006, and are classified as
    discontinued operations. Therefore, their results of operations
    (including any impairments, gains or losses), financial position
    and cash flows have been reflected in the consolidated financial
    statements and notes as discontinued operations.

Summarized
    Results of Discontinued Operations

The following table presents the summarized results of
    discontinued operations for the years ended December 31,
    2006, 2005, and 2004.

Loss from discontinued operations
    before income taxes

for the year ended December 31,
    2004, includes charges of approximately $153 million to
    increase our accrued liability associated with certain Quality
    Bank litigation matters. (See Note 15.) The

provision
    for income taxes

for the year ended December 31, 2004,
    is less than the federal statutory rate due primarily to the
    effect of net Canadian tax benefits realized from the sale of
    the Canadian straddle plants partially offset by the United
    States tax effect of earnings associated with these assets.

    Alaska refinery.

    Completed Transactions

Canadian
    straddle plants

On July 28, 2004, we completed the sale of the Canadian
    straddle plants for approximately $544 million and
    recognized a $189.8 million pre-tax gain on the sale. These
    assets were previously written down to estimated fair value,
    resulting in impairments of $41.7 million during 2003 and
    $36.8 million in 2002. In 2004, the fair value of the
    assets increased substantially due primarily to renegotiation of
    certain customer contracts and a general improvement in the
    market for processing assets. These operations were part of the
    Midstream segment.

Alaska
    refining, retail and pipeline operations

On March 31, 2004, we completed the sale of our Alaska
    refinery, retail and pipeline operations for approximately
    $304 million. We received $279 million in cash at the
    time of sale and $25 million in cash during the second
    quarter of 2004. Based on information we obtained throughout the
    sales negotiations process, we recorded impairments of
    $8 million in 2003 and $18.4 million in 2002. We
    recognized a $3.6 million pre-tax gain on the sale during
    first quarter 2004. These operations were part of the previously
    reported Petroleum Services segment.

We are party to a pending matter involving pipeline
    transportation rates charged to our former Alaska refinery in
    prior periods. While we have no loss exposure in this matter,
    favorable resolution could result in a refund.

Impairments of cost-based investments

for the year ended

    in an operating contract was converted to a 4 percent equity
    interest in a Venezuelan corporation which owns and operates oil
    and gas activities. Our 4 percent interest is reported as a cost
    method investment; previously, we accounted for our working
    interest using the proportionate consolidation method.

Impairments of cost-based investments

for the year ended
    December 31, 2004, includes a $20.8 million impairment
    of our investment in an Indonesian toll road, primarily due to

    investees is primarily related to impairments previously
    recognized.

Dividends and distributions, including those discussed below,
    received from companies accounted for by the equity method were
    $115.6 million in 2006 and $447.4 million in 2005.
    These transactions reduced the carrying value of our investments.

Gulfstream

In 2005, we received a $310.5 million distribution from
    Gulfstream Natural Gas System, L.L.C. (Gulfstream) following its
    debt offering. We also received dividends from Gulfstream of
    $41.5 million in 2006 and $60.5 million in 2005.

Discovery

During 2005, our Midstream subsidiary acquired an additional
    16.67 percent in Discovery, which was later reduced by
    6.67 percent due to a nonaffiliated member exercising its

the voting provisions of Discovery’s limited liability
    company which provide the other member of Discovery significant
    participatory rights such that we do not control the investment.

Additionally, we contributed $40.7 million during 2005 to
    Discovery for planned capital expenditures. Each owner
    contributed an amount equal to their respective ownership
    percentage, thus having no impact on the overall ownership
    allocation. We received distributions from Discovery of
    $27.2 million in 2006 and $31.3 million in 2005, which
    reduced the carrying value of our investment.

Longhorn

Based on management’s outlook for Longhorn at the end of
    the second quarter 2005, we assessed our equity investment in
    Longhorn to determine if there had been an

other-than-temporary

decline in its fair value. As a result, we recorded an
    impairment of $49.1 million. In the fourth quarter of 2005,
    management of Longhorn decided to pursue a strategy of the sale
    of Longhorn. Based on initial indications from potential buyers,
    we determined that our Longhorn investment would require full
    impairment. Therefore, in fourth quarter 2005, we recorded a
    $38.1 million impairment to write off the remaining
    investment in Longhorn.

We continue to have an equity ownership interest in Longhorn,
    including 94.7 percent of the Class B Interests and
    21.3 percent of the Common Interests, even though the
    management of Longhorn completed an asset sale of the pipeline
    during the third quarter of 2006. Summarized results of
    operations of equity method investments in 2006, as presented
    below, reflect the impact of Longhorn’s loss on this sale.
    As a result of the sale, we received full payment of the
    $10 million secured bridge loan that we provided Longhorn
    during 2005.

Aux
    Sable

During 2005, we decided to solicit sales offers for our equity
    investment in Aux Sable, a natural gas liquids extraction and
    fractionation facility. Based on initial indications of
    potential sales proceeds, management concluded that there was an

other-than-temporary

decline in fair value below carrying value. Accordingly, we
    recorded an impairment of $23 million.

We provide for income taxes using the asset and liability method
    as required by SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for
    Income Taxes.” As a result of additional analysis of our
    tax basis and book basis asset and liabilities, we recorded a
    tax provision of $7.4 million and a tax benefit of
    $20.2 million in 2006 and 2005, respectively, to adjust the
    overall deferred income tax liabilities on the Consolidated
    Balance Sheet.



THE
    WILLIAMS COMPANIES, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

During the course of audits of our business by domestic and
    foreign tax authorities, we frequently face challenges regarding
    the amount of taxes due. These challenges include questions
    regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation
    of income among various tax jurisdictions. In evaluating the
    liability associated with our various tax filing positions, we
    record a liability for probable tax contingencies. In
    association with this liability, we record an estimate of
    related interest and tax exposure as a component of our current
    tax provision. The impact of this accrual is included within

other — net

in our reconciliation of the tax
    provision to the federal statutory rate.

One of our wholly owned subsidiaries, Transco Coal Gas Company,
    was engaged in a dispute with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS)
    in which the principle issue was the recapture of certain income
    tax credits associated with

the construction and operation of a coal gasification plant in
    North Dakota by Great Plains Gasification Associates, a
    partnership in which Transco Coal Gas Company was a partner in
    the 1980’s. The IRS took alternative positions that alleged
    a disposition date for purposes of tax credit recapture that was
    earlier than the position taken in the partnership tax return.
    After settlement negotiations failed, the matter was tried
    before the U.S. Tax Court in February 2005. On
    December 27, 2006, the Tax Court ruled that the partnership
    utilized the appropriate disposition date for purposes of tax
    credit recapture.

    subsidiaries at December 31, 2006, totaled approximately

    taxes has been made for these subsidiaries because we intend to
    permanently reinvest such earnings in foreign operations.

Cash payments for income taxes (net of refunds) were
    $79 million, $230 million, and $8 million in
    2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. Cash tax payments include
    settlements with taxing authorities associated with prior period
    audits of $42 million and $204 million in 2006 and
    2005, respectively.

At December 31, 2006, federal net operating loss carryovers
    are $509 million. We expect to utilize our net operating
    loss carryovers prior to expiration in 2022 through 2025. We
    also expect to utilize $13 million of charitable
    contribution carryovers prior to their expiration in 2007
    through 2010. We do not expect to be able to utilize our
    $36.1 million foreign deferred tax assets related to
    carryovers.

In June 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48,

Employee
    Benefit Plans

We have noncontributory defined benefit pension plans in which
    all eligible employees participate. Currently, eligible
    employees earn benefits primarily based on a cash balance
    formula. Various other formulas, as defined in the plan
    documents, are utilized to calculate the retirement benefits for
    plan participants not covered by the cash balance formula. At
    the time of retirement, participants may receive annuity
    payments, a lump sum payment or a combination of lump sum and
    annuity payments. In addition to our pension plans, we currently
    provide subsidized medical and life insurance benefits (other
    postretirement benefits) to certain eligible participants.
    Generally, employees hired after December 31, 1991, are not
    eligible for these benefits, except for participants that were
    employees of Transco Energy Company on December 31, 1995,
    and other miscellaneous defined participant groups. Certain of
    these other postretirement benefit plans, particularly the
    subsidized medical benefit plans, provide for retiree
    contributions and contain other cost-sharing features such as
    deductibles, co-payments, and co-insurance. The accounting for
    these plans anticipates future cost-sharing that is consistent
    with our expressed intent to increase the retiree contribution
    level generally in line with health care cost increases.

SFAS No. 158
    Adoption

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158,
    “Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and
    Other Postretirement Plans — an amendment of FASB
    Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R)”
    (SFAS No. 158). This Statement requires sponsors of
    defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans
    to recognize the funded status of their pension and other
    postretirement benefit plans in the statement of financial
    position, measure the fair value of plan assets and benefit
    obligations as of the date of the fiscal year-end statement of
    financial position, and provide additional disclosures. On
    December 31, 2006, we adopted the recognition and
    disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 158, the effect of
    which has been reflected in the accompanying consolidated
    financial statements as of December 31, 2006, as described
    below. The adoption had no impact on the consolidated financial
    statements at December 31, 2005 or 2004.
    SFAS No. 158’s provisions regarding the change in
    the measurement date of postretirement benefit plans are not
    applicable as we already use a measurement date of
    December 31. There is no effect on our Consolidated
    Statement of Income for the year ended December 31, 2006,
    or for any periods presented related to the adoption of
    SFAS No. 158, nor will our future operating results be
    affected by the adoption.

Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 158, accounting
    rules allowed for the delayed recognition of certain actuarial
    gains and losses caused by differences between actual and
    assumed outcomes, as well as charges or credits caused by plan
    changes impacting the benefit obligations which were attributed
    to participants’ prior service. These unrecognized net
    actuarial gains or losses and unrecognized prior service costs
    or credits represented the difference between the plans’
    funded status and the amount recognized on the Consolidated
    Balance Sheet. In accordance with SFAS No. 158, we
    recorded adjustments to

accumulated other comprehensive
    loss

, net of income taxes, to recognize the funded status of
    our pension and other postretirement benefit plans on our
    Consolidated Balance Sheet. For our FERC-regulated gas
    pipelines, we recorded the adjustment to

net regulatory
    liabilities

for our other postretirement benefit plans.
    These

adjustments represent the previously unrecognized net actuarial

    SFAS No. 158 is provided in the following table.

The adjustments recorded to

    “Employers’ Accounting for Postretirement Benefits
    Other Than Pensions,” in the same manner as prior to the
    adoption of SFAS No. 158. Actuarial gains and losses
    that arise in subsequent periods and are not recognized as

net periodic pension

or

other postretirement benefit
    expense

in the same period will now be recognized in

The net underfunded/overfunded status of our pension plans
    presented in the previous table is recognized in the
    December 31, 2006, Consolidated Balance Sheet in

noncurrent assets

as $114.1 million for our
    overfunded pension plans and in

current liabilities

as
    $1.0 million and in

noncurrent liabilities

as
    $39.1 million for our underfunded pension plans. The
    underfunded status of our other postretirement benefit plans
    presented in the previous table is recognized in the
    December 31, 2006, Consolidated Balance Sheet in

current
    liabilities

as $9.2 million and in

noncurrent
    liabilities

as $122.7 million. The plan assets within
    our other postretirement benefit plans are intended to be used
    for the payment of benefits for certain groups of participants.
    The

current liabilities

for the other postretirement
    benefit plans represent the actuarial present value of benefits
    included in the benefit obligation payable in 2007 for the
    groups of participants whose benefits are not expected to be
    paid from plan assets.

The

regulatory asset

shown in 2005 in the table above is
    the portion of the additional minimum pension liability
    recognized by our FERC-regulated gas pipelines. As required by
    FERC accounting guidelines, our FERC-regulated gas pipelines
    were required to record the effect of an additional minimum
    pension liability to a

regulatory asset

instead of

accumulated other comprehensive loss.

The 2006

actuarial loss

of $13.3 million for our
    pension plans included in the table of changes in benefit
    obligation is due primarily to the impact of actual results
    differing from assumed results such as compensation and
    participant deaths, offset by the net impact of changes in
    assumptions utilized to calculate the benefit obligation
    including the discount rate, mortality and expected form of
    benefit payments. The 2005

actuarial gain

of
    $2.5 million for our pension plans included in the table of
    changes in benefit obligation reflects a gain of approximately
    $68 million for the cumulative impact of a correction of an
    error determined to have occurred in 2003 and 2004. The error
    was associated with our third-party actuarial computation of the
    benefit obligation which resulted in the identification of
    errors in certain Transco participant data involving annuity
    contract information utilized for 2003 and 2004. This gain is
    offset substantially by the impact of changes to the discount
    rates utilized to determine the benefit obligation. The 2006

actuarial gain

of $64.2 million for our other
    postretirement benefit plans included in the table of changes in
    benefit obligation is due primarily to the impact of changes in
    assumptions utilized to calculate the benefit obligation
    including claims costs, health care cost trend rates and the
    discount rate, as well as actual results differing from assumed
    results such as participant deaths and terminations prior to
    retirement. The 2005

actuarial loss

of $51.9 million
    for our other postretirement benefit plans included in the table
    of changes in benefit obligation is due primarily to the impact
    of changes in assumptions utilized to calculate the benefit
    obligation including the health care cost trend rates, discount
    rate and estimated cost savings related to the Medicare
    Prescription Drug Act.

The current accounting rules for the determination of

net
    periodic pension

and

other postretirement benefit expense

allow for the delayed recognition of gains and losses caused
    by differences between actual and assumed outcomes for items
    such as estimated return on plan assets, or caused by changes in
    assumptions for items such as discount rates or estimated future
    compensation levels. The

unrecognized net actuarial loss

presented in the previous tables and recorded in

accumulated other comprehensive loss

and

net
    regulatory liabilities

at December 31, 2006, represents
    the cumulative net deferred losses from these types of
    differences or changes which have not yet

    over the participants’ average remaining future years of
    service, which is approximately 12 years for our pension
    plans and 13 years for our other postretirement benefit
    plans.

We have multiple pension plans that are aggregated as prescribed

Net periodic pension expense (income)

for 2005 includes a
    $17.1 million reduction to expense to record the cumulative
    impact of a correction of an error determined to have occurred
    in 2003 and 2004. The error was associated with our third-party
    actuarial computation of annual

net periodic pension expense

which resulted from the identification of errors in certain
    Transco participant data involving annuity contract information
    utilized for 2003 and 2004. The adjustment is reflected as
    $16.1 million within

recognized net actuarial (gain)
    loss

and $1.0 million within

regulatory asset
    amortization (deferral).

The differences in the amount of actuarially determined

net
    periodic other postretirement benefit expense

and the other
    postretirement benefit costs recovered in rates for our
    FERC-regulated gas pipelines are deferred as a regulatory asset
    or liability. At December 31, 2006, we have a regulatory
    asset of $8.5 million for Transco and a regulatory
    liability of $13.3 million for Northwest Pipeline related
    to these deferrals. At December 31, 2005, we had a
    regulatory asset of $24.3 million for Transco and a
    regulatory liability of $10.8 million at Northwest Pipeline
    related to these deferrals. These amounts will be reflected in
    future rates based on Transco and Northwest Pipeline’s rate
    structures.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The discount rates for our pension and other postretirement
    benefit plans were determined separately based on an approach
    specific to our plans and their respective expected benefit cash
    flows. With the assistance of our third-party actuary, the plans
    were analyzed and discount rates based on a yield curve
    comprised of high-quality corporate bonds published by a large
    securities firm were matched to a highly correlated published
    index of high-quality corporate bonds. Based on an analysis
    performed between each of the plans’ yield curve discount
    rates and the index, a formula was developed to determine the
    December 31, 2006, discount rates based upon the year-end
    published index.

The expected long-term rates of return on plan assets were
    determined by combining a review of the historical returns
    realized within the portfolio, the investment strategy included
    in the plans’ Investment Policy Statement, and the capital
    market projections provided by our independent investment
    consultant for the asset classifications in which the portfolio
    is invested and the target weightings of each asset
    classification.

The mortality assumptions used to determine the obligations for
    our pension and other postretirement benefit plans are related
    to the experience of the plans and to our third-party
    actuary’s best estimate of expected plan mortality. The
    selected mortality tables are among the most recent tables
    available.

The assumed health care cost trend rate for 2007 is
    9.3 percent, and systematically decreases to
    5.5 percent by 2013. The health care cost trend rate
    assumption has a significant effect on the amounts reported. A
    one-percentage-point change in assumed health care cost trend
    rates would have the following effects:

Medicare
    Prescription Drug Act

In December 2003, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement,
    and Modernization Act of 2003 (the Act) was signed into law. The
    Act introduced a prescription drug benefit under Medicare
    (Medicare Part D) beginning in 2006 as well as a
    federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans
    that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent
    to Medicare Part D. Our health care plans for retirees
    include prescription drug coverage. Prior to 2005, our plans
    were amended to coordinate and pay secondary to any part of
    Medicare, including prescription drug benefits covered by
    Medicare Part D, which resulted in a decrease in the
    benefit obligation of $75.5 million. Beginning in 2005, the
    net reduction to the obligation was being amortized over
    approximately seven years which was the participants’
    average remaining years of service to full eligibility for
    benefits. It is reflected in the

amortization of prior
    service credit

in the table of components of

net periodic
    other postretirement benefit expense

for 2005.

Due to anticipated difficulties to administer our plans as
    previously amended to coordinate and pay secondary to Medicare
    Part D in 2006, we amended our plans in June 2005 to
    generally provide primary prescription drug coverage and apply
    for the federal subsidy in 2006. As a result of the amendment,
    generally our plans are designed to be actuarially equivalent to
    the standard coverage under Medicare Part D. The amendment
    increased our benefit obligation by $51.2 million at
    June 30, 2005, and is reflected as a

plan amendment

in the table of changes in benefit obligation for 2005.
    Beginning in the third quarter of 2005, the increase to the
    obligation is being amortized over the participants’
    average remaining years of service to full eligibility for
    benefits, which is approximately seven years.

Net periodic
    other postretirement benefit expense

for 2005, reflects an
    increase of $7.1 million, including an increase in

recognized net actuarial loss

of $.3 million, an
    increase in

service cost

of $.3 million, an increase
    in

interest cost

of $2.6 million, and an increase in

amortization of prior service credit

of
    $3.9 million, resulting from the plan amendment. We are
    continuing to evaluate coordination with Medicare Part D as
    a strategy to decrease our benefit obligation in the future and
    will closely monitor the development of systems and capabilities
    of third-party administrators to coordinate prescription drug
    benefits with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid
    Services.

Plan
    Assets

The investment policy for our pension and other postretirement
    benefit plans articulates an investment philosophy in accordance
    with ERISA which governs the investment of the assets in a
    diversified portfolio. The investment strategy for the assets of
    the pension plans and approximately one half of the assets of
    the other postretirement benefit plans include maximizing
    returns with reasonable and prudent levels of risk. The
    investment returns on the approximate one half of remaining
    assets of the other postretirement benefit plans is subject to
    federal income tax, therefore the investment strategy also
    includes investing in a tax efficient manner.

The following table presents the weighted-average asset
    allocations at December 31, 2006, and 2005 and target asset
    allocation at December 31, 2006, by asset category.

Included in equity securities are investments in commingled
    funds that invest entirely in equity securities and comprise
    38 percent and 37 percent of the pension plans’
    weighted-average assets at December 31, 2006, and 2005,
    respectively, and 27 percent and 26 percent of the
    other postretirement benefit plans’ weighted-average assets
    at December 31, 2006, and 2005, respectively. Other assets
    are comprised primarily of cash and cash equivalents for the
    pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans.

The assets are invested in accordance with the target
    allocations identified in the previous table. The investment
    policy provides for minimum and maximum ranges for the broad
    asset classes in the previous table. Additional target
    allocations are identified for specific classes of equity
    securities. The asset allocation ranges established by the
    investment policy are based upon a long-term investment
    perspective. The ranges are more heavily weighted toward equity
    securities since the liabilities of the pension and other
    postretirement benefit plans are long-term in nature and
    historically equity securities have significantly outperformed
    other asset classes over long periods of time.

Equity security investments are restricted to high-quality,
    readily marketable securities that are actively traded on the
    major U.S. and foreign national exchanges. Investment in
    Williams’ securities or an entity in which Williams has a
    majority ownership is prohibited except where these securities
    may be owned in a commingled investment vehicle in which the
    pension plans’ trust invests. No more than five percent of
    the total stock portfolio valued at market may be invested in
    the common stock of any one corporation. The following
    securities and transactions are not authorized: unregistered
    securities, commodities or commodity contracts, short sales or
    margin transactions or other leveraging strategies. Investment
    strategies using options or futures are not authorized.

Debt security investments are restricted to high-quality,
    marketable securities that include U.S. Treasury, federal
    agencies and U.S. Government guaranteed obligations, and
    investment grade corporate issues. The overall rating of the
    debt security assets is required to be at least “A”,
    according to the Moody’s or Standard & Poor’s
    rating system. No more than five percent of the total portfolio
    at the time of purchase may be invested in the debt securities
    of any one issuer. U.S. Government guaranteed and agency
    securities are exempt from this provision.

During 2006, 11 active investment managers and one passive
    investment manager managed substantially all of the pension and
    other postretirement benefit plans’ funds, each of whom had
    responsibility for managing a specific portion of these assets.

Periodically, an asset and liability study is performed to
    determine the optimal asset mix to meet future benefit
    obligations. The most recent pension asset and liability study
    was performed in 2001.

Plan
    Benefit Payments and Employer Contributions

The following are the expected benefits to be paid by the plan
    and the expected federal prescription drug subsidy to be
    received in the next ten years. These estimates are based on the
    same assumptions previously discussed and reflect future service
    as appropriate. The actuarial assumptions are based on long-term
    expectations and include, but are not limited to, assumptions as
    to average expected retirement age and form of benefit payment.
    Actual benefit payments could differ significantly from expected
    benefit payments if near-term participant behaviors differ
    significantly from the actuarial assumptions.

We expect to contribute approximately $41 million to our

Defined
    Contribution Plans

We also maintain defined contribution plans for the benefit of
    substantially all of our employees. Generally, plan participants
    may contribute a portion of their compensation on a pre-tax and
    after-tax basis in accordance with the plan’s guidelines.
    We match employees’ contributions up to certain limits.
    Costs recognized for these plans were $18.7 million in
    2006, $16.8 million in 2005, and $16.9 million in
    2004. One of our defined contribution plans was amended as of
    July 1, 2005, to convert one of the funds within the plan
    to a nonleveraged employee stock ownership plan (ESOP). The 2005
    compensation cost related to the ESOP of $.7 million is
    included in the $16.8 million of contributions, previously
    mentioned above, and represents the contribution made in
    consideration for employee services rendered in 2005. It is
    measured by the amount of cash contributed to the ESOP. The
    shares held by the ESOP are treated as outstanding when
    computing earnings per share and the dividends on the shares
    held by the ESOP are recorded as a component of retained
    earnings. For 2006 and future years, there are no contributions
    to this ESOP, other than dividend reinvestment, as contributions
    for purchase of our stock is now restricted within this defined
    contribution plan.

Asset
    Retirement Obligations

In March 2005, the FASB issued FIN 47, “Accounting for
    Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations — an
    interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143.” The
    Interpretation clarifies that the term “conditional asset
    retirement” as used in SFAS No. 143,
    “Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations,” refers
    to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in
    which the timing

and/or

method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may
    or may not be within the control of the entity. The
    Interpretation also clarifies when an entity would have
    sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of
    an asset retirement obligation.



THE
    WILLIAMS COMPANIES, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

We adopted the Interpretation on December 31, 2005. In
    accordance with the Interpretation, we estimated future
    retirement obligations for certain assets previously considered
    to have an indeterminate life. As a result, we recorded an
    increase in

other liabilities and deferred income

of
    $29.4 million, an increase in

property, plant and
    equipment — net

of $12.2 million, and a

cumulative effect of change in accounting principle

of
    $1.7 million (net of $1.0 million of taxes). We also
    recorded a $14.5 million regulatory asset in

other
    assets and deferred charges

for retirement costs expected to
    be recovered through regulated rates. Had we implemented the
    Interpretation at the beginning of 2003, the financial statement
    impact at December 31, 2004 would not be substantially
    different than the impact at December 31, 2005.

The asset retirement obligation at December 31, 2006 and
    2005 is $333 million and $93 million, respectively.
    The increase in the obligation in 2006 is due primarily to
    obtaining additional information that revised our estimation of
    our asset retirement obligation for certain assets in our
    Exploration & Production, Gas Pipeline and Midstream
    segments. Factors affected by the additional information
    included estimated settlement dates, estimated settlement costs
    and inflation rates.

The accrued obligations relate to producing wells, underground
    storage caverns, offshore platforms, fractionation facilities,
    gas gathering well connections and pipelines, and gas
    transmission facilities. At the end of the useful life of each
    respective asset, we are legally obligated to plug both
    producing wells and storage caverns and remove any related
    surface equipment, remove surface equipment and restore land at
    fractionation facilities, to dismantle offshore platforms, to
    cap certain gathering pipelines at the wellhead connection and
    remove any related surface equipment, and to remove certain
    components of gas transmission facilities from the ground.

Accounts
    Payable and Accrued Liabilities

Under our cash-management system, certain cash accounts
    reflected negative balances to the extent checks written have
    not been presented for payment. These negative balances
    represent obligations and have been reclassified to

accounts
    payable.

Accounts payable

includes approximately
    $44 million of these negative balances at December 31,
    2006, and $69 million at December 31, 2005.

On May 26, 2004, we were released from certain historical
    indemnities, primarily related to environmental remediation, for
    an agreement to pay $117.5 million. We had previously
    deferred $113 million of a gain on sale related to these
    indemnities. At the date of sale, the deferred revenue and
    identified obligations related to the indemnities totaled
    $102 million. The carrying value of this obligation is
    $33.9 million at December 31, 2006, and
    $51.3 million at December 31, 2005. The obligation
    will be settled with a payment of $35 million on
    July 1, 2007.

Revolving
    credit and letter of credit facilities (credit
    facilities)

In May 2006, we obtained an unsecured, three-year,
    $1.5 billion revolving credit facility, replacing our
    $1.275 billion secured revolving credit facility. The new
    unsecured facility contains similar terms and financial
    covenants as the secured facility, but contains additional
    restrictions on asset sales, certain subsidiary debt and
    sale-leaseback transactions. The facility is guaranteed by
    Williams Gas Pipeline Company, LLC and we guarantee obligations
    of Williams Partners L.P. for up to $75 million. Northwest
    Pipeline and Transco each have access to $400 million and
    Williams Partners L.P. has access to $75 million under the
    facility to the extent not otherwise utilized by us. Interest is
    calculated based on a choice of two methods: a fluctuating rate
    equal to the lender’s base rate plus an applicable margin
    or a periodic fixed rate equal to LIBOR plus an applicable
    margin. We are required to pay a commitment fee (currently
    .25 percent annually) based on the unused portion of the
    facility. The margins and commitment fee are generally based on
    the specific borrower’s senior unsecured long-term debt
    ratings. Significant financial covenants under the credit
    agreement include the following:

•

Our ratio of debt to capitalization must be no greater than
    65 percent. At December 31, 2006, we are in compliance
    with this covenant as our ratio of debt to capitalization, as
    calculated under this covenant, is approximately 53 percent.

•

Ratio of debt to capitalization must be no greater than
    55 percent for Northwest Pipeline and Transco. At
    December 31, 2006, we are in compliance with this covenant
    as our ratio of debt to capitalization, as calculated under this
    covenant, is approximately 44 percent for Northwest
    Pipeline and 32 percent for Transco.



THE
    WILLIAMS COMPANIES, INC.

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

•

Our ratio of EBITDA to interest, on a rolling four quarter
    basis, must be no less than 2.5 for the period ending
    December 31, 2007 and 3.0 for the remaining term of the
    agreement. Through December 31, 2006, we are in compliance
    with this covenant as we exceed the compliance level by
    approximately 50 percent.

Our $500 million and $700 million facilities provide
    for both borrowings and issuing letters of credit but are
    expected to be used primarily for issuing letters of credit. We
    are required to pay the funding bank fixed fees at a
    weighted-average interest rate of 3.64 percent and
    2.29 percent for the $500 million and
    $700 million facilities, respectively, on the total
    committed amount of the facilities. In addition, we pay interest
    on any borrowings at a fluctuating rate comprised of either a
    base rate or LIBOR.

The funding bank syndicated its associated credit risk through a
    private offering that allows for the resale of certain
    restricted securities to qualified institutional buyers. To
    facilitate the syndication of these facilities, the bank
    established trusts funded by the institutional investors. The
    assets of the trusts serve as collateral to reimburse the bank
    for our borrowings in the event that the facilities are
    delivered to the investors as described below. Thus, we have no
    asset securitization or collateral requirements under the
    facilities. Upon the occurrence of certain credit events,
    letters of credit under the agreement become cash collateralized
    creating a borrowing under the facilities. Concurrently, the
    funding bank can deliver the facilities to the institutional
    investors, whereby the investors replace the funding bank as
    lender under the facilities. Upon such occurrence, we will pay:

Exploration
    & Production’s Credit Agreement

Exploration & Production has recently entered into a
    five-year unsecured credit agreement with certain banks in order
    to reduce margin requirements related to our hedging activities
    as well as lower transaction fees. Margin requirements, if any,
    under this new facility are dependent on the level of hedging
    and on natural gas reserves value.

Issuances
    and retirements

On May 28, 2003, we issued $300 million of
    5.5 percent junior subordinated convertible debentures due
    2033. These notes, which are callable after seven years, are
    convertible at the option of the holder into our common stock at
    a conversion price of approximately $10.89 per share. In
    November 2005, we initiated an offer to convert these debentures
    to shares of our common stock. In January 2006, we converted
    approximately $220.2 million of the debentures. (See
    Note 12.)

In April 2006, Transco issued $200 million aggregate
    principal amount of 6.4 percent senior unsecured notes due
    2016 to certain institutional investors in a private debt
    placement. In October 2006, Transco completed an exchange of
    these notes for substantially identical new notes that are
    registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

In April 2006, we retired a secured floating-rate term loan for
    $488.9 million, including outstanding principal and accrued
    interest. The loan was due in 2008 and secured by substantially
    all of the assets of Williams Production RMT Company. The loan
    was retired using a combination of cash and revolving credit
    borrowings.

In June 2006, Northwest Pipeline issued $175 million
    aggregate principal amount of 7 percent senior unsecured
    notes due 2016 to certain institutional investors in a private
    debt placement. In October 2006, Northwest Pipeline completed an
    exchange of these notes for substantially identical new notes
    that are registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.

In June 2006, Williams Partners L.P. acquired 25.1 percent
    of our interest in Williams Four Corners LLC for
    $360 million. The acquisition was completed after Williams
    Partners L.P. successfully closed a $150 million private
    debt offering of 7.5 percent senior unsecured notes due
    2011 and an equity offering of approximately $225 million
    in net proceeds. In December 2006, Williams Partners L.P.
    acquired the remaining 74.9 percent interest in Williams
    Four Corners LLC for $1.223 billion. The acquisition was
    completed after Williams Partners L.P. successfully closed a
    $600 million private debt offering of 7.25 percent
    senior unsecured notes due 2017, a private equity offering of
    approximately $350 million of common and Class B
    units, and a public equity offering of approximately
    $294 million in net proceeds. The debt and equity issued by
    Williams Partners L.P. is reported as a component of our
    consolidated debt balance and minority interest balance,
    respectively. Williams Four Corners LLC owns certain gathering,
    processing and treating assets in the San Juan Basin in
    Colorado and New Mexico.

    this tolling agreement range from approximately
    $157 million to $169 million through 2017, with
    approximately $70 million remaining to be paid in 2018.
    Certain transactions resulting from the tolling agreements are
    accounted for as operating subleases. Total rentals to be
    received from these operating subleases are approximately
    $1.1 billion with approximately 4 years remaining on
    the agreements as of December 31, 2006.

Total rent expense was $242 million in 2006,
    $226 million in 2005 and $206 million in 2004. Rent
    expense at Power, primarily related to the tolling agreement,
    was $175 million (including $11 million of contingent
    rentals) in 2006 and $161 million (including
    ($1) million of contingent rentals) in 2005. Power’s
    rent expense was offset by approximately $264 million
    (including $8 million of contingent rental income) in 2006
    and $172 million (including $7 million of contingent
    rental income) in 2005 resulting from sales and other
    transactions made possible by the tolling agreement. Contingent
    rentals are primarily based on utilization of the leased
    property or changes in the capacity and availability of the
    power generating facility.

Stockholders’
    Equity

In November 2005, we initiated an offer to convert our
    5.5 percent junior subordinated convertible debentures into
    our common stock. In January 2006, we converted approximately
    $220.2 million of the debentures in exchange for
    20.2 million shares of common stock, a $25.8 million
    cash premium, and $1.5 million of accrued interest.

We maintain a Stockholder Rights Plan, as amended and restated
    on September 21, 2004, under which each outstanding share
    of our common stock has a right (as defined in the plan)
    attached. Under certain conditions, each right may be exercised
    to purchase, at an exercise price of $50 (subject to
    adjustment), one two-hundredth of a share of Series A
    Junior Participating Preferred Stock. The rights may be
    exercised only if an Acquiring Person acquires (or obtains the
    right to acquire) 15 percent or more of our common stock or
    commences an offer for 15 percent or more of our common
    stock. The rights, which until exercised do not have voting
    rights, expire in 2014 and may be redeemed at a price of
    $.01 per right prior to their expiration, or within a
    specified period of time after the occurrence of certain events.
    In the event a person becomes the owner of more than
    15 percent of our common stock, each holder of a right
    (except an Acquiring Person) shall have the right to receive,
    upon exercise, our common stock having a value equal to two
    times the exercise price of the right. In the event we are
    engaged in a merger, business combination, or 50 percent or
    more of our assets, cash flow or earnings power is sold or
    transferred, each holder of a right (except an Acquiring Person)
    shall have the right to receive, upon exercise, common stock of
    the acquiring company having a value equal to two times the
    exercise price of the right.

Plan
    Information

The Williams Companies, Inc. 2002 Incentive Plan (the Plan) was
    approved by stockholders on May 16, 2002, and amended and
    restated on May 15, 2003, and January 23, 2004. The
    Plan provides for common-stock-based awards to both employees
    and nonmanagement directors. Upon approval by the stockholders,
    all prior stock plans were terminated resulting in no further
    grants being made from those plans. However, awards outstanding
    in those prior plans remain in those plans with their respective
    terms and provisions.

The Plan permits the granting of various types of awards
    including, but not limited to, stock options and restricted
    stock units. Restricted stock units represent deferred share
    awards subject to time

and/or

performance-based vesting requirements. Awards may be granted
    for no consideration other than prior and future services or
    based on certain financial performance targets being achieved.
    At December 31, 2006, 41.7 million shares of our
    common stock were reserved for issuance pursuant to existing and
    future stock awards, of which 20 million shares were
    available for future grants. At December 31, 2005,
    45 million shares of our common stock were reserved for
    issuance, of which 21.6 million were available for future
    grants.

The expected dividend yield is based on the average annual
    dividend yield as of the grant date. Expected volatility is
    based on the historical volatility of our stock and the implied
    volatility of our stock based on traded options. In calculating
    historical volatility, returns during calendar year 2002 were
    excluded as the extreme volatility during that time is not
    reasonably expected to be repeated in the future. The risk-free
    interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury Constant
    Maturity rates as of the grant date. The expected life of the
    option is based on historical exercise behavior and expected
    future experience.

Cash received from stock option exercises was
    $34.3 million, $39.4 million and $21.6 million
    during 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The tax benefit

    when performance targets are established. Based on the extent to
    which certain financial targets are achieved, vested shares may
    range from zero percent to 200 percent of the original
    award amount.

Financial
    Instruments

Fair-value
    methods

We use the following methods and assumptions in estimating our
    fair-value disclosures for financial instruments:

Cash and cash equivalents and restricted
    cash

:  The carrying amounts of cash equivalents
    reported in the balance sheet approximate fair value due to the
    short-term maturity of these instruments.

Other securities, notes and other noncurrent receivables,
    structured indemnity settlement obligation, margin deposits, and
    customer margin deposits payable

:  The carrying
    amounts reported in the balance sheet approximate fair value as
    these instruments have interest rates approximating market

.
    Other securities

in the table below consists of auction rate
    securities and

held-to-maturity

securities and are reported in

other current assets and
    deferred charges

in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Long-term debt

:  The fair value of our publicly
    traded long-term debt is valued using indicative year-end traded
    bond market prices. Private debt is valued based on the prices
    of similar securities with similar terms and credit ratings. At
    December 31, 2006 and 2005, approximately 87 percent
    and 89 percent, respectively, of our long-term debt was
    publicly traded. We use the expertise of outside investment
    banking firms to assist with the estimate of the fair value of
    our long-term debt.

Guarantees

:  The

guarantees

represented
    in the table below consists primarily of guarantees we have
    provided in the event of nonpayment by our previously owned
    communications subsidiary, Williams Communications Group
    (WilTel), on certain lease performance obligations. To estimate
    the fair value of the guarantees, the estimated default rate is
    determined by obtaining the average cumulative issuer-weighted
    corporate default rate for each guarantee based on the credit
    rating of WilTel’s current owner and the term of the
    underlying obligation. The default rates are published by
    Moody’s Investors Service.

Energy derivatives

:  Energy derivatives include:

•

Futures contracts;

•

Forward contracts;

•

Swap agreements;

•

Option contracts.

The fair value of energy derivatives is determined based on the
    nature of the underlying transaction and the market in which the
    transaction is executed. We execute most of these transactions
    on an organized commodity exchange or in

over-the-counter

markets in which quoted prices exist for active periods. For
    contracts with terms that exceed the time period for which
    actively quoted prices are available, we determine fair value by
    estimating commodity prices during the illiquid periods
    utilizing internally developed valuations incorporating
    information obtained from commodity prices in actively quoted
    markets, quoted prices in less active markets, prices reflected
    in current transactions, and other market fundamental analysis.

Energy
    Derivatives

Our energy derivative contracts include the following:

Futures contracts

:  Futures contracts are
    standardized commitments through an organized commodity exchange
    to either purchase or sell a commodity at a future date for a
    specified price. Futures are generally settled in cash, but may
    be settled through delivery of the underlying commodity. The
    fair value of these contacts is generally determined using
    quoted prices.

Forward contracts

:  Forward contracts are

over-the-counter

commitments to either purchase or sell a commodity at a future
    date for a specified price, which involve physical delivery of
    energy commodities, and may contain either fixed or variable
    pricing terms. Forward contracts are valued based on prices of
    the underlying energy commodities over the contract life and
    contractual or notional volumes with the resulting expected
    future cash flows discounted to a present value using a
    risk-free market interest rate.

Swap agreements

:  Swap agreements require us to
    make payments to (or receive payments from) counterparties based
    upon the differential between a fixed and variable price or
    between variable prices of energy commodities at different
    locations. Swap agreements are valued based on prices of the
    underlying energy commodities over the contract life and
    contractual or notional volumes with the resulting expected
    future cash flows discounted to a present value using a
    risk-free market interest rate.

Option contracts

:  Physical and financial
    option contracts give the buyer the right to exercise the option
    and receive the difference between a predetermined strike price
    and a market price at the date of exercise. These



THE
    WILLIAMS COMPANIES, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

contracts are valued based on option pricing models considering
    prices of the underlying energy commodities over the contract
    life, volatility of the commodity prices, contractual volumes,
    estimated volumes under option and other arrangements, and a
    risk-free market interest rate.

Energy
    commodity cash flow hedges

We are exposed to market risk from changes in energy commodity
    prices within our operations. We utilize derivatives to manage
    our exposure to the variability in expected future cash flows
    from forecasted purchases and sales of natural gas and
    electricity attributable to commodity price risk. Certain of
    these derivatives have been designated as cash flow hedges under
    SFAS No. 133.

Our Power segment sells electricity produced by our electric
    generation facilities, obtained contractually through tolling
    agreements or obtained through marketplace transactions at
    different locations throughout the United States. We also buy
    electricity and capacity to serve our full requirements
    agreements in the Southeast. To reduce exposure to a decrease in
    revenues and increase in costs from fluctuations in electricity
    prices, we enter into fixed-price forward physical sales and
    purchase contracts and financial option contracts to mitigate
    the price risk on forecasted electricity sales and purchases.

Our electric generation facilities and tolling agreements
    require natural gas for the production of electricity. To reduce
    our exposure to increasing costs of natural gas due to changes
    in market prices, we enter into natural gas futures contracts,
    swap agreements, fixed-price forward physical purchases and
    financial option contracts to mitigate the price risk on
    anticipated purchases of natural gas.

Power’s cash flow hedges are expected to be highly
    effective in offsetting cash flows attributable to the hedged
    risk during the term of the hedge. However, ineffectiveness may
    be recognized primarily as a result of locational differences
    between the hedging derivative and the hedged item, changes in
    the creditworthiness of counterparties, and the hedging
    derivative contract having an initial fair value upon
    designation.

Our Exploration & Production segment produces, buys and
    sells natural gas at different locations throughout the United
    States. To reduce exposure to a decrease in revenues from
    fluctuations in natural gas market prices, we hedge price risk
    by entering into natural gas futures contracts, swap agreements,
    and financial option contracts to mitigate the price risk on
    forecasted sales and purchases of natural gas. We also enter
    into basis swap agreements to reduce the locational price risk
    associated with our producing basins. Exploration &
    Production’s cash flow hedges are expected to be highly
    effective in offsetting cash flows attributable to the hedged
    risk during the term of the hedge. However, ineffectiveness may
    be recognized primarily as a result of locational differences
    between the hedging derivative and the hedged item.

Changes in the fair value of our cash flow hedges are deferred
    in other comprehensive income and are reclassified into

revenues

in the same period or periods in which the
    hedged forecasted purchases or sales affect earnings, or when it
    is probable that the hedged forecasted transaction will not
    occur by the end of the originally specified time period. During
    2006, we reclassified approximately $1 million of net gains
    from other comprehensive income to earnings as a result of the
    discontinuance of cash flow hedges because the forecasted
    transaction did not occur by the end of the originally specified
    time period. Approximately $20 million and $2 million
    of net gains from hedge ineffectiveness are included in

revenues

in the Consolidated Statement of Income during
    2006 and 2005, respectively. For 2006 and 2005, there are no
    derivative gains or losses excluded from the assessment of hedge
    effectiveness. As of December 31, 2006, we have hedged
    portions of future cash flows associated with anticipated energy
    commodity purchases and sales for up to nine years. Based on
    recorded values at December 31, 2006, approximately
    $9 million of net gains (net of income tax provision of
    $6 million) will be reclassified into earnings within the
    next year. These recorded values are based on market prices of
    the commodities as of December 31, 2006. Due to the
    volatile nature of commodity prices and changes in the
    creditworthiness of counterparties, actual gains or losses
    realized in 2007 will likely differ from these values. These
    gains or losses will offset net losses or gains that



THE
    WILLIAMS COMPANIES, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

will be realized in earnings from previous unfavorable or
    favorable market movements associated with underlying hedged
    transactions.

Power elected hedge accounting for certain of its nontrading
    derivatives in the fourth quarter of 2004 after our Board
    decided in September 2004 to retain the Power business. Before
    this election, net changes in the fair value of these
    derivatives were recognized as revenues in the Consolidated
    Statement of Income.

Other
    energy derivatives

Our Power segment has other energy derivatives that have not
    been designated or do not qualify as SFAS No. 133
    hedges. As such, the net change in their fair value is
    recognized in revenues in the Consolidated Statement of Income.
    Even though they do not qualify for hedge accounting (see

derivative instruments and hedging activities

in
    Note 1 for a description of hedge accounting), certain of
    these derivatives hedge Power’s future cash flows on an
    economic basis.

In addition, our Exploration & Production segment
    enters into natural gas basis swap agreements that are not
    designated in a hedging relationship under
    SFAS No. 133. The fair value of these contracts is
    approximately $22 million as of December 31, 2006.

Other
    energy-related contracts

We also hold significant nonderivative energy-related contracts
    in our Power portfolios. These have not been included in the
    financial instruments table above or in our Consolidated Balance
    Sheet because they are not derivatives as defined by
    SFAS No. 133.

Guarantees

In addition to the guarantees and payment obligations discussed
    elsewhere in these footnotes (see Notes 3 and 15), we
    have issued guarantees and other similar arrangements with
    off-balance sheet risk as discussed below.

In connection with agreements executed prior to our acquisition
    of Transco to resolve

take-or-pay

and other contract claims and to amend gas purchase contracts,
    Transco entered into certain settlements with producers which
    may require the indemnification of certain claims for additional
    royalties that the producers may be required to pay as a result
    of such settlements. Transco, through its agent, Power,
    continues to purchase gas under contracts which extend, in some
    cases, through the life of the associated gas reserves. Certain
    of these contracts contain royalty indemnification provisions
    that have no carrying value. Producers have received certain
    demands and may receive other demands, which could result in
    claims pursuant to royalty indemnification provisions.
    Indemnification for royalties will depend on, among other
    things, the specific lease provisions between the producer and
    the lessor and the terms of the agreement between the producer
    and Transco. Consequently, the potential maximum future payments
    under such indemnification provisions cannot be determined.
    However, management believes that the probability of material
    payments is remote.

In connection with the 1993 public offering of units in the
    Williams Coal Seam Gas Royalty Trust (Royalty Trust), our
    Exploration & Production segment entered into a gas
    purchase contract for the purchase of natural gas in which the
    Royalty Trust holds a net profits interest. Under this
    agreement, we guarantee a minimum purchase price that the
    Royalty Trust will realize in the calculation of its net profits
    interest. We have an annual option to discontinue this minimum
    purchase price guarantee and pay solely based on an index price.
    The maximum potential future exposure associated with this
    guarantee is not determinable because it is dependent upon
    natural gas prices and production volumes. No amounts have been
    accrued for this contingent obligation as the index price
    continues to substantially exceed the minimum purchase price.

We are required by certain foreign lenders to ensure that the
    interest rates received by them under various loan agreements
    are not reduced by taxes by providing for the reimbursement of
    any domestic taxes required to be paid



THE
    WILLIAMS COMPANIES, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

by the foreign lender. The maximum potential amount of future
    payments under these indemnifications is based on the related
    borrowings. These indemnifications generally continue
    indefinitely unless limited by the underlying tax regulations
    and have no carrying value. We have never been called upon to
    perform under these indemnifications.

We have provided guarantees in the event of nonpayment by our
    previously owned communications subsidiary, WilTel, on certain
    lease performance obligations that extend through 2042. The
    maximum potential exposure is approximately $46 million at
    December 31, 2006, and $47 million at
    December 31, 2005. Our exposure declines systematically
    throughout the remaining term of WilTel’s obligations. The
    carrying value of these guarantees is approximately
    $41 million at December 31, 2006.

Former managing directors of Gulf Liquids are involved in
    litigation related to the construction of gas processing plants.
    Gulf Liquids has indemnity obligations to the former managing
    directors for legal fees and potential losses that may result
    from this litigation. Claims against these former managing
    directors have been settled and dismissed after payments on
    their behalf by directors and officers insurers. Some unresolved
    issues remain between us and these insurers, but no amounts have
    been accrued for any potential liability.

We have guaranteed the performance of a former subsidiary of our
    wholly owned subsidiary MAPCO Inc., under a coal supply
    contract. This guarantee was granted by MAPCO Inc. upon the sale
    of its former subsidiary to a third-party in 1996. The
    guaranteed contract provides for an annual supply of a minimum
    of 2.25 million tons of coal. Our potential exposure is
    dependent on the difference between current market prices of
    coal and the pricing terms of the contract, both of which are
    variable, and the remaining term of the contract. Given the
    variability of the terms, the maximum future potential payments
    cannot be determined. We believe that our likelihood of
    performance under this guarantee is remote. In the event we are
    required to perform, we are fully indemnified by the purchaser
    of MAPCO Inc.’s former subsidiary. This guarantee expires
    in December 2010 and has no carrying value.

    the California Independent System Operator (ISO), the California
    Department of Water Resources, and other power marketers and
    utilities located throughout the United States. As a general
    policy, collateral is not required for receivables, but
    customers’ financial condition and credit worthiness are
    evaluated regularly.

Derivative
    assets and liabilities

We have a risk of loss as a result of counterparties not
    performing pursuant to the terms of their contractual
    obligations. Risk of loss results from items including credit
    considerations and the regulatory environment for which a
    counterparty transacts. We attempt to minimize credit-risk
    exposure to derivative counterparties and brokers through formal
    credit policies, consideration of credit ratings from public
    ratings agencies, monitoring procedures, master netting
    agreements and collateral support under certain circumstances.

The concentration of counterparties within the energy and energy
    trading industry impacts our overall exposure to credit risk in
    that these counterparties are similarly influenced by changes in
    the economy and regulatory issues. Additional collateral support
    could include the following:

•

Letters of credit;

•

Payment under margin agreements;

•

Guarantees of payment by credit worthy parties.

We also enter into master netting agreements to mitigate
    counterparty performance and credit risk.

Rate
    and Regulatory Matters and Related Litigation

Our interstate pipeline subsidiaries have various regulatory

    proceedings, a portion of the revenues of these subsidiaries has
    been collected subject to refund. The natural gas pipeline
    subsidiaries have accrued approximately $2 million for
    potential refunds as of December 31, 2006.

Issues
    Resulting From California Energy Crisis

Subsidiaries of our Power segment are engaged in power marketing
    in various geographic areas, including California. Prices
    charged for power by us and other traders and generators in
    California and other western states in 2000 and 2001 were
    challenged in various proceedings, including those before the
    FERC. These challenges included refund proceedings, summer 2002

90-day

contracts, investigations of alleged market manipulation
    including withholding, gas indices and other gaming of the
    market, new long-term power sales to the State of California
    that were subsequently challenged and civil litigation relating
    to certain of these issues. We have entered into settlements
    with the State of California (State Settlement), major
    California utilities (Utilities Settlement), and others that
    substantially resolved each of these issues with these parties.

As a result of a December 19, 2006 Ninth Circuit Court of
    Appeals decision, certain contracts that Power entered into
    during 2000 and 2001 may be subject to partial refunds. These
    contracts, under which Power sold electricity, totaled
    approximately $89 million in revenue. While Power is not a
    party to the cases involved in the appellate court decision, the
    buyer of electricity from Power is a party to the cases and
    claims that Power must refund to the buyer any loss it suffers
    due to the decision and the FERC’s reconsideration of the
    contract terms at issue in the decision.

Certain other issues also remain open at the FERC and for other
    nonsettling parties.

Refund
    proceedings

Although we entered into the State Settlement and Utilities
    Settlement, which resolved the refund issues among the settling
    parties, we continue to have potential refund exposure to
    nonsettling parties, such as various California end users that
    did not participate in the Utilities Settlement. As a part of
    the Utilities Settlement, we funded escrow accounts that we
    anticipate will satisfy any ultimate refund determinations in
    favor of the nonsettling parties. We are also owed interest from
    counterparties in the California market during the refund period
    for which we have recorded a receivable totaling approximately
    $31 million at December 31, 2006. Collection of the
    interest is subject to the conclusion of this proceeding.
    Therefore, we continue to participate in the FERC refund case
    and related proceedings. Challenges to virtually every aspect of
    the refund proceeding, including the refund period, were made to
    the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. On August 2, 2006, the
    Ninth Circuit issued its order that largely upheld the
    FERC’s prior rulings, but it expanded the types of
    transactions that were made subject to refund. Because of our
    settlement, we do not expect this decision will have a material
    impact on us. No final refund calculation, however, has been
    made, and certain aspects of the refund calculation process
    remain unclear and prevent that final refund calculation. As
    part of the State Settlement, an additional $45 million,
    previously accrued, remains to be paid

to the California Attorney General (or his designee) over the
    next three years, with the final payment of $15 million due
    on January 1, 2010.

Reporting
    of Natural Gas-Related Information to Trade
    Publications

We disclosed on October 25, 2002, that certain of our
    natural gas traders had reported inaccurate information to a
    trade publication that published gas price indices. In 2002, we
    received a subpoena from a federal grand jury in northern
    California seeking documents related to our involvement in
    California markets, including our reporting to trade
    publications for both gas and power transactions. We have
    completed our response to the subpoena. Three former traders
    with Power have pled guilty to manipulation of gas prices
    through misreporting to an industry trade periodical. One former
    trader has pled not guilty. On February 21, 2006, we
    entered into a deferred prosecution agreement with the
    Department of Justice (DOJ) that is intended to resolve this
    matter. The agreement obligated us to pay a total of
    $50 million, of which $20 million was paid in March
    2006. The remaining $30 million has been paid in February
    2007. Absent a breach, the agreement will expire 15 months
    from the date of execution of the agreement and no further
    action will be taken by the DOJ.

Civil suits based on allegations of manipulating the gas indices
    have been brought against us and others, in each case seeking an
    unspecified amount of damages. We are currently a defendant in:

•

Class action litigation in federal court in Nevada alleging that
    we manipulated gas prices for direct purchasers of gas in
    California. We have reached settlement of this matter for
    $2.4 million. Legal documents will be filed with the court
    and the settlement is subject to court approval.

•

Class action litigation in state court in California alleging
    that we manipulated prices for indirect purchasers of gas in
    California. On December 11, 2006, the court granted final
    approval of our settlement of this matter for $15.6 million.

•

State court in California on behalf of certain individual gas
    users.

•

Class action litigation in state court in Colorado, Kansas,
    Missouri, Tennessee and Wisconsin brought on behalf of direct
    and indirect purchasers of gas in those states. On
    February 2, 2007, the Tennessee court dismissed the case
    before it because the claims could only be asserted at the FERC.

Earlier this year, we settled a case for $9.15 million in
    Federal court in New York based on an allegation of manipulation
    of the NYMEX gas market. It is reasonably possible that
    additional amounts may be necessary to resolve the remaining
    outstanding litigation in this area, the amount of which cannot
    be reasonably estimated at this time.

Mobile
    Bay Expansion

In December 2002, an administrative law judge at the FERC issued
    an initial decision in Transco’s 2001 general rate case
    which, among other things, rejected the recovery of the costs of
    Transco’s Mobile Bay expansion project from its shippers on
    a “rolled-in” basis and found that incremental pricing
    for the Mobile Bay expansion project is just and reasonable. In
    March 2004, the FERC issued an Order on Initial Decision in
    which it reversed certain parts of the administrative law
    judge’s decision and accepted Transco’s proposal for
    rolled-in rates. Power holds long-term transportation capacity
    on the Mobile Bay expansion project. If the FERC had adopted the
    decision of the administrative law judge on the pricing of the
    Mobile Bay expansion project and also required that the decision
    be implemented effective September 1, 2001, Power could
    have been subject to surcharges of approximately
    $111 million, including interest, through December 31,
    2006, in addition to increased costs going forward. Certain
    parties have filed appeals in federal court seeking to have the
    FERC’s ruling on the rolled-in rates overturned.

Enron
    Bankruptcy

We have outstanding claims against Enron Corp. and various of
    its subsidiaries (collectively “Enron”) related to its
    bankruptcy filed in December 2001. In 2002, we sold
    $100 million of our claims against Enron to a third party
    for $24.5 million. In 2003, Enron filed objections to these
    claims. We have resolved Enron’s objections, subject to
    court approval. Pursuant to the sales agreement, the purchaser
    of the claims has demanded repayment of the purchase price for
    the reduced portions of the claims. In January 2007, we entered
    into an

agreement-in-principle

with the purchaser to settle any potential repayment obligations.

Environmental
    Matters

Continuing
    operations

Since 1989, our Transco subsidiary has had studies underway to
    test certain of its facilities for the presence of toxic and
    hazardous substances to determine to what extent, if any,
    remediation may be necessary. Transco has responded to data
    requests from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
    (EPA) and state agencies regarding such potential contamination
    of certain of its sites. Transco has identified polychlorinated
    biphenyl (PCB) contamination in compressor systems, soils and
    related properties at certain compressor station sites. Transco
    has also been involved in negotiations with the EPA and state
    agencies to develop screening, sampling and cleanup programs. In
    addition, Transco commenced negotiations with certain
    environmental authorities and other programs concerning
    investigative and remedial actions relative to potential mercury
    contamination at certain gas metering sites. The costs of any
    such remediation will depend upon the scope of the remediation.
    At December 31, 2006, we had accrued liabilities of
    $6 million related to PCB contamination, potential mercury
    contamination, and other toxic and hazardous substances. Transco
    has been identified as a potentially responsible party at
    various Superfund and state waste disposal sites. Based on
    present volumetric estimates and other factors, we have
    estimated our aggregate exposure for remediation of these sites
    to be less than $500,000, which is included in the environmental
    accrual discussed above.

Beginning in the mid-1980’s, our Northwest Pipeline
    subsidiary evaluated many of its facilities for the presence of
    toxic and hazardous substances to determine to what extent, if
    any, remediation might be necessary. Consistent with other
    natural gas transmission companies, Northwest Pipeline
    identified PCB contamination in air compressor systems, soils
    and related properties at certain compressor station sites.
    Similarly, Northwest Pipeline identified hydrocarbon impacts at
    these facilities due to the former use of earthen pits and
    mercury contamination at certain gas metering sites. The PCBs
    were remediated pursuant to a Consent Decree with the EPA in the
    late 1980s and Northwest Pipeline conducted a voluntary

clean-up

of
    the hydrocarbon and mercury impacts in the early 1990s. In 2005,
    the Washington Department of Ecology required Northwest Pipeline
    to reevaluate its previous mercury

clean-ups

in
    Washington. Currently, Northwest Pipeline is assessing the
    actions needed for the sites to comply with Washington’s
    current environmental standards. At December 31, 2006, we
    have accrued liabilities totaling approximately $5 million
    for these costs. We expect that these costs will be recoverable
    through Northwest Pipeline’s rates.

We also accrue environmental remediation costs for natural gas
    underground storage facilities, primarily related to soil and
    groundwater contamination. At December 31, 2006, we have
    accrued liabilities totaling approximately $7 million for
    these costs.

In August 2005, our subsidiary, Williams Production RMT Company,
    voluntarily disclosed to the Colorado Department of Public
    Health and Environment (CDPHE) two air permit violations. We
    have reached an agreement in principle with the CDPHE in which
    we agree to pay a $500,000 penalty and conduct a supplemental
    environmental project. A definitive agreement will be finalized
    soon.

In March 2006, the CDPHE issued a notice of violation (NOV) to
    Williams Production RMT Company related to our operating permit
    for the Rulison oil separation and evaporation facility. On
    April 12, 2006, we met with the



THE
    WILLIAMS COMPANIES, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

CDPHE to discuss the allegations contained in the NOV. In May
    2006, we provided additional information to the agency regarding
    the emission estimates for operations from 1997 through 2003 and
    applied for updated permits.

In July 2006, the CDPHE issued an NOV to Williams Production RMT
    Company related to operating permits for our Roan Cliffs
    and Hayburn Gas Plants in Garfield County, Colorado. In
    September 2006, we met with the CDPHE to discuss the allegations
    contained in the NOV, and in October 2006, we provided
    additional requested information to the agency.

In August 2006, the CDPHE issued a NOV to Williams Production
    RMT Company related to our Grand Valley Oil Separation and
    Evaporation Facility located in Garfield County, Colorado in
    which the CDPHE alleged that we failed to obtain a construction
    permit and to comply with certain provisions of our existing
    permit. In September, 2006, we met with the CDPHE, and in
    October 2006, we provided additional requested information to
    the agency.

In July 2001, the EPA issued an information request asking for
    information on oil releases and discharges in any amount from
    our pipelines, pipeline systems, and pipeline facilities used in
    the movement of oil or petroleum products, during the period
    from July 1, 1998 through July 2, 2001. In November
    2001, we furnished our response. In March 2004, the DOJ invited
    the new owner of Williams Energy Partners and Magellan Midstream
    Partners, L.P. (Magellan) to enter into negotiations regarding
    alleged violations of the Clean Water Act. With the exception of
    four minor release events that underwent earlier cleanup
    operation under state enforcement actions, our environmental
    indemnification obligations to Magellan were released in a 2004
    buyout. We do not expect further enforcement action with respect
    to the four release events or two 2006 spills at our Colorado
    and Wyoming facilities after providing additional requested
    information to the DOJ.

Former
    operations, including operations classified as
    discontinued

In connection with the sale of certain assets and businesses, we
    have retained responsibility, through indemnification of the
    purchasers, for environmental and other liabilities existing at
    the time the sale was consummated, as described below.

Agrico

In connection with the 1987 sale of the assets of Agrico
    Chemical Company, we agreed to indemnify the purchaser for
    environmental cleanup costs resulting from certain conditions at
    specified locations to the extent such costs exceed a specified
    amount. At December 31, 2006, we have accrued liabilities
    of approximately $9 million for such excess costs.

Other

At December 31, 2006, we have accrued environmental
    liabilities totaling approximately $25 million related
    primarily to our:

•

Potential indemnification obligations to purchasers of our
    former retail petroleum and refining operations;

•

Former propane marketing operations, bio-energy facilities,
    petroleum products and natural gas pipelines;

•

Discontinued petroleum refining facilities;

•

Former exploration and production and mining operations.

These costs include certain conditions at specified locations
    related primarily to soil and groundwater contamination and any
    penalty assessed on Williams Refining & Marketing,
    L.L.C. (Williams Refining) associated with noncompliance with
    the EPA’s National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air
    Pollutants (NESHAP). In 2002, Williams Refining submitted a
    self-disclosure letter to the EPA indicating noncompliance with
    those regulations. This unintentional noncompliance had occurred
    due to a regulatory interpretation that resulted in
    under-counting the total annual benzene level at Williams
    Refining’s Memphis refinery. Also in 2002, the EPA
    conducted an all-

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

media audit of the Memphis refinery. In 2004, Williams Refining
    and the new owner of the Memphis refinery met with the EPA and
    the DOJ to discuss alleged violations and proposed penalties due
    to noncompliance issues identified in the report, including the
    benzene NESHAP issue. In July and August 2006, we finalized our
    agreements that resolved both the government’s claims
    against us for alleged violations and an indemnity dispute with
    the purchaser in connection with our 2003 sale of the Memphis
    refinery. We have paid the required settlement amounts to the
    purchaser, and our payment to the government awaits the filing
    of the settlement with the court.

In 2004, our Gulf Liquids subsidiary initiated a self-audit of
    all environmental conditions (air, water, waste) at three
    facilities: Geismar, Sorrento, and Chalmette, Louisiana. The
    audit revealed numerous infractions of Louisiana environmental
    regulations and resulted in a Consolidated Compliance Order and
    Notice of Potential Penalty from the Louisiana Department of
    Environmental Quality (LDEQ). No specific penalty amount was
    assessed. Instead, LDEQ was required by Louisiana law to demand
    a profit and loss statement to determine the financial benefit
    obtained by noncompliance and to assess a penalty accordingly.
    Gulf Liquids offered $91,500 as a single, final, global
    multi-media settlement. Subsequent negotiations have resulted in
    a revised offer of $109,000, which LDEQ is currently reviewing.

Certain of our subsidiaries have been identified as potentially
    responsible parties at various Superfund and state waste
    disposal sites. In addition, these subsidiaries have incurred,
    or are alleged to have incurred, various other hazardous
    materials removal or remediation obligations under environmental
    laws.

Summary
    of environmental matters

Actual costs incurred for these matters could be substantially
    greater than amounts accrued depending on the actual number of
    contaminated sites identified, the actual amount and extent of
    contamination discovered, the final cleanup standards mandated
    by the EPA and other governmental authorities and other factors,
    but the amount cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.

Other
    Legal Matters

Will
    Price (formerly Quinque)

In 2001, fourteen of our entities were named as defendants in a
    nationwide class action lawsuit in Kansas state court that had
    been pending against other defendants, generally pipeline and
    gathering companies, since 2000. The plaintiffs alleged that the
    defendants have engaged in mismeasurement techniques that
    distort the heating content of natural gas, resulting in an
    alleged underpayment of royalties to the class of producer
    plaintiffs and sought an unspecified amount of damages. The
    fourth amended petition, which was filed in 2003, deleted all of
    our defendant entities except two Midstream subsidiaries. All
    remaining defendants have opposed class certification and a
    hearing on plaintiffs’ second motion to certify the class
    was held on April 1, 2005. We are awaiting a decision from
    the court.

Grynberg

In 1998, the DOJ informed us that Jack Grynberg, an individual,
    had filed claims on behalf of himself and the federal
    government, in the United States District Court for the District
    of Colorado under the False Claims Act against us and certain of
    our wholly owned subsidiaries. The claims sought an unspecified
    amount of royalties allegedly not paid to the federal
    government, treble damages, a civil penalty, attorneys’
    fees, and costs. In connection with our sales of Kern River Gas
    Transmission in 2002 and Texas Gas Transmission Corporation in
    2003, we agreed to indemnify the purchasers for any liability
    relating to this claim, including legal fees. The maximum amount
    of future payments that we could potentially be required to pay
    under these indemnifications depends upon the ultimate
    resolution of the claim and cannot currently be determined.
    Grynberg had also filed claims against approximately 300 other
    energy companies alleging that the defendants violated the False
    Claims Act in connection with the measurement, royalty valuation
    and purchase of hydrocarbons. In 1999, the DOJ announced that it
    was declining to intervene in any of the Grynberg cases. Also in
    1999, the Panel on Multi-District



THE
    WILLIAMS COMPANIES, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Litigation transferred all of these cases, including those filed
    against us, to the federal court in Wyoming for pre-trial
    purposes. Grynberg’s measurement claims remained pending
    against us and the other defendants; the court previously
    dismissed Grynberg’s royalty valuation claims. In May 2005,
    the court-appointed special master entered a report which
    recommended that the claims against our Gas Pipeline and
    Midstream subsidiaries be dismissed but upheld the claims
    against our Exploration & Production subsidiaries
    against our jurisdictional challenge. In October 2006, the
    District Court dismissed all claims against us and our wholly
    owned subsidiaries, and in November 2006, Grynberg filed his
    notice of appeal with the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals.

On August 6, 2002, Jack J. Grynberg, and Celeste C.
    Grynberg, Trustee on Behalf of the Rachel Susan Grynberg Trust,
    and the Stephen Mark Grynberg Trust, served us and one of our
    Exploration & Production subsidiaries with a complaint
    in the state court in Denver, Colorado. The complaint alleges
    that we have used mismeasurement techniques that distort the BTU
    heating content of natural gas, resulting in the alleged
    underpayment of royalties to Grynberg and other independent
    natural gas producers. The complaint also alleges that we
    inappropriately took deductions from the gross value of their
    natural gas and made other royalty valuation errors. Under
    various theories of relief, the plaintiff is seeking actual
    damages of between $2 million and $20 million based on
    interest rate variations and punitive damages in the amount of
    approximately $1.4 million. In 2004, Grynberg filed an
    amended complaint against one of our Exploration &
    Production subsidiaries. This subsidiary filed an answer in
    January 2005, denying liability for the damages claimed. Trial
    in this case was originally set for May 2006, but the parties
    have negotiated an agreement dismissing the measurement claims
    and deferring further proceedings on the royalty claims until
    resolution of an appeal in another case.

Securities
    class actions

Numerous shareholder class action suits were filed against us in
    2002 in the United States District Court for the Northern
    District of Oklahoma. The majority of the suits alleged that we
    and co-defendants, WilTel, previously an owned subsidiary known
    as Williams Communications, and certain corporate officers,
    acted jointly and separately to inflate the stock price of both
    companies. Other suits alleged similar causes of action related
    to a public offering in early January 2002 known as the FELINE
    PACS offering. These cases were also filed in 2002 against us,
    certain corporate officers, all members of our board of
    directors and all of the offerings’ underwriters. WilTel
    was dismissed as a defendant as a result of its bankruptcy.
    These cases were consolidated and an order was issued requiring
    separate amended consolidated complaints by our equity holders
    and WilTel equity holders. The underwriter defendants have
    requested indemnification and defense from these cases. If we
    grant the requested indemnifications to the underwriters, any
    related settlement costs will not be covered by our insurance
    policies. We covered the cost of defending the underwriters. In
    2002, the amended complaints of the WilTel securities holders
    and of our securities holders added numerous claims related to
    Power. On June 13, 2006, we announced that we had reached
    an

agreement-in-principle

to settle the claims of our securities holders for a total
    payment of $290 million. On October 4, 2006, the court
    granted preliminary approval of the settlement. On
    November 3, 2006, we paid into escrow approximately
    $145 million in cash to fund the settlement, and the
    balance of the total settlement amount was funded by our
    insurers. On February 9, 2007, the court gave its final
    approval to the settlement. We entered into indemnity agreements
    with certain of our insurers to ensure their timely payment
    related to this settlement. The carrying value of our estimated
    liability related to these agreements is immaterial because we
    believe the likelihood of any future performance is remote.

Litigation with the WilTel equity holders continues but the
    trial has been stayed pending decisions on various motions for
    summary judgment. Any obligation of ours to the WilTel equity
    holders as a result of a settlement or as a result of trial will
    not likely be covered by insurance, as our insurance coverage
    has been fully utilized by the settlement described above. The
    extent of the obligation is presently unknown and cannot be
    estimated, but it is reasonably possible that our exposure
    materially exceeds amounts accrued for this matter.

Derivative shareholder suits have been filed in state court in
    Oklahoma all based on similar allegations. The state court
    approved motions to consolidate and to stay these Oklahoma suits
    pending action by the federal court in



THE

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

the shareholder suits. On December 23, 2006, our insurer
    paid $1.2 million on our behalf to reimburse the
    plaintiffs’ attorneys fees and expenses which concluded the
    settlement of these suits. We previously implemented certain
    corporate governance and internal control enhancements that we
    agreed to under the court-approved settlement agreement.

Federal
    income tax litigation

One of our wholly-owned subsidiaries, Transco Coal Gas Company,
    was engaged in a dispute with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS)
    regarding the recapture of certain income tax credits associated
    with the construction of a coal gasification plant in North
    Dakota by Great Plains Gasification Associates, in which Transco
    Coal Gas Company was a partner. This case has been resolved.
    (See Note 5.)

TAPS
    Quality Bank

One of our subsidiaries, Williams Alaska Petroleum, Inc. (WAPI),
    is actively engaged in administrative litigation being conducted
    jointly by the FERC and the Regulatory Commission of Alaska
    (RCA) concerning the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System (TAPS) Quality
    Bank. Primary issues being litigated include the appropriate
    valuation of the naphtha, heavy distillate, vacuum gas oil and
    residual product cuts within the TAPS Quality Bank as well as
    the appropriate retroactive effects of the determinations. Due
    to the sale of WAPI’s interests on March 31, 2004, no
    future Quality Bank liability will accrue but we are responsible
    for any liability that existed as of that date including
    potential liability for any retroactive payments that might be
    awarded in these proceedings for the period prior to
    March 31, 2004. In the third quarter of 2004, the FERC and
    RCA presiding administrative law judges rendered their joint and
    individual initial decisions. The initial decisions set forth
    methodologies for determining the valuations of the product cuts
    under review and also approved the retroactive application of
    the approved methodologies for the heavy distillate and residual
    product cuts. In

third-quarter

2004, we accrued approximately $134 million based on our
    computation and assessment of ultimate ruling terms that were
    considered probable.

The FERC and the RCA completed their reviews of the initial
    decisions and in 2005 issued substantially similar orders
    generally affirming the initial decisions. On June 1, 2006,
    the FERC, after two sets of rehearing requests, entered its
    final order (FERC Final Order). During this administrative
    rehearing process all other appeals of the initial decisions
    were stayed including ExxonMobil’s appeal to the D.C.
    Circuit Court of Appeals asserting that the FERC’s reliance
    on the Highway Reauthorization Act as the basis for limiting the
    retroactive effect violates, among other things, the separation
    of powers under the U.S. Constitution by interfering with
    the FERC’s independent decision-making role. ExxonMobil
    filed a similar appeal in the Alaska Superior Court. We also
    appealed the FERC’s order to the extent of its ruling on
    the West Coast Heavy Distillate component.

The Quality Bank Administrator issued his interpretations of the
    payment obligations under the FERC Final Order, and we and
    others filed exceptions to these instructions with the FERC. We
    expect the FERC’s ruling on these payment instruction
    exceptions later in the first quarter of 2007. Once the FERC
    rules, the Administrator will invoice us for amounts due, and we
    will be required to pay the invoiced amounts, subject to the
    outcome of the appeals of the FERC Final Order. We estimate that
    our net obligation could be as much as $116 million.
    Amounts accrued in excess of this estimated obligation will be
    retained pending resolution of all appeals.

Redondo
    Beach taxes

On February 5, 2005, Power received a tax assessment
    letter, addressed to AES Redondo Beach, L.L.C. and Power, from
    the city of Redondo Beach, California, in which the city
    asserted that approximately $33 million in back taxes and
    approximately $39 million in interest and penalties are
    owed related to natural gas used at the generating facility
    operated by AES Redondo Beach. Hearings were held in July 2005
    and in September 2005 the tax administrator for the city issued
    a decision in which he found Power jointly and severally liable
    with AES Redondo Beach for back taxes of approximately
    $36 million and interest and penalties of approximately



THE
    WILLIAMS COMPANIES, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

$21 million. Both we and AES Redondo Beach filed notices of
    appeal that were heard at the city level. On December 13,
    2006, the city hearing officer for the appeal of the pre-2005
    amounts issued a final decision affirming our utility user tax
    liability and reversing AES Redondo’s liability because the
    officer ruled that AES Redondo is an exempt public utility. Even
    though we appealed this decision to the Los Angeles Superior
    Court, we may be required to pay the full amount of any final
    assessment prior to the resolution of this state court appeal.
    Despite the city hearing officer’s unfavorable decision and
    the potential payment to preserve our appeal rights, we do not
    believe a contingent loss is probable.

The City’s current assessment of our liability (for the
    periods from 1998 through September 2006) is approximately
    $69 million (inclusive of interest and penalties). We have
    protested all these assessments and requested hearings on them.
    We and AES Redondo have also filed separate refund actions in
    Los Angeles Superior Court related to certain taxes paid since
    the initial 2005 notice of assessment. We believe that under our
    tolling agreement related to the Redondo Beach generating
    facility, AES Redondo Beach is responsible for taxes of the
    nature asserted by the city; however, AES Redondo Beach has
    notified us that it does not agree.

Gulf
    Liquids litigation

Gulf Liquids contracted with Gulsby Engineering Inc. (Gulsby)
    and Gulsby-Bay for the construction of certain gas processing
    plants in Louisiana. National American Insurance Company (NAICO)
    and American Home Assurance Company provided payment and
    performance bonds for the projects. Gulsby and Gulsby-Bay
    defaulted on the construction contracts. In the fall of 2001,
    the contractors, sureties, and Gulf Liquids filed multiple cases
    in Louisiana and Texas. In January 2002, NAICO added Gulf
    Liquids’ co-venturer Power to the suits as a third-party
    defendant. Gulf Liquids asserted claims against the contractors
    and sureties for, among other things, breach of contract
    requesting contractual and consequential damages from
    $40 million to $80 million, any of which is subject to
    a sharing arrangement with XL Insurance Company.

At the conclusion of the consolidated trial of the asserted
    contract and tort claims, the jury returned its actual damages
    verdict against Power and Gulf Liquids on July 31, 2006 and
    its related punitive damages verdict on August 1, 2006. The
    court is not expected to enter any judgment until the second or
    third quarter of 2007. Based on our interpretation of the jury
    verdicts, we have estimated exposure for actual damages of
    approximately $68 million plus potential interest of
    approximately $22 million, all of which have been accrued
    as of December 31, 2006. In addition, it is reasonably
    possible that any ultimate judgment may include additional
    amounts of approximately $199 million in excess of our
    accrual, which primarily represents our estimate of potential
    punitive damage exposure under Texas law.

Hurricane
    lawsuits

We were named as a defendant in two class action petitions for
    damages filed in federal court in Louisiana in September and
    October 2005 arising from hurricanes that struck Louisiana in
    2005. The class action plaintiffs, purporting to represent
    persons, businesses and entities in the State of Louisiana who
    have suffered damage as a result of the winds and storm surge
    from the hurricanes, allege that the operating activities of the
    two

sub-classes

of defendants, which are all oil and gas pipelines (including
    Transco) that dredged pipeline canals or installed pipelines in
    the marshes of south Louisiana and all oil and gas exploration
    and production companies which drilled for oil and gas or
    dredged canals in the marshes of south Louisiana, have altered
    marshland ecology and caused marshland destruction which
    otherwise would have averted all or almost all of the
    destruction and loss of life caused by the hurricanes.
    Plaintiffs requested that the court allow the lawsuits to
    proceed as class actions and sought legal and equitable relief
    in an unspecified amount. In September 2006, the court granted
    our and the other defendants’ joint motion to dismiss the
    class action petitions on various grounds. In August 2006, an
    additional class action case containing substantially identical
    allegations was filed against the same defendants, including
    Transco. This case was dismissed on November 30, 2006.

Wyoming
    severance taxes

The Wyoming Department of Audit (DOA) audited the severance tax
    reporting for our subsidiary Williams Production RMT Company for
    the production years 2000 through 2002. In August 2006, the DOA
    assessed additional severance tax and interest for those periods
    of approximately $3 million. In addition, the DOA notified
    us of an increase in the taxable value of our interests for ad
    valorem tax purposes, which is estimated to result in additional
    taxes of approximately $2 million, including interest. We
    dispute the DOA’s interpretation of the statutory
    obligation and have appealed this assessment to the Wyoming
    State Board of Equalization. If the DOA prevails in its
    interpretation of our obligation and applies the same basis of
    assessment to subsequent periods, it is reasonably possible that
    we could owe a total of approximately $21 million to
    $23 million in taxes and interest from January 1,
    2003, through December 31, 2006.

Royalty
    litigation

In September 2006, royalty interest owners in Garfield County,
    Colorado, filed a class action suit in Colorado state court
    alleging that we improperly calculated oil and gas royalty
    payments, failed to account for the proceeds that we received
    from the sale of gas and extracted products, improperly charged
    certain expenses, and failed to refund amounts withheld in
    excess of ad valorem tax obligations. The plaintiffs claim that
    the class might be in excess of 500 individuals and seek an
    accounting and damages. The parties have agreed to stay this
    action in order to participate in a mediation to be scheduled.

Other
    Divestiture Indemnifications

Pursuant to various purchase and sale agreements relating to
    divested businesses and assets, we have indemnified certain
    purchasers against liabilities that they may incur with respect
    to the businesses and assets acquired from us. The indemnities
    provided to the purchasers are customary in sale transactions
    and are contingent upon the purchasers incurring liabilities
    that are not otherwise recoverable from third parties. The
    indemnities generally relate to breach of warranties, tax,
    historic litigation, personal injury, environmental matters,
    right of way and other representations that we have provided.

We sold a natural gas liquids pipeline system in 2002, and in
    July 2006, the purchaser of that system filed its complaint
    against us and our subsidiaries in state court in Houston,
    Texas. The purchaser alleges that we breached certain warranties
    under the purchase and sale agreement and seeks an unspecified
    amount of damages and our specific performance under certain
    guarantees. On September 1, 2006, we filed our answer to
    the purchaser’s complaint denying all liability. We
    anticipate that the trial will occur in the fourth quarter 2007,
    and our prior suit filed against the purchaser in Delaware state
    court has been stayed pending resolution of the Texas case.

At December 31, 2006, we do not expect any of the
    indemnities provided pursuant to the sales agreements to have a
    material impact on our future financial position. However, if a
    claim for indemnity is brought against us in the future, it may
    have a material adverse effect on results of operations in the
    period in which the claim is made.

In addition to the foregoing, various other proceedings are
    pending against us which are incidental to our operations.

Summary

Litigation, arbitration, regulatory matters, and environmental
    matters are subject to inherent uncertainties. Were an
    unfavorable ruling to occur, there exists the possibility of a
    material adverse impact on the results of operations in the
    period in which the ruling occurs. Management, including
    internal counsel, currently believes that the ultimate
    resolution of the foregoing matters, taken as a whole and after
    consideration of amounts accrued, insurance coverage, recovery
    from customers or other indemnification arrangements, will not
    have a materially adverse effect upon our future financial
    position.

Commitments

Power has entered into certain contracts giving it the right to
    receive fuel conversion services as well as certain other
    services associated with electric generation facilities that are
    currently in operation throughout the continental United States.
    At December 31, 2006, Power’s estimated committed
    payments under these contracts range from approximately
    $406 million to $424 million annually through 2017 and
    decline over the remaining five years to $59 million in
    2022. Total committed payments under these contracts over the
    next sixteen years are approximately $5.5 billion. Included
    in the $5.5 billion is a $1.9 billion contract that is
    accounted for as an operating lease. (See Leases-Lessee in
    Note 11.) Total payments made under these contracts during
    2006, 2005, and 2004 were $409 million, $403 million,
    and $402 million, respectively.

Commitments for construction and acquisition of property, plant
    and equipment are approximately $406 million at
    December 31, 2006.

Available-for-Sale
    Securities

During 2004, we received proceeds totaling $851.4 million
    from the sale and maturity of available-for-sale securities. We
    realized losses of $5.5 million from these transactions.

Note 17.

Segment
    Disclosures

Our reportable segments are strategic business units that offer
    different products and services. The segments are managed
    separately because each segment requires different technology,
    marketing strategies and industry knowledge. Our master limited
    partnership, Williams Partners L.P., is consolidated within our
    Midstream segment. (See Note 1.) Other primarily consists
    of corporate operations.

Performance
    Measurement

We currently evaluate performance based on

segment profit
    (loss)

from operations, which includes

segment revenues

from external and internal customers,

segment costs and
    expenses, depreciation, depletion and amortization, equity
    earnings (losses)

and

income (loss) from investments

including impairments related to investments accounted for under
    the equity method. The accounting policies of the segments are
    the same as those described in Note 1. Intersegment sales
    are generally accounted for at current market prices as if the
    sales were to unaffiliated third parties.

During 2004, Power was party to intercompany interest rate swaps
    with the corporate parent, the effect of which is included in
    Power’s

segment revenues

and

segment profit
    (loss)

as shown in the reconciliation within the following
    tables. We terminated these interest-rate derivatives in the
    fourth quarter of 2004.

The majority of energy commodity hedging by certain of our
    business units is done through intercompany derivatives with
    Power which, in turn, enters into offsetting derivative
    contracts with unrelated third parties. Power bears the
    counterparty performance risks associated with the unrelated
    third parties. External revenues of our Exploration &
    Production segment includes third-party oil and gas sales, more
    than offset by transportation expenses and royalties due third
    parties on intersegment sales.

The SEC defines proved oil and gas reserves

(Rule 4-10(a)

of

Regulation S-X)

as the estimated quantities of crude oil, natural gas, and
    natural gas liquids which geological and engineering data
    demonstrate with reasonable certainty are recoverable in future
    years from known reservoirs under existing economic and
    operating conditions. Our proved reserves consist of two
    categories, proved developed reserves and proved undeveloped
    reserves. Proved developed reserves are currently producing
    wells and wells awaiting minor sales connection expenditure,
    recompletion, additional perforations or borehole stimulation
    treatments. Proved undeveloped reserves are those reserves which
    are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage
    or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is
    required for recompletion. Proved reserves on undrilled acreage
    are limited to those drilling units offsetting productive units
    that are reasonably certain of production when drilled or where
    it can be demonstrated with certainty that there is continuity
    of production from the existing productive formation.

•

Natural gas reserves are computed at 14.73 pounds per square
    inch absolute and 60 degrees Fahrenheit. Crude oil reserves are
    insignificant and have been included in the proved reserves on a
    basis of billion cubic feet equivalents (Bcfe).

Standardized
    Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows Relating to Proved
    Oil and Gas Reserves

The following is based on the estimated quantities of proved
    reserves and the year-end prices and costs. The average year end
    natural gas prices used in the following estimates were $4.81,
    $6.95, and $5.08 per MMcfe at December 31, 2006, 2005,
    and 2004, respectively. Future income tax expenses have been
    computed considering available carry forwards and credits and
    the appropriate statutory tax rates. The discount rate of
    10 percent is as prescribed by SFAS No. 69.
    Continuation of year-end economic conditions also is assumed.
    The calculation is based on estimates of proved reserves, which
    are revised over time as new data becomes available. Probable or
    possible reserves, which may become proved in the future, are
    not considered. The calculation also requires assumptions as to
    the timing of future production of proved reserves, and the
    timing and amount of future development and production costs. Of
    the $3,070 million of future development costs,
    $1,041 million, $942 million and $540 million are
    estimated to be spent in 2007, 2008 and 2009, respectively.

Numerous uncertainties are inherent in estimating volumes and
    the value of proved reserves and in projecting future production
    rates and timing of development expenditures. Such reserve
    estimates are subject to change as additional information
    becomes available. The reserves actually recovered and the
    timing of production may be substantially different from the
    reserve estimates.

Item 9A.

Controls
    and Procedures

Evaluation
    of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

An evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation
    of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in

Rules 13a-15(e)

and

15d-15(e)

of
    the Securities Exchange Act) (Disclosure Controls) was performed
    as of the end of the period covered by this report. This
    evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the
    participation of our management, including our Chief Executive
    Officer and Chief Financial Officer. Based upon that evaluation,
    our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer
    concluded that these Disclosure Controls are effective at a
    reasonable assurance level.

Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
    Financial Officer, does not expect that our Disclosure Controls
    will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no
    matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only
    reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the
    control system are met. Further, the design of a control system
    must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and
    the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their
    costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control
    systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute
    assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if
    any, within the company have been detected. These inherent
    limitations include the realities that judgments in
    decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur
    because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can
    be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by
    collusion of two or more people, or by management override of
    the control. The design of any system of controls also is based
    in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future
    events, and there can be no assurance that any design will
    succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future
    conditions. Because of the inherent limitations in a
    cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or
    fraud may occur and not be detected. We monitor our Disclosure
    Controls and make modifications as necessary; our intent in this
    regard is that the Disclosure Controls will be modified as
    systems change and conditions warrant.
