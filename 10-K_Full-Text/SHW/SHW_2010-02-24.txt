PART
    I

ITEM
    1.  BUSINESS

Introduction

The Sherwin-Williams Company, founded in 1866 and incorporated
    in Ohio in 1884, is engaged in the development, manufacture,
    distribution and sale of paint, coatings and related products to
    professional, industrial, commercial and retail customers
    primarily in North and South America with additional operations
    in the Caribbean region, Europe and Asia. Our principal
    executive offices are located at 101 West Prospect Avenue,
    Cleveland, Ohio 44115-1075, telephone (216) 566-2000. As
    used in this report, the terms “Sherwin-Williams,”
    “Company,” “we” and “our” mean The
    Sherwin-Williams Company and its consolidated subsidiaries
    unless the context indicates otherwise.

    Corporate Governance Guidelines, our Director Independence
    Standards, our Business Ethics Policy and the charters of our
    Audit Committee, our Compensation and Management Development
    Committee, and our Nominating and Corporate Governance
    Committee. You may access these documents in the “Corporate
    Governance” section on the “Investor Relations”
    page of our website at www.sherwin.com.

Basis of
    Reportable Segments

We report our segment information in the same way that
    management internally organizes our business for assessing
    performance and making decisions regarding allocation of
    resources in accordance with the Segment Reporting Topic of the
    Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards
    Codification (ASC). We have three reportable operating segments:
    Paint Stores Group, Consumer Group and Global Finishes Group
    (collectively, the “Reportable Operating Segments”).
    Factors considered in determining our Reportable Operating
    Segments include the nature of the business activities,
    existence of managers responsible for the operating and
    administrative activities and information presented to our Board
    of Directors. We report all other business activities and
    immaterial operating segments that are not reportable in the
    Administrative segment. For more information about the
    Reportable Operating Segments, see pages 5 through 7 of our 2009
    Annual Report, which is incorporated herein by reference.

The Company’s chief operating decision maker
    (CODM) has been identified as the Chief Executive Officer
    because he has final authority over performance assessment and
    resource allocation decisions. Because of the diverse operations
    of the Company, the CODM regularly receives discrete financial
    information about each Reportable Operating Segment as well as a
    significant amount of additional financial information about
    certain divisions, business units or subsidiaries of the
    Company. The CODM uses all such financial information for
    performance assessment and resource allocation decisions. The
    CODM evaluates the performance of and allocates resources to the
    Reportable Operating Segments based on profit or loss before
    income taxes and cash generated from operations. The accounting
    policies of the Reportable Operating Segments are the same as
    those described in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements on pages 44 through 50 of our 2009
    Annual Report, which is incorporated herein by reference.

Paint
    Stores Group

The Paint Stores Group consisted of 3,354 company-operated
    specialty paint stores in the United States, Canada, Puerto
    Rico, Virgin Islands, Trinidad and Tobago, St. Maarten and
    Jamaica at December 31, 2009. Each store in this segment is
    engaged in the related business activity of selling paint,
    coatings and related products to end-



use customers. The Paint Stores Group markets and sells
    Sherwin-Williams

®

branded architectural paint and coatings, industrial and marine
    products, original equipment manufacturer (“OEM”)
    product finishes and related items. These products are produced
    by manufacturing facilities in the Consumer and Global Finishes
    Groups. In addition, each store sells selected purchased
    associated products. During 2009, this segment opened 8 net new
    stores, consisting of 53 new stores opened (44 in the United
    States, 7 in Canada, 1 in Jamaica and 1 in St. Maarten) and 45
    stores closed (in the United States). In 2008, this segment
    opened 21 net new stores (14 in the United States). In
    2007, there were 172 stores acquired and 107 net new stores
    opened (81 in the United States). The loss of any single
    customer would not have a material adverse effect on the
    business of this segment. A map on page 10 of our 2009 Annual
    Report, which is incorporated herein by reference, shows the
    number of paint stores and their geographic locations.

Consumer
    Group

The Consumer Group develops, manufactures and distributes a
    variety of paint, coatings and related products to third party
    customers primarily in the United States and Canada and the
    Paint Stores Group. Approximately 51 percent of the total
    sales of the Consumer Group in 2009, including inter-segment
    transfers, represented products sold through the Paint Stores
    Group. Sales and marketing of certain controlled brand and
    private labeled products is performed by a direct sales staff.
    The products distributed through third party customers are
    intended for resale to the ultimate end-user of the product. The
    Consumer Group had sales to certain customers that,
    individually, may be a significant portion of the sales of the
    segment. However, the loss of any single customer would not have
    a material adverse effect on the overall profitability of the
    segment. This segment incurred most of the Company’s
    capital expenditures related to ongoing environmental compliance
    measures.

Global
    Finishes Group

The Global Finishes Group develops, licenses, manufactures,
    distributes and sells a variety of architectural paint and
    coatings, industrial and marine products, automotive finishes
    and refinish products, OEM coatings and related products in
    North and South America, Europe and Asia. This segment meets the
    demands of its customers for a consistent worldwide product
    development, manufacturing and distribution presence and
    approach to doing business. This segment licenses certain
    technology and trade names worldwide.
    Sherwin-Williams

®

and other controlled brand products are distributed through the
    Paint Stores Group and this segment’s 539 company-operated
    branches and by a direct sales staff and outside sales
    representatives to retailers, dealers, jobbers, licensees and
    other third party distributors. During 2009, this segment opened
    18 new branches (8 in the United States, 1 in Canada, 6 in South
    America and 3 in India) and closed 20 (1 in South America, 15 in
    the United States  and 4 in Mexico) for a net reduction of 2
    branches. At December 31, 2009, the Global Finishes Group
    consisted of operations in the United States, subsidiaries in
    14 foreign countries, 4 foreign joint ventures and
    income from licensing agreements in 16 foreign countries. A map
    on page 10 of our 2009 Annual Report, which is incorporated
    herein by reference, shows the number of branches and their
    geographic locations.

Administrative
    Segment

The Administrative segment includes the administrative expenses
    of the Company’s corporate headquarters site. Also included
    in the Administrative segment was interest expense, interest and
    investment income, certain expenses related to closed facilities
    and environmental-related matters, and other expenses which were
    not directly associated with the Reportable Operating Segments.
    The Administrative segment did not include any significant
    foreign operations. Also included in the Administrative segment
    was a real estate management unit that is responsible for the
    ownership, management, and leasing of non-retail properties held
    primarily for use by the Company, including the Company’s
    headquarters site, and disposal of idle facilities. Sales of
    this segment represented external leasing revenue of excess
    headquarters space or leasing of facilities no longer used by
    the Company in its primary businesses. Gains and losses from the
    sale of property were not a significant operating factor in
    determining the performance of the Administrative segment.



Segment
    Financial Information

For financial information regarding our Reportable Operating
    Segments, including net external sales, segment profit,
    identifiable assets and other information by segment, see
    Note 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
    on pages 75 through 77 of our 2009 Annual Report, which is
    incorporated herein by reference.

Domestic
    and Foreign Operations

Financial and other information regarding domestic and foreign
    operations is set forth in Note 19 of the Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements on page 76 of our 2009
    Annual Report, which is incorporated herein by reference.

Additional information regarding risks attendant to foreign
    operations is set forth on page 29 of our 2009 Annual
    Report under the caption “Market Risk” of
    “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
    Condition and Results of Operation,” which is incorporated
    herein by reference.

Business
    Developments

For additional information regarding our business and business
    developments, see pages 5 through 10 of our 2009 Annual
    Report and the “Letter to Shareholders” on
    pages 1 through 4 of our 2009 Annual Report, which is
    incorporated herein by reference.

Raw
    Materials and Products Purchased for Resale

Raw materials and fuel supplies are generally available from
    various sources in sufficient quantities that none of the
    Reportable Operating Segments anticipate any significant
    sourcing problems during 2010. There are sufficient suppliers of
    each product purchased for resale that none of the Reportable
    Operating Segments anticipate any significant sourcing problems
    during 2010.

Seasonality

The majority of the sales for the Reportable Operating Segments
    traditionally occur during the second and third quarters. There
    is no significant seasonality in sales for the Administrative
    segment.

Working
    Capital

In order to meet increased demand during the second and third
    quarters, the Company usually builds its inventories during the
    first quarter. Working capital items (inventories and accounts
    receivable) are generally financed through short-term
    borrowings, which include the use of lines of credit and the
    issuance of commercial paper. For a description of the
    Company’s liquidity and capital resources, see
    pages 19 through 30 of our 2009 Annual Report under
    the caption “Financial Condition, Liquidity and Cash
    Flow” of  “Management’s Discussion and Analysis
    of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” which is
    incorporated herein by reference.

Trademarks
    and Trade Names

Customer recognition of our trademarks and trade names
    collectively contribute significantly to our sales. The major
    trademarks and trade names used by each Reportable Operating
    Segment are set forth below.

Patents

Although patents and licenses are not of material importance to
    our business as a whole or any segment, the Global Finishes
    Group derives a portion of its income from the licensing of
    technology, trademarks and trade names to foreign companies.

Backlog
    and Productive Capacity

Backlog orders are not significant in the business of any
    Reportable Operating Segment since there is normally a short
    period of time between the placing of an order and shipment. We
    believe that sufficient productive capacity currently exists to
    fulfill our needs for paint, coatings and related products
    through 2010.

Research
    and Development

For information regarding our costs of research and development
    included in technical expenditures, see Note 1 of the Notes
    to Consolidated Financial Statements on page 47 of our 2009
    Annual Report, which is incorporated herein by reference.

Competition

We experience competition from many local, regional, national
    and international competitors of various sizes in the
    manufacture, distribution and sale of our paint, coatings and
    related products. We are a leading manufacturer and retailer of
    paint, coatings and related products to professional,
    industrial, commercial and retail customers, however, our
    competitive position varies for our different products and
    markets.

In the Paint Stores Group, competitors include other paint and
    wallpaper stores, mass merchandisers, home centers, independent
    hardware stores, hardware chains and manufacturer-operated
    direct outlets. Product quality, product innovation, breadth of
    product line, technical expertise, service and price determine
    the competitive advantage for this segment.

In the Consumer Group, domestic and foreign competitors include
    manufacturers and distributors of branded and private labeled
    paint and coatings products. Technology, product quality,
    product innovation, breadth of product line, technical
    expertise, distribution, service and price are the key
    competitive factors for this segment.

The Global Finishes Group has numerous competitors in its
    domestic and foreign markets with broad product offerings and
    several others with niche products. Key competitive factors for
    this segment include technology, product quality, product
    innovation, breadth of product line, technical expertise,
    distribution, service and price.

The Administrative segment has many competitors consisting of
    other real estate owners, developers and managers in areas in
    which this segment owns property. The main competitive factors
    are the availability of property and price.

Employees

We employed 29,220 persons at December 31, 2009.

Environmental
    Compliance

For additional information regarding environmental-related
    matters, see pages 22 through 24 of our 2009 Annual Report
    under the caption “Environmental-Related Liabilities”
    of  “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
    Condition and Results of Operations” and Notes 1, 9
    and 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements on
    pages 46, 63 through 65, and 72, respectively, of our 2009
    Annual Report, which is incorporated herein by reference.



CAUTIONARY
    STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION

Certain statements contained in “Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations,” “Business” and elsewhere in this
    report constitute “forward-looking statements” within
    the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933
    and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
    These forward-looking statements are based upon
    management’s current expectations, estimates, assumptions
    and beliefs concerning future events and conditions and may
    discuss, among other things, anticipated future performance
    (including sales and earnings), expected growth, future business
    plans and the costs and potential liability for
    environmental-related matters and the lead pigment and
    lead-based paint litigation. Any statement that is not
    historical in nature is a forward-looking statement and may be
    identified by the use of words and phrases such as
    “expects,” “anticipates,”
    “believes,” “will,” “will likely
    result,” “will continue,” “plans to”
    and similar expressions.

Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any
    forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are
    necessarily subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors,
    many of which are outside our control, that could cause actual
    results to differ materially from such statements and from our
    historical results and experience. These risks, uncertainties
    and other factors include such things as:

•

the duration and severity of the current negative global
    economic and financial conditions;

•

general business conditions, strengths of retail and
    manufacturing economies and the growth in the coatings industry;

•

competitive factors, including pricing pressures and product
    innovation and quality;

•

changes in raw material and energy supplies and pricing;

•

changes in our relationships with customers and suppliers;

•

our ability to attain cost savings from productivity initiatives;

•

our ability to successfully integrate past and future
    acquisitions into our existing operations, as well as the
    performance of the businesses acquired;

•

risks and uncertainties associated with our ownership of Life
    Shield Engineered Systems, LLC;

•

changes in general domestic economic conditions such as
    inflation rates, interest rates, tax rates, unemployment rates,
    higher labor and healthcare costs, recessions, and changing
    government policies, laws and regulations;

•

risks and uncertainties associated with our expansion into and
    our operations in Asia, Mexico, South America and other foreign
    markets, including general economic conditions, inflation rates,
    recessions, foreign currency exchange rates, foreign investment
    and repatriation restrictions, legal and regulatory constraints,
    civil unrest and other external economic and political factors;

•

the achievement of growth in developing markets, such as Asia,
    Mexico and South America;

•

increasingly stringent domestic and foreign governmental
    regulations including those affecting health, safety and the
    environment;

•

inherent uncertainties involved in assessing our potential
    liability for environmental-related activities;

•

other changes in governmental policies, laws and regulations,
    including changes in accounting policies and standards and
    taxation requirements (such as new tax laws and new or revised
    tax law interpretations);

•

the nature, cost, quantity and outcome of pending and future
    litigation and other claims, including the lead pigment and
    lead-based paint litigation, and the effect of any legislation
    and administrative regulations relating thereto; and

•

unusual weather conditions.

Readers are cautioned that it is not possible to predict or
    identify all of the risks, uncertainties and other factors that
    may affect future results and that the above list should not be
    considered to be a complete list. Any forward-



looking statement speaks only as of the date on which such
    statement is made, and we undertake no obligation to update or
    revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new
    information, future events or otherwise.

ITEM
    1A.  RISK FACTORS

Described below and elsewhere in this report and other documents
    that we file from time to time with the Securities and Exchange
    Commission are risks, uncertainties and other factors that can
    adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flow,
    liquidity or financial condition.

Adverse
    changes in general business and economic conditions in the
    United States and worldwide may adversely affect our results of
    operations, cash flow, liquidity or financial
    condition.

Adverse changes in general business and economic conditions in
    the United States and worldwide may reduce the demand for some
    of our products and adversely affect our results of operations,
    cash flow, liquidity or financial condition. Higher inflation
    rates, interest rates, tax rates and unemployment rates, higher
    labor and healthcare costs, recessions, changing governmental
    policies, laws and regulations, and other economic factors that
    adversely affect the demand for our paint, coatings and related
    products could adversely affect our results of operations, cash
    flow, liquidity or financial condition.

The
    duration and severity of the current global economic and
    financial downturn may adversely affect our results of
    operations, cash flow, liquidity or financial
    condition.

A protracted continuation or worsening of the current global
    economic and financial conditions may adversely impact our net
    sales, the collection of accounts receivable, funding for
    working capital needs, expected cash flow generation from
    current and acquired businesses, and our investments, which may
    adversely impact our results of operations, cash flow, liquidity
    or financial condition.

We finance a portion of our sales through trade credit. The
    current global economic and financial conditions have caused
    some customers to be less profitable and have increased our
    exposure to credit risk. In addition, due to the tightening of
    credit markets, some customers who require financing for their
    businesses have not been able to obtain necessary financing.
    Continuation of these conditions could limit our ability to
    collect our accounts receivable, which could adversely affect
    our results of operations, cash flow, liquidity or financial
    condition.

We generally fund a portion of our seasonal working capital
    needs and obtain funding for other general corporate purposes
    through short-term borrowings backed by our revolving credit
    facility and other financing facilities. If any of the banks in
    these credit and financing facilities are unable to perform on
    their commitments, which could adversely affect our ability to
    fund seasonal working capital needs and obtain funding for other
    general corporate purposes, our cash flow, liquidity or
    financial condition could be adversely impacted.

Although we currently have available credit facilities to fund
    our current operating needs, we cannot be certain that we will
    be able to replace our existing credit facilities or refinance
    our existing debt when necessary. Our cost of borrowing and
    ability to access the capital markets are affected not only by
    market conditions, but also by our debt and credit ratings
    assigned by the major credit rating agencies. Downgrades in
    these ratings will increase our cost of borrowing and could have
    an adverse effect on our access to the capital markets,
    including our access to the commercial paper  market. An
    inability to access the capital markets could have a material
    adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flow,
    liquidity or financial condition.

We have goodwill and intangible assets recorded on our balance
    sheet. We periodically evaluate the recoverability of the
    carrying value of our goodwill and intangible assets whenever
    events or changes in circumstances indicate that such value may
    not be recoverable. Impairment assessment involves judgment as
    to assumptions regarding future sales and cash flows and the
    impact of market conditions on those assumptions. Future events
    and changing market conditions may impact our assumptions and
    may result in changes in our estimates of future sales and cash
    flows that may result in us incurring substantial impairment
    charges, which would adversely affect our results of operations
    or financial condition.



We hold investments in equity and debt securities in some of our
    defined benefit pension plans. A decrease in the value of plan
    assets resulting from a general financial downturn may cause a
    negative pension plan investment performance, which may
    adversely affect our results of operations, cash flow, liquidity
    or financial condition.

Economic
    downturns in cyclical segments of the economy may reduce the
    demand for some of our products and adversely affect our sales,
    earnings, cash flow or financial condition.

Portions of our business involve the sale of paint, coatings and
    related products to segments of the economy that are cyclical in
    nature, particularly segments relating to construction, housing
    and manufacturing. Our sales to these segments are affected by
    the levels of discretionary consumer and business spending in
    these segments. During economic downturns in these segments, the
    levels of consumer and business discretionary spending may
    decrease. This decrease in spending will likely reduce the
    demand for some of our products and may adversely affect our
    sales, earnings, cash flow or financial condition.

During the past three years, the U.S. homebuilding industry
    experienced a significant and sustained decrease in demand for
    new homes and an oversupply of new and existing homes available
    for sale. During this same time period, the U.S. real
    estate industry also experienced a significant decrease in
    existing home turnover. The commercial and industrial building
    and maintenance sectors also began to experience a significant
    decline in 2008. The downturn in each of these segments has
    contributed to an unprecedented decline in the demand for some
    of our products and adversely affected our sales and earnings.
    We cannot predict the duration or severity of the downturn in
    these segments. Continued downturn in these segments will
    continue to reduce the demand for some of our products and may
    adversely impact sales, earnings and cash flow.

Increases
    in the cost of raw materials and energy may adversely affect our
    earnings or cash flow.

We purchase raw materials and energy for use in the
    manufacturing, distribution and sale of our products. Factors
    such as adverse weather conditions, including hurricanes, and
    other disasters can disrupt raw material and fuel supplies and
    increase our costs. Although raw materials and energy supplies
    are generally available from various sources in sufficient
    quantities, unexpected shortages and increases in the cost of
    raw materials and energy, or any deterioration in our
    relationships with or the financial viability of our suppliers,
    may have an adverse effect on our earnings or cash flow in the
    event we are unable to offset higher costs in a timely manner by
    sufficiently decreasing our operating costs or raising the
    prices of our products. Many of our paint and coatings products
    utilize petroleum based derivatives, minerals (including
    titanium dioxide) and metals.

Although
    we have an extensive customer base, the loss of any of our
    largest customers could adversely affect our sales, earnings or
    cash flow.

We have a large and varied customer base due to our extensive
    distribution network. During 2009, no individual customer
    accounted for sales totaling more than ten percent of our sales.
    However, we have some customers that, individually, purchase a
    large amount of products from us. Although our broad
    distribution channels would help to minimize the impact of the
    loss of any one customer, the loss of any of these large
    customers could have an adverse effect on our sales, earnings or
    cash flow.

Adverse
    weather conditions may temporarily reduce the demand for some of
    our products and could have a negative effect on our sales,
    earnings or cash flow.

From time to time, adverse weather conditions in certain parts
    of the United States have had an adverse effect on our sales of
    paint, coatings and related products. For example, unusually
    cold and rainy weather, especially during the exterior painting
    season, could have an adverse effect on sales of our exterior
    paint products. An adverse effect on sales may cause a reduction
    in our earnings or cash flow.

Increased
    competition may reduce our sales, earnings or cash flow
    performance.

We face substantial competition from many international,
    national, regional and local competitors of various sizes in the
    manufacture, distribution and sale of our paint, coatings and
    related products. Some of our competitors are larger than us and
    have greater financial resources to compete. Other competitors
    are smaller and may be able to



offer more specialized products. Technology, product quality,
    product innovation, breadth of product line, technical
    expertise, distribution, service and price are the key
    competitive factors for our business. Competition in any of
    these areas may reduce our sales and adversely affect our
    earnings or cash flow by resulting in decreased sales volumes,
    reduced prices and increased costs of manufacturing,
    distributing and selling our products.

Our
    results of operations, cash flow or financial condition may be
    negatively impacted if we do not successfully integrate past and
    future acquisitions into our existing operations and if the
    performance of the businesses we acquire do not meet our
    expectations.

We have historically made strategic acquisitions of businesses
    in the paint and coatings industry and will likely acquire
    additional businesses in the future as part of our long term
    growth strategy. These acquisitions involve challenges and
    risks. In the event that we do not successfully integrate these
    acquisitions into our existing operations so as to realize the
    expected return on our investment, our results of operations,
    cash flow or financial condition could be adversely affected.

Risks
    and uncertainties associated with our expansion into and our
    operations in Asia, Mexico, South America and other foreign
    markets could adversely affect our results of operations, cash
    flow, liquidity or financial condition.

Net external sales of our consolidated foreign subsidiaries
    totaled approximately $1.03 billion in 2009, or 14.5% of
    our total consolidated net sales. Sales outside of the United
    States make up an important part of our current business and
    future strategic plans. Our results of operations, cash flow,
    liquidity or financial condition could be adversely affected by
    a variety of international factors, including general economic
    conditions, inflation rates, recessions, foreign currency
    exchange rates, foreign currency exchange controls, interest
    rates, foreign investment and repatriation restrictions, legal
    and regulatory constraints, civil unrest, difficulties in
    staffing and managing foreign operations and other external
    economic and political factors. Our inability to successfully
    manage the risks and uncertainties relating to these factors
    could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flow,
    liquidity or financial condition.

In many foreign countries, it is acceptable to engage in certain
    business practices that we are prohibited from engaging in
    because of regulations that are applicable to us, such as the
    Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Although we have internal control
    policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these
    regulations, there can be no assurance that our policies and
    procedures will prevent a violation of these regulations. Any
    violation could cause an adverse effect on our results of
    operations, cash flow or financial condition.

Fluctuations
    in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely affect our
    results of operations, cash flow, liquidity or financial
    condition.

Because of our international operations, we are exposed to risk
    associated with interest rates and value changes in foreign
    currencies, which may adversely affect our business.
    Historically, our reported net sales, earnings, cash flow and
    financial condition have been subjected to fluctuations in
    foreign exchange rates. Our primary exchange rate exposure is
    with the euro, the British pound, the Argentine peso, the
    Brazilian real, the Chilean peso, the Canadian dollar and the
    Mexican peso against the U.S. dollar. While we actively
    manage the exposure of our foreign currency risk as part of our
    overall financial risk management policy, we believe we may
    experience losses from foreign currency exchange rate
    fluctuations, and such losses could adversely affect our sales,
    earnings, cash flow, liquidity or financial condition.

We are
    subject to a wide variety of complex domestic and foreign laws
    and regulations, for which compliance could adversely affect our
    results of operations, cash flow or financial
    condition.

We are subject to a wide variety of complex domestic and foreign
    laws and regulations, and legal compliance risks, including
    securities laws, tax laws, employment and pension-related laws,
    competition laws, U.S. and foreign export and trading laws,
    and laws governing improper business practices. We are affected
    by new laws and regulations, and changes to existing laws and
    regulations, including interpretations by courts and regulators.
    From time to time, our Company, our operations and the
    industries in which we operate are being reviewed or
    investigated by regulators, which could lead to enforcement
    actions or the assertion of private litigation claims and
    damages.



Although we believe that we have adopted appropriate risk
    management and compliance programs to mitigate these risks, the
    global and diverse nature of our operations means that
    compliance risks will continue to exist. Investigations,
    examinations and other proceedings, the nature and outcome of
    which cannot be predicted, will likely arise from time to time.
    These investigations, examinations and other proceedings could
    subject us to significant liability and require us to take
    significant accruals or pay significant settlements, fines and
    penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our
    results of operations, cash flow or financial condition.

We are subject to tax laws and regulations in the United States
    and multiple foreign jurisdictions. We are affected by changes
    in tax laws and regulations, as well as changes in related
    interpretations and other tax guidance. In the ordinary course
    of our business, we are subject to examinations and
    investigations by various tax authorities. In addition to
    existing examinations and investigations, there could be
    additional examinations and investigations in the future, and
    existing examinations and investigations could be expanded.

For non-income tax risks, we estimate material loss
    contingencies and accrue for such loss contingencies as required
    by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles based on
    our assessment of contingencies where liability is deemed
    probable and reasonably estimable in light of the facts and
    circumstances known to us at a particular point in time.
    Subsequent developments may affect our assessment and estimates
    of the loss contingency. In the event the loss contingency is
    ultimately determined to be significantly higher than currently
    accrued, the recording of the additional liability may result in
    a material adverse effect on our results of operations or
    financial condition for the annual or interim period during
    which such additional liability is accrued. In those cases where
    no accrual is recorded because it is not probable that a
    liability has been incurred and cannot be reasonably estimated,
    any potential liability ultimately determined to be attributable
    to us may result in a material adverse effect on our results of
    operations, cash flow or financial condition for the annual or
    interim period during which such liability is accrued or paid.
    For income tax risks, we recognize tax benefits based on our
    assessment that a tax benefit has a greater than 50% likelihood
    of being sustained upon ultimate settlement with the applicable
    taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant facts.
    For those income tax positions where we assess that there is not
    a greater than 50% likelihood that such tax benefits will be
    sustained, we do not recognize a tax benefit in our financial
    statements. Subsequent events may cause us to change our
    assessment of the likelihood of sustaining a
    previously-recognized benefit which could result in a material
    adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flow or
    financial position for the annual or interim period during which
    such liability is accrued or paid.

We are
    required to comply with numerous complex and increasingly
    stringent domestic and foreign health, safety and environmental
    laws and regulations, the cost of which is likely to increase
    and may adversely affect our results of operations, cash flow or
    financial condition.

Our operations are subject to various domestic and foreign
    health, safety and environmental laws and regulations. These
    laws and regulations not only govern our current operations and
    products, but also impose potential liability on us for our past
    operations. We expect health, safety and environmental laws and
    regulations to impose increasingly stringent requirements upon
    our industry and us in the future. Our costs to comply with
    these laws and regulations may increase as these requirements
    become more stringent in the future, and these increased costs
    may adversely affect our results of operations, cash flow or
    financial condition.

We are
    involved with environmental investigation and remediation
    activities at some of our currently and formerly owned sites, as
    well as a number of third-party sites, for which our ultimate
    liability may exceed the current amount we have
    accrued.

We are involved with environmental investigation and remediation
    activities at some of our currently and formerly owned sites and
    a number of third-party sites. We accrue for estimated costs of
    investigation and remediation activities at these sites for
    which commitments or

clean-up

plans have been developed and when such costs can be reasonably
    estimated based on industry standards and professional judgment.
    These estimated costs are based on currently available facts
    regarding each site. We continuously assess our potential
    liability for investigation and remediation activities and
    adjust our environmental-related accruals as information becomes
    available upon which more accurate costs can be reasonably
    estimated. Due to the uncertainties surrounding environmental
    investigation and remediation activities, our liability may
    result in costs that are significantly higher than currently
    accrued and may have an adverse affect on our earnings.



The
    nature, cost, quantity and outcome of pending and future
    litigation, such as litigation arising from the historical
    manufacture and sale of lead pigments and lead-based paint,
    could have a material adverse effect on our results of
    operations, cash flow, liquidity and financial
    condition.

In the course of our business, we are subject to a variety of
    claims and lawsuits, including litigation relating to product
    liability and warranty, personal injury, environmental,
    intellectual property, commercial, contractual and antitrust
    claims that are inherently subject to many uncertainties
    regarding the possibility of a loss to us. These uncertainties
    will ultimately be resolved when one or more future events occur
    or fail to occur confirming the incurrence of a liability or the
    reduction of a liability. In accordance with the Contingencies
    Topic of the ASC, we accrue for these contingencies by a charge
    to income when it is both probable that one or more future
    events will occur confirming the fact of a loss and the amount
    of the loss can be reasonably estimated. In the event that a
    loss contingency is ultimately determined to be significantly
    higher than currently accrued, the recording of the additional
    liability may result in a material impact on our results of
    operations, liquidity or financial condition for the annual or
    interim period during which such additional liability is
    accrued. In those cases where no accrual is recorded because it
    is not probable that a liability has been incurred and cannot be
    reasonably estimated, any potential liability ultimately
    determined to be attributable to us may result in a material
    impact on our results of operations, liquidity or financial
    condition for the annual or interim period during which such
    liability is accrued. In those cases where no accrual is
    recorded or exposure to loss exists in excess of the amount
    accrued, the Contingencies Topic of the ASC requires disclosure
    of the contingency when there is a reasonable possibility that a
    loss or additional loss may have been incurred even if the
    possibility may be remote.

Our past operations included the manufacture and sale of lead
    pigments and lead-based paints. Along with other companies, we
    are a defendant in a number of legal proceedings, including
    individual personal injury actions, purported class actions and
    actions brought by various counties, cities, school districts
    and other government-related entities, arising from the
    manufacture and sale of lead pigments and lead-based paints. The
    plaintiffs are seeking recovery based upon various legal
    theories, including negligence, strict liability, breach of
    warranty, negligent misrepresentations and omissions, fraudulent
    misrepresentations and omissions, concert of action, civil
    conspiracy, violations of unfair trade practice and consumer
    protection laws, enterprise liability, market share liability,
    public nuisance, unjust enrichment and other theories. The
    plaintiffs seek various damages and relief, including personal
    injury and property damage, costs relating to the detection and
    abatement of lead-based paint from buildings, costs associated
    with a public education campaign, medical monitoring costs and
    others. We are also a defendant in legal proceedings arising
    from the manufacture and sale of non-lead-based paints which
    seek recovery based upon various legal theories, including the
    failure to adequately warn of potential exposure to lead during
    surface preparation when using non-lead-based paint on surfaces
    previously painted with lead-based paint. We believe that the
    litigation brought to date is without merit or subject to
    meritorious defenses and are vigorously defending such
    litigation. We expect that additional lead pigment and
    lead-based paint litigation may be filed against us in the
    future asserting similar or different legal theories and seeking
    similar or different types of damages and relief.

Notwithstanding our views on the merits, litigation is
    inherently subject to many uncertainties, and we ultimately may
    not prevail. Adverse court rulings, such as the jury verdict
    against us and other defendants in the State of Rhode Island
    action and the Wisconsin State Supreme Court’s
    determination that Wisconsin’s risk contribution theory may
    apply in the lead pigment litigation, or determinations of
    liability, among other factors, could affect the lead pigment
    and lead-based paint litigation against us and encourage an
    increase in the number and nature of future claims and
    proceedings. In addition, from time to time, various legislation
    and administrative regulations have been enacted, promulgated or
    proposed to impose obligations on present and former
    manufacturers of lead pigments and lead-based paints respecting
    asserted health concerns associated with such products or to
    overturn the effect of court decisions in which we and other
    manufacturers have been successful.

Due to the uncertainties involved, management is unable to
    predict the outcome of the lead pigment and lead-based paint
    litigation, the number or nature of possible future claims and
    proceedings, or the effect that any legislation

and/or

administrative regulations may have on the litigation or against
    us. In addition, management cannot reasonably determine the
    scope or amount of the potential costs and liabilities related
    to such litigation, or any such legislation and regulations. We
    have not accrued any amounts for such litigation. Any potential
    liability that may result from such litigation or such
    legislation and regulations cannot reasonably be estimated. In
    the event any significant liability is determined to be
    attributable to us relating to such litigation, the recording of
    the liability



may result in a material impact on net income for the annual or
    interim period during which such liability is accrued.
    Additionally, due to the uncertainties associated with the
    amount of any such liability

and/or

the
    nature of any other remedy which may be imposed in such
    litigation, any potential liability determined to be
    attributable to us arising out of such litigation may have a
    material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flow,
    liquidity or financial condition. An estimate of the potential
    impact on our results of operations, cash flow, liquidity or
    financial condition cannot be made due to the aforementioned
    uncertainties.

We discuss the risks and uncertainties related to litigation,
    including the lead pigment and lead-based paint litigation, in
    more detail on page 18 of our 2009 Annual Report under the
    caption “Litigation and Other Contingent Liabilities,”
    and pages 26 through 29 of our 2009 Annual Report under the
    caption “Litigation” of “Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations” and in Note 10 of the Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements on pages 65 through 68 of
    our 2009 Annual Report.

The
    costs or potential liability ultimately determined to be
    attributable to us through our ownership of Life Shield could
    have an adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flow,
    liquidity or financial condition.

We own Life Shield Engineered Systems, LLC. Life Shield develops
    and manufactures blast and fragment mitigating systems and
    ballistic resistant systems. The blast and fragment mitigating
    systems and ballistic resistant systems create a potentially
    higher level of product liability for us than is normally
    associated with coatings and related products we manufacture,
    distribute and sell. Depending upon the extent of any potential
    liability ultimately determined to be attributable to us
    relating to Life Shield, such liability could have an adverse
    effect on our results of operations, cash flow, liquidity or
    financial condition. We discuss these risks and uncertainties in
    more detail on pages 25 and 26 of our 2009 Annual Report under
    the caption “Contingent Liabilities” of
    “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
    Condition and Results of Operations.”

The operations of the Paint Stores Group included a
    manufacturing and distribution facility in Jamaica and 3,354
    company-operated specialty paint stores, of which 215 were
    owned, in the United States, Canada, Puerto Rico, Virgin
    Islands, Trinidad and Tobago, St. Maarten and Jamaica at
    December 31, 2009. These paint stores are divided into four
    separate operating divisions that are responsible for the sale
    of predominantly architectural, industrial maintenance and
    related products through the paint stores located within their
    geographical region. At the end of 2009:

•

the Mid Western Division operated 888 paint stores
    primarily located in the midwestern and upper west coast states;

•

the Eastern Division operated 799 paint stores along the
    upper east coast and New England states and Canada;

•

the Southeastern Division operated a manufacturing and
    distribution facility in Jamaica and 868 paint stores
    principally covering the lower east and gulf coast states,
    Puerto Rico, Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, St. Maarten

    prior positions held by each during the last five years and the
    date when each was first elected or appointed as an executive

    OPERATIONS

    pages 13 through 35 of our 2009 Annual Report under the
    caption “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
    Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” which is

ITEM
    7A.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT
    MARKET RISK

We are exposed to market risk associated with interest rates,
    foreign currency and commodity fluctuations. We occasionally
    utilize derivative instruments as part of our overall financial
    risk management policy, but do not use derivative instruments
    for speculative or trading purposes. The Company entered into
    foreign currency option and forward currency exchange contracts
    and commodity swaps during 2009 to hedge against value changes
    in foreign currency and commodities. There were no contracts
    outstanding at December 31, 2009. Foreign currency option
    and forward contracts are described in Note 14 of the Notes
    to Consolidated Financial Statements on page 72 of our 2009
    Annual Report. Commodity swaps are described in Note 1 of
    the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements on page 45
    of our 2009 Annual Report. We believe we may experience
    continuing losses from foreign currency and commodity price
    fluctuations. However, we do not expect currency translation,
    transaction, commodity price fluctuations or hedging contract
    losses to have a material adverse effect on our financial
    condition, results of operations or cash flows.
