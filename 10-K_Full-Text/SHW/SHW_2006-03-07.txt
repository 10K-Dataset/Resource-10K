distribution and sale of paint, coatings and related products to
professional, industrial, commercial and retail customers
primarily in North and South America. Our principal executive
offices are located at 101 Prospect Avenue, N.W.,
Cleveland, Ohio 44115-1075, telephone (216) 566-2000. As

Basis of Reportable Segments

We report our segment information in five
reportable segments — Paint Stores, Consumer,
Automotive Finishes, International Coatings (collectively, the
“Operating Segments”) and Administrative —
in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
(FAS) No. 131, “Disclosures about Segments of an
Enterprise and Related Information.” FAS No. 131
requires an enterprise to report segment information in the same
way that management internally organizes its business for
assessing performance and making decisions regarding allocation
of resources. Factors considered in determining the five
reportable segments of the Company include the nature of the
business activities, existence of managers responsible for the
operating and administrative activities and information
presented to the Board of Directors.

The Company’s chief operating decision maker
(CODM) has been identified as the Chief Executive Officer
because he has final authority over performance assessment and
resource allocation decisions. Because of the global, diverse
operations of the Company, the CODM regularly receives discrete
financial information about each reportable segment as well as a
significant amount of additional financial information about
certain aggregated divisions, business units and subsidiaries of
the Company. The CODM uses all such financial information for
performance assessment and resource allocation decisions. The
CODM evaluates the performance of the Operating Segments and
allocates resources based on profit or loss and cash generated
from operations before income taxes, excluding corporate
expenses and financing gains and losses. The accounting policies
of the reportable segments are the same as those described in
Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements on
pages 46 through 51 of our 2005 Annual Report, which is
incorporated herein by reference.

Paint Stores Segment

The Paint Stores Segment consisted of 3,081
company-operated specialty paint stores in the United States,
Canada, Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico and Mexico at
December 31, 2005. Each division of the Segment is engaged
in the related business activity of selling the Company’s
own manufactured paint, coatings and related products to end-use
customers. During 2005, this Segment opened 98 net new stores,
consisting of 91 stores in the United



States, 5 in Canada and 2 in Puerto Rico. In
2004, there were 296 net new stores opened or acquired (294 in
the United States). In 2003, there were 45 net new stores opened
or acquired (41 in the United States). This Segment also
manufactures OEM product finishes that are sold through the
Segment’s network of paint stores and certain shared or
dedicated paint stores (73, 71 and 72 at December 31, 2005,
2004 and 2003, respectively, included above) and sold by direct
outside sales representatives.

The Paint Stores Segment markets and sells
Sherwin-Williams

®

branded architectural paint and coatings, industrial and marine
products, OEM product finishes and related items throughout
North America and the Caribbean. These products are produced by
this Segment’s manufacturing facilities and those in the
Consumer Segment. The loss of any single customer would not have
a material adverse effect on the business of this Segment.

Consumer Segment

The Consumer Segment develops, manufactures and
distributes a variety of paint, coatings and related products to
third party customers and the Paint Stores Segment. The
acquisition of KST Coatings Manufacturing, Inc., KST
Coatings LLC and Uniflex LLC (“KST”) in 2005 was
included in this Segment. Approximately 52 percent of the
total sales of the Consumer Segment in 2005, including
inter-segment transfers, represented products sold through the
Paint Stores Segment. Sales and marketing of certain controlled
brand and private labeled products is performed by a direct
sales staff. The products distributed through third party
customers are intended for resale to the ultimate end-user of
the product. The Consumer Segment had sales to certain customers
that, individually, may be a significant portion of the sales of
the Segment. However, the loss of any single customer would not
have a material adverse effect on the overall profitability of
the Segment. This Segment incurred most of the Company’s
capital expenditures related to ongoing environmental compliance
measures.

Automotive Finishes Segment

The Automotive Finishes Segment develops,
manufactures and distributes a variety of motor vehicle finish,
refinish and touch-up products primarily throughout North and
South America, the Caribbean Islands, and Europe. This Segment
also licenses certain technology and trade names worldwide.
Sherwin-Williams

®

branded automotive finish and refinish products are distributed
throughout North America solely through this Segment’s
network of 153 company-operated automotive branches in the
United States and 19 in Canada. Additional automotive branches
in Jamaica (15), Chile (14) and Peru (2) complete this
Segment’s worldwide network. At December 31, 2005,
this Segment included consolidated operations in 10 foreign
countries and realized income from licensing agreements in 9
foreign countries.

International Coatings Segment

The International Coatings Segment develops,
licenses, manufactures and distributes a variety of paint,
coatings and related products worldwide. The majority of the
sales from licensees and subsidiaries occurred in South America,
the Segment’s most important international market. This
Segment sold its products through 30 company-operated specialty
paint stores in Chile, 36 in Brazil, 6 in Uruguay and 1 in
Argentina and by outside selling functions to dealers and other
distributors. At December 31, 2005, this Segment included
consolidated operations in 7 foreign countries, 4 foreign joint
ventures and income from licensing agreements in 12 foreign
countries.

Administrative Segment

The Administrative Segment included the
administrative expenses of the Company’s corporate
headquarters site. This Segment also included interest expense
which was unrelated to retail real estate leasing activities,
investment income, certain foreign currency transaction losses
related to dollar-denominated debt and foreign currency option
and forward contracts, certain expenses related to closed
facilities and environmental-related matters, and other expenses
which were not directly associated with any Operating Segment.
Administrative expenses did not include any significant foreign
operations. Also included in the Administrative Segment was a
real estate management unit that is responsible for the
ownership, management and leasing of non-retail



properties held primarily for use by the Company,
including the Company’s headquarters site, and disposal of
idle facilities. Sales of the Administrative Segment represented
external leasing revenue of excess headquarters space or leasing
of facilities no longer used by the Company in its operations.
Gains and losses from the sale of property were not a
significant operating factor in determining the performance of
this Segment.

Segment Financial Information

For financial information regarding our
reportable segments, including net external sales, operating
profit, identifiable assets and other information by segment,
see Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements on pages 69 through 71 of our 2005 Annual
Report, which is incorporated herein by reference.

Domestic and Foreign Operations

Financial and other information regarding
domestic and foreign operations is set forth in Note 17 of
the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements on page 70
of our 2005 Annual Report, which is incorporated herein by
reference.

Additional information regarding risks attendant
to foreign operations is set forth on page 32 of our 2005
Annual Report under the caption entitled “Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operation,” which is incorporated herein by reference.

Business Developments

For additional information regarding our business
and business developments, see pages 6 through 15 of our
2005 Annual Report and the “Letter to Shareholders” on
pages 2 through 5 of our 2005 Annual Report, which is
incorporated herein by reference.

Raw Materials and Products Purchased for
Resale

Raw materials and fuel supplies are generally
available from various sources in sufficient quantities that
none of the Operating Segments anticipate any significant
sourcing problems during 2006. There are sufficient suppliers of
each product purchased for resale that none of the Operating
Segments anticipate any significant sourcing problems during
2006.

Seasonality

The majority of the sales for the Paint Stores,
Consumer and Automotive Finishes Segments traditionally occur
during the second and third quarters. The International Coatings
Segment’s fourth quarter sales have traditionally been
greater than the sales for any of the first three quarters.
There is no significant seasonality in sales for the
Administrative Segment.

Working Capital

In order to meet increased demand during the
second and third quarters, the Company usually builds its
inventories during the first quarter. Working capital items
(inventory and receivables) are generally financed through
short-term borrowings, which include the use of lines of credit
and the issuance of commercial paper. For a description of the
Company’s liquidity and capital resources, see
pages 24 through 32 of our 2005 Annual Report under the
caption entitled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” which is
incorporated herein by reference.

Patents

Although patents and licenses are not of material
importance to our business as a whole or any segment, the
International Coatings Segment and the international operations
of the Automotive Finishes Segment derive a portion of their
income from the licensing of technology, trademarks and trade
names to foreign companies.

Backlog and Productive Capacity

Backlog orders are not significant in the
business of any Operating Segment since there is normally a
short period of time between the placing of an order and
shipment. Sufficient productive capacity currently exists to
fulfill our needs for paint, coatings and related products
through 2006.

Research and Development

For information regarding our costs of research
and development included in technical expenditures, see
Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements on
page 48 of our 2005 Annual Report, which is incorporated
herein by reference.

Competition

We experience competition from many local,
regional, national and international competitors of various
sizes in the manufacture, distribution and sale of our paint,
coatings and related products. We are a leading manufacturer and
retailer of paint, coatings and related products to
professional, industrial, commercial and retail customers,
however, our competitive position varies for our different
products and markets.

In the Paint Stores Segment, competitors include
other paint and wallpaper stores, mass merchandisers, home
centers, independent hardware stores, hardware chains and
manufacturer-operated direct outlets. Product quality, service
and price determine the competitive advantage for this Segment.

In the Consumer and International Coatings
Segments, domestic and foreign competitors include manufacturers
and distributors of branded and private labeled paint and
coatings products. Technology, product quality, product
innovation, breadth of product line, technical expertise,
distribution, service and price are the key competitive factors
for these Segments.

The Automotive Finishes Segment has numerous
competitors in its domestic and foreign markets with broad
product offerings and several others with niche products. Key
competitive factors for this Segment include technology, product
quality, distribution, service and price.

The Administrative Segment has many competitors
consisting of other real estate owners, developers and managers
in areas in which this Segment owns property. The main
competitive factors are the availability of property and price.

Employees

We employed 29,434 persons at December 31,
2005.



Environmental Compliance

For additional information regarding
environmental-related matters, see pages 26 through 28 of
our 2005 Annual Report under the caption entitled
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations” and Notes 1, 8
and 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements on
pages 48, 61 and 62, and 66, respectively, of our 2005
Annual Report, which is incorporated herein by reference.

CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING
INFORMATION

Certain statements contained in
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations,” “Business”
and elsewhere in this report constitute “forward-looking
statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the
Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934. These forward-looking statements are based
upon management’s current expectations, estimates,
assumptions and beliefs concerning future events and conditions
and may discuss, among other things, anticipated future
performance (including sales and earnings), expected growth,
future business plans and the costs and potential liability for
environmental-related matters and the lead pigment and
lead-based paint litigation. Any statement that is not
historical in nature is a forward-looking statement and may be
identified by the use of words and phrases such as
“expects,” “anticipates,”
“believes,” “will,” “will likely
result,” “will continue,” “plans to”
and similar expressions.

Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance
on any forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements
are necessarily subject to risks, uncertainties and other
factors, many of which are outside our control, that could cause
actual results to differ materially from such statements and
from our historical results and experience. These risks,
uncertainties and other factors include such things as:



•

the nature, cost, quantity and outcome of pending
    and future litigation and other claims, including the lead
    pigment and lead-based paint litigation, and the effect of any
    legislation and administrative regulations relating thereto; and

•

unusual weather conditions.

Readers are cautioned that it is not possible to
predict or identify all of the risks, uncertainties and other
factors that may affect future results and that the above list
should not be considered to be a complete list. Any
forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which
such statement is made, and we undertake no obligation to update
or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of
new information, future events or otherwise.

ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS

Described below and elsewhere in this report and
other documents that we file from time to time with the
Securities and Exchange Commission are risks, uncertainties and
other factors that can adversely affect our business, results of
operation and financial condition. The following are some of the
more important of these risks, uncertainties and other factors.
Additional risks, uncertainties and other factors that are
currently not known to us or we believe are not currently
material may also adversely affect our business, results of
operation and financial condition.

Adverse changes in general business
conditions in the United States and worldwide may adversely
affect our results of operations and financial
condition.

Adverse changes in general business conditions in
the United States and worldwide may reduce the demand for some
of our products and adversely affect our results of operations
and financial condition. Higher inflation rates, interest rates,
tax rates and unemployment rates, higher labor and healthcare
costs, recessions, changing governmental policies, laws and
regulations, and other economic factors that adversely affect
the demand for our paint, coatings and related products could
adversely affect our results of operations and financial
condition.

Economic downturns in cyclical segments of
the economy may reduce the demand for some of our products and
adversely affect our sales and earnings.

Portions of our business involve the sale of
paint, coatings and related products to segments of the economy
that are cyclical in nature, particularly segments relating to
construction, housing and manufacturing. Our sales to these
segments are affected by the levels of discretionary consumer
and business spending in these segments. During economic
downturns in these segments, the levels of consumer and business
discretionary spending may decrease. This decrease in spending
will likely reduce the demand for some of our products and
adversely affect our sales and earnings.

Increases in the cost of raw materials and
energy may adversely affect our earnings.

We purchase raw materials and energy for use in
the manufacturing, distribution and sale of our products.
Factors such as adverse weather conditions, including
hurricanes, and other disasters can disrupt raw material and
fuel supplies and increase our costs. Although raw materials and
energy supplies are generally available from various sources in
sufficient quantities, unexpected shortages and increases in the
cost of raw materials and energy may have an adverse effect on
our earnings in the event we are unable to offset these costs by
sufficiently decreasing our operating costs or raising the
prices of our products. Many of our paint and coatings products
utilize titanium dioxide, which is widely used as a white
pigment for paint. During 2005, we experienced significant cost
increases in energy and raw materials, particularly titanium
dioxide and petroleum-based materials, which adversely impacted
our earnings.



Although we have an extensive customer
base, the loss of any of our largest customers could adversely
affect our sales and earnings.

We have a large and varied customer base due to
our extensive distribution network. During 2005, no individual
customer accounted for sales totaling more than ten percent of
our sales. However, we have some customers that, individually,
purchase a large amount of products from us. Although our broad
distribution channels would help to minimize the impact of the
loss of any one customer, the loss of any of these large
customers could have an adverse effect on our sales and earnings.

Adverse weather conditions may reduce the
demand for some of our products and could have a negative effect
on our sales.

From time to time, adverse weather conditions in
certain parts of the United States have had an adverse effect on
our sales of paint, coatings and related products. For example,
unusually cold and rainy weather, especially during the exterior
painting season, could have an adverse effect on sales of our
exterior paint products.

Increased competition may reduce our sales
and earnings performance.

We face substantial competition from many
international, national, regional and local competitors of
various sizes in the manufacture, distribution and sale of our
paint, coatings and related products. Some of our competitors
are larger than us and have greater financial resources to
compete. Other competitors are smaller and may be able to offer
more specialized products. Technology, product quality, product
innovation, breadth of product line, technical expertise,
distribution, service and price are the key competitive factors
for our business. Competition in any of these areas may reduce
our sales and adversely affect our earnings by resulting in
decreased sales volumes, reduced prices and increased costs of
manufacturing, distributing and selling our products.

Our operating results and financial
condition may be negatively impacted if we do not successfully
integrate past and future acquisitions into our existing
operations and if the performance of the businesses we acquire
do not meet our expectations.

We have historically made strategic acquisitions
of businesses in the paint and coatings industry and will likely
acquire additional businesses in the future as part of our long
term growth strategy. These acquisitions involve significant
challenges and risks. In the event that we do not successfully
integrate these acquisitions into our existing operations so as
to realize the expected return on our investment, our operating
results and financial condition could be adversely affected.

Risks and uncertainties associated with our
expansion into and our operations in China, South America and
other foreign markets could adversely affect our sales and
earnings.

Net external sales of our consolidated foreign
subsidiaries totaled approximately $747 million in 2005, or
10.4% of our total consolidated net sales. Sales outside of the
United States make up an important part of our current business
and future strategic plans. Our sales and earnings could be
adversely affected by a variety of international factors,
including general economic conditions, inflation rates,
recessions, foreign currency exchange rates, foreign investment
and repatriation restrictions, legal and regulatory constraints,
civil unrest, difficulties in staffing and managing foreign
operations and other external economic and political factors.
Our inability to successfully manage the risks and uncertainties
relating to these factors could adversely affect our sales and
earnings.

In many foreign countries, it is acceptable to
engage in certain business practices that we are prohibited from
engaging in because of regulations that are applicable to us,
such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Although we have
internal control policies and procedures designed to ensure
compliance with these regulations, there can be no assurance
that our policies and procedures will prevent a violation of
these regulations. Any violation could cause an adverse effect
on our results of operations.



Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange
rates could adversely affect our sales and
earnings.

Because of our international operations, we are
exposed to market risk associated with interest rates and value
changes in foreign currencies, which may adversely affect our
business. Historically, our reported net sales and net earnings
have been subjected to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.
Our primary exchange rate exposure is with the British pound,
the Argentine peso, the Brazilian real, the Chilean peso, the
Canadian dollar and the Mexican peso against the U.S. dollar.
While we actively manage the exposure of our foreign currency
market risk as part of our overall financial risk management
policy, we believe we may experience continuing losses from
foreign currency translation, and such losses could adversely
affect our sales and earnings.

We are required to comply with increasingly
stringent federal, state and local environmental laws and
regulations, the cost of which is likely to increase and may
adversely affect our earnings.

Our operations are subject to various federal,
state and local environmental laws and regulations. These laws
and regulations not only govern our current operations and
products, but also impose potential liability on us for our past
operations. We expect environmental laws and regulations to
impose increasingly stringent requirements upon our industry and
us in the future. Our costs to comply with these laws and
regulations may increase as these requirements become more
stringent in the future, and these increased costs may adversely
affect our earnings.

We are involved with environmental
investigation and remediation activities at some of our current
and former sites, as well as a number of third-party sites, for
which our ultimate liability may exceed the current amount we
have accrued.

We are involved with environmental investigation
and remediation activities at some of our current and former
sites and a number of third-party sites. We accrue for estimated
costs of investigation and remediation activities at these sites
for which commitments or clean-up plans have been developed and
when such costs can be reasonably estimated based on industry
standards and professional judgment. These estimated costs are
based on currently available facts regarding each site. We
continuously assess our potential liability for investigation
and remediation activities and adjust our environmental-related
accruals as information becomes available upon which more
accurate costs can be reasonably estimated. Due to the
uncertainties surrounding environmental investigation and
remediation activities, our liability may result in costs that
are significantly higher than currently accrued and may have an
adverse affect on our earnings.

The nature, cost, quantity and outcome of
pending and future litigation, such as litigation arising from
the manufacture and sale of lead pigments and lead-based paint,
could have a material adverse effect on our results of
operations, liquidity and financial condition.

In the course of our business, we are subject to
a variety of claims and lawsuits, including litigation relating
to product liability and warranty, personal injury,
environmental, intellectual property, commercial, contractual
and antitrust claims. We accrue for these contingencies
consistent with the policy stated on page 30 of our 2005
Annual Report under the caption entitled “Contingent
Liabilities” of “Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”
However, because litigation is inherently subject to many
uncertainties and the ultimate result of any present or future
litigation is unpredictable, our ultimate liability may result
in costs that are significantly higher than currently accrued.
In the event that our loss contingency is ultimately determined
to be significantly higher than currently accrued, the recording
of the liability may result in a material impact on net income
for the annual or interim period during which such liability is
accrued. Additionally, due to the uncertainties involved, any
potential liability determined to be attributable to us arising
out of such litigation may have a material adverse effect on our
results of operations, liquidity or financial condition.

Our past operations included the manufacture and
sale of lead pigments and lead-based paints. Along with other
companies, we are a defendant in a number of legal proceedings,
including purported class actions, separate actions brought by
the State of Rhode Island, and actions brought by various
counties, cities, school districts and other government-related
entities, arising from the manufacture and sale of lead pigments
and lead-based paints. We are also a defendant in legal
proceedings arising from the manufacture and sale of
non-lead-based paints,



which seek recovery based upon various legal
theories, including the failure to adequately warn of potential
exposure to lead during surface preparation when using
non-lead-based paint on surfaces previously painted with
lead-based paint. We expect that additional lead pigment and
lead-based paint litigation may be filed against us in the
future asserting similar or different legal theories and seeking
similar or different types of damages and relief.

During September 2002, a jury trial commenced in
the first phase of the action brought by the State of Rhode
Island against us and the other defendants. The sole issue
before the court in this first phase was whether lead pigment in
paint constitutes a public nuisance under Rhode Island law. In
October 2002, the court declared a mistrial as the jury, which
was split four to two in favor of the defendants, was unable to
reach a unanimous decision.

The State of Rhode Island retried the case and on
February 22, 2006, the jury returned a verdict, finding
that (1) the cumulative presence of lead pigment in paints
and coatings on buildings in the State of Rhode Island
constitutes a public nuisance, (ii) we, along with two
other defendants, caused or substantially contributed to the
creation of the public nuisance, and (iii) we and two other
defendants should be ordered to abate the public nuisance. The
Court will determine the scope of the abatement remedy. Various
other matters remain before the Court. We intend to appeal the
jury’s verdict.

This was the first legal proceeding against us to
go to trial relating to the lead pigment and lead-based paint
litigation. We believe it is possible that additional legal
proceedings could be scheduled for trial in 2006 and in
subsequent years in other jurisdictions.

Litigation is inherently subject to many
uncertainties. Adverse court rulings, such as the Rhode Island
jury verdict and the Wisconsin State Supreme Court’s
determination in July 2005 that Wisconsin’s risk
contribution theory applies to the lead pigment litigation, or
determinations of liability, among other factors, could affect
the lead pigment and lead-based paint litigation against us and
encourage an increase in the number and nature of future claims
and proceedings. In addition, from time to time, various
legislation and administrative regulations have been enacted or
proposed to impose obligations on present and former
manufacturers of lead pigments and lead-based paints respecting
asserted health concerns associated with such products and to
overturn court decisions in which we and other manufacturers
have been successful. We cannot reasonably determine the impact
that the State of Rhode Island decision and determination of
liability will have on the number or nature of present or future
claims and proceedings against us.

Due to the uncertainties involved, management is
unable to predict the outcome of the lead pigment and lead-based
paint litigation, the number or nature of possible future claims
and proceedings, or the effect that any legislation and/or
administrative regulations may have on the litigation or against
us. In addition, management cannot reasonably determine the
scope or amount of the potential costs and liabilities related
to such litigation, or any such legislation and regulations. We
have not accrued any amounts for such litigation. Any potential
liability that may result from such litigation or such
legislation and regulations cannot reasonably be estimated. In
the event any significant liability is determined to be
attributable to us relating to such litigation, the recording of
the liability may result in a material impact on net income for
the annual or interim period during which such liability is
accrued. Additionally, due to the uncertainties associated with
the amount of any such liability and/or the nature of any other
remedy which may be imposed in such litigation, any potential
liability determined to be attributable to us arising out of
such litigation may have a material adverse effect on our
results of operations, liquidity or financial condition. An
estimate of the potential impact on our results of operations,
liquidity or financial condition cannot be made due to the
aforementioned uncertainties.

We discuss this litigation in more detail on
pages 31 and 32 of our 2005 Annual Report under the caption
entitled “Litigation” of “Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations” and in Note 18 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements on page 72 of our 2005
Annual Report.



The costs or potential liability ultimately
determined to be attributable to us through our ownership of
Life Shield could have an adverse effect on our results of
operations, liquidity or financial condition.

We own a 25% interest in Life Shield Engineered
Systems, LLC and are obligated to acquire an additional 24%
interest in Life Shield in October 2007. Life Shield is a
start-up company that develops and manufactures blast and
fragment mitigating systems and ballistic resistant systems. The
blast and fragment mitigating systems and ballistic resistant
systems create a potentially higher level of product liability
for us than is normally associated with coatings and related
products we manufacture, distribute and sell. Depending upon the
extent of any potential liability ultimately determined to be
attributable to us relating to Life Shield, such liability could
have an adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity
and financial condition. We discuss the risks and uncertainties
relating to our ownership of Life Shield in more detail on
page 30 of our 2005 Annual Report under the caption
entitled “Contingent Liabilities” of
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations.”

ITEM 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

On January 27, 2006, the Company received
correspondence from the United States Attorney’s Office in
Los Angeles, California informing the Company that it is a
target of a grand jury investigation into potential violations
of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act
(“RCRA”). The investigation involves the
transportation of hazardous materials and hazardous waste from
the Company’s Garland, Texas manufacturing facility. The
United States Attorney alleges that the Company shipped drums
from its Garland, Texas facility that contained trace amounts of
residue without complying with the manifest requirements for
hazardous materials and hazardous waste under RCRA. The Company
has also received a grand jury subpoena from the United States
Attorney seeking documents and information relating to the
Company’s use, handling and transportation of hazardous
materials or hazardous waste at the Company’s Garland,
Texas manufacturing facility. The Company believes the
allegations are without merit and cannot predict the outcome of
this matter.

For information regarding environmental-related
matters and other legal proceedings, see pages 26 through
28, and 31 and 32, of our 2005 Annual Report under the caption
entitled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and

MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY,
    RELATED STOCKHOLDER

MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES

Our common stock is listed on the New York Stock
Exchange and traded under the symbol SHW. The number of
shareholders of record at February 28, 2006 was 10,975.

The following table sets forth a summary of the
Company’s repurchase of common stock during the fourth

All shares were purchased through the
    Company’s publicly announced share repurchase programs. On
    October 21, 2005, the Board of Directors of the Company
    authorized the Company to purchase, in the aggregate,
    20.0 million shares of its common stock and rescinded the
    previous authorization limit. The Company had remaining
    authorization at December 31, 2005 to purchase 18,421,070
    shares. There is no expiration date specified for the program.

ITEM 6.  SELECTED FINANCIAL
DATA

(millions of dollars, except per common share
data)

(a)

For purposes of calculating the ratio of earnings
    to fixed charges, earnings represent income before income taxes,
    minority interest and cumulative effect of change in accounting
    principle plus fixed charges. Fixed charges consist of interest
    expense, net, including amortization of discount and financing
    costs and the portion of operating rental expense which
    management believes is representative of the interest component
    of rent expense.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
    FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The information required by this item is set
forth on pages 20 through 36 of our 2005 Annual Report
under the caption entitled “Management’s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations,” which is incorporated herein by reference.

ITEM 7A.  QUANTITATIVE AND
QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

We are exposed to market risk associated with
interest rates and foreign currency exposure. We occasionally
utilize derivative instruments as part of our overall financial
risk management policy, but do not use derivative instruments
for speculative or trading purposes. The Company has partially
hedged risks associated with fixed interest rate debt by
entering into various interest rate swap agreements. These
interest rate swap contracts are described in detail in
Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements on
pages 60 and 61 of our 2005 Annual Report. We do not
believe that any potential loss related to interest rate
exposure will have a material adverse effect on our financial
condition, results of operations or cash flows. We also entered
into foreign currency option and forward contracts to hedge
against value changes in foreign currency. Foreign currency
option and forward contracts are described in detail in
Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
on page 66 of our 2005 Annual Report. We believe we may
experience continuing losses from foreign currency translation.
However, we do not expect currency translation, transaction or
hedging contract losses to have a material adverse effect on our
financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
