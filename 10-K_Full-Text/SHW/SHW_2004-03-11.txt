Basis of Reportable Segments

We report our segment information in five
reportable segments — Paint Stores, Consumer,
Automotive Finishes, International Coatings (collectively, the
“Operating Segments”) and Administrative —
in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
(SFAS) No. 131, “Disclosures about Segments of an
Enterprise and Related Information.” SFAS No. 131
requires an enterprise to report segment information in the same
way that management internally organizes its business for
assessing performance and making decisions regarding allocation
of resources.

Our chief operating decision maker has been
identified as our Chief Executive Officer because he has final
authority over performance assessment and resource allocation
decisions. Because of our global, diverse operations, our chief
operating decision maker regularly receives discrete financial
information about each reportable segment as well as a
significant amount of additional financial information about
certain aggregated divisions, business units and subsidiaries.
Our chief operating decision maker uses all such financial
information for performance assessment and resource allocation
decisions. Factors considered in determining our five reportable
segments include the nature of the business activities,
existence of managers responsible for the operating and
administrative activities and information presented to the Board
of Directors. Our chief operating decision maker evaluates the
performance of our Operating Segments and allocates resources
based on profit or loss and cash generated from operations
before income taxes, excluding corporate expenses and financing
gains and losses. The accounting policies of our reportable
segments are the same as those described in Note 1 of the Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements on pages 44 through 47 of
our 2003 Annual Report, which is incorporated herein by
reference.

Paint Stores Segment

The Paint Stores Segment consists of 2,688
company-operated specialty paint stores in the United States,
Canada, Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico and Mexico. Each division
and business unit of the Segment is engaged in the related
business activity of selling our own manufactured paints,
coatings and related products to end-use customers. During 2003,
this Segment opened 45 net new stores, remodeled 14
and relocated 29. The net new



stores consisted of 41 stores in the United
States, 3 in Canada and 1 in Mexico. In 2002, there
were 70 net new stores opened or acquired (62 in the
United States). In 2001, 85 net new stores were opened or
acquired (83 in the United States). This Segment also
manufactures original equipment manufacturer (OEM) product
finishes sold through certain shared or dedicated paint stores
and by direct outside sales representatives. In addition to
stores, operations in Mexico include outside selling functions
to dealers and other distributors.

The Paint Stores Segment is the exclusive North
American marketer and seller of Sherwin-Williams® branded
architectural paints and coatings, industrial and marine
products, OEM product finishes and related items produced by its
product finishes manufacturing facilities and by the Consumer
Segment, including the Consumer Segment’s Mexico
manufacturing facility. The loss of any single customer would
not have a material adverse effect on the business of this
Segment.

Consumer Segment

The Consumer Segment develops, manufactures and
distributes a variety of paints, coatings and related products
to third party customers and the Paint Stores Segment.
Approximately 46 percent of the total sales of the Consumer
Segment in 2003, including inter-segment transfers, represented
products sold through the Paint Stores Segment. Sales and
marketing of certain control-branded and private labeled
products is performed by a direct sales staff. The products
distributed through third party customers are intended for
resale to the ultimate end-user of the product. The Consumer
Segment has sales to certain customers that, individually, may
be a significant portion of the sales of the Segment. However,
the loss of any single customer would not have a material
adverse effect on the overall profitability of the Segment. This
Segment incurs most of the Company’s capital expenditures
related to ongoing environmental compliance measures.

Automotive Finishes Segment

The Automotive Finishes Segment develops,
manufactures and distributes a variety of motor vehicle finish,
refinish and touch-up products primarily throughout North and
South America, the Caribbean Islands and Europe. This Segment
also licenses certain technology and trade names worldwide.
Sherwin-Williams® branded automotive finish and refinish
products are distributed throughout North America primarily
through this Segment’s network of 142 company-operated
automotive branches in the United States and 16 in Canada.
Additional automotive branches in Jamaica (15), Chile (20) and
Peru (1) complete this Segment’s worldwide network. At
December 31, 2003, this Segment included consolidated
operations in 9 foreign countries and realized income from
licensing agreements in 14 foreign countries.

International Coatings Segment

The International Coatings Segment develops,
licenses, manufactures and distributes a variety of paints,
coatings and related products worldwide. The majority of the
sales from licensees and subsidiaries occur in South America,
the Segment’s most important international market. This
Segment sells its products through 28 company-operated
specialty paint stores in Chile, 27 in Brazil, 5 in
Uruguay and 1 in Argentina and by outside selling functions
to dealers and other distributors. At December 31, 2003,
this Segment included consolidated operations in 7 foreign
countries, 4 foreign joint ventures and income from
licensing agreements in 15 foreign countries.

Administrative Segment

The Administrative Segment includes the
administrative expenses of our corporate headquarters site. This
Segment includes interest expense which is unrelated to retail
real estate leasing activities, investment income, certain
foreign currency transaction losses related to
dollar-denominated debt and foreign currency option and forward
contracts, certain expenses related to closed facilities and
environmental-related matters, and other expenses which are not
directly associated with any Operating Segment. Administrative
expenses do not include any significant foreign operations. Also
included in the Administrative Segment is a real estate
management unit that is responsible for the ownership,
management and leasing of non-retail properties held primarily
for our use, including our headquarters site, and disposal of
idle facilities. Sales of the Administrative Segment represent
external leasing revenue of excess headquarters space or leasing
of facilities no longer used by us in our



operations. Gains and losses from the sale of
property are not a significant operating factor in determining
the performance of this Segment.

Segment Financial Information

For financial information regarding our
reportable segments, including net external sales, operating
profit, identifiable assets and other information by segment,
see Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements on pages 64 through 66 of our 2003 Annual
Report, which is incorporated herein by reference.

Domestic and Foreign Operations

Financial and other information regarding
domestic and foreign operations is set forth in Note 17 of the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements on page 65 of
our 2003 Annual Report, which is incorporated herein by
reference.

Additional information regarding risks attendant
to foreign operations is set forth on page 31 of our 2003
Annual Report under the caption entitled “Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operation,” which is incorporated herein by reference.

Business Developments

For additional information regarding our business
and business developments, see pages 4, 5 and
10 through 19 of our 2003 Annual Report and the
“Letter to Shareholders” on pages 6
through 9 of our 2003 Annual Report, which is incorporated
herein by reference.

Raw Materials and Products Purchased for
Resale

Raw materials and fuel supplies are generally
available from various sources in sufficient quantities that
none of the Operating Segments anticipate any significant
sourcing problems during 2004. There are sufficient suppliers of
each product purchased for resale that none of the Operating
Segments anticipate any significant sourcing problems during
2004.

Seasonality

The majority of the sales for the Paint Stores,
Consumer and Automotive Finishes Segments traditionally occur
during the second and third quarters. The International Coatings
Segment’s fourth quarter sales have traditionally been
greater than the sales for any of the first three quarters.
There is no significant seasonality in sales for the
Administrative Segment.

Trademarks and Trade Names

Customer recognition of our trademarks and trade
names collectively contribute significantly to our sales. The
major trademarks and tradenames used by each Operating Segment
are set forth below.



Patents

Although patents and licenses are not of material
importance to our business as a whole or any segment, the
International Coatings Segment and the international operations
of the Automotive Finishes Segment derive a portion of their
income from the licensing of technology, trademarks and trade
names to foreign companies.

Backlog and Productive Capacity

Backlog orders are not significant in the
business of any Operating Segment since there is normally a
short period of time between the placing of an order and
shipment. Sufficient productive capacity currently exists to
fulfill our needs for paint and coatings products through 2004.

Research and Development

For information regarding our costs of research
and development included in technical expenditures, see
Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements on
page 45 of our 2003 Annual Report, which is incorporated
herein by reference.

Competition

We experience competition from many local,
regional, national and international competitors of various
sizes in the manufacture, distribution and sale of our paints,
coatings and related products. We are a leading manufacturer and
retailer of paints, coatings and related products to
professional, industrial, commercial and retail customers,
however, our competitive position varies for our different
products and markets.

In the Paint Stores Segment, competitors include
other paint and wallpaper stores, mass merchandisers, home
centers, independent hardware stores, hardware chains and
manufacturer-operated direct outlets. Product quality, service
and price determine the competitive advantage for this Segment.

In the Consumer and International Coatings
Segments, domestic and foreign competitors include manufacturers
and distributors of branded and private labeled paints and
coatings products. Technology, product quality, product
innovation, breadth of product line, technical expertise,
distribution, service and price are the key competitive factors
for these Segments.

The Automotive Finishes Segment has numerous
competitors in its domestic and foreign markets with broad
product offerings and several others with niche products. Key
competitive factors for this Segment include technology, product
quality, distribution, service and price.

The Administrative Segment has many competitors
consisting of other real estate owners, developers and managers
in areas in which this Segment owns property. The main
competitive factors are the availability of property and price.

Employees

We employed 25,777 persons at December 31,
2003.

environmental-related matters, see pages 30 and 31 of

ITEM 7A.  QUANTITATIVE AND
QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK

We are exposed to market risk associated with
interest rates and foreign currency exposure. We utilize
derivative instruments as part of our overall financial risk
management policy, but do not use derivative instruments for
speculative or trading purposes. The Company has partially
hedged risks associated with fixed interest rate debt by
entering into various interest rate swap agreements. These
interest rate swap contracts are described in detail in
Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements on
pages 55 and 56 of our 2003 Annual Report. We do not
believe that any potential loss related to interest rate
exposure will have a material adverse effect on our financial
condition, results of operations or cash flows. We also entered
into foreign currency option and forward contracts to hedge
against value changes in foreign currency. Foreign currency
option and forward contracts are described in detail in
Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
on pages 60 and 61 of our 2003 Annual Report. We believe we may
experience continuing losses from foreign currency translation.

financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

Shareholders and Board of Directors

The Sherwin-Williams Company

Cleveland, Ohio

We have audited the consolidated balance sheets
of The Sherwin-Williams Company and subsidiaries as of
December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, and the related
statements of consolidated income, cash flows, and
shareholders’ equity and comprehensive income for each of
the three years in the period ended December 31, 2003
incorporated by reference from the Company’s Annual Report.
Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed
in the Index at Item 15(a). These financial statements and
schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements and schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with
auditing standards generally accepted in the United States.
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial
statements referred to above present fairly, in all material
respects, the consolidated financial position of The
Sherwin-Williams Company and subsidiaries at December 31,
2003, 2002 and 2001, and the consolidated results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December 31, 2003, in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule,
when considered in relation to the basic financial statements
taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the
information set forth therein.

As disclosed in Note 2 to the consolidated
financial statements, in 2002 the Company changed its method of
accounting for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets.
