Basis of Reportable Segments

We report our segment information in the same way
that management internally organizes its business for assessing
performance and making decisions regarding allocation of
resources in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards (FAS) No. 131, “Disclosures about
Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information.”
Effective January 1, 2006, we changed our reportable
operating segments based on organizational changes in our
management structure. Our reportable operating segments now are:
Paint Stores Group, Consumer Group and Global Group
(collectively, the “Reportable Operating Segments”).
The Global Group consists of certain business units with foreign
or worldwide operations that were reported in the previous Paint
Stores, Consumer, Automotive Finishes and International Coatings
segments. Amounts previously reported have been reclassified to
conform with the 2006 presentation. Factors considered in
determining our three Reportable Operating Segments include the
nature of the business activities, existence of managers
responsible for the operating activities and information
presented to the Board of Directors. We report all other
business activities and immaterial operating segments that are
not reportable in the Administrative segment.

The Company’s chief operating decision maker
(CODM) has been identified as the Chief Executive Officer
because he has final authority over performance assessment and
resource allocation decisions. Because of the diverse operations
of the Company, the CODM regularly receives discrete financial
information about each reportable operating segment as well as a
significant amount of additional financial information about
certain divisions, business units or subsidiaries of the
Company. The CODM uses all such financial information for
performance assessment and resource allocation decisions. The
CODM evaluates the performance of and allocates resources to the
Reportable Operating Segments based on profit or loss and cash
generated from operations before income taxes. The accounting
policies of the Reportable Operating Segments are the same as
those described in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements on pages 47 through 51 of our 2006
Annual Report, which is incorporated herein by reference.



Paint Stores Group

The Paint Stores Group consisted of 3,046
company-operated specialty paint stores in the United States,
Canada, Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico at December 31,
2006. Each store in this segment is engaged in the related
business activity of selling paint, coatings and related
products to end-use customers. The Paint Stores Group markets
and sells
Sherwin-Williams

®

branded architectural paint and coatings, industrial and marine
products, OEM product finishes and related items. These products
are produced by manufacturing facilities in the Consumer and
Global Groups. In addition, each store sells selected purchased
associated products. During 2006, this segment opened 117 net
new stores, consisting of 113 stores in the United States and 4
in Canada. In 2005, there were 95 net new stores opened (88 in
the United States). In 2004, there were 297 net new stores
opened or acquired (294 in the United States). The loss of any
single customer would not have a material adverse effect on the
business of this segment.

Consumer Group

The Consumer Group develops, manufactures and
distributes a variety of paint, coatings and related products to
third party customers and the Paint Stores Group primarily in
the United States and Canada. The acquisition of Susannah Dobbs
Company LLC in 2006 was included in this segment. Approximately
55 percent of the total sales of the Consumer Group in
2006, including inter-segment transfers, represented products
sold through the Paint Stores Group. Sales and marketing of
certain controlled brand and private labeled products is
performed by a direct sales staff. The products distributed
through third party customers are intended for resale to the
ultimate end-user of the product. The Consumer Group had sales
to certain customers that, individually, may be a significant
portion of the sales of the segment. However, the loss of any
single customer would not have a material adverse effect on the
overall profitability of the segment. This segment incurred most
of the Company’s capital expenditures related to ongoing
environmental compliance measures.

Global Group

The Global Group develops, licenses,
manufactures, distributes and sells a variety of architectural
paint and coatings, industrial and marine products, automotive
finishes and refinish products, OEM coatings and related
products in North and South America, Jamaica, the United
Kingdom, Europe and China. This segment meets the demands of its
customers for a consistent worldwide product development,
manufacturing and distribution presence and approach to doing
business. This segment licenses certain technology and trade
names worldwide.
Sherwin-Williams

®

and other controlled brand products are distributed through the
Paint Stores Group and this segment’s network of 469
company-operated branches — 237 in the United States,
84 in Mexico, 44 in Chile, 56 in Brazil, 23 in Canada, 16
in Jamaica, 6 in Uruguay, 2 in Argentina, 1 in Peru —
and by a direct sales staff and outside sales representatives to
retailers, dealers, jobbers, licensees and other third party
distributors. At December 31, 2006, the Global Group
consisted of operations in the United States, 14 foreign
countries, 3 foreign joint ventures and income from
licensing agreements in 14 foreign countries.

Administrative Segment

The Administrative segment includes the
administrative expenses of the Company’s corporate
headquarters site. Also included in the Administrative segment
was interest expense which was unrelated to retail real estate
leasing activities, investment income, certain foreign currency
transaction losses related to dollar-denominated debt and
foreign currency option and forward contracts, certain expenses
related to closed facilities and environmental-related matters,
and other expenses which were not directly associated with any
Reportable Operating Segment. The Administrative segment did not
include any significant foreign operations. Also included in the
Administrative segment was a real estate management unit that is
responsible for the ownership, management, and leasing of
non-retail properties held primarily for use by the Company,
including the Company’s headquarters site, and disposal of
idle facilities. Sales of this segment represented external
leasing revenue of excess headquarters space or leasing of
facilities no longer used by the Company in its operations.
Gains and losses from the sale of property were not a
significant operating factor in determining the performance of
the Administrative segment.



Segment Financial Information

For financial information regarding our
Reportable Operating Segments, including net external sales,
segment profit, identifiable assets and other information by
segment, see Note 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements on pages 75 through 78 of our 2006 Annual
Report, which is incorporated herein by reference.

Domestic and Foreign Operations

Financial and other information regarding
domestic and foreign operations is set forth in Note 18 of
the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements on page 77
of our 2006 Annual Report, which is incorporated herein by
reference.

Additional information regarding risks attendant
to foreign operations is set forth on page 33 of our 2006
Annual Report under the caption entitled “Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operation,” which is incorporated herein by reference.

Business Developments

For additional information regarding our business
and business developments, see pages 6 through 13 of our
2006 Annual Report and the “Letter to Shareholders” on
pages 2 through 5 of our 2006 Annual Report, which is
incorporated herein by reference.

Raw Materials and Products Purchased for
Resale

Raw materials and fuel supplies are generally
available from various sources in sufficient quantities that
none of the Reportable Operating Segments anticipate any
significant sourcing problems during 2007. There are sufficient
suppliers of each product purchased for resale that none of the
Reportable Operating Segments anticipate any significant
sourcing problems during 2007.

Seasonality

The majority of the sales for the Paint Stores
Group, Consumer Group and Global Group traditionally occur
during the second and third quarters. There is no significant
seasonality in sales for the Administrative segment.

Working Capital

In order to meet increased demand during the
second and third quarters, the Company usually builds its
inventories during the first quarter. Working capital items
(inventory and receivables) are generally financed through
short-term borrowings, which include the use of lines of credit
and the issuance of commercial paper. For a description of the
Company’s liquidity and capital resources, see
pages 23 through 33 of our 2006 Annual Report under the
caption entitled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” which is
incorporated herein by reference.

Patents

Although patents and licenses are not of material
importance to our business as a whole or any segment, the
international operations of the Global Group derive a portion of
its income from the licensing of technology, trademarks and
trade names to foreign companies.

Backlog and Productive Capacity

Backlog orders are not significant in the
business of any Reportable Operating Segment since there is
normally a short period of time between the placing of an order
and shipment. Sufficient productive capacity currently exists to
fulfill our needs for paint, coatings and related products
through 2007.

Research and Development

For information regarding our costs of research
and development included in technical expenditures, see
Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements on
page 50 of our 2006 Annual Report, which is incorporated
herein by reference.

Competition

We experience competition from many local,
regional, national and international competitors of various
sizes in the manufacture, distribution and sale of our paint,
coatings and related products. We are a leading manufacturer and
retailer of paint, coatings and related products to
professional, industrial, commercial and retail customers,
however, our competitive position varies for our different
products and markets.

In the Paint Stores Group, competitors include
other paint and wallpaper stores, mass merchandisers, home
centers, independent hardware stores, hardware chains and
manufacturer-operated direct outlets. Product quality, service
and price determine the competitive advantage for this segment.

In the Consumer Group, domestic and foreign
competitors include manufacturers and distributors of branded
and private labeled paint and coatings products. Technology,
product quality, product innovation, breadth of product line,
technical expertise, distribution, service and price are the key
competitive factors for this segment.

The Global Group has numerous competitors in its
domestic and foreign markets with broad product offerings and
several others with niche products. Key competitive factors for
this segment include technology, product quality, product
innovation, breadth of product line, technical expertise,
distribution, service and price.

The Administrative segment has many competitors
consisting of other real estate owners, developers and managers
in areas in which this segment owns property. The main
competitive factors are the availability of property and price.

Employees

We employed 30,767 persons at December 31,
2006.

Environmental Compliance

For additional information regarding
environmental-related matters, see pages 25 through 27 of
our 2006 Annual Report under the caption entitled
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations” and Notes 1, 8
and 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements on
pages 49, 63 through 65, and 72 and 73, respectively, of
our 2006 Annual Report, which is incorporated herein by
reference.



CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING
INFORMATION

Certain statements contained in
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations,” “Business”
and elsewhere in this report constitute “forward-looking
statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the
Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934. These forward-looking statements are based
upon management’s current expectations, estimates,
assumptions and beliefs concerning future events and conditions
and may discuss, among other things, anticipated future
performance (including sales and earnings), expected growth,
future business plans and the costs and potential liability for
environmental-related matters and the lead pigment and
lead-based paint litigation. Any statement that is not
historical in nature is a forward-looking statement and may be
identified by the use of words and phrases such as
“expects,” “anticipates,”
“believes,” “will,” “will likely
result,” “will continue,” “plans to”
and similar expressions.

Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance
on any forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements
are necessarily subject to risks, uncertainties and other
factors, many of which are outside our control, that could cause
actual results to differ materially from such statements and
from our historical results and experience. These risks,
uncertainties and other factors include such things as:

Readers are cautioned that it is not possible to
predict or identify all of the risks, uncertainties and other
factors that may affect future results and that the above list
should not be considered to be a complete list. Any
forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which
such statement is made, and we undertake no



obligation to update or revise any
forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new
information, future events or otherwise.

ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS

Described below and elsewhere in this report and
other documents that we file from time to time with the
Securities and Exchange Commission are risks, uncertainties and
other factors that can adversely affect our business, results of
operation and financial condition. The following are some of the
more important of these risks, uncertainties and other factors.
Additional risks, uncertainties and other factors that are
currently not known to us or we believe are not currently
material may also adversely affect our business, results of
operation and financial condition.

Adverse changes in general business
conditions in the United States and worldwide may adversely
affect our results of operations and financial
condition.

Adverse changes in general business conditions in
the United States and worldwide may reduce the demand for some
of our products and adversely affect our results of operations
and financial condition. Higher inflation rates, interest rates,
tax rates and unemployment rates, higher labor and healthcare
costs, recessions, changing governmental policies, laws and
regulations, and other economic factors that adversely affect
the demand for our paint, coatings and related products could
adversely affect our results of operations and financial
condition.

Economic downturns in cyclical segments of
the economy may reduce the demand for some of our products and
adversely affect our sales and earnings.

Portions of our business involve the sale of
paint, coatings and related products to segments of the economy
that are cyclical in nature, particularly segments relating to
construction, housing and manufacturing. Our sales to these
segments are affected by the levels of discretionary consumer
and business spending in these segments. During economic
downturns in these segments, the levels of consumer and business
discretionary spending may decrease. This decrease in spending
will likely reduce the demand for some of our products and
adversely affect our sales and earnings.

Increases in the cost of raw materials and
energy may adversely affect our earnings.

We purchase raw materials and energy for use in
the manufacturing, distribution and sale of our products.
Factors such as adverse weather conditions, including
hurricanes, and other disasters can disrupt raw material and
fuel supplies and increase our costs. Although raw materials and
energy supplies are generally available from various sources in
sufficient quantities, unexpected shortages and increases in the
cost of raw materials and energy may have an adverse effect on
our earnings in the event we are unable to offset these costs by
sufficiently decreasing our operating costs or raising the
prices of our products. Many of our paint and coatings products
utilize titanium dioxide, which is widely used as a white
pigment for paint. During 2006, we experienced significant cost
increases in energy and raw materials, particularly titanium
dioxide and petroleum-based materials, which adversely impacted
our earnings.

Although we have an extensive customer
base, the loss of any of our largest customers could adversely
affect our sales and earnings.

We have a large and varied customer base due to
our extensive distribution network. During 2006, no individual
customer accounted for sales totaling more than ten percent of
our sales. However, we have some customers that, individually,
purchase a large amount of products from us. Although our broad
distribution channels would help to minimize the impact of the
loss of any one customer, the loss of any of these large
customers could have an adverse effect on our sales and earnings.



Adverse weather conditions may reduce the
demand for some of our products and could have a negative effect
on our sales.

From time to time, adverse weather conditions in
certain parts of the United States have had an adverse effect on
our sales of paint, coatings and related products. For example,
unusually cold and rainy weather, especially during the exterior
painting season, could have an adverse effect on sales of our
exterior paint products.

Increased competition may reduce our sales
and earnings performance.

We face substantial competition from many
international, national, regional and local competitors of
various sizes in the manufacture, distribution and sale of our
paint, coatings and related products. Some of our competitors
are larger than us and have greater financial resources to
compete. Other competitors are smaller and may be able to offer
more specialized products. Technology, product quality, product
innovation, breadth of product line, technical expertise,
distribution, service and price are the key competitive factors
for our business. Competition in any of these areas may reduce
our sales and adversely affect our earnings by resulting in
decreased sales volumes, reduced prices and increased costs of
manufacturing, distributing and selling our products.

Our operating results and financial
condition may be negatively impacted if we do not successfully
integrate past and future acquisitions into our existing
operations and if the performance of the businesses we acquire
do not meet our expectations.

We have historically made strategic acquisitions
of businesses in the paint and coatings industry and will likely
acquire additional businesses in the future as part of our long
term growth strategy. These acquisitions involve significant
challenges and risks. In the event that we do not successfully
integrate these acquisitions into our existing operations so as
to realize the expected return on our investment, our operating
results and financial condition could be adversely affected.

Risks and uncertainties associated with our
expansion into and our operations in China, South America and
other foreign markets could adversely affect our sales and
earnings.

Net external sales of our consolidated foreign
subsidiaries totaled approximately $831 million in 2006, or
10.6% of our total consolidated net sales. Sales outside of the
United States make up an important part of our current business
and future strategic plans. Our sales and earnings could be
adversely affected by a variety of international factors,
including general economic conditions, inflation rates,
recessions, foreign currency exchange rates, foreign investment
and repatriation restrictions, legal and regulatory constraints,
civil unrest, difficulties in staffing and managing foreign
operations and other external economic and political factors.
Our inability to successfully manage the risks and uncertainties
relating to these factors could adversely affect our sales and
earnings.

In many foreign countries, it is acceptable to
engage in certain business practices that we are prohibited from
engaging in because of regulations that are applicable to us,
such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Although we have
internal control policies and procedures designed to ensure
compliance with these regulations, there can be no assurance
that our policies and procedures will prevent a violation of
these regulations. Any violation could cause an adverse effect
on our results of operations.

Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange
rates could adversely affect our sales and
earnings.

Because of our international operations, we are
exposed to market risk associated with interest rates and value
changes in foreign currencies, which may adversely affect our
business. Historically, our reported net sales and net earnings
have been subjected to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.
Our primary exchange rate exposure is with the British pound,
the Argentine peso, the Brazilian real, the Chilean peso, the
Canadian dollar and the Mexican peso against the U.S. dollar.
While we actively manage the exposure of our foreign currency
market risk as part of our overall financial risk management
policy, we believe we may experience continuing losses from
foreign currency translation, and such losses could adversely
affect our sales and earnings.



We are required to comply with increasingly
stringent federal, state and local environmental laws and
regulations, the cost of which is likely to increase and may
adversely affect our earnings.

Our operations are subject to various federal,
state and local environmental laws and regulations. These laws
and regulations not only govern our current operations and
products, but also impose potential liability on us for our past
operations. We expect environmental laws and regulations to
impose increasingly stringent requirements upon our industry and
us in the future. Our costs to comply with these laws and
regulations may increase as these requirements become more
stringent in the future, and these increased costs may adversely
affect our earnings.

We are involved with environmental
investigation and remediation activities at some of our current
and former sites, as well as a number of third-party sites, for
which our ultimate liability may exceed the current amount we
have accrued.

We are involved with environmental investigation
and remediation activities at some of our current and former
sites and a number of third-party sites. We accrue for estimated
costs of investigation and remediation activities at these sites
for which commitments or clean-up plans have been developed and
when such costs can be reasonably estimated based on industry
standards and professional judgment. These estimated costs are
based on currently available facts regarding each site. We
continuously assess our potential liability for investigation
and remediation activities and adjust our environmental-related
accruals as information becomes available upon which more
accurate costs can be reasonably estimated. Due to the
uncertainties surrounding environmental investigation and
remediation activities, our liability may result in costs that
are significantly higher than currently accrued and may have an
adverse affect on our earnings.

The nature, cost, quantity and outcome of
pending and future litigation, such as litigation arising from
the manufacture and sale of lead pigments and lead-based paint,
could have a material adverse effect on our results of
operations, liquidity and financial condition.

In the course of our business, we are subject to
a variety of claims and lawsuits, including litigation relating
to product liability and warranty, personal injury,
environmental, intellectual property, commercial, contractual
and antitrust claims. We accrue for these contingencies when it
is probable that one or more future events will occur confirming
the fact of a loss and the amount of the loss can be reasonably
estimated. However, because litigation is inherently subject to
many uncertainties and the ultimate result of any present or
future litigation is unpredictable, our ultimate liability may
result in costs that are significantly higher than currently
accrued. In the event that our loss contingency is ultimately
determined to be significantly higher than currently accrued,
the recording of the liability may result in a material impact
on net income for the annual or interim period during which such
liability is accrued. Additionally, due to the uncertainties
involved, any potential liability determined to be attributable
to us arising out of such litigation may have a material adverse
effect on our results of operations, liquidity or financial
condition.

Our past operations included the manufacture and
sale of lead pigments and lead-based paints. Along with other
companies, we are a defendant in a number of legal proceedings,
including purported class actions, separate actions brought by
the State of Rhode Island, and actions brought by various
counties, cities, school districts and other government-related
entities, arising from the manufacture and sale of lead pigments
and lead-based paints. We are also a defendant in legal
proceedings arising from the manufacture and sale of
non-lead-based paints, which seek recovery based upon various
legal theories, including the failure to adequately warn of
potential exposure to lead during surface preparation when using
non-lead-based paint on surfaces previously painted with
lead-based paint. We expect that additional lead pigment and
lead-based paint litigation may be filed against us in the
future asserting similar or different legal theories and seeking
similar or different types of damages and relief.

During September 2002, a jury trial commenced in
the first phase of the action brought by the State of Rhode
Island against us and the other defendants. The sole issue in
this first phase was whether lead pigment in paint constitutes a
public nuisance under Rhode Island law. In October 2002, the
court declared a mistrial as the jury, which was split four to
two in favor of the defendants, was unable to reach a unanimous
decision.

The State of Rhode Island retried the case and on
February 22, 2006, the jury returned a verdict, finding
that (1) the cumulative presence of lead pigment in paints
and coatings on buildings in the State of Rhode Island



constitutes a public nuisance, (ii) we,
along with two other defendants, caused or substantially
contributed to the creation of the public nuisance, and
(iii) we and two other defendants should be ordered to
abate the public nuisance. On February 26, 2007, the Court
issued a decision on the post-trial motions and other matters
pending before the Court. Specifically, the Court (i) denied the
defendants’ post-trial motions for judgment as a matter of
law and for a new trial, (ii) decided to enter a judgment of
abatement in favor of the State against us and two other
defendants, and (iii) decided to appoint a special master for
the purpose of assisting the Court in its consideration of a
remedial order to implement the judgment of abatement, and if
necessary, any monitoring of the implementation of that order.
We intend to appeal the jury’s verdict and the Court’s
decision.

Litigation is inherently subject to many
uncertainties. Adverse court rulings, such as the Rhode Island
jury verdict and the Wisconsin State Supreme Court’s
determination in July 2005 that Wisconsin’s risk
contribution theory may apply to the lead pigment litigation, or
determinations of liability, among other factors, could affect
the lead pigment and lead-based paint litigation against us and
encourage an increase in the number and nature of future claims
and proceedings. In addition, from time to time, various
legislation and administrative regulations have been enacted or
proposed to impose obligations on present and former
manufacturers of lead pigments and lead-based paints respecting
asserted health concerns associated with such products and to
overturn court decisions in which we and other manufacturers
have been successful. We cannot reasonably determine the impact
that the State of Rhode Island decision and determination of
liability will have on the number or nature of present or future
claims and proceedings against us.

Due to the uncertainties involved, management is
unable to predict the outcome of the lead pigment and lead-based
paint litigation, the number or nature of possible future claims
and proceedings, or the effect that any legislation and/or
administrative regulations may have on the litigation or against
us. In addition, management cannot reasonably determine the
scope or amount of the potential costs and liabilities related
to such litigation, or any such legislation and regulations. We
have not accrued any amounts for such litigation. Any potential
liability that may result from such litigation or such
legislation and regulations cannot reasonably be estimated. In
the event any significant liability is determined to be
attributable to us relating to such litigation, the recording of
the liability may result in a material impact on net income for
the annual or interim period during which such liability is
accrued. Additionally, due to the uncertainties associated with
the amount of any such liability and/or the nature of any other
remedy which may be imposed in such litigation, any potential
liability determined to be attributable to us arising out of
such litigation may have a material adverse effect on our
results of operations, liquidity or financial condition. An
estimate of the potential impact on our results of operations,
liquidity or financial condition cannot be made due to the
aforementioned uncertainties.

We discuss the risks and uncertainties related to
litigation, including the lead pigment and lead-based paint
litigation, in more detail on pages 21 and 22 of our 2006 Annual
Report under the caption “Litigation and Other Contingent
Liabilities,” and pages 29 through 33 of our 2006
Annual Report under the caption “Litigation,” of
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations” and in Note 9 of
the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements on pages 65
through 68 of our 2006 Annual Report.

The costs or potential liability ultimately
determined to be attributable to us through our ownership of
Life Shield could have an adverse effect on our results of
operations, liquidity or financial condition.

We own a 25% interest in Life Shield Engineered
Systems, LLC and are obligated to acquire an additional 24%
interest in Life Shield in October 2007. Life Shield is a
start-up company that develops and manufactures blast and
fragment mitigating systems and ballistic resistant systems. The
blast and fragment mitigating systems and ballistic resistant
systems create a potentially higher level of product liability
for us than is normally associated with coatings and related
products we manufacture, distribute and sell. Depending upon the
extent of any potential liability ultimately determined to be
attributable to us relating to Life Shield, such liability could
have an adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity
and financial condition. We discuss these risks and
uncertainties in more detail on page 29 of our 2006 Annual
Report under the caption entitled “Contingent
Liabilities” of “Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”

We are exposed to market risk associated with

forward contracts and commodity swaps outstanding at
