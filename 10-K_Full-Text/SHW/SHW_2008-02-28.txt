PART
    I

ITEM
    1.  BUSINESS

Introduction

The Sherwin-Williams Company, founded in 1866 and incorporated
    in Ohio in 1884, is engaged in the development, manufacture,
    distribution and sale of paint, coatings and related products to
    professional, industrial, commercial and retail customers
    primarily in North and South America with additional operations
    in the United Kingdom, Europe, India and China. Our principal
    executive offices are located at 101 Prospect Avenue, N.W.,
    Cleveland, Ohio 44115-1075, telephone (216) 566-2000. As
    used in this report, the terms “Sherwin-Williams,”
    “Company,” “we” and “our” mean The
    Sherwin-Williams Company and its consolidated subsidiaries
    unless the context indicates otherwise.

Basis of
    Reportable Segments

We report our segment information in the same way that
    management internally organizes our business for assessing
    performance and making decisions regarding allocation of
    resources in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting
    Standards (FAS) No. 131, “Disclosures about
    Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information.”
    Effective January 1, 2006, we changed our reportable
    operating segments based on organizational changes in our
    management structure. Our reportable operating segments now are:
    Paint Stores Group, Consumer Group and Global Group
    (collectively, the “Reportable Operating Segments”).
    The Global Group consists of certain business units with foreign
    or worldwide operations that were reported in the previous Paint
    Stores, Consumer, Automotive Finishes and International Coatings
    segments. Amounts reported prior to January 1, 2006 have
    been reclassified to conform to the current presentation.
    Factors considered in determining our Reportable Operating
    Segments include the nature of the business activities,
    existence of managers responsible for the operating activities
    and information presented to our Board of Directors. We report
    all other business activities and immaterial operating segments
    that are not reportable in the Administrative segment.

The Company’s chief operating decision maker
    (CODM) has been identified as the Chief Executive Officer
    because he has final authority over performance assessment and
    resource allocation decisions. Because of the diverse operations
    of the Company, the CODM regularly receives discrete financial
    information about each Reportable Operating Segment as well as a
    significant amount of additional financial information about
    certain divisions, business units or subsidiaries of the
    Company. The CODM uses all such financial information for
    performance assessment and resource allocation decisions. The
    CODM evaluates the performance of and allocates resources to the
    Reportable Operating Segments based on profit or loss and cash
    generated from operations before income taxes. The accounting
    policies of the Reportable Operating Segments are the same as
    those described in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements on pages 47 through 51 of our 2007
    Annual Report, which is incorporated herein by reference.



Paint
    Stores Group

The Paint Stores Group consisted of 3,325 company-operated
    specialty paint stores and seven manufacturing/distribution
    facilities in the United States, Canada, Jamaica, Virgin Islands
    and Puerto Rico at December 31, 2007. Each store in this
    segment is engaged in the related business activity of selling
    paint, coatings and related products to end-use customers. The
    acquisitions of M.A. Bruder & Sons, Incorporated
    and Columbia Paint & Coatings Co. are included in this
    segment. The Paint Stores Group markets and sells
    Sherwin-Williams

®

branded architectural paint and coatings, industrial and marine
    products, original equipment manufacturer (“OEM”)
    product finishes and related items. These products are produced
    by manufacturing facilities in the Paint Stores, Consumer and
    Global Groups. In addition, each store sells selected purchased
    associated products. During 2007, this segment acquired 172
    stores and opened 107 net new stores, consisting of 81 stores in
    the United States, 18 in the Caribbean region and 8 in Canada.
    In 2006, there were 117 net new stores opened (113 in the United
    States). In 2005, there were 95 net new stores opened (88 in the
    United States). The loss of any single customer would not have a
    material adverse effect on the business of this segment.

Consumer
    Group

The Consumer Group develops, manufactures and distributes a
    variety of paint, coatings and related products to third party
    customers and the Paint Stores Group primarily in the United
    States and Canada. The acquisitions of the brand names, formulas
    and patents of the
    VHT

®

brand paint line and Life Shield Engineered Systems, LLC in 2007
    are included in this segment. Approximately 56 percent of
    the total sales of the Consumer Group in 2007, including
    inter-segment transfers, represented products sold through the
    Paint Stores Group. Sales and marketing of certain controlled
    brand and private labeled products is performed by a direct
    sales staff. The products distributed through third party
    customers are intended for resale to the ultimate end-user of
    the product. The Consumer Group had sales to certain customers
    that, individually, may be a significant portion of the sales of
    the segment. However, the loss of any single customer would not
    have a material adverse effect on the overall profitability of
    the segment. This segment incurred most of the Company’s
    capital expenditures related to ongoing environmental compliance
    measures.

Global
    Group

The Global Group develops, licenses, manufactures, distributes
    and sells a variety of architectural paint and coatings,
    industrial and marine products, automotive finishes and refinish
    products, OEM coatings and related products in North and South
    America, the United Kingdom, Europe, China and India. The
    acquisitions of Nitco Paints Private Limited (India), Pinturas
    Industriales S.A. (Uruguay), Napko, S.A. de C.V. (Mexico) and
    Flex Recubrimientos, S.A. de C.V. (Mexico) are included in this
    segment. This segment meets the demands of its customers for a
    consistent worldwide product development, manufacturing and
    distribution presence and approach to doing business. This
    segment licenses certain technology and trade names worldwide.
    Sherwin-Williams

®

and other controlled brand products are distributed through the
    Paint Stores Group and this segment’s network of 519
    company-operated branches and by a direct sales staff and
    outside sales representatives to retailers, dealers, jobbers,
    licensees and other third party distributors. During 2007, this
    segment added 50 net new branches consisting of 29 net new
    branches in South America, 19 branches in the United States and
    2 in Canada. At December 31, 2007, the Global Group
    consisted of operations in the United States, subsidiaries in 15
    foreign countries, 3 foreign joint ventures and income from
    licensing agreements in 14 foreign countries.

Administrative
    Segment

The Administrative segment includes the administrative expenses
    of the Company’s corporate headquarters site. Also included
    in the Administrative segment was interest expense which was
    unrelated to retail real estate leasing activities, interest and
    investment income, certain foreign currency transaction losses
    related to dollar-denominated debt and foreign currency option
    and forward contracts, certain expenses related to closed
    facilities and environmental-related matters, and other expenses
    which were not directly associated with any Reportable Operating
    Segment. The Administrative segment did not include any
    significant foreign operations. Also included in the
    Administrative segment was a real estate management unit that is
    responsible for the ownership, management, and leasing of
    non-retail properties held primarily for use by the Company,
    including the Company’s



headquarters site, and disposal of idle facilities. Sales of
    this segment represented external leasing revenue of excess
    headquarters space or leasing of facilities no longer used by
    the Company in its operations. Gains and losses from the sale of
    property were not a significant operating factor in determining
    the performance of the Administrative segment.

Segment
    Financial Information

For financial information regarding our Reportable Operating
    Segments, including net external sales, segment profit,
    identifiable assets and other information by segment, see
    Note 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
    on pages 76 through 78 of our 2007 Annual Report, which is
    incorporated herein by reference.

Domestic
    and Foreign Operations

Financial and other information regarding domestic and foreign
    operations is set forth in Note 18 of the Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements on page 77 of our 2007
    Annual Report, which is incorporated herein by reference.

Additional information regarding risks attendant to foreign
    operations is set forth on page 34 of our 2007 Annual
    Report under the caption entitled “Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operation,” which is incorporated herein by reference.

Business
    Developments

For additional information regarding our business and business
    developments, see pages 6 through 14 of our 2007 Annual
    Report and the “Letter to Shareholders” on
    pages 2 through 5 of our 2007 Annual Report, which is
    incorporated herein by reference.

Raw
    Materials and Products Purchased for Resale

Raw materials and fuel supplies are generally available from
    various sources in sufficient quantities that none of the
    Reportable Operating Segments anticipate any significant
    sourcing problems during 2008. There are sufficient suppliers of
    each product purchased for resale that none of the Reportable
    Operating Segments anticipate any significant sourcing problems
    during 2008.

Seasonality

The majority of the sales for the Paint Stores Group, Consumer
    Group and Global Group traditionally occur during the second and
    third quarters. There is no significant seasonality in sales for
    the Administrative segment.

Working
    Capital

In order to meet increased demand during the second and third
    quarters, the Company usually builds its inventories during the
    first quarter. Working capital items (inventory and receivables)
    are generally financed through short-term borrowings, which
    include the use of lines of credit and the issuance of
    commercial paper. For a description of the Company’s
    liquidity and capital resources, see pages 23
    through 34 of our 2007 Annual Report under the caption
    entitled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
    Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” which is
    incorporated herein by reference.

Trademarks
    and Trade Names

Customer recognition of our trademarks and trade names
    collectively contribute significantly to our sales. The major
    trademarks and trade names used by each Reportable Operating

Patents

Although patents and licenses are not of material importance to
    our business as a whole or any segment, the international
    operations of the Global Group derive a portion of its income
    from the licensing of technology, trademarks and trade names to
    foreign companies.

Backlog
    and Productive Capacity

Backlog orders are not significant in the business of any
    Reportable Operating Segment since there is normally a short
    period of time between the placing of an order and shipment. We
    believe that sufficient productive capacity currently exists to
    fulfill our needs for paint, coatings and related products
    through 2008.

Research
    and Development

For information regarding our costs of research and development
    included in technical expenditures, see Note 1 of the Notes
    to Consolidated Financial Statements on page 50 of our 2007
    Annual Report, which is incorporated herein by reference.

Competition

We experience competition from many local, regional, national
    and international competitors of various sizes in the
    manufacture, distribution and sale of our paint, coatings and
    related products. We are a leading manufacturer and retailer of
    paint, coatings and related products to professional,
    industrial, commercial and retail customers, however, our
    competitive position varies for our different products and
    markets.

In the Paint Stores Group, competitors include other paint and
    wallpaper stores, mass merchandisers, home centers, independent
    hardware stores, hardware chains and manufacturer-operated
    direct outlets. Product quality, product innovation, breadth of
    product line, technical expertise, service and price determine
    the competitive advantage for this segment.

In the Consumer Group, domestic and foreign competitors include
    manufacturers and distributors of branded and private labeled
    paint and coatings products. Technology, product quality,
    product innovation, breadth of product line, technical
    expertise, distribution, service and price are the key
    competitive factors for this segment.

The Global Group has numerous competitors in its domestic and
    foreign markets with broad product offerings and several others
    with niche products. Key competitive factors for this segment
    include technology, product quality, product innovation, breadth
    of product line, technical expertise, distribution, service and
    price.

The Administrative segment has many competitors consisting of
    other real estate owners, developers and managers in areas in
    which this segment owns property. The main competitive factors
    are the availability of property and price.

Employees

We employed 31,572 persons at December 31, 2007.

Environmental
    Compliance

For additional information regarding environmental-related
    matters, see pages 25 through 27 of our 2007 Annual Report
    under the caption entitled “Management’s Discussion
    and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations” and Notes 1, 8 and 13 of the Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements on pages 49, 63 and 64,
    and 73, respectively, of our 2007 Annual Report, which is
    incorporated herein by reference.



CAUTIONARY
    STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION

Certain statements contained in “Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations,” “Business” and elsewhere in this
    report constitute “forward-looking statements” within
    the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933
    and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
    These forward-looking statements are based upon
    management’s current expectations, estimates, assumptions
    and beliefs concerning future events and conditions and may
    discuss, among other things, anticipated future performance
    (including sales and earnings), expected growth, future business
    plans and the costs and potential liability for
    environmental-related matters and the lead pigment and
    lead-based paint litigation. Any statement that is not
    historical in nature is a forward-looking statement and may be
    identified by the use of words and phrases such as
    “expects,” “anticipates,”
    “believes,” “will,” “will likely
    result,” “will continue,” “plans to”
    and similar expressions.

Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any
    forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are
    necessarily subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors,
    many of which are outside our control, that could cause actual
    results to differ materially from such statements and from our
    historical results and experience. These risks, uncertainties
    and other factors include such things as:

•

general business conditions, strengths of retail and
    manufacturing economies and the growth in the coatings industry;

•

competitive factors, including pricing pressures and product
    innovation and quality;

•

changes in raw material and energy supplies and pricing;

•

changes in our relationships with customers and suppliers;

•

our ability to attain cost savings from productivity initiatives;

•

our ability to successfully integrate past and future
    acquisitions into our existing operations, as well as the
    performance of the businesses acquired;

•

risks and uncertainties associated with our ownership of Life
    Shield Engineered Systems, LLC;

•

changes in general domestic economic conditions such as
    inflation rates, interest rates, tax rates, unemployment rates,
    higher labor and healthcare costs, recessions, and changing
    government policies, laws and regulations;

•

risks and uncertainties associated with our expansion into and
    our operations in China, India, South America and other foreign
    markets, including general economic conditions, inflation rates,
    recessions, foreign currency exchange rates, foreign investment
    and repatriation restrictions, legal and regulatory constraints,
    civil unrest and other external economic and political factors;

•

the achievement of growth in developing markets, such as China,
    India, Mexico and South America;

•

increasingly stringent domestic and foreign governmental
    regulations including those affecting the environment;

•

inherent uncertainties involved in assessing our potential
    liability for environmental-related activities;

•

other changes in governmental policies, laws and regulations,
    including changes in accounting policies and standards and
    taxation requirements (such as new tax laws and new or revised
    tax law interpretations);

•

the nature, cost, quantity and outcome of pending and future
    litigation and other claims, including the lead pigment and
    lead-based paint litigation, and the effect of any legislation
    and administrative regulations relating thereto; and

•

unusual weather conditions.

Readers are cautioned that it is not possible to predict or
    identify all of the risks, uncertainties and other factors that
    may affect future results and that the above list should not be
    considered to be a complete list. Any forward-looking statement
    speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made, and
    we undertake no obligation to update or revise any
    forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new
    information, future events or otherwise.



ITEM
    1A.  RISK FACTORS

Described below and elsewhere in this report and other documents
    that we file from time to time with the Securities and Exchange
    Commission are risks, uncertainties and other factors that can
    adversely affect our business, results of operation and
    financial condition. The following are some of the more
    important of these risks, uncertainties and other factors.
    Additional risks, uncertainties and other factors that are
    currently not known to us or we believe are not currently
    material may also adversely affect our business, results of
    operation and financial condition.

Adverse
    changes in general business conditions in the United States and
    worldwide may adversely affect our results of operations and
    financial condition.

Adverse changes in general business conditions in the United
    States and worldwide may reduce the demand for some of our
    products and adversely affect our results of operations and
    financial condition. Higher inflation rates, interest rates, tax
    rates and unemployment rates, higher labor and healthcare costs,
    recessions, changing governmental policies, laws and
    regulations, and other economic factors that adversely affect
    the demand for our paint, coatings and related products could
    adversely affect our results of operations and financial
    condition.

Economic
    downturns in cyclical segments of the economy may reduce the
    demand for some of our products and adversely affect our sales
    and earnings.

Portions of our business involve the sale of paint, coatings and
    related products to segments of the economy that are cyclical in
    nature, particularly segments relating to construction, housing
    and manufacturing. Our sales to these segments are affected by
    the levels of discretionary consumer and business spending in
    these segments. During economic downturns in these segments, the
    levels of consumer and business discretionary spending may
    decrease. This decrease in spending will likely reduce the
    demand for some of our products and adversely affect our sales
    and earnings.

Increases
    in the cost of raw materials and energy may adversely affect our
    earnings.

We purchase raw materials and energy for use in the
    manufacturing, distribution and sale of our products. Factors
    such as adverse weather conditions, including hurricanes, and
    other disasters can disrupt raw material and fuel supplies and
    increase our costs. Although raw materials and energy supplies
    are generally available from various sources in sufficient
    quantities, unexpected shortages and increases in the cost of
    raw materials and energy may have an adverse effect on our
    earnings in the event we are unable to offset these costs by
    sufficiently decreasing our operating costs or raising the
    prices of our products. Many of our paint and coatings products
    utilize titanium dioxide, which is widely used as a white
    pigment for paint.

Although
    we have an extensive customer base, the loss of any of our
    largest customers could adversely affect our sales and
    earnings.

We have a large and varied customer base due to our extensive
    distribution network. During 2007, no individual customer
    accounted for sales totaling more than ten percent of our sales.
    However, we have some customers that, individually, purchase a
    large amount of products from us. Although our broad
    distribution channels would help to minimize the impact of the
    loss of any one customer, the loss of any of these large
    customers could have an adverse effect on our sales and earnings.

Adverse
    weather conditions may reduce the demand for some of our
    products and could have a negative effect on our
    sales.

From time to time, adverse weather conditions in certain parts
    of the United States have had an adverse effect on our sales of
    paint, coatings and related products. For example, unusually
    cold and rainy weather, especially during the exterior painting
    season, could have an adverse effect on sales of our exterior
    paint products.



Increased
    competition may reduce our sales and earnings
    performance.

We face substantial competition from many international,
    national, regional and local competitors of various sizes in the
    manufacture, distribution and sale of our paint, coatings and
    related products. Some of our competitors are larger than us and
    have greater financial resources to compete. Other competitors
    are smaller and may be able to offer more specialized products.
    Technology, product quality, product innovation, breadth of
    product line, technical expertise, distribution, service and
    price are the key competitive factors for our business.
    Competition in any of these areas may reduce our sales and
    adversely affect our earnings by resulting in decreased sales
    volumes, reduced prices and increased costs of manufacturing,
    distributing and selling our products.

Our
    operating results and financial condition may be negatively
    impacted if we do not successfully integrate past and future
    acquisitions into our existing operations and if the performance
    of the businesses we acquire do not meet our
    expectations.

We have historically made strategic acquisitions of businesses
    in the paint and coatings industry and will likely acquire
    additional businesses in the future as part of our long term
    growth strategy. These acquisitions involve challenges and
    risks. In the event that we do not successfully integrate these
    acquisitions into our existing operations so as to realize the
    expected return on our investment, our operating results and
    financial condition could be adversely affected.

Risks
    and uncertainties associated with our expansion into and our
    operations in China, India, South America and other foreign
    markets could adversely affect our sales and
    earnings.

Net external sales of our consolidated foreign subsidiaries
    totaled approximately $965 million in 2007, or 12.1% of our
    total consolidated net sales. Sales outside of the United States
    make up an important part of our current business and future
    strategic plans. Our sales and earnings could be adversely
    affected by a variety of international factors, including
    general economic conditions, inflation rates, recessions,
    foreign currency exchange rates, foreign investment and
    repatriation restrictions, legal and regulatory constraints,
    civil unrest, difficulties in staffing and managing foreign
    operations and other external economic and political factors.
    Our inability to successfully manage the risks and uncertainties
    relating to these factors could adversely affect our sales and
    earnings.

In many foreign countries, it is acceptable to engage in certain
    business practices that we are prohibited from engaging in
    because of regulations that are applicable to us, such as the
    Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Although we have internal control
    policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these
    regulations, there can be no assurance that our policies and
    procedures will prevent a violation of these regulations. Any
    violation could cause an adverse effect on our results of
    operations.

Fluctuations
    in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely affect our
    sales and earnings.

Because of our international operations, we are exposed to risk
    associated with interest rates and value changes in foreign
    currencies, which may adversely affect our business.
    Historically, our reported net sales and net earnings have been
    subjected to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. Our primary
    exchange rate exposure is with the euro, the British pound, the
    Argentine peso, the Brazilian real, the Chilean peso, the
    Canadian dollar and the Mexican peso against the U.S. dollar.
    While we actively manage the exposure of our foreign currency
    risk as part of our overall financial risk management policy, we
    believe we may experience losses from foreign currency
    translation, and such losses could adversely affect our sales
    and earnings.

We are
    required to comply with increasingly stringent federal, state
    and local environmental laws and regulations, the cost of which
    is likely to increase and may adversely affect our
    earnings.

Our operations are subject to various federal, state and local
    environmental laws and regulations. These laws and regulations
    not only govern our current operations and products, but also
    impose potential liability on us for our past operations. We
    expect environmental laws and regulations to impose increasingly
    stringent requirements upon our industry and us in the future.
    Our costs to comply with these laws and regulations may increase
    as these requirements become more stringent in the future, and
    these increased costs may adversely affect our earnings.



We are
    involved with environmental investigation and remediation
    activities at some of our currently and formerly owned sites, as
    well as a number of third-party sites, for which our ultimate
    liability may exceed the current amount we have
    accrued.

We are involved with environmental investigation and remediation
    activities at some of our currently and formerly owned sites and
    a number of third-party sites. We accrue for estimated costs of
    investigation and remediation activities at these sites for
    which commitments or clean-up plans have been developed and when
    such costs can be reasonably estimated based on industry
    standards and professional judgment. These estimated costs are
    based on currently available facts regarding each site. We
    continuously assess our potential liability for investigation
    and remediation activities and adjust our environmental-related
    accruals as information becomes available upon which more
    accurate costs can be reasonably estimated. Due to the
    uncertainties surrounding environmental investigation and
    remediation activities, our liability may result in costs that
    are significantly higher than currently accrued and may have an
    adverse affect on our earnings.

The
    nature, cost, quantity and outcome of pending and future
    litigation, such as litigation arising from the historical
    manufacture and sale of lead pigments and lead-based paint,
    could have a material adverse effect on our results of
    operations, liquidity and financial condition.

In the course of our business, we are subject to a variety of
    claims and lawsuits, including litigation relating to product
    liability and warranty, personal injury, environmental,
    intellectual property, commercial, contractual and antitrust
    claims that are inherently subject to many uncertainties
    regarding the possibility of a loss to us. These uncertainties
    will ultimately be resolved when one or more future events occur
    or fail to occur confirming the incurrence of a liability or the
    reduction of a liability. In accordance with Statement of
    Financial Accounting Standards (FAS) No. 5,
    “Accounting for Contingencies,” we accrue for these
    contingencies by a charge to income when it is both probable
    that one or more future events will occur confirming the fact of
    a loss and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.
    In the event that a loss contingency is ultimately determined to
    be significantly higher than currently accrued, the recording of
    the additional liability may result in a material impact on our
    results of operations, liquidity or financial condition for the
    annual or interim period during which such additional liability
    is accrued. In those cases where no accrual is recorded because
    it is not probable that a liability has been incurred and cannot
    be reasonably estimated, any potential liability ultimately
    determined to be attributable to us may result in a material
    impact on our results of operations, liquidity or financial
    condition for the annual or interim period during which such
    liability is accrued. In those cases where no accrual is
    recorded or exposure to loss exists in excess of the amount
    accrued, FAS No. 5 requires disclosure of the
    contingency when there is a reasonable possibility that a loss
    or additional loss may have been incurred if even the
    possibility may be remote.

Our past operations included the manufacture and sale of lead
    pigments and lead-based paints. Along with other companies, we
    are a defendant in a number of legal proceedings, including
    individual personal injury actions, purported class actions,
    actions brought by the State of Rhode Island and the State of
    Ohio, and actions brought by various counties, cities, school
    districts and other government-related entities, arising from
    the manufacture and sale of lead pigments and lead-based paints.
    The plaintiffs are seeking recovery based upon various legal
    theories, including negligence, strict liability, breach of
    warranty, negligent misrepresentations and omissions, fraudulent
    misrepresentations and omissions, concert of action, civil
    conspiracy, violations of unfair trade practice and consumer
    protection laws, enterprise liability, market share liability,
    public nuisance, unjust enrichment and other theories. The
    plaintiffs seek various damages and relief, including personal
    injury and property damage, costs relating to the detection and
    abatement of lead-based paint from buildings, costs associated
    with a public education campaign, medical monitoring costs and
    others. We are also a defendant in legal proceedings arising
    from the manufacture and sale of non-lead-based paints which
    seek recovery based upon various legal theories, including the
    failure to adequately warn of potential exposure to lead during
    surface preparation when using non-lead-based paint on surfaces
    previously painted with lead-based paint. We believe that the
    litigation brought to date is without merit or subject to
    meritorious defenses and are vigorously defending such
    litigation. We expect that additional lead pigment and
    lead-based paint litigation may be filed against us in the
    future asserting similar or different legal theories and seeking
    similar or different types of damages and relief.

During September 2002, a jury trial commenced in the first phase
    of an action brought by the State of Rhode Island against us and
    the other defendants. The sole issue before the court in this
    first phase was whether lead



pigment in paint constitutes a public nuisance under Rhode
    Island law. In October 2002, the court declared a mistrial as
    the jury, which was split four to two in favor of the
    defendants, was unable to reach a unanimous decision.

The State of Rhode Island retried the case and on
    February 22, 2006, the jury returned a verdict, finding
    that (i) the cumulative presence of lead pigment in paints
    and coatings on buildings in the State of Rhode Island
    constitutes a public nuisance, (ii) we, along with two
    other defendants, caused or substantially contributed to the
    creation of the public nuisance, and (iii) we and two other
    defendants should be ordered to abate the public nuisance. On
    February 28, 2006, the Court granted the defendants’
    motion to dismiss the punitive damages claim, finding
    insufficient evidence to support the State’s request for
    punitive damages. On February 26, 2007, the Court issued a
    decision on the post-trial motions and other matters pending
    before the Court. Specifically, the Court (i) denied the
    defendant’s post-trial motions for judgment as a matter of
    law and for a new trial, (ii) decided to enter a judgment
    of abatement in favor of the State against us and two other
    defendants, and (iii) decided to appoint a special master
    for the purpose of assisting the Court in its consideration of a
    remedial order to implement the judgment of abatement, and if
    necessary, any monitoring of the implementation of that order.
    On March 16, 2007, final judgment was entered against us
    and two other defendants. Also on March 16, 2007, we filed
    our notice of appeal to the Rhode Island Supreme Court. Oral
    argument on our and the other two defendants’ appeal to the
    Rhode Island Supreme Court is scheduled for May 2008.
    Proceedings relating to a remedial order to implement the
    judgment of abatement are continuing in the Court during the
    pending appeal to the Rhode Island Supreme Court.

We cannot reasonably determine the impact that the State of
    Rhode Island decision and determination of liability will have
    on the number or nature of present or future claims and
    proceedings against us or estimate the amount or range of
    ultimate loss that we may incur.

Notwithstanding our views on the merits, litigation is
    inherently subject to many uncertainties and we ultimately may
    not prevail. Adverse court rulings, such as the judgment against
    us and other defendants in the State of Rhode Island action and
    the Wisconsin State Supreme Court’s July 2005 determination
    that Wisconsin’s risk contribution theory may apply in the
    lead pigment litigation, or determinations of liability, among
    other factors, could affect the lead pigment and lead-based
    paint litigation against us and encourage an increase in the
    number and nature of future claims and proceedings. In addition,
    from time to time, various legislation and administrative
    regulations have been enacted, promulgated or proposed to impose
    obligations on present and former manufacturers of lead pigments
    and lead-based paints respecting asserted health concerns
    associated with such products or to overturn the effect of court
    decisions in which we and other manufacturers have been
    successful.

Due to the uncertainties involved, management is unable to
    predict the outcome of the lead pigment and

lead-based

paint litigation, the number or nature of possible future claims
    and proceedings, or the effect that any legislation and/or
    administrative regulations may have on the litigation or against
    us. In addition, management cannot reasonably determine the
    scope or amount of the potential costs and liabilities related
    to such litigation, or any such legislation and regulations. In
    accordance with FAS No. 5, we have not accrued any amounts
    for such litigation. Any potential liability that may result
    from such litigation or such legislation and regulations cannot
    reasonably be estimated. In the event any significant liability
    is determined to be attributable to us relating to such
    litigation, the recording of the liability may result in a
    material impact on net income for the annual or interim period
    during which such liability is accrued. Additionally, due to the
    uncertainties associated with the amount of any such liability
    and/or the nature of any other remedy which may be imposed in
    such litigation, any potential liability determined to be
    attributable to us arising out of such litigation may have a
    material adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity
    or financial condition. An estimate of the potential impact on
    our results of operations, liquidity or financial condition
    cannot be made due to the aforementioned uncertainties.

We discuss the risks and uncertainties related to litigation,
    including the lead pigment and lead-based paint litigation, in
    more detail on pages 21 and 22 of our 2007 Annual Report under
    the caption “Litigation and Other Contingent
    Liabilities,” and pages 29 through 33 of our 2007
    Annual Report under the caption “Litigation” of
    “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
    Condition and Results of Operations” and in Note 9 of
    the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements on pages 64
    through 68 of our 2007 Annual Report.



The
    costs or potential liability ultimately determined to be
    attributable to us through our ownership of Life Shield could
    have an adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity
    or financial condition.

We own Life Shield Engineered Systems, LLC. Life Shield develops
    and manufactures blast and fragment mitigating systems and
    ballistic resistant systems. The blast and fragment mitigating
    systems and ballistic resistant systems create a potentially
    higher level of product liability for us than is normally
    associated with coatings and related products we manufacture,
    distribute and sell. Depending upon the extent of any potential
    liability ultimately determined to be attributable to us
    relating to Life Shield, such liability could have an adverse
    effect on our results of operations, liquidity and financial
    condition. We discuss these risks and uncertainties in more
    detail on page 29 of our 2007 Annual Report under the
    caption entitled “Contingent Liabilities” of
    “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
    Condition and Results of Operations.”

    OPERATIONS

    pages 18 through 38 of our 2007 Annual Report under the
    caption entitled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis
    of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” which is

ITEM
    7A.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT
    MARKET RISK

We are exposed to market risk associated with interest rates,
    foreign currency and commodity fluctuations. We occasionally
    utilize derivative instruments as part of our overall financial
    risk management policy, but do not use derivative instruments
    for speculative or trading purposes. The Company had foreign
    currency option and forward contracts and commodity swaps
    outstanding at December 31, 2007 to hedge against value
    changes in foreign currency and commodities. Foreign currency
    option and forward contracts are described in detail in
    Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
    on page 73 of our 2007 Annual Report. Commodity swaps are
    described in detail in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements on page 48 of our 2007 Annual Report.
    We believe we may experience continuing losses from foreign
    currency translation and commodity price fluctuations. However,
    we do not expect currency translation, transaction, commodity
    price fluctuations or hedging contract losses to have a material
    adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations
    or cash flows.
