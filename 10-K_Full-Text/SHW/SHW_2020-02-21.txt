THE SHERWIN-WILLIAMS COMPANY



PART I

ITEM 1.    BUSINESS

Introduction

The Sherwin-Williams Company, founded in 1866 and incorporated in Ohio in 1884, is engaged in the development, manufacture, distribution and sale of paint, coatings and related products to professional, industrial, commercial and retail customers primarily in North and South America with additional operations in the Caribbean region, Europe, Asia and Australia. Our principal executive offices are located at 101 West Prospect Avenue, Cleveland, Ohio 44115-1075, telephone (216) 566-2000. As used in this report, the terms “Sherwin-Williams,” “Company,” “we” and “our” mean The Sherwin-Williams Company and its consolidated subsidiaries unless the context indicates otherwise.

Basis of Reportable Segments

The Company reports its segment information in the same way that management internally organizes its business for assessing performance and making decisions regarding allocation of resources in accordance with the Segment Reporting Topic of the Accounting Standards Codification (ASC). The Company has

three

reportable operating segments: The Americas Group, Consumer Brands Group and Performance Coatings Group (individually, a "Reportable Segment" and collectively, the “Reportable Segments”). Factors considered in determining the

three

Reportable Segments of the Company include the nature of business activities, the management structure directly accountable to the Company’s chief operating decision maker (CODM) for operating and administrative activities, availability of discrete financial information and information presented to the Board of Directors. The Company reports all other business activities and immaterial operating segments that are not reportable in the Administrative segment. For more information about the Reportable Segments, see Note


to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.

The Company’s CODM has been identified as the Chief Executive Officer because he has final authority over performance assessment and resource allocation decisions. Because of the diverse operations of the Company, the CODM regularly receives discrete financial information about each Reportable Segment as well as a significant amount of additional financial information about certain divisions, business units or subsidiaries of the Company. The CODM uses all such financial information for performance assessment and resource allocation decisions. The CODM evaluates the performance of and allocates resources to the Reportable Segments based on profit or loss before income taxes and cash generated from operations. The accounting policies of the Reportable Segments are the same as those described in

Note 1

of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.

The Americas Group

The Americas Group consisted of

4,758

company-operated specialty paint stores in the United States, Canada, Latin America and the Caribbean region at

December 31, 2019

. Each store in this segment is engaged in servicing the needs of architectural and industrial paint contractors and do-it-yourself homeowners. The Americas Group company-operated stores market and sell Sherwin-Williams

®

and other controlled brand architectural paint and coatings, protective and marine products, OEM product finishes and related products. The majority of these products are produced by manufacturing facilities in the Consumer Brands Group. In addition, each store sells select purchased associated products. In addition to our stores in the Latin America region, The Americas Group meets regional customer demands through developing, licensing, manufacturing, distributing and selling a variety of architectural paints, coatings and related products in North and South America. The loss of any single customer would not have a material adverse effect on the business of this segment. At

December 31, 2019

, The Americas Group consisted of operations from subsidiaries in


foreign countries. During


, this segment opened


net new stores, consisting of


new stores opened (


in the United States,


in Canada, and


in South America) and


stores closed (


in the United States,


in South America and


in Mexico). In


and


, this segment opened


and


net new stores, respectively. The CODM uses discrete financial information about The Americas Group, supplemented with information by geographic region, product type and customer type, to assess performance of and allocate resources to The Americas Group as a whole. In accordance with ASC 280-10-50-9, The Americas Group as a whole is considered the operating segment, and because it meets the criteria in ASC 280-10-50-10, it is also considered a Reportable Segment.



Consumer Brands Group

The Consumer Brands Group supplies a broad portfolio of branded and private-label architectural paint, stains, varnishes, industrial products, wood finishes products, wood preservatives, applicators, corrosion inhibitors, aerosols, caulks and adhesives to retailers and distributors throughout North America, as well as in Australia, New Zealand, China and Europe. The Consumer Brands Group also supports the Company's other businesses around the world with new product research and development, manufacturing, distribution and logistics. Approximately

57%

of the total sales of the Consumer Brands Group in


were intersegment transfers of products primarily sold through The Americas Group. At

December 31, 2019

, the Consumer Brands Group consisted of operations in the United States and subsidiaries in


foreign countries, including company-operated outlets in Australia and New Zealand. Sales and marketing of certain controlled brand and private-label products is performed by a direct sales staff. The products distributed through third-party customers are intended for resale to the ultimate end-user of the product. The Consumer Brands Group had sales to certain customers that, individually, may be a significant portion of the sales of the segment. However, the loss of any single customer would not have a material adverse effect on the overall profitability of the segment. This segment incurred most of the Company’s capital expenditures related to ongoing environmental compliance measures at sites currently in operation. The CODM uses discrete financial information about the Consumer Brands Group, supplemented with information by product type and customer type, to assess performance of and allocate resources to the Consumer Brands Group as a whole. In accordance with ASC 280-10-50-9, the Consumer Brands Group as a whole is considered the operating segment, and because it meets the criteria in ASC 280-10-50-10, it is also considered a Reportable Segment.

Performance Coatings Group

The Performance Coatings Group develops and sells industrial coatings for wood finishing and general industrial (metal and plastic) applications, automotive refinish, protective and marine coatings, coil coatings, packaging coatings and performance-based resins and colorants worldwide. This segment licenses certain technology and trade names worldwide. Sherwin-Williams

®

and other controlled brand products are distributed through The Americas Group and this segment’s


company-operated branches and by a direct sales staff and outside sales representatives to retailers, dealers, jobbers, licensees and other third-party distributors. The Performance Coatings Group had sales to certain customers that, individually, may be a significant portion of the sales of the segment. However, the loss of any single customer would not have a material adverse effect on the overall profitability of the segment. During


, this segment opened


new branches and closed


branches for a net decrease of


branch. At

December 31, 2019

, the Performance Coatings Group consisted of operations in the United States and subsidiaries in


foreign countries. The CODM uses discrete financial information about the Performance Coatings Group, supplemented with information about geographic divisions, business units and subsidiaries, to assess performance of and allocate resources to the Performance Coatings Group as a whole. In accordance with ASC 280-10-50-9, the Performance Coatings Group as a whole is considered the operating segment, and because it meets the criteria in ASC 280-10-50-10, it is also considered a Reportable Segment.

Administrative Segment

The Administrative segment includes the administrative expenses of the Company’s corporate headquarters site. Also included in the Administrative segment is interest expense, interest and investment income, certain expenses related to closed facilities and environmental-related matters, and other expenses which are not directly associated with the Reportable Segments. The Administrative segment does not include any significant foreign operations. Also included in the Administrative segment is a real estate management unit that is responsible for the ownership, management, and leasing of non-retail properties held primarily for use by the Company, including the Company’s headquarters site, and disposal of idle facilities. Sales of this segment represent external leasing revenue of excess headquarters space or leasing of facilities no longer used by the Company in its primary businesses. Material gains and losses from the sale of property are infrequent and not a significant operating factor in determining the performance of the Administrative segment.

Raw Materials and Products Purchased for Resale

We believe we generally have adequate sources of raw materials and fuel supplies used in our business. There are sufficient suppliers of each product purchased for resale that none of the Reportable Segments anticipate any significant sourcing problems during


. See Item 1A Risk Factors for more information regarding cost and sourcing of raw materials.

Seasonality

The majority of the sales for the Reportable Segments traditionally occur during the second and third quarters. There is no significant seasonality in sales for the Administrative segment.

Working Capital

In order to meet increased demand during the second and third quarters, the Company usually builds its inventories during the first quarter. Working capital items (inventories and accounts receivable) are generally financed through short-term borrowings, which include the use of lines of credit and the issuance of commercial paper. For a description of the Company’s liquidity and capital resources, see the “Financial Condition, Liquidity and Cash Flow” section in Item 7.

Backlog and Productive Capacity

Backlog orders are not significant in the business of any Reportable Segment since there is normally a short period of time between the placing of an order and shipment. We believe that sufficient productive capacity currently exists to fulfill our needs for paint, coatings and related products through


.

Competition

We experience competition from many local, regional, national and international competitors of various sizes in the manufacture, distribution and sale of our paint, coatings and related products. We are a leading manufacturer and retailer of paint, coatings and related products to professional, industrial, commercial and retail customers, however, our competitive position varies for our different products and markets.

In The Americas Group, competitors include other paint and wallpaper stores, mass merchandisers, home centers, independent hardware stores, hardware chains and manufacturer-operated direct outlets. Product quality, product innovation, breadth of product line, technical expertise, service and price determine the competitive advantage for this segment.

In the Consumer Brands Group, domestic and foreign competitors include manufacturers and distributors of branded and private-label paint and coatings products. Technology, product quality, product innovation, breadth of product line, technical expertise, distribution, service and price are the key competitive factors for this segment.

The Performance Coatings Group has numerous competitors in its domestic and foreign markets with broad product offerings and several others with niche products. Key competitive factors for this segment include technology, product quality, product innovation, breadth of product line, technical expertise, distribution, service and price.

The Administrative segment has many competitors consisting of other real estate owners, developers and managers in areas in which this segment owns property. The main competitive factors are the availability of property and price.

•

our ability to successfully integrate past and future acquisitions into our existing operations, as well as the performance of the businesses acquired;

•

competitive factors, including pricing pressures and product innovation and quality;

•

our ability to attain cost savings from productivity initiatives;

•

risks and uncertainties associated with our expansion into and our operations in Asia, Europe, South America and other foreign markets, including general economic conditions, inflation rates, recessions, foreign currency exchange rates, foreign investment and repatriation restrictions, legal and regulatory constraints, civil unrest and other external economic and political factors;

•

the achievement of growth in foreign markets, such as Asia, Europe and South America;

•

increasingly stringent domestic and foreign governmental regulations, including those affecting health, safety and the environment;

•

inherent uncertainties involved in assessing our potential liability for environmental-related activities;

•

other changes in governmental policies, laws and regulations, including changes in tariff policies, as well as changes in accounting policies and standards and taxation requirements (such as new tax laws and new or revised tax law interpretations);

•

the nature, cost, quantity and outcome of pending and future litigation and other claims, including the lead pigment and lead-based paint litigation, and the effect of any legislation and administrative regulations relating thereto; and

•

adverse weather conditions or impacts of climate change, natural disasters and public health crises.

Readers are cautioned that it is not possible to predict or identify all of the risks, uncertainties and other factors that may affect future results and that the above list should not be considered to be a complete list. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made, and we undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise except as otherwise required by law.

ITEM 1A.    RISK FACTORS

The risks described below and in other documents we file from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flow, liquidity or financial condition.

Adverse changes in general business and economic conditions in the United States and worldwide may adversely affect our results of operations, cash flow, liquidity or financial condition.

Our business is sensitive to global and regional business and economic conditions. Adverse changes in such conditions in the United States and worldwide may reduce the demand for some of our products and impair the ability of those with whom we do business to satisfy their obligations to us, each of which could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flow, liquidity or financial condition. Higher inflation rates, interest rates, tax rates and unemployment rates, higher labor and healthcare costs, recessions, changing governmental policies, laws and regulations, business disruptions due to cybersecurity incidents, terrorist activity, armed conflict, war, public health crises, fires or other natural disasters, and other economic factors could also adversely affect demand for some of our products, availability and cost of raw materials and our results of operations, cash flow, liquidity or financial condition and that of our customers, vendors and suppliers.



A weakening or reversal of the general economic recovery in the United States and other countries and regions in which we do business, or the continuation or worsening of economic downturns in other countries and regions, may adversely affect our results of operations, cash flow, liquidity or financial condition.

Global economic uncertainty continues to exist. A weakening or reversal of the general economic recovery in the United States and other countries and regions in which we do business, or the continuation or worsening of economic downturns in other countries and regions, may adversely impact our net sales, the collection of accounts receivable, funding for working capital needs, expected cash flow generation from current and acquired businesses, and our investments, which may adversely impact our results of operations, cash flow, liquidity or financial condition.

We finance a portion of our sales through trade credit. Credit markets remain tight, and some customers who require financing for their businesses have not been able to obtain necessary financing. A continuation or worsening of these conditions could limit our ability to collect our accounts receivable, which could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flow, liquidity or financial condition.

We generally fund a portion of our seasonal working capital needs and obtain funding for other general corporate purposes through short-term borrowings backed by our revolving credit facility and other financing facilities. If any of the banks in these credit and financing facilities are unable to perform on their commitments, such inability could adversely impact our cash flow, liquidity or financial condition, including our ability to obtain funding for working capital needs and other general corporate purposes.

Although we currently have available credit facilities to fund our current operating needs, we cannot be certain we will be able to replace our existing credit facilities or refinance our existing or future debt when necessary. Our cost of borrowing and ability to access the capital markets are affected not only by market conditions, but also by our debt and credit ratings assigned by the major credit rating agencies. Downgrades in these ratings will increase our cost of borrowing and could have an adverse effect on our access to the capital markets, including our access to the commercial paper market. An inability to access the capital markets could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flow, liquidity or financial condition.

We have goodwill and intangible assets recorded on our balance sheet. We periodically evaluate the recoverability of the carrying value of our goodwill and intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate such value may not be recoverable. An impairment assessment involves judgment as to assumptions regarding future sales and cash flow and the impact of market conditions on those assumptions. Future events and changing market conditions may impact our assumptions and change our estimates of future sales and cash flow, resulting in us incurring substantial impairment charges, which would adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.

We hold investments in equity and debt securities in some of our defined benefit pension plans. A decrease in the value of plan assets resulting from a general financial downturn may cause a negative pension plan investment performance, which may adversely affect our results of operations, cash flow, liquidity or financial condition.

Protracted duration of economic downturns in cyclical segments of the economy may depress the demand for some of our products and adversely affect our sales, earnings, cash flow or financial condition.

Portions of our business involve the sale of paint, coatings and related products to segments of the economy that are cyclical in nature, particularly segments relating to construction, housing, manufacturing and oil production, refining, storage and transportation. Our sales to these segments are affected by the levels of discretionary consumer and business spending in these segments. During economic downturns in these segments, the levels of consumer and business discretionary spending may decrease, and the recovery of these segments may lag behind the recovery of the overall economy. This decrease in spending will likely reduce the demand for some of our products and may adversely affect our sales, earnings, cash flow or financial condition.

Although interest rates remain low by historical standards, any increase may adversely affect the demand for new residential homes, existing home turnover and new non-residential construction. A worsening in these segments will reduce the demand for some of our products and may adversely impact sales, earnings and cash flow.

In the U.S. construction and housing segments, the recent demand for new construction has caused contractors to experience a shortage of skilled workers, resulting in project backlogs and an adverse effect on the growth rate of demand for our products. While we expect to see higher demand for our products as project backlogs are reduced in the future, this labor shortage may adversely impact our sales, earnings, cash flow or financial condition.

Increases in the cost of raw materials and energy may adversely affect our earnings or cash flow.

We purchase raw materials (including titanium dioxide and petrochemical feedstock sources, such as propylene and ethylene) and energy for use in the manufacturing, distribution and sale of our products. Factors such as political instability, higher tariffs and adverse weather conditions, including hurricanes, and other natural disasters can disrupt raw material and fuel supplies and increase our costs. In addition, environmental and social regulations, including regulations related to climate change, may negatively impact us or our suppliers in terms of availability and cost of raw materials, as well as sources and supply of energy. Although raw materials and energy supplies (including oil and natural gas) are generally available from various sources in sufficient quantities, unexpected



shortages and increases in the cost of raw materials and energy, or any deterioration in our relationships with or the financial viability of our suppliers, may have an adverse effect on our earnings or cash flow in the event we are unable to offset higher costs in a timely manner by sufficiently decreasing our operating costs or raising the prices of our products. In recent years, some raw material and energy prices have increased, particularly titanium dioxide and petrochemical feedstock sources, such as propylene and ethylene, as well as metal and plastic packaging. The cost of raw materials and energy has in the past experienced, and likely will in the future continue to experience, periods of volatility.

Although we have an extensive customer base, the loss of any of our largest customers could adversely affect our sales, earnings or cash flow.

We have a large and varied customer base due to our extensive distribution network. During


, no individual customer accounted for sales totaling more than ten percent of our sales. However, we have some customers that, individually, purchase a large amount of products from us. Although our broad distribution channels help to minimize the impact of the loss of any one customer, the loss of any of these large customers could have an adverse effect on our sales, earnings or cash flow.

Increased competition may reduce our sales, earnings or cash flow performance.

We face substantial competition from many international, national, regional and local competitors of various sizes in the manufacture, distribution and sale of our paint, coatings and related products. Some of our competitors are larger than us and have greater financial resources to compete. Other competitors are smaller and may be able to offer more specialized products. Technology, product quality, product innovation, breadth of product line, technical expertise, distribution, service and price are the key competitive factors for our business. Competition in any of these areas may reduce our sales and adversely affect our earnings or cash flow by resulting in decreased sales volumes, reduced prices and increased costs of manufacturing, distributing and selling our products.

We require a significant amount of cash to service the substantial amount of debt we have outstanding. Our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control. We also depend on the business of our subsidiaries to satisfy our cash needs. If we cannot generate the required cash, we may not be able to make the necessary payments required under our indebtedness.

At

December 31, 2019

, we had total debt of approximately

$8.7 billion

, which is

a decrease

of

$658.5 million

since

December 31, 2018

. We have the ability under our existing credit facilities to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. Our ability to make payments on our debt, fund our other liquidity needs, and make planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. Our historical financial results have been, and we anticipate our future financial results will be, subject to fluctuations. Our ability to generate cash, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors beyond our control. We cannot guarantee our business will generate sufficient cash flow from our operations or future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to make payments of our debt, fund other liquidity needs and make planned capital expenditures.

The degree to which we are currently leveraged could have important consequences for shareholders. For example, it could:

•

require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of debt service, reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes;

•

increase our vulnerability to adverse economic or industry conditions;

•

limit our ability to obtain additional financing in the future to enable us to react to changes in our business; or

•

place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to businesses in our industry that have less debt.

Additionally, any failure to comply with covenants in the instruments governing our debt could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, would have a material adverse effect on us.

A significant portion of our operations are conducted through our subsidiaries. As a result, our ability to generate sufficient cash flow for our needs is dependent to some extent on the earnings of our subsidiaries and the payment of those earnings to us in the form of dividends, loans or advances and through repayment of loans or advances from us. Our subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities. Our subsidiaries have no obligation to pay any amounts due on our debt or to provide us with funds to meet our cash flow needs, whether in the form of dividends, distributions, loans or other payments. In addition, any payment of dividends, loans or advances by our subsidiaries could be subject to statutory or contractual restrictions. Payments to us by our subsidiaries will also be contingent upon our subsidiaries’ earnings and business considerations. Our right to receive any assets of any of our subsidiaries upon their liquidation or reorganization will be effectively subordinated to the claims of that subsidiary’s creditors, including trade creditors. In addition, even if we are a creditor of any of our subsidiaries, our rights as a creditor would be subordinate to any security interest in the assets of our subsidiaries and any indebtedness of our subsidiaries senior to that held by us. Finally, changes in the laws of foreign jurisdictions in which we operate may adversely affect the ability of some of our foreign subsidiaries to repatriate funds to us.



Our results of operations, cash flow or financial condition may be negatively impacted if we do not successfully integrate future acquisitions into our existing operations and if the performance of the businesses we acquire do not meet our expectations.

We have historically made strategic acquisitions of businesses in the paint and coatings industry and will likely acquire additional businesses in the future as part of our long-term growth strategy. The success of future acquisitions depends in large part on our ability to integrate the operations and personnel of the acquired companies and manage challenges that may arise as a result of the acquisitions, particularly when the acquired businesses operate in new or foreign markets. In the event we do not successfully integrate such future acquisitions into our existing operations so as to realize the expected return on our investment, our results of operations, cash flow or financial condition could be adversely affected.

Risks and uncertainties associated with our expansion into and our operations in Asia, Europe, South America and other foreign markets could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flow, liquidity or financial condition.

Net external sales of our consolidated foreign subsidiaries totaled approximately

20.6%

,

23.0%

and

19.8%

of our total consolidated net sales in


,


and


, respectively. Sales outside of the United States make up a significant part of our current business and future strategic plans. Our results of operations, cash flow, liquidity or financial condition could be adversely affected by a variety of domestic and international factors, including general economic conditions, political instability, inflation rates, recessions, tariffs, foreign currency exchange rates, foreign currency exchange controls, interest rates, foreign investment and repatriation restrictions, legal and regulatory constraints, civil unrest, difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations and other external economic and political factors. In addition, public health crises (including viral outbreaks, such as the coronavirus) in foreign jurisdictions may temporarily reduce the demand for some of our products and adversely affect the availability and cost of raw materials. Our inability to successfully manage the risks and uncertainties relating to any of these factors could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flow, liquidity or financial condition.

In many foreign countries, it is acceptable to engage in certain business practices we are prohibited from engaging in because of regulations applicable to us, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the UK Bribery Act. Recent years have seen a substantial increase in anti-bribery law enforcement activity, with more frequent and aggressive investigations and enforcement proceedings by both U.S. and non-U.S. regulators, and an increase in criminal and civil proceedings brought against companies and individuals. Although we have internal control policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these regulations, there can be no assurance our policies and procedures will prevent a violation of these regulations. Any violation could cause an adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flow or financial condition.

Policy changes affecting international trade could adversely impact the demand for our products and our competitive position.

Due to the international scope of our operations, changes in government policies on foreign trade and investment may affect the demand for our products and services, impact the competitive position of our products or prevent us from being able to sell products in certain countries. Our business benefits from free trade agreements, which may include the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, and efforts to withdraw from, or substantially modify such agreements, in addition to the implementation of more restrictive trade policies, such as more detailed inspections, higher tariffs, import or export licensing requirements, exchange controls or new barriers to entry, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flow and that of our customers, vendors and suppliers.

Additionally, the results of the United Kingdom’s referendum on European Union membership, which resulted in the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union on January 31, 2020, has caused and may continue to cause significant volatility in global stock markets, currency exchange rate fluctuations and global economic uncertainty. Although it is unknown what the terms of the United Kingdom’s future relationship with the European Union will be, it is possible there will be greater restrictions on imports and exports between the United Kingdom and the European Union and increased regulatory complexities. Any of these factors could adversely impact customer demand, our relationships with customers and suppliers and our results of operations.

Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flow, liquidity or financial condition.

Because of our international operations, we are exposed to risk associated with interest rates and value changes in foreign currencies, which may adversely affect our business. Historically, our reported net sales, earnings, cash flow and financial condition have been subjected to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. Our primary exchange rate exposure is with the Euro, the Chinese yuan, the Brazilian real, the Canadian dollar, the British pound, the Mexican peso, the Australian dollar and the Argentine peso, each against the U.S. dollar. While we actively manage the exposure of our foreign currency risk as part of our overall financial risk management policy, we believe we may experience losses from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, and such losses could adversely affect our sales, earnings, cash flow, liquidity or financial condition.

We are subject to a wide variety of complex domestic and foreign laws, rules and regulations, for which compliance could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flow or financial condition.

We are subject to a wide variety of complex domestic and foreign laws, rules and regulations, and legal compliance risks, including securities laws, tax laws, employment and pension-related laws, competition laws, U.S. and foreign export and trading laws, data



privacy and security laws, and laws governing improper business practices. We are affected by new laws and regulations, and changes to existing laws and regulations, including interpretations by courts and regulators. From time to time, our Company, our operations and the industries in which we operate are being reviewed or investigated by regulators, which could lead to enforcement actions or the assertion of private litigation claims and damages.

Although we believe we have adopted appropriate risk management and compliance programs to mitigate these risks, the global and diverse nature of our operations means compliance risks will continue to exist. Investigations, examinations and other proceedings, the nature and outcome of which cannot be predicted, will likely arise from time to time. These investigations, examinations and other proceedings could subject us to significant liability and require us to take significant accruals or pay significant settlements, fines and penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flow or financial condition.

We are subject to tax laws and regulations in the United States and multiple foreign jurisdictions. We are affected by changes in tax laws and regulations, as well as changes in related interpretations and other tax guidance. In the ordinary course of our business, we are subject to examinations and investigations by various tax authorities and other regulators. In addition to existing examinations and investigations, there could be additional examinations and investigations in the future, and existing examinations and investigations could be expanded.

For non-income tax risks, we estimate material loss contingencies and accrue for such loss contingencies as required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles based on our assessment of contingencies where liability is deemed probable and reasonably estimable in light of the facts and circumstances known to us at a particular point in time. Subsequent developments may affect our assessment and estimates of the loss contingency. In the event the loss contingency is ultimately determined to be significantly higher than currently accrued, the recording of the additional liability may result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition for the annual or interim period during which such additional liability is accrued. In those cases where no accrual is recorded because it is not probable a liability has been incurred and cannot be reasonably estimated, any potential liability ultimately determined to be attributable to us may result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flow or financial condition for the annual or interim period during which such liability is accrued or paid. For income tax risks, we recognize tax benefits based on our assessment that a tax benefit has a greater than 50% likelihood of being sustained upon ultimate settlement with the applicable taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant facts. For those income tax positions where we determine there is not a greater than 50% likelihood such tax benefits will be sustained, we do not recognize a tax benefit in our financial statements. Subsequent events may cause us to change our assessment of the likelihood of sustaining a previously-recognized benefit which could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flow or financial position for the annual or interim period during which such liability is accrued or paid.

We discuss risks and uncertainties with regard to taxes in more detail in

Note 19

to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.

Adverse weather conditions or impacts of climate change and natural disasters may temporarily reduce the demand for some of our products and could have a negative effect on our sales, earnings or cash flow.

Our business is seasonal in nature, with the second and third quarters typically generating a higher proportion of sales and earnings than other quarters. From time to time, adverse weather conditions or impacts of climate change and natural disasters have had or may have an adverse effect on our sales of paint, coatings and related products. In addition, unusually cold and rainy weather could have an adverse effect on sales of our exterior paint products. An adverse effect on sales may cause a reduction in our earnings or cash flow.

Inability to protect or enforce our material trademarks and other intellectual property rights could have an adverse effect on our business.

We have numerous patents, trade secrets, trademarks, trade names and know-how that are valuable to our business. Despite our efforts to protect such intellectual property and other proprietary information from unauthorized use or disclosure, third parties may attempt to disclose, obtain or use our trademarks or such other intellectual property and information without our authorization. Although we rely on the patent, trademark, trade secret and copyright laws of the United States and other countries to protect our intellectual property rights, the laws of some countries may not protect such rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Unauthorized use of our intellectual property by third parties, the failure of foreign countries to have laws to protect our intellectual property rights, or an inability to effectively enforce such rights in foreign countries could have an adverse effect on our business.

Security breaches and other disruptions to our information technology infrastructure could interfere with our operations, compromise our information and the information of our customers and suppliers and severely harm our business.

As part of our business, we collect, process, and retain sensitive and confidential personal information about our customers, employees and suppliers. Despite the security measures we have in place, our facilities and systems, and those of the retailers, dealers, licensees and other third-party suppliers and vendors with which we do business, may be vulnerable to security breaches,



cyber attacks, acts of vandalism or misconduct, computer viruses, ransomware, misplaced or lost data, programming and/or human errors or other similar events or intrusions. Any security breach involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of confidential customer, employee, supplier or Company information, whether caused by us, an unknown third party, or the retailers, dealers, licensees or other third-party suppliers and vendors with which we do business, could result in losses, severely damage our reputation, expose us to the risks of litigation and liability, disrupt our operations and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. As cyber security threats evolve in sophistication and become more prevalent in numerous industries worldwide, we continue to increase our sensitivity and attention to these threats, seek additional investments and resources to address these threats and enhance the security of our facilities and systems and strengthen our controls and procedures implemented to monitor and mitigate these threats. The domestic and international regulatory environment related to information security, data collection and privacy is increasingly rigorous and complex, with new and constantly changing requirements applicable to our business. Compliance with these requirements, including the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation and other domestic and international regulations, could result in additional costs and changes to our business practices.

Moreover, we rely heavily on computer systems to manage and operate our business, record and process transactions, and manage, support and communicate with our employees, customers, suppliers and other vendors. Computer systems are important to production planning, manufacturing, finance, company operations and customer service, among other business-critical processes. Despite efforts to prevent disruptions to our computer systems, our systems may be affected by damage or interruption from, among other causes, power outages, system failures, computer viruses and other intrusions, including ransomware and other cyber attacks. Computer hardware and storage equipment that is integral to efficient operations, such as email, telephone and other functionality, is concentrated in certain physical locations in the various continents in which we operate. Additionally, we rely on software applications, enterprise cloud storage systems and cloud computing services provided by third-party vendors. If these third-party vendors, as well as our suppliers and other vendors, experience security breaches, cyber attacks, computer viruses, ransomware or other similar events or intrusions, our business may be adversely affected and such events or intrusions may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

We are required to comply with numerous complex and increasingly stringent domestic and foreign health, safety and environmental laws and regulations, the cost of which is likely to increase and may adversely affect our results of operations, cash flow or financial condition.

Our operations are subject to various domestic and foreign health, safety and environmental laws and regulations, including laws and regulations related to climate change. These laws and regulations not only govern our current operations and products, but also impose potential liability on us for our past operations. We expect health, safety and environmental laws and regulations to impose increasingly stringent requirements upon our industry and us in the future. Our costs to comply with these laws and regulations may increase as these requirements become more stringent in the future, and these increased costs may adversely affect our results of operations, cash flow or financial condition.

We are involved with environmental investigation and remediation activities at some of our currently and formerly owned sites, as well as a number of third-party sites, for which our ultimate liability may exceed the current amount we have accrued.

We are involved with environmental investigation and remediation activities at some of our currently and formerly owned sites and a number of third-party sites. We accrue for estimated costs of investigation and remediation activities at these sites for which commitments or clean-up plans have been developed and when such costs can be reasonably estimated based on industry standards and professional judgment. These estimated costs are based on currently available facts regarding each site. We continuously assess our potential liability for investigation and remediation activities and adjust our environmental-related accruals as information becomes available upon which more accurate costs can be reasonably estimated. Due to the uncertainties surrounding environmental investigation and remediation activities, our liability may result in costs that are significantly higher than currently accrued and may have an adverse effect on our earnings. We discuss these risks and uncertainties in more detail in the "Environmental Matters" and "Environmental-Related Liabilities" sections in Item 7 and in

Note 10

to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.

The nature, cost, quantity and outcome of pending and future litigation, such as litigation arising from the historical manufacture and sale of lead pigments and lead-based paint, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flow, liquidity and financial condition.

In the course of our business, we are subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits, including, but not limited to, litigation relating to product liability and warranty, personal injury, environmental, intellectual property, commercial, contractual and antitrust claims that are inherently subject to many uncertainties regarding the possibility of a loss to us. These uncertainties will ultimately be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur confirming the incurrence of a liability or the reduction of a liability. In accordance with the Contingencies Topic of the ASC, we accrue for these contingencies by a charge to income when it is both probable that one or more future events will occur confirming the fact of a loss and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. In the event a loss contingency is ultimately determined to be significantly higher than currently accrued, the recording



of the additional liability may result in a material impact on our results of operations, liquidity or financial condition for the annual or interim period during which such additional liability is accrued. In those cases where no accrual is recorded because it is not probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of any such loss cannot be reasonably estimated, any potential liability ultimately determined to be attributable to us may result in a material impact on our results of operations, liquidity or financial condition for the annual or interim period during which such liability is accrued.

Our past operations included the manufacture and sale of lead pigments and lead-based paints. Along with other companies, we are and have been a defendant in a number of legal proceedings, including individual personal injury actions, purported class actions and actions brought by various counties, cities, school districts and other government-related entities, arising from the manufacture and sale of lead pigments and lead-based paints. The plaintiffs' claims have been based upon various legal theories, including negligence, strict liability, breach of warranty, negligent misrepresentations and omissions, fraudulent misrepresentations and omissions, concert of action, civil conspiracy, violations of unfair trade practice and consumer protection laws, enterprise liability, market share liability, public nuisance, unjust enrichment and other theories. The plaintiffs seek various damages and relief, including personal injury and property damage, costs relating to the detection and abatement of lead-based paint from buildings, costs associated with a public education campaign, medical monitoring costs and others. We have also been a defendant in legal proceedings arising from the manufacture and sale of non-lead-based paints that seek recovery based upon various legal theories, including the failure to adequately warn of potential exposure to lead during surface preparation when using non-lead-based paint on surfaces previously painted with lead-based paint. We believe the litigation brought to date is without merit or subject to meritorious defenses and are vigorously defending such litigation. We have not settled any material lead pigment or lead-based paint litigation. We expect additional lead pigment and lead-based paint litigation may be filed against us in the future asserting similar or different legal theories and seeking similar or different types of damages and relief.

Notwithstanding our views on the merits, litigation is inherently subject to many uncertainties, and we ultimately may not prevail. Adverse court rulings or determinations of liability, among other factors, could affect the lead pigment and lead-based paint litigation against us and encourage an increase in the number and nature of future claims and proceedings. In addition, from time to time, various legislation and administrative regulations have been enacted, promulgated or proposed to impose obligations on present and former manufacturers of lead pigments and lead-based paints respecting asserted health concerns associated with such products or to overturn the effect of court decisions in which we and other manufacturers have been successful.

Due to the uncertainties involved, management is unable to predict the outcome of the lead pigment and lead-based paint litigation, the number or nature of possible future claims and proceedings, or the effect any legislation and/or administrative regulations may have on the litigation or against us. In addition, management cannot reasonably determine the scope or amount of the potential costs and liabilities related to such litigation, or resulting from any such legislation and regulations. Except with respect to the litigation in California, we have not accrued any amounts for such litigation because we do not believe it is probable that a loss has occurred, and we believe it is not possible to estimate the range of potential losses as there is no substantive information upon which an estimate could be based. In addition, any potential liability that may result from any changes to legislation and regulations cannot reasonably be estimated. In the event any significant liability is determined to be attributable to us relating to such litigation, or any such liability is higher than any amount currently accrued for such litigation, the recording of the liability, or additional liability, as applicable, may result in a material impact on net income for the annual or interim period during which such liability is accrued. Additionally, due to the uncertainties associated with the amount of any such liability and/or the nature of any other remedy which may be imposed in such litigation, any potential liability determined to be attributable to us arising out of such litigation may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flow, liquidity or financial condition. We discuss the risks and uncertainties related to litigation, including the lead pigment and lead-based paint litigation, in more detail in

Note 11

ITEM 3.    LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

As previously disclosed in the Company’s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company received a letter dated September 26, 2018 from the South Coast Air Quality Management District (“SCAQMD”) in California alleging excess emissions from non-compliant coatings and seeking a proposed penalty of approximately $1.5 million.  Settlement discussions regarding this matter have been unsuccessful to date, and SCAQMD filed a civil Complaint against the Company on November 30, 2018 in the Superior Court of California seeking civil penalties, costs and injunctive relief including an initial demand of $30 million. The Company disputes the allegations in the Complaint and intends to vigorously defend this matter, if a mutually agreeable settlement cannot be reached.

In addition, as previously disclosed in the Company’s Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2019, on April 4, 2019, SCAQMD notified the Company of its position that the Company was engaging in non-compliant sales of denatured alcohol.

(11)

See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for additional information.



Non-GAAP Financial Measures

Management utilizes certain financial measures that are not in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (US GAAP) to analyze and manage the performance of the business. The required disclosures for these non-GAAP measures are shown below. The Company provides such non-GAAP information in reporting its financial results to give investors additional data to evaluate the Company's operations. Management does not, nor does it suggest investors should, consider such non-GAAP measures in isolation from, or in substitution for, financial information prepared in accordance with US GAAP.

EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA

EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure defined as net income from continuing operations before income taxes and interest, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes the Valspar acquisition and other adjustments. Management considers EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA useful in understanding the operating performance of the Company. The reader is cautioned that the Company's EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be compared to other entities unknowingly. Further, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered alternatives to Net income or Net operating cash as an indicator of operating performance or as a measure of liquidity. The reader should refer to the determination of Net income and Net operating cash in accordance with US GAAP disclosed in the Statements of Consolidated Income and Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows in Item 8.

The following table summarizes EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as calculated by management for the years indicated below:

Free Cash Flow

Free Cash Flow is a non-GAAP financial measure defined as Net operating cash, as shown in the Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows, less the amount reinvested in the business for Capital expenditures and the return of investment to its shareholders by the payment of cash dividends. Management considers Free Cash Flow to be a useful tool in its determination of appropriate uses of the Company’s Net operating cash. The reader is cautioned that the Free Cash Flow measure should not be compared to other entities unknowingly as it may not be comparable, and it does not consider certain non-discretionary cash flows, such as mandatory debt and interest payments. The amount shown below should not be considered an alternative to Net operating cash or other cash flow amounts provided in accordance with US GAAP as disclosed in the Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows in Item 8.

The following table summarizes Free Cash Flow as calculated by management for the years indicated below:



Adjusted Diluted Net Income Per Share

Management of the Company believes that investors' understanding of the Company's operating performance is enhanced by the disclosure of diluted net income per share excluding Valspar acquisition-related costs and other adjustments. This adjusted earnings per share measurement is not in accordance with US GAAP. It should not be considered a substitute for earnings per share in accordance with US GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.

The following tables reconcile diluted net income per share computed in accordance with US GAAP to adjusted diluted net income per share.

(1)

Integration costs consist primarily of professional service expenses, salaries and other employee-related expenses dedicated directly to the integration effort, and severance expense. These costs are included in Selling, general and administrative and other expenses and Cost of goods sold.

(2)

Acquisition-related amortization expense consists primarily of the amortization of intangible assets related to the Valspar acquisition and is included in Amortization.

(3)

The tax effect is calculated based on the statutory rate and the nature of the item, unless otherwise noted.



Adjusted Segment Profit

Management of the Company believes that investors' understanding of the Company's operating performance is enhanced by the disclosure of segment profit excluding Valspar acquisition-related costs and other adjustments. This adjusted segment profit measurement is not in accordance with US GAAP. It should not be considered a substitute for segment profit in accordance with US GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. The following tables reconcile segment profit computed in accordance with US GAAP to adjusted segment profit.

(1)

Integration costs consist primarily of professional service expenses, salaries and other employee-related expenses dedicated directly to the integration effort, and severance expense. These costs are included in Selling, general and administrative and other expenses and Cost of goods sold.

(2)

Acquisition-related amortization expense consists primarily of the amortization of intangible assets related to the Valspar acquisition and is included in Amortization.

ITEM 7.    MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

(dollars in millions, except as noted and per share data)

Company Background

The Sherwin-Williams Company, founded in 1866, and its consolidated wholly owned subsidiaries (collectively, the Company) are engaged in the development, manufacture, distribution and sale of paint, coatings and related products to professional, industrial, commercial and retail customers primarily in North and South America with additional operations in the Caribbean region and throughout Europe, Asia and Australia.

The Company is structured into

three

reportable segments – The Americas Group, Consumer Brands Group and Performance Coatings Group (collectively, the Reportable Segments) – and an Administrative segment in the same way it is internally organized for assessing performance and making decisions regarding allocation of resources. See Notes


and


to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for additional information regarding the Valspar acquisition and the Company's Reportable Segments, respectively.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The following discussion and analysis addresses comparisons of material changes in the consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31,


and


. For comparisons of the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, see Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Part II, Item 7 of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended

December 31, 2018

filed on February 22, 2019.

Consolidated net sales for


increased

due primarily to higher paint sales volume in The Americas Group and selling price increases. Currency translation rate changes

decreased


consolidated net sales by

1.4%

. Net sales of all consolidated foreign subsidiaries

decreased

8.7%

to $

3.679 billion

for


versus $

4.028 billion

for


due primarily to industrial market softness and macroeconomic pressures in China and Australia. Net sales of all operations other than consolidated foreign subsidiaries

increased

5.3%

to

$14.222 billion

for


versus

$13.507 billion

for


.

Net sales in The Americas Group

increased

due primarily to higher paint sales volume across most end market segments and selling price increases. Net sales from stores in U.S. and Canada open for more than twelve calendar months

increased

5.3%

in the year over last year's comparable period. Currency translation rate changes reduced net sales by

0.9%

compared to


. During


, The Americas Group opened


new stores and closed


redundant locations for a net

increase

of


stores,

increasing

the total number of stores in operation at

December 31, 2019

to

4,758

in the United States, Canada, Latin America and the Caribbean. The Americas Group’s objective is to expand its store base an average of 2% each year, primarily through internal growth. Sales of products other than paint

increased

approximately

5.9%

over last year. A discussion of changes in volume versus pricing for sales of products other than paint is not pertinent due to the wide assortment of general merchandise sold.

Net sales of the Consumer Brands Group

decreased

in


primarily due to the divestiture of the Guardsman insurance business and lower sales outside of North America in some end markets, partially offset by selling price increases and higher volume sales to some of the group's retail customers. In


, the Consumer Brands Group plans to continue promotions of new and existing products and expand its customer base and product assortment at existing customers.

The Performance Coatings Group’s net sales in


decreased

due primarily to softer sales outside of North America and unfavorable currency translation rate changes, partially offset by selling price increases. Currency translation rate changes

decreased

net sales

2.3%

compared to


. In


, the Performance Coatings Group opened


new branches and closed


locations decreasing the total from


to


branches open in the United States, Canada, Mexico, South America, Europe and Asia at



year-end. In


, the Performance Coatings Group plans to continue expanding its worldwide presence and improving its customer base.

Net sales in the Administrative segment, which primarily consists of external leasing revenue of excess headquarters space and leasing of facilities no longer used by the Company in its primary business,

decreased

by an insignificant amount in


.

Consolidated gross profit

increased

$617.5 million

in


compared to the same period in 2018. Consolidated gross profit as a percent to consolidated net sales

increased

to

44.9%

in 2019 from

42.3%

in


. Consolidated gross profit dollars and percent improved as a result of

higher paint sales volume in North American stores, selling price increases, improved supply chain efficiencies, moderating raw material costs, and lower acquisition-related amortization expense, partially offset by unfavorable currency translation rate changes. The Americas Group’s gross profit for


increased

$384.2 million

compared to the same period in


. The Americas Group's gross profit dollars and margin improved as a result of higher paint sales volume, selling price increases and moderating raw material costs. The Consumer Brands Group’s gross profit

increased

$125.5 million

in


compared to the same period in


. The Consumer Brands Group's gross profit dollars and margin improved due primarily to improved supply chain efficiencies, synergies, moderating raw material costs, and lower acquisition-related depreciation expense, partially offset by lower paint sales volume. The Performance Coatings Group’s gross profit for


increased

$51.3 million

compared to the same period in


.  The Performance Coatings Group's gross profit dollars and margin improved due primarily to selling price increases and moderating raw material costs, partially offset by unfavorable currency translation rate changes.

Consolidated SG&A

increased

by

$241.1 million

due primarily to increased expenses to support higher sales levels and net new store openings, partially offset by good cost control. SG&A

increased

as a percent of sales to

29.5%

in


from

28.7%

in


as a result of softer sales outside of North America. The Americas Group's SG&A

increased

$196.7 million

for the year due primarily to increased spending due to the number of new store openings and general comparable store expenses to support higher sales levels. The Consumer Brands Group’s SG&A

increased

by

$12.7 million

for the year primarily due to increased expenses to support new customer programs. The Performance Coatings Group’s SG&A

decreased

by

$0.9 million

for the year related to softer sales outside of North America. The Administrative segment’s SG&A

increased

$32.6 million

primarily due to increased investments in information systems and increased compensation, including stock-based compensation.

Other general expense - net

decreased

$150.0 million

in


compared to


. The

decrease

was mainly caused by

a decrease

of

$147.6 million

in the Administrative segment, which was primarily attributable to a

decrease

in expense recognized related to provisions for environmental matters. The expense recognized related to environmental provisions decreased

$153.3 million

from the prior year. This decrease was the result of the Company reaching a series of agreements in 2018 with the Environmental Protection Agency for remediation plans with cost estimates at one of the Company's four major sites which required significant environmental provisions to be recorded. See Notes


and


to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for additional information concerning environmental matters and

Other general expense - net

, respectively.

As required by the Goodwill and Other Intangibles Topic of the ASC, management performed an annual impairment test of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets as of October 1,


. During the fourth quarter of 2019, the Company recognized non-cash pre-tax impairment charges totaling

$122.1 million

related to recently acquired trademarks. These charges included impairments totaling

$117.0 million

in the Performance Coatings Group and

$5.1 million

in the Consumer Brands Group. In the Performance Coatings Group,

$75.6 million

related to trademarks in North America directly associated with strategic decisions made to rebrand industrial products to the Sherwin-Williams® brand name,

$25.7 million

related to trademarks in the Asia Pacific region as a direct result of recent performance which reduced the long-term forecasted net sales and

$15.7 million

related to other recently acquired trademarks in various regions. The impairment tests in


did not result in any impairment. See

Note 6

to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for additional information.

Interest expense

decreased

$17.4 million

in


primarily due to lower average debt levels. Interest and net investment income increased $20.7 million in


including an $18.8 million gain recognized during the fourth quarter of 2019 after the Company received a favorable court decision in Brazil related to the recovery of certain indirect taxes previously paid over gross sales. See Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for additional information on the Brazil indirect tax matter.

During


, the Company recognized a

$34.7 million

benefit from the resolution of the California public nuisance litigation as a result of the final court approved agreement issued during the third quarter of 2019. During the third quarter of


, the Company recognized expense of

$136.3 million

related to the California litigation. See

Note 11

to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for additional information related to the litigation.

Other expense (income) - net

decreased by

$3.4 million

in


compared to


. This change was primarily attributable to a

$38.7 million

gain related to the recognition of indirect tax credits partially offset by

$14.8 million

in losses related to the extinguishment of the 2.25% and 2.75% Senior Notes recorded in the Administrative segment and an increase of

$13.6 million

related to pension plan settlement and other miscellaneous pension expenses. In addition, foreign currency related transaction

losses

increased

$12.2 million

in


, primarily in The Americas Group and Performance Coatings Group, which were offset by



other miscellaneous sources of income, including dividend and royalty income. There were no other items within Other income or Other expense that were individually significant at

December 31, 2019

.  See Notes


,


and


to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for additional information related to debt, pensions and

Other expense (income) - net

, respectively.

Consolidated Income before income taxes in


increased

$622.1 million

to

$1.982 billion

, or

11.1%

of net sales, compared to

$1.360 billion

, or

7.8%

of net sales in


. Income before income taxes

increased

$158.1 million

and

$112.1 million

in The Americas Group and Consumer Brands Group, and

decreased

$73.0 million

in the Performance Coatings Group when compared to


. In


, the Administrative segment expenses favorably impacted Income before income taxes by

$424.9 million

when compared to


primarily due to lower expense recognized related to environmental matters, benefits from the resolution of the California litigation as well as a Brazil indirect tax credit, and decreased acquisition-related expenses.

The effective income tax rate for


was

22.2%

compared to

18.5%

in


. The increase in the effective rate in 2019 was primarily due to a

$74.3 million

tax credit investment loss recognized during the second quarter of 2019 related to the reversal of net tax benefits recognized in previous tax years from federal renewable energy tax credit funds. This loss negatively impacted the


effective tax rate by 370 basis points. See

Note 19

to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for additional information.

Diluted net income per share for


increased

to

$16.49

per share from

$11.67

per share for


. Diluted net income per share in


included charges for acquisition-related costs of

$3.21

per share and other adjustments totaling

$1.42

per share. Acquisition-related costs include integration costs (which primarily consist of professional service expenses, salaries and other employee-related expenses dedicated directly to the integration effort, and severance expenses all of which are included in Selling, general and administrative and other expenses and Cost of goods sold) and amortization of intangible assets recognized in the June 2017 acquisition of Valspar (included in Amortization). Total other adjustments included charges of

$1.00

per share for non-cash trademark impairment charges, a tax credit investment loss of

$0.79

per share and pension plan settlement expense of

$0.27

per share, partially offset by a Brazil indirect tax credit of

$0.36

per share and a benefit from the resolution of the California litigation of

$0.28

per share. Currency translation rate changes

decreased

diluted net income per share in the year by

$0.18

per share. Diluted net income per share in


included charges for acquisition-related costs of

$4.15

per share and other adjustments totaling

$2.71

per share. Total other adjustments in


included charges of

$1.32

per share for environmental expense provisions,

$1.09

per share for California litigation expense and

$0.30

per share for pension settlement expense.

FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CASH FLOW

Overview

The Company’s financial condition, liquidity and cash flow continued to be strong in 2019 as net operating cash

increased

to a record

$2.321 billion

primarily due to improved operating results as consolidated income from continuing operations before income taxes increased to

$1.982 billion

or

11.1%

of net sales. Strong net operating cash provided the funds necessary for the Company to invest

$406.2 million

in capital expenditures and acquisitions of businesses, reduce total debt by

$665.8 million

and return

$1.200 billion

to shareholders in the form of cash dividends and share buybacks during the year.

During 2019, the Company generated EBITDA from continuing operations of

$2.906 billion

. See the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section in Item 6 for definition and calculation of EBITDA. As of December 31, 2019, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of

$161.8 million

and total debt outstanding of

$8.685 billion

.  Total debt, net of cash and cash equivalents, was

$8.523 billion

and was less than 3x the Company’s EBITDA in 2019.

Net Working Capital

Total current assets less Total current liabilities (net working capital)

increased

$63.0 million

to a

surplus

of

$109.8 million

at

December 31, 2019

from a

surplus

of

$46.8 million

at

December 31, 2018

. The net working capital

increase

is due to an increase in current assets, partially offset by an increase in current liabilities primarily attributable to the recognition of operating lease



liabilities upon the adoption of the Leases Topic of the ASC (ASU 2016-02) as of January 1, 2019. Accounts receivable

increased

$70.1 million

, inventories

increased

$74.3 million

primarily due to intentional inventory build to better service customers, other current assets

increased

$136.5 million

primarily related to refundable income taxes and the surplus assets transferred from the Company's terminated domestic defined benefit pension plan as discussed in the deferred pension and other assets section below. In addition to the increase in liabilities as a result of adopting ASU 2016-02, Accounts payable

increased

$76.9 million

, partially offset by a

decrease

in the California litigation accrual of

$124.3 million

as a result of the terms of the settlement discussed in Note 11 of Item 8 and a

decrease

in Other accruals of

$152.0 million

due to timing of payments.

As a result of the net effect of these changes, the Company’s current ratio

improved

to

1.02

at

December 31, 2019

from

1.01

at

December 31, 2018

. Accounts receivable as a percent of Net sales

increased

to

11.7%

in


from

11.5%

in


. Accounts receivable days outstanding remained unchanged from


at


days in


. In


, provisions for allowance for doubtful collection of accounts

decreased

$9.4 million

, or

20.5%

. Inventories as a percent of Net sales

increased

to

10.6%

in


from

10.4%

in


primarily to support future growth. Inventory days outstanding remained unchanged from


at


days in


. The Company has sufficient total available borrowing capacity to fund its current operating needs.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets

Goodwill, which represents the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets acquired in purchase business combinations,

increased

$48.1 million

in


primarily due to incremental goodwill recognized in 2019 acquisitions of

$14.2 million

and foreign currency translation rate fluctuations of

$33.9 million

. Intangible assets

decreased

$467.1 million

in


primarily due to amortization of finite-lived intangible assets of

$312.8 million

, impairment of indefinite-lived trademarks of

$122.1 million

, and foreign currency translation rate fluctuations of

$70.4 million

, partially offset by finite-lived intangible assets recognized in 2019 acquisitions of

$34.9 million

. See

Note 6

to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for a description of goodwill, identifiable intangible assets and asset impairments recognized in accordance with the Goodwill and Other Intangibles Topic of the ASC and summaries of the remaining carrying values of goodwill and intangible assets.

Deferred Pension and Other Assets

Deferred pension assets of

$43.0 million

at

December 31, 2019

represent the excess of the fair value of assets over the actuarially determined projected benefit obligations. The

decrease

in Deferred pension assets during


of

$227.7 million

from

$270.7 million

last year was primarily due to the termination of the Company's domestic defined benefit pension plan. See

Note 8

to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 and the Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans section below.

Other assets

decreased

$22.6 million

to

$561.4 million

at

December 31, 2019

due primarily to a decrease in deferred tax assets.

Property, Plant and Equipment

Net property, plant and equipment

increased

$58.4 million

to

$1.835 billion

at

December 31, 2019

due primarily to capital expenditures of

$328.9 million

and assets acquired through business combinations of

$16.8 million

, partially offset by depreciation expense of

$262.1 million

and sale or disposition of assets with remaining net book value of

$37.5 million

. The remaining change of

$12.3 million

is attributable to currency translation and other adjustments. Capital expenditures during


in The Americas Group were primarily attributable to the opening of new paint stores and renovation and improvements in existing stores. In the Consumer Brands Group and the Performance Coatings Group, capital expenditures during


were primarily attributable to improvements and normal equipment replacements in manufacturing and distribution facilities. The Administrative segment incurred capital expenditures primarily for information systems hardware. On February 6, 2020, the Company announced that it is finalizing plans to build and occupy a new global headquarters (new headquarters) in downtown Cleveland, Ohio and a new research and development (R&D) center in the Cleveland suburb of Brecksville. Preliminary plans require the Company to invest a minimum of $600 million of capital expenditures to build both the new headquarters and R&D center. Construction on the new headquarters and R&D center is not expected to commence before mid-2020, with completion in 2023 at the earliest. The plans are contingent upon completion of standard due diligence, approvals of  economic development incentives and other matters at the state, county and city levels, and resolution of business and legal matters that accompany such major real estate investment projects. The Company has not made any decisions regarding the disposition of the Company’s current Cleveland-area headquarters and R&D centers, which are all owned by the Company. Due to the remaining contingencies and uncertainties listed above, an estimate of the impact on the financial statements cannot be made at this time. In


, the Company expects to spend more than


for capital expenditures. The predominant share of the capital expenditures in


is expected to be for various productivity improvement and maintenance projects at existing manufacturing, distribution and research and development facilities, new store openings, new or upgraded information systems hardware and the new global headquarters and R&D center in Ohio. The Company does not anticipate the need for any specific long-term external financing to support these capital expenditures.



Debt

Total debt including short-term borrowings

decreased

by

$658.5 million

to

$8.685 billion

in


. This was primarily attributable to the

Company repurchasing

$1.071 billion

of its

2.25%

Senior Notes due May 2020 and

$490.0 million

of its

2.75%

Senior Notes due June 2022, partially offset by the Company issuing

$800.0 million

of

2.95%

Senior Notes due 2029 and

$550.0 million

of

3.80%

Senior Notes due 2049 (collectively the "New Notes") in a public offering during the third quarter of 2019. The net proceeds from the issuance of the New Notes will be used for general corporate purposes. The repurchases of Senior Notes above resulted in a loss of

$14.8 million

recorded in other expense (income) - net. See

Note 18

to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for additional information.

On May 9, 2019, the Company entered into a U.S. Dollar to Euro cross currency swap contract with a total notional amount of

$400.0 million

to hedge the Company's net investment in its European operations. This contract has been designated as a net investment hedge and will mature on January 15, 2022. During the term of the contract, the Company will pay fixed-rate interest in Euros and receive fixed-rate interest in U.S. Dollars, thereby effectively converting a portion of the Company's U.S. Dollar denominated fixed-rate debt to Euro denominated fixed-rate debt. The fair value of the contract is included in

Other assets

on the balance sheet. The changes in fair value are recognized in the foreign currency translation adjustments component of Accumulated other comprehensive loss. For the year ended

December 31, 2019

, an unrealized gain of

$1.1 million

, net of tax, was recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive loss.

On July 19, 2018, the Company and three of its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Sherwin-Williams Canada, Inc., Sherwin-Williams Luxembourg S.à r.l and Sherwin-Williams UK Holding Limited (all together with the Company, the Borrowers), entered into a new five-year

$2.000 billion

credit agreement. This credit agreement may be used for general corporate purposes, including the financing of working capital requirements, and replaced a credit agreement dated July 16, 2015, as amended, which was terminated. This credit agreement allows the Company to extend the maturity of the facility with two one-year extension options and the Borrowers to increase the aggregate amount of the facility to

$2.750 billion

, both of which are subject to the discretion of each lender. In addition, the Borrowers may request letters of credit in an amount of up to

$250.0 million

.

On October 8, 2019, the Company amended this agreement to, among other things, extend the maturity date to October 8, 2024.

At

December 31, 2019

and


, there were no short-term borrowings under this credit agreement.

In September 2017, the Company entered into a five-year letter of credit agreement, subsequently amended on multiple dates, with an aggregate availability of

$625.0 million

at

December 31, 2019

. On May 6, 2016, the Company entered into a five-year credit agreement, subsequently amended on multiple dates. This credit agreement gives the Company the right to borrow and to obtain the issuance, renewal, extension and increase of a letter of credit up to an aggregate availability of

$875.0 million

at

December 31, 2019

. Both of these credit agreements are being used for general corporate purposes. At

December 31, 2019

and


, there were no short-term borrowings outstanding under these credit agreements.

Borrowing outstanding under the Company’s domestic commercial paper program as of

December 31, 2019

and


were

$191.9 million

and

$291.4 million

, respectively, with a weighted average interest rate of

2.1%

and

3.0%

, respectively. Borrowings outstanding under various other foreign programs were

$12.8 million

and

$37.0 million

at

December 31, 2019

and


, respectively, with a weighted average interest rate of

4.3%

and

9.3%

, respectively.

See

Note 7

to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for a detailed description and summary of the Company’s outstanding debt and other available financing programs.

Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans

In 2018, the Company terminated its domestic defined benefit pension plan for salaried employees (Terminated Plan) and the participants were moved to a qualified replacement

plan

(Qualified Replacement Plan), which is the Company's domestic defined contribution plan. The Company settled the liabilities of the Terminated Plan through a combination of (i) lump sum payments to eligible participants who elected to receive them and (ii) the purchase of annuity contracts for participants who either did not elect lump sums or were already receiving benefit payments. The lump sum payments were paid in December 2018 and resulted in a settlement charge of

$37.6 million

in 2018.

During the first quarter of 2019, the Company purchased annuity contracts to settle the remaining liabilities of the Terminated Plan. The annuity contract purchase resulted in a settlement charge of

$32.4 million

in the first quarter of 2019. The remaining surplus of the Terminated Plan is being used, as prescribed in the applicable regulations, to fund Company contributions to the Qualified Replacement Plan. During 2019, the Company transferred the remaining surplus of

$242.2 million

to a suspense account held within a trust for the Qualified Replacement Plan. This amount included

$131.8 million

of Company common stock (

300,000

shares). The shares are treated as treasury stock in accordance with ASC 715.

The Company's domestic defined benefit pension plan for hourly employees continues to operate.

In accordance with the accounting prescribed by the Retirement Benefits Topic of the ASC, the Company’s total liability for unfunded or underfunded defined benefit pension plans

increased

$12.0 million

to

$92.7 million

primarily due to changes in the



actuarial assumptions. Postretirement benefits other than pensions

increased

$5.9 million

to

$280.5 million

at

December 31, 2019

due primarily to changes in the actuarial assumptions.

The assumed discount rate used to determine the projected benefit obligation for domestic defined benefit pension plans was

3.4%

at

December 31, 2019

and

3.6%

at December 31, 2018 and 2017. The assumed discount rate used to determine the projected benefit obligation for foreign defined benefit pension plans decreased to

2.2%

at

December 31, 2019

from

3.0%

at

December 31, 2018

. The decrease in the discount rates for both the domestic and foreign defined benefit pension plans was primarily due to lower interest rates. The assumed discount rate used to determine the projected benefit obligation for other postretirement benefit obligations decreased to

3.2%

at

December 31, 2019

from

4.2%

at

December 31, 2018

for the same reason. The rate of compensation increases used to determine the projected benefit obligations at

December 31, 2019

was

3.0%

for the domestic pension plan and

3.1%

for foreign pension plans, which was comparable to the rates used in the prior year. In deciding on the rate of compensation increases, management considered historical Company increases as well as expectations for future increases. The expected long-term rate of return on assets remained

5.0%

at

December 31, 2019

for the domestic pension plan and was slightly lower for most foreign plans. In establishing the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets for


, management considered the historical rates of return, the nature of investments and an expectation for future investment strategies. The assumed health care cost trend rates used to determine the net periodic benefit cost of postretirement benefits other than pensions for


were

4.9%

and

9.8%

, respectively, for medical and prescription drug cost increases, both decreasing gradually to

4.5%

in


. In developing the assumed health care cost trend rates, management considered industry data, historical Company experience and expectations for future health care costs.

For


Net pension cost for the ongoing domestic pension plan, the Company will use a discount rate of

3.4%

, an expected long-term rate of return on assets of

5.0%

and a rate of compensation increase of

3.0%

. Lower discount rates and expected long-term rates of return on plan assets will be used for most foreign plans. For


, Net periodic benefit costs for postretirement benefits other than pensions, the Company will use a discount rate of

3.2%

. Net pension cost in


for the ongoing domestic pension plan is expected to be approximately

$2.8 million

. Net periodic benefit costs for postretirement benefits other than pensions in


is expected to be approximately

$10.0 million

. See

Note 8

to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for more information on the Company’s obligations and funded status of its defined benefit pension plans and postretirement benefits other than pensions.

Deferred Income Taxes

Deferred income taxes at

December 31, 2019

decreased

$161.0 million

from the prior year primarily due to the change in deferred taxes as a result of the amortization of intangible assets and settlement of the domestic defined benefit pension plan in the current year. See

Note 19

to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for more information on deferred taxes.

Other Long-Term Liabilities

Other long-term liabilities

increased

$187.4 million

during


due primarily to the final court approved agreement to resolve the California public nuisance litigation, which impacted the timing and amount of expected payments, and an increase related to the reversal of net tax benefits recognized in previous tax years from federal renewable energy tax credit funds. See Notes


and


, and


to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for additional information on litigation and income tax matters, respectively.

Environmental-Related Liabilities

The operations of the Company, like those of other companies in the same industry, are subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. These laws and regulations not only govern current operations and products, but also impose potential liability on the Company for past operations. Management expects environmental laws and regulations to impose increasingly stringent requirements upon the Company and the industry in the future. Management believes that the Company conducts its operations in compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations and has implemented various programs designed to protect the environment and promote continued compliance.

Depreciation of capital expenditures and other expenses related to ongoing environmental compliance measures were included in the normal operating expenses of conducting business. The Company’s capital expenditures, depreciation and other expenses related to ongoing environmental compliance measures were not material to the Company’s financial condition, liquidity, cash flow or results of operations during


. Management does not expect that such capital expenditures, depreciation and other expenses will be material to the Company’s financial condition, liquidity, cash flow or results of operations in


. See

Note 10

to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for further information on environmental-related long-term liabilities.

Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments

The Company has certain obligations and commitments to make future payments under contractual obligations and commercial commitments. The following tables summarize such obligations and commitments as of

December 31, 2019

.



(1)

Relate to open purchase orders for raw materials at

December 31, 2019

.

(2)

Relate primarily to estimated future capital contributions to investments in the U.S. affordable housing and historic renovation real estate partnerships and various other contractual obligations.

Warranties

The Company offers product warranties for certain products. The specific terms and conditions of such warranties vary depending on the product or customer contract requirements. Management estimated the costs of unsettled product warranty claims based on historical results and experience and included an amount in Other accruals. Management periodically assesses the adequacy of the accrual for product warranty claims and adjusts the accrual as necessary. Changes in the Company’s accrual for product warranty claims during


,


and


, including customer satisfaction settlements during the year, were as follows:

Warranty accruals acquired in connection with the Valspar acquisition in 2017 include warranties for certain products under extended furniture protection plans. The decrease in the accrual in 2018 was primarily due to the divestiture of the furniture protection plan business during the third quarter of 2018 for an immaterial amount that approximated net book value.

Shareholders’ Equity

Shareholders’ equity

increased

$392.6 million

to

$4.123 billion

at

December 31, 2019

from

$3.731 billion

last year primarily due to

an increase

in retained earnings of

$1.120 billion

and

an increase

in Other capital of

$256.6 million

, partially offset by purchases of Treasury stock and Treasury stock received from stock option exercises totaling

$935.8 million

and

an increase

in Accumulated other comprehensive loss of

$49.6 million

. Retained earnings

increased

$1.120 billion

during


due to net income of

$1.541 billion

, partially offset by

$420.8 million

in cash dividends paid. The

increase

in Other capital of

$256.6 million

was due primarily to the recognition of stock-based compensation expense and stock option exercises. The

increase

in Accumulated other comprehensive loss of

$49.6 million

was due primarily to unfavorable foreign currency translation effects of

$49.8 million

. See the Statements of Consolidated Shareholders Equity and Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income in Item 8 for additional information.



The Company purchased

1.675 million

shares of its common stock for treasury during


. The Company acquires its common stock for general corporate purposes, and depending on its cash position and market conditions, it may acquire shares in the future. The Company had remaining authorization from its Board of Directors at

December 31, 2019

to purchase

8.45 million

shares of its common stock.

The Company's


annual cash dividend of

$4.52

per share represented

38.7%

of


diluted net income per share. The


annual dividend represented the 41

st

consecutive year of increased dividend payments since the dividend was suspended in 1978. At a meeting held on

February 19, 2020

, the Board of Directors increased the quarterly cash dividend to

$1.34

per share. This quarterly dividend, if approved in each of the remaining quarters of


, would result in an annual dividend for


of

$5.36

per share or a

32.5%

payout of


diluted net income per share. See the Statements of Consolidated Shareholders’ Equity in Item 8 for more information concerning Shareholders’ equity.

Cash Flow

Net operating cash

increased

$377.6 million

in


to a cash source of

$2.321 billion

from a cash source of

$1.944 billion

in


due primarily to an increase in net income and favorable changes in non-cash items, partially offset by changes in working capital when compared to


. Net operating cash

increased

as a percent to sales to

13.0%

in


compared to

11.1%

in


. During


, strong net operating cash continued to provide the funds necessary to pay down total net debt, invest in new stores and manufacturing and distribution facilities, and return cash to shareholders through treasury stock purchases and dividends paid.

Net investing cash

usage

increased

$211.0 million

to a

usage

of

$462.6 million

in


from a

usage

of

$251.6 million

in


due primarily to increased capital expenditures, cash used to fund the acquisition of a domestic packaging company and two European coatings companies as disclosed in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, and

decreased

proceeds from the sale of assets.

Net financing cash

usage

increased

$99.7 million

to a

usage

of

$1.846 billion

in


from a

usage

of

$1.747 billion

in


due primarily to increased payments of long-term debt, treasury stock purchases, cash dividends and activity related to other accruals, partially offset by the issuance of new long-term debt and a decrease in net payments on short-term borrowings.

Litigation

See

Note 11

to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for information concerning litigation.

Market Risk

The Company is exposed to market risk associated with interest rate, foreign currency and commodity fluctuations. The Company occasionally utilizes derivative instruments as part of its overall financial risk management policy, but does not use derivative instruments for speculative or trading purposes. The Company entered into foreign currency forward contracts with maturity dates of less than twelve months in


,


and


, primarily to hedge against value changes in foreign currency. There were no material foreign currency forward contracts outstanding at December 31,


,


and


. In May 2019, the Company entered into a U.S. Dollar to Euro cross currency swap contract with a total notional amount of

$400.0 million

to hedge the Company's net investment in its European operations. This contract has been designated as a net investment hedge and will mature on January 15, 2022. During the term of the contract, the Company will pay fixed-rate interest in Euros and receive fixed-rate interest in U.S. Dollars, thereby effectively converting a portion of the Company's U.S. Dollar denominated fixed-rate debt to Euro denominated fixed-rate debt. The Company believes it may be exposed to continuing market risk from foreign currency exchange rate and commodity price fluctuations. However, the Company does not expect that foreign currency exchange rate and commodity price fluctuations or hedging contract losses will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. See Notes


and


to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.

Financial Covenant

Certain borrowings contain a consolidated leverage covenant. The covenant states the Company’s leverage ratio is not to exceed 3.75 to 1.00. The leverage ratio is defined as the ratio of total indebtedness (the sum of Short-term borrowings, Current portion of long-term debt and Long-term debt) at the reporting date to consolidated “Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization” (EBITDA) for the 12-month period ended on the same date. Refer to the “Results of Operations” caption in Item 7 for a reconciliation of EBITDA to Net income. At

December 31, 2019

, the Company was in compliance with the covenant. The Company’s Notes, Debentures and revolving credit agreement contain various default and cross-default provisions. In the event of default under any one of these arrangements, acceleration of the maturity of any one or more of these borrowings may result. See

Note 7

to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for additional information.

Employee Stock Ownership Plan

Participants in the Company’s Employee Stock Purchase and Savings Plan (ESOP) are allowed to contribute up to the lesser of 20% of their annual compensation and the maximum dollar amount allowed under the Internal Revenue Code. The Company



matches 6% of eligible employee contributions. The Company’s matching contributions to the ESOP charged to operations were

$111.9 million

in


compared to

$104.7 million

in


. At

December 31, 2019

, there were

8,433,722

shares of the Company’s common stock being held by the ESOP, representing

9.2%

of the total number of voting shares outstanding. See

Note 13

to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for more information concerning the Company’s ESOP.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (US GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. These determinations were made based upon management’s best estimates, judgments and assumptions that were believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, giving due consideration to materiality. We do not believe there is a great likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions related to the accounting policies described below. However, application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and, as a result, actual results could differ from these estimates.

All of the significant accounting policies that were followed in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are disclosed in

Note 1

to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Management believes that the following critical accounting policies and estimates have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.

Inventories

Inventories were stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value with cost determined principally on the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method based on inventory quantities and costs determined during the fourth quarter. Inventory quantities were adjusted during the fourth quarter as a result of annual physical inventory counts taken at all locations. If inventories accounted for on the LIFO method are reduced on a year-over-year basis, then liquidation of certain quantities carried at costs prevailing in prior years occurs. Management recorded the best estimate of net realizable value for obsolete and discontinued inventories based on historical experience and current trends through reductions to inventory cost by recording a provision included in Cost of goods sold. If management estimates that the reasonable market value is below cost or determines that future demand was lower than current inventory levels, based on historical experience, current and projected market demand, current and projected volume trends and other relevant current and projected factors associated with the current economic conditions, a reduction in inventory cost to estimated net realizable value is provided for in the reserve for obsolescence. See

Note 5

to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for more information regarding the impact of the LIFO inventory valuation and the reserve for obsolescence.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets

In accordance with the Goodwill and Other Intangibles Topic of the ASC, management performs impairment tests of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets on an annual basis, as well as whenever an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate impairment has more likely than not occurred. An optional qualitative assessment allows companies to skip the annual quantitative test if it is not more likely than not that impairment has occurred based on monitoring key Company financial performance metrics and macroeconomic conditions. The qualitative assessment is performed when deemed appropriate.

In accordance with the Goodwill and Other Intangibles Topic of the ASC, management tests goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level. A reporting unit is an operating segment per the Segment Reporting Topic of the ASC or one level below the operating segment (component level) as determined by the availability of discrete financial information that is regularly reviewed by operating segment management or an aggregate of component levels of an operating segment having similar economic characteristics. At the time of goodwill impairment testing (if performing a quantitative assessment), management determines fair value through the use of a discounted cash flow valuation model incorporating discount rates commensurate with the risks involved for each reporting unit. If the calculated fair value is less than the current carrying value, then impairment of the reporting unit exists. The use of a discounted cash flow valuation model to determine estimated fair value is common practice in impairment testing. The key assumptions used in the discounted cash flow valuation model for impairment testing include discount rates, growth rates, cash flow projections and terminal value rates. Discount rates are set by using the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (“WACC”) methodology. The WACC methodology considers market and industry data as well as Company-specific risk factors for each reporting unit in determining the appropriate discount rates to be used. The discount rate utilized for each reporting unit is indicative of the return an investor would expect to receive for investing in such a business. Operational management, considering industry and Company-specific historical and projected data, develops growth rates, sales projections and cash flow projections for each reporting unit. Terminal value rate determination follows common methodology of capturing the present value of perpetual cash flow estimates beyond the last projected period assuming a constant WACC and low long-term growth rates. As an indicator that each reporting unit has been valued appropriately through the use of the discounted cash flow valuation model, the aggregate of all reporting units' fair value is reconciled to the total market capitalization of the Company.



The Company had seven components, some of which are aggregated due to similar economic characteristics, to form three reporting units (also the operating segments) with goodwill as of October 1,


, the date of the annual impairment test. The annual impairment review performed as of October 1,


did not result in any of the reporting units having impairment or deemed at risk for impairment.

In accordance with the Goodwill and Other Intangibles Topic of the ASC, management tests indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment at the asset level, as determined by appropriate asset valuations at acquisition. Management utilizes the royalty savings method and valuation model to determine the estimated fair value for each indefinite-lived intangible asset or trademark. In this method, management estimates the royalty savings arising from the ownership of the intangible asset. The key assumptions used in estimating the royalty savings for impairment testing include discount rates, royalty rates, growth rates, sales projections, terminal value rates and, to a lesser extent, tax rates. Discount rates used are similar to the rates developed by the WACC methodology considering any differences in Company-specific risk factors between reporting units and trademarks. Royalty rates are established by management and valuation experts and periodically substantiated by valuation experts. Operational management, considering industry and Company-specific historical and projected data, develops growth rates and sales projections for each significant trademark. Terminal value rate determination follows common methodology of capturing the present value of perpetual sales estimates beyond the last projected period assuming a constant WACC and low long-term growth rates. The royalty savings valuation methodology and calculations used in


impairment testing are consistent with prior years. The annual impairment review performed as of October 1,


resulted in the Company recognizing non-cash pre-tax impairment charges totaling

$122.1 million

related to certain recently acquired indefinite-lived trademarks.

The discounted cash flow and royalty savings valuation methodologies require management to make certain assumptions based upon information available at the time the valuations are performed. Actual results could differ from these assumptions. Management believes the assumptions used are reflective of what a market participant would have used in calculating fair value considering the current economic conditions. See

Note 6

to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for a discussion of goodwill and intangible assets and the impairment tests performed in accordance with the Goodwill and Other Intangibles Topic of the ASC.

Valuation of Long-Lived Assets

In accordance with the Property, Plant and Equipment Topic of the ASC, if events or changes in circumstances indicated that the carrying value of long-lived assets, including Operating lease right-of-use assets, may not be recoverable or the useful life had changed, impairment tests were performed or the useful life was adjusted. Undiscounted cash flows were used to calculate the recoverable value of long-lived assets to determine if such assets were not recoverable. If the carrying value of the assets was deemed to not be recoverable, the impairment to be recognized is the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the assets as determined in accordance with the Fair Value Topic of the ASC. If the usefulness of an asset was determined to be impaired, then management estimated a new useful life based on the period of time for projected uses of the asset. Fair value approaches and changes in useful life required management to make certain assumptions based upon information available at the time the valuation or determination was performed. Actual results could differ from these assumptions. Management believes the assumptions used are reflective of what a market participant would have used in calculating fair value or useful life considering the current economic conditions. All tested long-lived assets or groups of long-lived assets had undiscounted cash flows that were substantially in excess of their carrying value. See Notes


and


to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for a discussion of the reductions in carrying value or useful life of long-lived assets in accordance with the Property, Plant and Equipment Topic of the ASC. See

Note 1

to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for the Property, Plant and Equipment accounting policy.

Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans

To determine the Company’s ultimate obligation under its defined benefit pension plans and postretirement benefit plans other than pensions, management must estimate the future cost of benefits and attribute that cost to the time period during which each covered employee works. To determine the obligations of such benefit plans, management uses actuaries to calculate such amounts using key assumptions such as discount rates, inflation, long-term investment returns, mortality, employee turnover, rate of compensation increases and medical and prescription drug costs. Management reviews all of these assumptions on an ongoing basis to ensure that the most current information available is being considered. An increase or decrease in the assumptions or economic events outside management’s control could have a direct impact on the Company’s results of operations or financial condition.

In accordance with the Retirement Benefits Topic of the ASC, the Company recognizes each plan’s funded status as an asset for overfunded plans and as a liability for unfunded or underfunded plans. Actuarial gains and losses and prior service costs are recognized and recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss, a component of Shareholders’ equity. The amounts recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss will continue to be modified as actuarial assumptions and service costs change, and all such amounts will be amortized to expense over a period of years through the net pension and net periodic benefit costs.



Pension costs for


are expected to decrease significantly due to pension settlement lump sum activity in 2018 and annuity contract purchases in the first quarter of 2019. The annuity contract purchases in 2019 resulted in a settlement charge of

$32.4 million

. The Company will use any remaining overfunded cash surplus balances,

as prescribed in the applicable regulations, to fund future Company contributions to a qualified replacement pension plan, which is the current domestic defined contribution plan (Qualified Replacement Plan).

Postretirement benefit plan costs for


are expected to be approximately the same as 2019 due to similar actuarial assumptions being applied. See

Note 8

to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for information concerning the Company’s defined benefit pension plans and postretirement benefit plans other than pensions.

Environmental Matters

The Company is involved with environmental investigation and remediation activities at some of its currently and formerly owned sites (including sites which were previously owned and/or operated by businesses acquired by the Company). The Company initially provides for estimated costs of environmental-related activities relating to its past operations and third-party sites for which commitments or clean-up plans have been developed and when such costs can be reasonably estimated based on industry standards and professional judgment. These estimated costs, which are not discounted, are determined based on currently available facts regarding each site. If the reasonably estimable costs can only be identified as a range and no specific amount within that range can be determined more likely than any other amount within the range, the minimum of the range is provided. The Company continuously assesses its potential liability for investigation and remediation-related activities and adjusts its environmental-related accruals as information becomes available upon which more accurate costs can be reasonably estimated and as additional accounting guidelines are issued. Actual costs incurred may vary from the accrued estimates due to the inherent uncertainties involved. See

Note 10

to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for information concerning the accrual for extended environmental-related activities and a discussion concerning unaccrued future loss contingencies.

Litigation and Other Contingent Liabilities

In the course of its business, the Company is subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits, including, but not limited to, litigation relating to product liability and warranty, personal injury, environmental, intellectual property, commercial, contractual and antitrust claims. Management believes that the Company has properly accrued for all known liabilities that existed and those where a loss was deemed probable for which a fair value was available or an amount could be reasonably estimated in accordance with US GAAP. However, because litigation is inherently subject to many uncertainties and the ultimate result of any present or future litigation is unpredictable, the Company’s ultimate liability may result in costs that are significantly higher than currently accrued. In the event that the Company’s loss contingency is ultimately determined to be significantly higher than currently accrued, the recording of the liability may result in a material impact on net income for the annual or interim period during which such liability is accrued. Additionally, due to the uncertainties involved, any potential liability determined to be attributable to the Company arising out of such litigation may have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations, liquidity or financial condition. See

Note 11

to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for information concerning litigation.

Income Taxes

The Company estimated income taxes in each jurisdiction that it operated. This involved estimating taxable earnings, specific taxable and deductible items, the likelihood of generating sufficient future taxable income to utilize deferred tax assets and possible exposures related to future tax audits. To the extent these estimates change, adjustments to deferred and accrued income taxes will be made in the period in which the changes occur.

We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution. These assessments of uncertain tax positions contain judgments related to the interpretation of tax regulations in the jurisdictions in which we transact business. The judgments and estimates made at a point in time may change based on the outcome of tax audits, expiration of statutes of limitations, as well as changes to, or further interpretations of, tax laws and regulations. Income tax expense is adjusted in our Statements of Consolidated Income in the period in which these events occur. See

Note 19

to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for information concerning income taxes.



ITEM 7A.    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

We are exposed to market risk associated with interest rates, foreign currency and commodity fluctuations. We occasionally utilize derivative instruments as part of our overall financial risk management policy, but do not use derivative instruments for speculative or trading purposes. In 2019, the Company entered into a U.S. Dollar to Euro cross currency swap contract to hedge the Company's net investment in its European operations. This contract has been designated as a net investment hedge and will mature on January 15, 2022. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. The Company entered into forward foreign currency exchange contracts during


to hedge against value changes in foreign currency. There were no material contracts outstanding at

December 31, 2019

. Forward foreign currency exchange contracts are described in

Note 18

to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. We believe we may experience continuing losses from foreign currency fluctuations. However, we do not expect currency translation, transaction or hedging contract losses to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

ITEM 8.    FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA



Report of Management

On Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Shareholders of The Sherwin-Williams Company

We are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. We recognize that internal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives because of its inherent limitations. Internal control over financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence and is subject to the possibility of human error or the circumvention or the overriding of internal control. Therefore, there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting. However, we believe we have designed into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In order to ensure that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of

December 31, 2019

, we conducted an assessment of its effectiveness under the supervision and with the participation of our management group, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer. This assessment was based on the criteria established in the 2013 Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

Based on our assessment of internal control over financial reporting under the criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework, we have concluded that, as of

December 31, 2019

, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Our internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2019

has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, and their report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting is included on page


of this report.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

On Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

The Board of Directors and Shareholders of The Sherwin-Williams Company

Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

We have audited The Sherwin-Williams Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2019

, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, The Sherwin-Williams Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2019

, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) ("PCAOB"), the consolidated balance sheets of The Sherwin-Williams Company as of

December 31, 2019

,


, and


, and the related statements of consolidated income and comprehensive income, cash flows and shareholders’ equity for each of the three years in the period ended

December 31, 2019

, and the related notes and our report dated

February 21, 2020

expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Basis for Opinion

The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Report of Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(millions of dollars, unless otherwise noted)

NOTE 1 –

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of The Sherwin-Williams Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries (collectively, the Company). Inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (US GAAP) requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those amounts.

Nature of Operations

The Company is engaged in the development, manufacture, distribution and sale of paint, coatings and related products to professional, industrial, commercial and retail customers primarily in North and South America, with additional operations in the Caribbean region, Europe, Asia and Australia.

Reportable Segments

See

Note 21

for further details.

Cash Equivalents

Management considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.

Derivative Instruments

The Company utilizes derivative instruments as part of its overall financial risk management policy. The Company entered into foreign currency forward contracts with maturity dates of less than twelve months in


,


, and


, primarily to hedge against value changes in foreign currency. See

Note 18

. There were

no

material foreign currency option and forward contracts outstanding at

December 31, 2019

,


and


.

On May 9, 2019, the Company entered into a U.S. Dollar to Euro cross currency swap contract with a total notional amount of

$

400.0

million

to hedge the Company's net investment in its European operations. This contract has been designated as a net investment hedge and will mature on January 15, 2022. During the term of the contract, the Company will pay fixed-rate interest in Euros and receive fixed-rate interest in U.S. Dollars, thereby effectively converting a portion of the Company's U.S. Dollar denominated fixed-rate debt to Euro denominated fixed-rate debt. The fair value of the contract as of

December 31, 2019

was

$

1.5

million

and is included in

Other assets

on the balance sheet. The changes in fair value are recognized in the foreign currency translation adjustments component of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (AOCI). For the year ended

December 31, 2019

, an unrealized gain of

$

1.1

million

, net of tax, was recognized in AOCI.

Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

Accounts receivable were recorded at the time of credit sales net of allowance for credit losses. The Company recorded an allowance for doubtful accounts of

$

36.5

million

,

$

45.9

million

and

$

53.0

million

at

December 31, 2019

,


and


, respectively, to reduce Accounts receivable to their estimated net realizable value. The allowance was based on an analysis of historical bad debts, a review of the aging of Accounts receivable and the current creditworthiness of customers. Accounts receivable balances are written-off against the allowance if a final determination of uncollectibility is made. All provisions for allowances for doubtful collection of accounts are included in Selling, general and administrative expenses.



Property, Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment (including leasehold improvements) is stated on the basis of cost. Depreciation is provided by the straight-line method. Depreciation and amortization are included in the appropriate Cost of goods sold or Selling, general and administrative expenses caption on the Statements of Consolidated Income.

The major classes of assets and ranges of annual depreciation rates are:

Goodwill and Intangible Assets

Goodwill represents the cost in excess of fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations accounted for by the purchase method. Intangible assets include indefinite-lived trademarks, customer relationships and intellectual property. In accordance with the Goodwill and Other Intangibles Topic of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC), goodwill and indefinite-lived trademarks are not amortized, but instead are tested for impairment on an annual basis, as well as whenever an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate impairment has more likely than not occurred. The costs of finite-lived intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the expected period of benefit, which ranges primarily from


to


years

. See

Note 6

.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

In accordance with the Property, Plant and Equipment Topic of the ASC, management evaluates the recoverability and remaining lives of long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable or the useful life has changed. See Notes


and


.

Non-Traded Investments

The Company has investments in the U.S. affordable housing and historic renovation real estate markets and certain other investments that have been identified as variable interest entities. However, because the Company does not have the power to direct the day-to-day operations of the investments and the risk of loss is limited to the amount of contributed capital, the Company is not considered the primary beneficiary. In accordance with the Consolidation Topic of the ASC, the investments are not consolidated. For affordable housing investments entered into prior to the January 1, 2015 adoption of Accounting Standard Update (ASU) No. 2014-01, the Company uses the effective yield method to determine the carrying value of the investments. Under the effective yield method, the initial cost of the investments is amortized to income tax expense over the period that the tax credits are recognized. For affordable housing investments entered into on or after the January 1, 2015 adoption of ASU No. 2014-01, the Company uses the proportional amortization method. Under the proportional amortization method, the initial cost of the investments is amortized to income tax expense in proportion to the tax credits and other tax benefits received.

The carrying amounts of the investments, included in Other assets, were

$

176.2

million

,

$

181.2

million

and

$

189.4

million

at

December 31, 2019

,


and


, respectively. The liabilities recorded on the balance sheets for estimated future capital contributions to the investments were

$

174.4

million

,

$

183.0

million

and

$

179.0

million

at

December 31, 2019

,


and


, respectively.

Standby Letters of Credit

The Company occasionally enters into standby letter of credit agreements to guarantee various operating activities. These agreements provide credit availability to the various beneficiaries if certain contractual events occur.

Amounts outstanding under these agreements totaled

$

61.2

million

,

$

65.6

million

and

$

75.3

million

at

December 31, 2019

,


and


, respectively.



Product Warranties

The Company offers assurance type product warranties for certain products. The specific terms and conditions of such warranties vary depending on the product or customer contract requirements. Management estimated the costs of unsettled product warranty claims based on historical results and experience and included an amount in Other accruals. Management periodically assesses the adequacy of the accrual for product warranty claims and adjusts the accrual as necessary.

Changes in the Company’s accrual for product warranty claims during


,


and


, including customer satisfaction settlements during the year, were as follows:

Warranty accruals acquired in connection with the Valspar acquisition include warranties for certain products under extended furniture protection plans. The decrease in the accrual for product warranty claims in the

year ended

December 31, 2018 was primarily due to the divestiture of the furniture protection plan business in the third quarter of 2018.

Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans

The Company accounts for its defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans in accordance with the Retirement Benefits Topic of the ASC, which requires the recognition of a plan’s funded status as an asset for overfunded plans and as a liability for unfunded or underfunded plans.

See

Note 8

.

Environmental Matters

Capital expenditures for ongoing environmental compliance measures were recorded in Property, plant and equipment, and related expenses were included in the normal operating expenses of conducting business. The Company accrued for environmental-related activities for which commitments or clean-up plans have been developed and when such costs could be reasonably estimated based on industry standards and professional judgment. All accrued amounts were recorded on an undiscounted basis and have not been recorded net of insurance proceeds in accordance with the Offsetting Subtopic of the Balance Sheet Topic of the ASC. Environmental-related expenses included direct costs of investigation and remediation and indirect costs such as compensation and benefits for employees directly involved in the investigation and remediation activities and fees paid to outside engineering, consulting and law firms.

See Notes


and


.

Employee Stock Purchase and Savings Plan

The Company accounts for the Employee Stock Purchase and Savings Plan (ESOP) in accordance with the Employee Stock Ownership Plans Subtopic of the Compensation – Stock Ownership Topic of the ASC. The Company recognized compensation expense for amounts contributed to the ESOP.

See

Note 13

.

Stock-Based Compensation

The cost of the Company’s stock-based compensation is recorded in accordance with the Stock Compensation Topic of the ASC.

See

Note 14

.

Other Liabilities

The Company retains risk for certain liabilities, primarily workers’ compensation claims, employee medical and disability benefits, and automobile, property, general and product liability claims. Estimated amounts were accrued for certain workers’ compensation, employee medical and disability benefits, automobile and property claims filed but unsettled, and estimated claims incurred but not reported based upon management’s estimated aggregate liability for claims incurred using historical experience, actuarial assumptions followed in the insurance industry and actuarially-developed models for estimating certain liabilities. Certain estimated general and product liability claims filed but unsettled were accrued based on management’s best estimate of ultimate settlement or actuarial calculations of potential liability using industry experience and actuarial assumptions developed for similar types of claims.

Foreign Currency Translation

All consolidated non-highly inflationary foreign operations use the local currency of the country of operation as the functional currency and translated the local currency asset and liability accounts at year-end exchange rates while income and expense



accounts were translated at average exchange rates. The resulting translation adjustments were included in AOCI, a component of Shareholders’ equity.

Revenue Recognition

The Company recognized revenue when control of the product was transferred to unaffiliated customers. Collectibility of amounts recorded as revenue was probable at the time of recognition.

See Note 17.

Customer and Vendor Consideration

The Company offered certain customers rebate and sales incentive programs which were classified as reductions in Net sales. Such programs were in the form of volume rebates, rebates that constituted a percentage of sales or rebates for attaining certain sales goals. The Company received consideration from certain suppliers of raw materials in the form of volume rebates or rebates that constituted a percentage of purchases. These rebates were recognized on an accrual basis by the Company as a reduction of the purchase price of the raw materials and a subsequent reduction of Cost of goods sold when the related product was sold.

Costs of Goods Sold

Included in Costs of goods sold were costs for materials, manufacturing, distribution and related support. Distribution costs included expenses related to the distribution of products including inbound freight charges, purchase and receiving costs, warehousing costs, internal transfer costs and other costs incurred to ship products. Also included in Costs of goods sold were total technical expenditures, which included research and development costs, quality control, product formulation expenditures and other similar items.

Research and development costs included in technical expenditures were

$

103.1

million

,

$

51.9

million

and

$

58.5

million

for


,


and


, respectively.

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses

Selling costs included advertising expenses, marketing costs, employee and store costs and sales commissions. The cost of advertising was expensed as incurred. The Company incurred

$

355.2

million

,

$

357.8

million

and

$

374.1

million

in advertising costs during


,


and


, respectively. General and administrative expenses included human resources, legal, finance and other support and administrative functions.

Earnings Per Share

Common stock held in a revocable trust (see

Note 12

) was not included in outstanding shares for basic or diluted income per share calculations. Basic and diluted net income per share were calculated using the treasury stock method in accordance with the Earnings Per Share Topic of the ASC. Basic net income per share amounts were computed based on the weighted-average number of shares outstanding during the year. Diluted net income per share amounts were computed based on the weighted-average number of shares outstanding plus all dilutive securities potentially outstanding during the year.

NOTE 2 –

RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

Adopted in 2019

Effective January 1, 2019, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-02, "Leases" (ASC 842). ASC 842 consists of a comprehensive lease accounting standard requiring most leases to be recognized on the balance sheet and significant new disclosures. The Company adopted ASC 842 using the modified retrospective optional transition method. Therefore, the standard was applied starting January 1, 2019 and prior periods were not restated.

The Company applied the package of practical expedients permitted under the ASC 842 transition guidance. As a result, the Company did not reassess the identification, classification and initial direct costs of leases commencing before the effective date. The Company also applied the practical expedient to not separate lease and non-lease components to all new leases as well as leases commencing before the effective date.

As a result of the adoption of ASC 842, right-of-use assets, current liabilities and non-current liabilities related to operating leases of

$

1.7

billion

,

$

0.4

billion

and

$

1.4

billion

, respectively, were recognized on the balance sheet at

December 31, 2019

. In addition, the adoption of ASC 842 resulted in a transition adjustment, net of tax, reducing the opening balance of retained earnings by

$

8.4

million

at January 1, 2019. The adoption of ASC 842 did not have a material impact on the Company's results of operations, cash flows or debt covenants. See

Note 9

for additional information.



Effective January 1, 2019, the Company adopted ASU 2018-02, "Reclassification of Certain Income Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income." This standard allows a reclassification from AOCI to retained earnings for stranded tax effects resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. As a result of this standard, the Company recorded an

$

8.3

million

reclassification from AOCI to retained earnings. See

Note 15

for additional information on the impact of the reclassification to each component of AOCI. The adoption of this standard did not have a significant impact on the Company's results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.

Effective January 1, 2019, the Company adopted ASU 2017-12, "Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities." This standard better aligns hedging activities and financial reporting for hedging relationships. It eliminates the requirement to separately measure and report hedge ineffectiveness and reduces the complexity of applying certain aspects of hedge accounting. There were no outstanding hedges as of the adoption date. The prospective adoption of this standard did not have a significant impact on the Company's results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.

Not Yet Adopted

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, "Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments." This ASU replaces the incurred loss impairment methodology in current US GAAP with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates. In addition, new disclosures are required. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019 and for interim periods therein. The adoption of ASU 2016-13 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, "Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes." The ASU simplifies the accounting for income taxes, changes the accounting for certain income tax transactions, and makes other minor changes. The standards update is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2020, with early adoption permitted. The amendments are primarily perspective. The Company is currently assessing the impact of this standards update on our consolidated financial statements.

NOTE 3 –

ACQUISITIONS

During 2019, the Company completed the acquisition of a domestic packaging company and two European coatings companies for an aggregate purchase price of

$

84.4

million

, including amounts withheld as security for certain representations, warranties and obligations of the sellers. These acquisitions support the growth of the Performance Coatings Group by providing new technologies and an expanded global platform. The acquisitions have been accounted for as business combinations. The preliminary purchase price allocations are expected to be finalized within the allowable measurement period. The results of operations of these companies have been included in the consolidated financial statements since the date of acquisition. Pro forma results of operations have not been presented as the impact on the Company's consolidated financial results was not material.

On June 1, 2017, the Company completed the acquisition of The Valspar Corporation (Valspar) at

$


per share in an all cash transaction for a total purchase price of

$

8.9

billion

, net of divestiture proceeds of

$

431.0

million

. On April 11, 2017, the Company and Valspar entered into a definitive agreement with Axalta Coating Systems Ltd. to divest the assets related to Valspar's North American industrial wood coatings business. The divestiture was also completed on June 1, 2017, and is reported as a discontinued operation with

no

pre-tax gain or loss, but includes the tax expense effect of this separate transaction. Proceeds of

$

431.0

million

were received for the divested assets sold. The divestiture resulted in a tax provision of

$

41.5

million

, which reduced basic and diluted net income per share by

$

0.44

for the

year ended

December 31, 2017. The acquisition expanded the Company's diversified array of brands and technologies, expanded its global platform and added new capabilities in its packaging and coil businesses.



The following table summarizes the allocation of the fair value of the net assets acquired through the Valspar acquisition. This allocation was based on the acquisition method of accounting and third-party valuation appraisals.

Finite-lived intangible assets include customer relationships of

$

3.2

billion

and intellectual property and technology of

$

1.7

billion

, which are being amortized over weighted average amortization periods ranging from


to


years. The measurement period adjustments for finite-lived intangible assets resulted in a

$

7.7

million

reduction of amortization expense in the second quarter of 2018 that related to prior periods. Goodwill of

$

2.0

billion

,

$

1.1

billion

, and

$

2.8

billion

was recorded in The Americas Group, Consumer Brands Group, and Performance Coatings Group, respectively, and relates primarily to expected synergies. The results of operations for Valspar have been included in the Company's consolidated financial statements since the date of acquisition.

NOTE 4 –

EXIT OR DISPOSAL ACTIVITIES

Management is continually re-evaluating the Company’s operating facilities, including acquired operating facilities, against its long-term strategic goals. Liabilities associated with exit or disposal activities are recognized as incurred in accordance with the Exit or Disposal Cost Obligations Topic of the ASC. Provisions for qualified exit costs are made at the time a facility is no longer operational. Qualified exit costs primarily include post-closure lease expenses or early lease termination costs and costs of employee terminations. Adjustments may be made to liabilities accrued for qualified exit costs if information becomes available upon which more accurate amounts can be reasonably estimated. Concurrently, property, plant and equipment is tested for impairment in accordance with the Property, Plant and Equipment Topic of the ASC, and if impairment exists, the carrying value of the related assets is reduced to estimated fair value. Additional impairment may be recorded for subsequent revisions in estimated fair value. Adjustments to prior provisions and additional impairment charges for property, plant and equipment of closed sites being held for disposal are recorded in Other general expense – net.

The following table summarizes the activity and remaining liabilities associated with qualified exit costs:

NOTE 5 –

INVENTORIES

Inventories were stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, with cost primarily determined on the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method. Management believes that the use of LIFO results in a better matching of costs and revenues.



The following table summarizes the extent to which the Company's Inventories use the LIFO cost method, and presents the effect on inventories had the Company used the first-in, first-out (FIFO) inventory valuation method.

The Company recorded a reserve for obsolescence of

$

115.4

million

,

$

105.9

million

and

$

103.7

million

at

December 31, 2019

,


and


, respectively, to reduce Inventories to their estimated net realizable value.

NOTE 6 –

GOODWILL, INTANGIBLE AND LONG-LIVED ASSETS

In accordance with the Property, Plant and Equipment Topic of the ASC, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of long-lived assets may not be recoverable or the useful life may have changed, impairment tests are to be performed. Subsequent to the adoption of ASU 2016-02, right-of-use assets recognized in the consolidated balance sheet are considered to be long-lived assets. Undiscounted cash flows were used to calculate the recoverable value of long-lived assets to determine if such assets were not recoverable. If the carrying value of the assets was deemed to not be recoverable, the impairment to be recognized is the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the assets as determined in accordance with the Fair Value Topic of the ASC.

No

material impairments of long-lived assets were recorded in 2019, 2018 or 2017.

During 2019, the Company acquired

three

companies which resulted in the recognition of goodwill of

$

14.2

million

and finite-lived intangibles of

$

34.9

million

. During 2017, the Company recognized goodwill of

$

5.9

billion

, finite-lived intangibles of

$

4.9

billion

and indefinite-lived trademarks of

$

614.3

million

in connection with the acquisition of Valspar in 2017. See

Note 3

for additional information related to the acquisitions.

In accordance with the Goodwill and Other Intangibles Topic of the ASC, goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually, and interim impairment tests are performed whenever an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate an impairment has more likely than not occurred. October 1 has been established for the annual impairment review. At the time of impairment testing, values are estimated separately for goodwill and trademarks with indefinite lives using a valuation model, incorporating discount rates commensurate with the risks involved for each group of assets. An optional qualitative assessment may alleviate the need to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test when impairment is unlikely.

During the fourth quarter of 2019, the Company performed a strategic review of its business lines as part of the annual planning cycle. Decisions were made during this review related to certain brands which resulted in a reduction to the long-term forecasted net sales for certain indefinite-lived trademarks acquired in the Valspar acquisition within the Performance Coatings and Consumer Brands Groups. As a result of the strategic decisions made at that time and in conjunction with the annual impairment review performed as of October 1, 2019, the Company recognized non-cash pre-tax impairment charges totaling

$

122.1

million

related to certain recently acquired indefinite-lived trademarks. These charges included impairments totaling

$

117.0

million

in the Performance Coatings Group and

$

5.1

million

in the Consumer Brands Group. In the Performance Coatings Group,

$

75.6

million

related to trademarks in North America directly associated with strategic decisions made to rebrand industrial products to the Sherwin-Williams® brand name,

$

25.7

million

related to trademarks in the Asia Pacific region as a direct result of recent performance that reduced the long-term forecasted net sales and

$

15.7

million

related to other recently acquired trademarks in various regions. The fair values of the indefinite-lived trademarks were calculated using the royalty savings method. The annual impairment review did not result in any goodwill impairment.

The annual impairment reviews performed as of October 1, 2018 did

no

t result in any goodwill or trademark impairment. The annual impairment review performed as of October 1, 2017 resulted in trademark impairment of

$

2.0

million

in The Americas Group related to lower than anticipated sales of an acquired brand and

no

goodwill impairment.



A summary of changes in the Company’s carrying value of goodwill by Reportable Segment is as follows:

(1)

Net of accumulated impairment losses of

$

19.4

million

(

$

10.5

million

in The Americas Group,

$

8.1

million

in the Consumer Brands Group and

$

0.8

million

in the Performance Coatings Group).

A summary of the Company’s carrying value of intangible assets is as follows:

(1)

Trademarks with indefinite lives as of

December 31, 2019

is net of accumulated impairment losses of

$

122.1

million

. There were no material accumulated impairment losses as of December 31, 2018 and 2017.

Amortization of finite-lived intangible assets is estimated as follows for the next five years:

$

298.7

million

in


,

$

297.9

million

in


,

$

296.3

million

in


,

$

293.9

million

in


and

$

291.3

million

in


.

Although the Company believes its estimates of fair value related to reporting units and indefinite-lived trademarks are reasonable, actual financial results could differ from those estimates due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making such estimates. Changes in assumptions concerning future financial results or other underlying assumptions could have a significant impact and future impairment charges may be required.

On May 16, 2017, the Company issued

$

6.0

billion

of senior notes in a public offering. The net proceeds from the issuance of these notes were used to fund the acquisition of Valspar. See

Note 3

. The interest rate locks entered into in 2016 settled in March



2017 resulting in a pretax gain of

$

recognized in AOCI. This gain is being amortized from AOCI to a reduction of interest expense over the terms of the notes. For the years ended

December 31, 2019

and


, the amortization of the unrealized gain reduced interest expense by

$

, respectively.

On June 2, 2017, the Company closed its previously announced exchange offers and consent solicitations for the outstanding senior notes of Valspar and issued notes with an aggregate principal amount of approximately

$

1.478

. The notes are unsecured senior obligations of the Company. The Company did not receive any cash proceeds from the issuance of these notes.

In August 2017, the Company entered into a floating rate loan of

€

In April 2016, the Company entered into agreements for a

$

7.3

Bridge Loan and a

$

2.0

on the Term Loan. During 2018, the Company paid the outstanding balance on the Term Loan and the agreement was terminated.

Short-Term Borrowings

On July 19, 2018, the Company and three of its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Sherwin-Williams Canada, Inc., Sherwin-Williams Luxembourg S.à r.l and Sherwin-Williams UK Holding Limited (all together with the Company, the Borrowers), entered into a new

five

credit agreement. This credit agreement may be used for general corporate purposes, including the financing of working capital requirements, and replaced a credit agreement dated July 16, 2015, as amended, which was terminated. This credit agreement allows the Company to extend the maturity of the facility with

two

one

NOTE 8 –

PENSION, HEALTH CARE AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS OTHER THAN PENSIONS

The Company provides pension benefits to substantially all full-time employees through primarily noncontributory defined contribution or defined benefit plans and certain health care and life insurance benefits to domestic active employees and eligible retirees. In accordance with the Retirement Benefits Topic of the ASC, the Company recognizes an asset for overfunded defined benefit pension or other postretirement benefit plans and a liability for unfunded or underfunded plans. In addition, actuarial gains and losses and prior service costs of such plans are recorded in AOCI. The amounts recorded in AOCI will continue to be modified as actuarial assumptions and service costs change, and all such amounts will be amortized to expense over a period of years through the net pension cost (credit) and net periodic benefit cost.

Health Care Plans

The Company provides certain domestic health care plans that are contributory and contain cost-sharing features such as deductibles and coinsurance. There were

27,030

,

26,323

and

26,565

active employees entitled to receive benefits under these plans at

December 31, 2019

,


and


, respectively. The cost of these benefits for active employees, which includes claims incurred and claims incurred but not reported, amounted to

$

301.6

million

,

$

298.8

million

and

$

281.2

and


, respectively.



Defined Contribution Pension Plans

The Company’s annual contribution for its domestic defined contribution pension plan was

$

72.7

million

,

$

65.2

million

and

$

38.4

million

for


,


and


, respectively. The contribution percentage ranges from

two

percent to

percent of compensation for covered employees based on an age and service formula. Assets in employee accounts of the domestic defined contribution pension plan are invested in various investment funds as directed by the participants. These investment funds did not own a significant number of shares of the Company’s common stock for any year presented.

The Company’s annual contributions for its foreign defined contribution pension plans, which are based on various percentages of compensation for covered employees up to certain limits, were

$

24.5

million

,

$

19.5

Defined Benefit Pension Plans

Prior to December 31, 2017, the Company had one salaried and one hourly domestic defined benefit pension plan. In connection with the acquisition of Valspar (see Note 3), the Company acquired Valspar's domestic defined benefit pension plan. Effective December 31, 2017, the three domestic defined benefit pension plans were merged into one plan. In 2018, this plan was split into two separate overfunded plans: one that will continue to operate, and one that was frozen and subsequently terminated during 2018 (Terminated Plan). Active participants in the Terminated Plan were moved to the Company's domestic defined contribution plan (Qualified Replacement Plan). The Company settled the liabilities of the Terminated Plan through a combination of (i) lump sum payments to eligible participants who elected to receive them and (ii) the purchase of annuity contracts for participants who either did not elect lump sums or were already receiving benefit payments. The lump sum payments were paid in December 2018 and resulted in a settlement charge of

$

37.6

million

in 2018.

During the first quarter of 2019, the Company purchased annuity contracts to settle the remaining liabilities of the Terminated Plan. The annuity contract purchase resulted in a settlement charge of

$

32.4

million

in the first quarter of 2019. The remaining surplus of the Terminated Plan is being used, as prescribed in the applicable regulations, to fund Company contributions to the Qualified Replacement Plan. During 2019, the Company transferred the remaining surplus of

$

242.2

million

to a suspense account held within a trust for the Qualified Replacement Plan. This amount included

$

131.8

million

of Company common stock (

300,000

shares). The shares are treated as treasury stock in accordance with ASC 715.

At

The Company employs a total return investment approach for the domestic and foreign defined benefit pension plan assets. A mix of equities and fixed income investments are used to maximize the long-term return of assets for a prudent level of risk. In determining the expected long-term rate of return on defined benefit pension plan assets, management considers the historical rates of return, the nature of investments and an expectation of future investment strategies. The target allocations for plan assets are

Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions

Employees of the Company hired in the United States prior to January 1, 1993 who are not members of a collective bargaining unit, and certain groups of employees added through acquisitions, are eligible for health care and life insurance benefits upon retirement, subject to the terms of the unfunded plans.

NOTE 9 –

LEASES

The Company leases retail stores, manufacturing and distribution facilities, office space and equipment under operating lease agreements. Operating lease right-of-use (ROU) assets and lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. The majority of the ROU asset and lease liability balances relate to the retail operations of The Americas Group.

Most leases include one or more options to renew. The exercise of lease renewal options is at the Company's discretion and is not reasonably certain at lease commencement. Some leases have variable payments, however, because they are not based on an index or rate, they are not included in the ROU assets and liabilities. Variable payments for real estate leases relate primarily to common area maintenance, insurance, taxes and utilities associated with the properties. Variable payments for equipment leases relate



primarily to hours, miles, or other quantifiable usage factors which are not determinable at the time the lease agreement is entered into by the Company. The Company has made an accounting policy election by class of underlying asset to not apply the recognition requirements of ASC 842 to short-term leases. As a result, certain leases with a term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet and expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Most leases do not contain an implicit discount rate. Therefore, the Company’s estimated incremental borrowing rate based on information available at the time of lease inception is used to discount lease payments to present value. Effective January 1, 2019, the Company adopted ASC 842 using the modified retrospective optional transition method, electing to not restate prior periods. As a result, the required comparative period disclosures below are reported in accordance with the previous accounting standard, ASC 840.

Additional lease information is summarized below:

(1)

Operating lease cost for comparative periods includes short-term lease cost in accordance with ASC 840 disclosure requirements.

(2)

Disclosure was not required for comparative periods under ASC 840.

At

December 31, 2019

, the weighted average remaining lease term and discount rate for operating leases was

The following table reconciles the undiscounted cash flows for each of the next five years and thereafter to the operating lease liabilities recognized on the balance sheet as of

During 2018, the Company completed transactions to sell and subsequently leaseback certain real estate properties and received proceeds totaling

$

225.3

million

. The transactions were accounted for as financing transactions primarily due to the Company's continuing involvement resulting from the length of the lease term in comparison to the remaining economic life of the real estate properties. The financing transactions have related future obligations of

NOTE 10 –

OTHER LONG-TERM LIABILITIES

The operations of the Company, like those of other companies in its industry, are subject to various domestic and foreign environmental laws and regulations. These laws and regulations not only govern current operations and products, but also impose potential liability on the Company for past operations. Management expects environmental laws and regulations to impose increasingly stringent requirements upon the Company and the industry in the future. Management believes that the Company conducts its operations in compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations and has implemented various programs designed to protect the environment and promote continued compliance.

The Company is involved with environmental investigation and remediation activities at some of its currently and formerly owned sites (including sites which were previously owned and/or operated by businesses acquired by the Company). In addition, the Company, together with other parties, has been designated a potentially responsible party under federal and state environmental



protection laws for the investigation and remediation of environmental contamination and hazardous waste at a number of third-party sites, primarily Superfund sites. In general, these laws provide that potentially responsible parties may be held jointly and severally liable for investigation and remediation costs regardless of fault. The Company may be similarly designated with respect to additional third-party sites in the future.

The Company initially provides for estimated costs of environmental-related activities relating to its past operations and third-party sites for which commitments or clean-up plans have been developed and when such costs can be reasonably estimated based on industry standards and professional judgment. These estimated costs, which are not discounted, are determined based on currently available facts regarding each site. If the reasonably estimable costs can only be identified as a range and no specific amount within that range can be determined more likely than any other amount within the range, the minimum of the range is provided. The Company continuously assesses its potential liability for investigation and remediation-related activities and adjusts its environmental-related accruals as information becomes available upon which more accurate costs can be reasonably estimated and as additional accounting guidelines are issued. At

December 31, 2019

,


and


, the Company had accruals reported on the balance sheet as Other long-term liabilities of

$

314.8

million

,

$

322.5

million

and

$

179.6

million

, respectively. Estimated costs of current investigation and remediation activities of

$

57.6

million

,

$

51.0

million

and

$

28.6

million

are included in Other accruals at

December 31, 2019

,


and


, respectively.

Actual costs incurred may vary from the accrued estimates due to the inherent uncertainties involved including, among others, the number and financial condition of parties involved with respect to any given site, the volumetric contribution which may be attributed to the Company relative to that attributed to other parties, the nature and magnitude of the wastes involved, the various technologies that can be used for remediation and the determination of acceptable remediation with respect to a particular site. If the Company’s future loss contingency is ultimately determined to be at the unaccrued maximum of the estimated range of possible outcomes for every site for which costs can be reasonably estimated, the Company’s accrual for environmental-related activities would be

$

115.5

million

higher than the minimum accruals at

December 31, 2019

. Additionally, costs for environmental-related activities may not be reasonably estimable at early stages of investigation and therefore would not be included in the unaccrued maximum amount.

Four

of the Company’s currently and formerly owned manufacturing sites ("Major Sites") account for the majority of the accrual for environmental-related activities and the unaccrued maximum of the estimated range of possible outcomes at

December 31, 2019

. At

December 31, 2019

,

$

320.1

million

, or

86.0

%

of the total accrual, related directly to the Major Sites. In the aggregate unaccrued maximum of

$

115.5

million

at

December 31, 2019

,

$

91.3

million

, or

79.0

%

, related to the Major Sites. The significant cost components of this liability continue to be related to remedy implementation, regulatory agency interaction, project management and other costs. While different for each specific environmental situation, these components generally each account for approximately


%

,


%

, and


%

, respectively, of the accrued amount and those percentages are subject to change over time. While environmental investigations and remedial actions are in different stages at these sites, additional investigations, remedial actions and monitoring will likely be required at each site.

The largest and most complex of the Major Sites is the Gibbsboro, New Jersey site ("Gibbsboro") which comprises the substantial majority of the environmental-related accrual. Gibbsboro, a former manufacturing plant, and related areas, which ceased operations in 1978, has had various areas included on the National Priorities List since 1999. This location has soil, waterbodies, and groundwater contamination related to the historic operations of the facility. Gibbsboro has been divided by the Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") into

six

operable units ("OUs") based on location and characteristics, whose investigation and remediation efforts are likely to occur over an extended period of time. Each of the OUs are in various phases of investigation and remediation with the EPA that provide enough information to reasonably estimate cost ranges and record environmental-related accruals. The most significant assumptions underlying the reliability and precision of remediation cost estimates for the Gibbsboro site are the type and extent of future remedies to be selected by the EPA and the costs of implementing those remedies.

The remaining

three

Major Sites comprising the majority of the accrual include (1) a multi-party Superfund site that has received a record of decision from the federal EPA and is currently in the remedial design phase for one operable unit and for which a remedial investigation/feasibility study has been submitted for another operable unit, (2) a closed paint manufacturing facility that is in the operation and maintenance phase of remediation under both federal and state EPA programs, and (3) a formerly-owned site containing warehouse and office space that is in the remedial investigation phase under a state EPA program. Each of these

three

Major Sites are in phases of investigation and remediation that provide sufficient information to reasonably estimate cost ranges and record environmental-related accruals.

Excluding the Major Sites discussed above, no sites are individually material to the total accrual balance. There are multiple, future events yet to occur, including further remedy selection and design, remedy implementation and execution, and securing applicable governmental agency approvals, all of which have the potential to contribute to the uncertainty surrounding these future events. As these events occur and to the extent that the cost estimates of the environmental remediation change, the existing reserve will be adjusted.



Management cannot presently estimate the ultimate potential loss contingencies related to these sites or other less significant sites until such time as a substantial portion of the investigation at the sites is completed and remedial action plans are developed. Unasserted claims could have a material effect on the Company's loss contingency as more information becomes available over time. At

December 31, 2019

, the Company did not have material loss contingency accruals related to unasserted claims. Management does not expect that a material portion of unrecognized loss contingencies will be recoverable through insurance, indemnification agreements or other sources. In the event any future loss contingency significantly exceeds the current amount accrued, the recording of the ultimate liability may result in a material impact on net income for the annual or interim period during which the additional costs are accrued. Moreover, management does not believe that any potential liability ultimately attributed to the Company for its environmental-related matters will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, liquidity, or cash flow due to the extended length of time during which environmental investigation and remediation takes place. An estimate of the potential impact on the Company’s operations cannot be made due to the aforementioned uncertainties.

Management expects these contingent environmental-related liabilities to be resolved over an extended period of time. Management is unable to provide a more specific time frame due to the indeterminate amount of time to conduct investigation activities at any site, the indeterminate amount of time to obtain environmental agency approval, as necessary, with respect to investigation and remediation activities, and the indeterminate amount of time necessary to conduct remediation activities.

The Asset Retirement and Environmental Obligations Topic of the ASC requires a liability to be recognized for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation if a settlement date and fair value can be reasonably estimated. The Company recognizes a liability for any conditional asset retirement obligation when sufficient information is available to reasonably estimate a settlement date to determine the fair value of such a liability. The Company has identified certain conditional asset retirement obligations at various current and closed manufacturing, distribution and store facilities. These obligations relate primarily to asbestos abatement, hazardous waste Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) closures, well abandonment, transformers and used oil disposals and underground storage tank closures. Using investigative, remediation and disposal methods that are currently available to the Company, the estimated costs of these obligations were accrued and are not significant. The recording of additional liabilities for future conditional asset retirement obligations may result in a material impact on net income for the annual or interim period during which the costs are accrued. Management does not believe that any potential liability ultimately attributed to the Company for its conditional asset retirement obligations will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, liquidity, or cash flow due to the extended period of time over which sufficient information may become available regarding the closure or modification of any one or group of the Company’s facilities. An estimate of the potential impact on the Company’s operations cannot be made due to the aforementioned uncertainties.

NOTE 11 –

LITIGATION

In the course of its business, the Company is subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits, including, but not limited to, litigation relating to product liability and warranty, personal injury, environmental, intellectual property, commercial, contractual and antitrust claims that are inherently subject to many uncertainties regarding the possibility of a loss to the Company. These uncertainties will ultimately be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur confirming the incurrence of a liability or the reduction of a liability. In accordance with the Contingencies Topic of the ASC, the Company accrues for these contingencies by a charge to income when it is both probable that one or more future events will occur confirming the fact of a loss and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. In the event that the Company’s loss contingency is ultimately determined to be significantly higher than currently accrued, the recording of the additional liability may result in a material impact on the Company’s results of operations, liquidity or financial condition for the annual or interim period during which such additional liability is accrued. In those cases where no accrual is recorded because it is not probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of any such loss cannot be reasonably estimated, any potential liability ultimately determined to be attributable to the Company may result in a material impact on the Company’s results of operations, liquidity or financial condition for the annual or interim period during which such liability is accrued. In those cases where no accrual is recorded or exposure to loss exists in excess of the amount accrued, the Contingencies Topic of the ASC requires disclosure of the contingency when there is a reasonable possibility that a loss or additional loss may have been incurred.

Lead pigment and lead-based paint litigation.

The Company’s past operations included the manufacture and sale of lead pigments and lead-based paints. The Company, along with other companies, is and has been a defendant in a number of legal proceedings, including individual personal injury actions, purported class actions, and actions brought by various counties, cities, school districts and other government-related entities, arising from the manufacture and sale of lead pigments and lead-based paints. The plaintiffs’ claims have been based upon various legal theories, including negligence, strict liability, breach of warranty, negligent misrepresentations and omissions, fraudulent misrepresentations and omissions, concert of action, civil conspiracy, violations of unfair trade practice and consumer protection laws, enterprise liability, market share liability, public nuisance, unjust enrichment and other theories. The plaintiffs seek various damages and relief, including personal injury and property damage, costs relating to the detection and abatement of lead-based paint from buildings, costs associated with a public education campaign, medical



monitoring costs and others. The Company has also been a defendant in legal proceedings arising from the manufacture and sale of non-lead-based paints that seek recovery based upon various legal theories, including the failure to adequately warn of potential exposure to lead during surface preparation when using non-lead-based paint on surfaces previously painted with lead-based paint. The Company believes that the litigation brought to date is without merit or subject to meritorious defenses and is vigorously defending such litigation. The Company expects that additional lead pigment and lead-based paint litigation may be filed against the Company in the future asserting similar or different legal theories and seeking similar or different types of damages and relief. The Company will continue to vigorously defend against any additional lead pigment and lead-based paint litigation that may be filed, including utilizing all avenues of appeal, if necessary.

Notwithstanding the Company’s views on the merits, litigation is inherently subject to many uncertainties, and the Company ultimately may not prevail. Adverse court rulings or determinations of liability, among other factors, could affect the lead pigment and lead-based paint litigation against the Company and encourage an increase in the number and nature of future claims and proceedings. In addition, from time to time, various legislation and administrative regulations have been enacted, promulgated or proposed to impose obligations on present and former manufacturers of lead pigments and lead-based paints respecting asserted health concerns associated with such products or to overturn the effect of court decisions in which the Company and other manufacturers have been successful.

Due to the uncertainties involved, management is unable to predict the outcome of the lead pigment and lead-based paint litigation, the number or nature of possible future claims and proceedings or the effect that any legislation and/or administrative regulations may have on the litigation or against the Company. In addition, management cannot reasonably determine the scope or amount of the potential costs and liabilities related to such litigation, or resulting from any such legislation and regulations. Except with respect to the litigation in California discussed below, the Company has not accrued any amounts for such litigation because the Company does not believe it is probable that a loss has occurred, and the Company believes it is not possible to estimate the range of potential losses as there is no substantive information upon which an estimate could be based. In addition, any potential liability that may result from any changes to legislation and regulations cannot reasonably be estimated. In the event any significant liability is determined to be attributable to the Company relating to such litigation or any such liability is higher than any amount currently accrued for such litigation, the recording of the liability may result in a material impact on net income for the annual or interim period during which such liability is accrued. Additionally, due to the uncertainties associated with the amount of any such liability and/or the nature of any other remedy which may be imposed in such litigation, any potential liability determined to be attributable to the Company arising out of such litigation may have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations, liquidity or financial condition. An estimate of the potential impact on the Company’s results of operations, liquidity or financial condition cannot be made due to the aforementioned uncertainties.

Public nuisance claim litigation

.

The Company and other companies are or were defendants in legal proceedings seeking recovery based on public nuisance liability theories, among other theories, brought by the State of Rhode Island; the City of St. Louis, Missouri; various cities and counties in the State of New Jersey; various cities in the State of Ohio and the State of Ohio; the City of Chicago, Illinois; the City of Milwaukee, Wisconsin; the County of Santa Clara, California, and other public entities in the State of California; and Lehigh and Montgomery Counties in Pennsylvania. Except for the Santa Clara County, California proceeding and the pending Pennsylvania proceedings, all of these legal proceedings have been concluded in favor of the Company and other defendants at various stages in the proceedings.

Santa Clara County, California Proceeding

.

The Santa Clara County, California proceeding was initiated in March 2000 in the Superior Court of the State of California, County of Santa Clara. In the original complaint, the plaintiffs asserted various claims including fraud and concealment, strict product liability/failure to warn, strict product liability/design defect, negligence, negligent breach of a special duty, public nuisance, private nuisance, and violations of California’s Business and Professions Code. A number of the asserted claims were resolved in favor of the defendants through pre-trial proceedings. The named plaintiffs in the Fourth Amended Complaint, filed on March 16, 2011, are the Counties of Santa Clara, Alameda, Los Angeles, Monterey, San Mateo, Solano and Ventura, as well as the Cities of Oakland and San Diego and the City and County of San Francisco (individually, a Prosecuting Jurisdiction). The Fourth Amended Complaint asserted a sole claim for public nuisance, alleging that the presence of lead pigments for use in paint and coatings in, on and around residences in the plaintiffs’ jurisdictions constitutes a public nuisance. The plaintiffs sought the abatement of the alleged public nuisance that exists within the plaintiffs’ jurisdictions. A trial commenced on July 15, 2013 and ended on August 22, 2013. The court entered final judgment on January 27, 2014, finding in favor of the plaintiffs and against the Company and

two

other defendants (ConAgra Grocery Products Company and NL Industries, Inc.). The final judgment held the Company jointly and severally liable with the other

two

defendants to pay

$

1.15

billion

into a fund to abate the public nuisance. The Company strongly disagrees with the judgment.

On February 18, 2014, the Company filed a motion for new trial and a motion to vacate the judgment. The court denied these motions on March 24, 2014. On March 28, 2014, the Company filed a notice of appeal to the Sixth District Court of Appeal for the State of California. Oral argument before the Sixth District Court of Appeal was held on August 24, 2017. On November 14, 2017, the Sixth District Court of Appeal entered its decision, which affirmed the trial court’s judgment of liability with respect to



residences built before 1951 and reversed and vacated the trial court’s judgment with respect to residences built after 1950. The Sixth District Court of Appeal directed the trial court to: (i) recalculate the amount of the abatement fund to limit the fund to the amount necessary to cover the cost of inspecting and remediating pre-1951 residences; and (ii) hold an evidentiary hearing to appoint a suitable receiver. On November 29, 2017, the Company and the

two

other defendants filed separate Petitions for Rehearing, which the Sixth District Court of Appeal denied on December 6, 2017. The Sixth District Court of Appeal’s decision became final on December 14, 2017. On December 22, 2017, the Company and the

two

other defendants submitted separate Petitions for Review to the California Supreme Court. On February 14, 2018, the California Supreme Court issued an order denying the Petitions for Review. On July 16, 2018, the Company filed a Petition for Writ of Certiorari with the Supreme Court of the United States seeking discretionary review. On October 15, 2018, the Supreme Court of the United States denied the Company's Petition for Writ of Certiorari.

On April 17, 2018, the parties filed their briefs with the trial court regarding the recalculation of the amount of the abatement fund. The plaintiffs proposed

$

730.0

million

as the amount of the abatement fund, and the Company and the other

two

defendants jointly proposed a maximum amount of no more than

$

409.1

million

. On August 17, 2018, the trial court held a hearing regarding the recalculation of the amount of the abatement fund. On September 4, 2018, the trial court ruled that the amount of the abatement fund is

$

409.1

million

. On March 8, 2019, the trial court approved a setoff of

$

8.0

million

to the abatement fund reducing the abatement fund to

$

401.1

million

.

On May 17, 2018, NL Industries filed a Motion for Good Faith Settlement, which the Company and ConAgra opposed. The trial court held a hearing on NL Industries’ Motion for Good Faith Settlement on July 12, 2018 and subsequently denied NL Industries' Motion. NL Industries filed a petition for writ of mandate with the Sixth District Court of Appeal seeking to obtain immediate appellate review and reversal of the denial of its motion. On June 20, 2019, the Sixth District Court of Appeal denied the petition for writ of mandate.

On April 8, 2019, the plaintiffs filed a motion to recover attorneys’ fees and litigation costs from the abatement fund. On May 10, 2019, the trial court issued a tentative ruling denying the plaintiffs’ motion for fees and costs.

On July 17, 2019, the Company, ConAgra and NL Industries reached an agreement in principle with the plaintiffs to resolve the litigation. The agreement provides for a mutual release of all pending and related future claims and contribution rights in exchange for certain payments of money over time by the Company and the other

two

defendants to the plaintiffs. More specifically, the agreement provides that, in full and final satisfaction of any and all claims of the plaintiffs, the Company and the other

two

defendants collectively shall pay a total of

$

305.0

million

, with the Company and the other

two

defendants each paying approximately

$

101.7

million

as follows: (i) an initial payment of

$

25.0

million

within

sixty days

after the entry of a dismissal order and judgment; (ii) subsequent annual payments of

$

12.0

million

one year after the initial payment and for a period of

four years

thereafter; and (iii) a final payment of approximately

$

16.7

million

on the sixth anniversary of the initial payment. Should NL Industries fail to make any of its payments required under the agreement, the Company has agreed to backstop and pay on behalf of NL Industries a maximum amount of

$

15.0

million

. To implement the agreement, the Company and the other

two

defendants filed a joint motion to dismiss with prejudice and a motion to stay all proceedings, pending the trial court’s approval of the agreement. On July 24, 2019, the trial court approved the agreement, discharged the receiver, and granted a judgment of dismissal with prejudice in favor of the Company and the other

two

defendants. The Company made its initial payment of

$

25.0

million

to the plaintiffs on September 23, 2019.

The Company accrued

$

136.3

million

for this litigation in the third quarter of 2018. During the third quarter of 2019, the Company reduced its accrual by

$

59.6

million

as a result of the final court approved agreement to resolve the litigation and the initial payment of

$

25.0

million

to the plaintiffs in accordance with the agreement. The next payment of

$

12.0

million

is due on September 22, 2020 and is included in current liabilities, while the remaining

$

64.7

million

is included in other long-term liabilities.

Pennsylvania Proceedings

.

Two

proceedings in Pennsylvania were initiated in October 2018. The County of Montgomery, Pennsylvania filed a Complaint against the Company and several other former lead-based paint and lead pigment manufacturers in the Court of Common Pleas of Montgomery County, Pennsylvania. The County of Lehigh, Pennsylvania also filed a Complaint against the Company and several other former lead-based paint and lead pigment manufacturers in the Court of Common Pleas of Lehigh County, Pennsylvania. The Company removed both actions to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania on November 28, 2018. The plaintiffs filed a motion for remand in each action on January 7, 2019, which the defendants opposed. The federal trial court remanded each action on June 5, 2019. The defendants asked the federal court to stay the order of remand pending appeal, which the federal court granted on June 27, 2019, and the defendants filed a notice of appeal with the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. On August 12, 2019, the defendants filed their opening brief with the Third Circuit, to which the plaintiffs filed their opposition brief on September 11, 2019, and the defendants filed their reply brief on October 2, 2019. The Third Circuit took the appeal under submission without oral argument, and the parties are awaiting the Third Circuit’s decision.



In both actions, the counties request declaratory relief establishing the existence of a public nuisance and the defendants' contribution to it, the abatement of an ongoing public nuisance arising from the presence of lead-based paint in housing throughout the applicable county, an injunction against future illicit conduct, and the costs of litigation and attorneys' fees.

In October 2018, the Company filed a Complaint in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania against the Pennsylvania Counties of Delaware, Erie and York seeking injunctive and declaratory relief to prevent the violation of the Company's rights under the First Amendment and Due Process Clause of the U.S. Constitution. The Company voluntarily dismissed defendant Erie County on November 9, 2018 and defendant York County on November 21, 2018. Defendant Delaware County filed a motion to dismiss the Complaint, which the federal trial court granted on October 4, 2019.  The Company appealed the federal trial court’s dismissal on November 1, 2019 and filed its opening brief in the Third Circuit on January 21, 2020.

Litigation seeking damages from alleged personal injury.

The Company and other companies are defendants in a number of legal proceedings seeking monetary damages and other relief from alleged personal injuries. These proceedings include claims by children allegedly injured from ingestion of lead pigment or lead-containing paint and claims for damages allegedly incurred by the children’s parents or guardians. These proceedings generally seek compensatory and punitive damages, and seek other relief including medical monitoring costs. These proceedings include purported claims by individuals, groups of individuals and class actions.

The plaintiff in Thomas v. Lead Industries Association, et al., initiated an action in Wisconsin state court against the Company, other alleged former lead pigment manufacturers and the Lead Industries Association in September 1999. The claims against the Company and the other defendants included strict liability, negligence, negligent misrepresentation and omissions, fraudulent misrepresentation and omissions, concert of action, civil conspiracy and enterprise liability. Implicit within these claims is the theory of “risk contribution” liability (Wisconsin’s theory which is similar to market share liability, except that liability can be joint and several) due to the plaintiff’s inability to identify the manufacturer of any product that allegedly injured the plaintiff. The case ultimately proceeded to trial and, on November 5, 2007, the jury returned a defense verdict, finding that the plaintiff had ingested white lead carbonate, but was not brain damaged or injured as a result. The plaintiff appealed and, on December 16, 2010, the Wisconsin Court of Appeals affirmed the final judgment in favor of the Company and other defendants.

Wisconsin is the only jurisdiction to date to apply a theory of liability with respect to alleged personal injury (i.e., risk contribution/market share liability) that does not require the plaintiff to identify the manufacturer of the product that allegedly injured the plaintiff in the lead pigment and lead-based paint litigation. Although the risk contribution liability theory was applied during the Thomas trial, the constitutionality of this theory as applied to the lead pigment cases has not been judicially determined by the Wisconsin state courts. However, in an unrelated action filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin, Gibson v. American Cyanamid, et al., on November 15, 2010, the District Court held that Wisconsin’s risk contribution theory as applied in that case violated the defendants’ right to substantive due process and is unconstitutionally retroactive. The District Court's decision in Gibson v. American Cyanamid, et al., was appealed by the plaintiff to the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. On July 24, 2014, the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit reversed the judgment and remanded the case back to the District Court for further proceedings. On January 16, 2015, the defendants filed a petition for certiorari in the United States Supreme Court seeking that Court's review of the Seventh Circuit's decision, and on May 18, 2015, the United States Supreme Court denied the defendants' petition. The case is currently pending in the District Court.

The United States District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin consolidated

three

cases (Ravon Owens v. American Cyanamid, et al., Cesar Sifuentes v. American Cyanamid, et al., and Glenn Burton, Jr. v. American Cyanamid, et al.) for purposes of trial. A trial commenced on May 6, 2019 and ended on May 31, 2019, with a jury verdict for the

three

plaintiffs in the amount of

$

2.0

million

each for a total of

$

6.0

million

against the Company and

two

other defendants (Armstrong Containers Inc. and E.I. du Pont de Nemours). The Company filed a motion for judgment in its favor based on public policy factors under Wisconsin law. On September 20, 2019, the trial court denied the motion and entered judgment in favor of the plaintiffs. On October 18, 2019, the Company filed post-trial motions for judgment as a matter of law and for a new trial. If the post-trial motions are denied, the Company intends to appeal the jury verdict.

In Maniya Allen, et al. v. American Cyanamid, et al., also pending in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin, cases involving

six

of the


plaintiffs were selected for discovery. In Dijonae Trammell, et al. v. American Cyanamid, et al., also pending in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin, discovery for

one

of the

three

plaintiffs was consolidated with the

six

Allen cases referenced above. The parties have selected

four

of the cases to proceed to expert discovery and to prepare for trial. On November 14, 2019, the District Court issued an order scheduling trial in the four cases to commence on June 15, 2020.

Other lead-based paint and lead pigment litigation.

In Mary Lewis v. Lead Industries Association, et al. pending in the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois, parents seek to recover the cost of their children’s blood lead testing against the Company and

three

other defendants that made (or whose alleged corporate predecessors made) white lead pigments. The Circuit Court has



certified a statewide class and a Chicago subclass of parents or legal guardians of children who lived in high-risk zip codes identified by the Illinois Department of Health and who were screened for lead toxicity between August 1995 and February 2008. Excluded from the class are those parents or guardians who have incurred no expense, liability or obligation to pay for the cost of their children’s blood lead testing. In 2017, the Company and other defendants moved for summary judgment on the grounds that the

three

named plaintiffs have not paid and have no obligation or liability to pay for their children’s blood lead testing because Medicaid paid for the children of

two

plaintiffs and private insurance paid for the third plaintiff without any evidence of a co-pay or deductible. The Circuit Court granted the motion, but on September 7, 2018, the Appellate Court reversed with respect to the

two

plaintiffs for whom Medicaid paid for their children’s testing. Defendants filed a petition with the Supreme Court of Illinois for discretionary review. By order entered January 31, 2019, that court allowed defendants’ petition for leave to appeal. The defendants filed their opening brief in the Supreme Court of Illinois on April 11, 2019, to which the plaintiffs filed a response brief on June 17, 2019. The defendants filed their reply brief on July 15, 2019. Oral argument was held before the Supreme Court of Illinois on November 14, 2019, and the parties are awaiting the decision.

Insurance coverage litigation.

The Company and its liability insurers, including certain underwriters at Lloyd’s of London, initiated legal proceedings against each other to determine, among other things, whether the costs and liabilities associated with the abatement of lead pigment are covered under certain insurance policies issued to the Company. The Company’s action, filed on March 3, 2006 in the Common Pleas Court, Cuyahoga County, Ohio, previously was stayed and inactive. On January 9, 2019, the Company filed an unopposed motion to lift the stay with the trial court, which was granted, allowing the case to proceed. On June 28, 2019, the Company and its liability insurers each filed separate motions for summary judgment seeking various forms of relief. Oral argument regarding those motions occurred on October 24, 2019, and those motions remain pending before the trial court. The liability insurers’ action, which was filed on February 23, 2006 in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York, has been dismissed. An ultimate loss in the insurance coverage litigation would mean that insurance proceeds could be unavailable under the policies at issue to mitigate any ultimate abatement related costs and liabilities. The Company has not recorded any assets related to these insurance policies or otherwise assumed that proceeds from these insurance policies would be received in estimating any contingent liability accrual. Therefore, an ultimate loss in the insurance coverage litigation without a determination of liability against the Company in the lead pigment or lead-based paint litigation will have no impact on the Company’s results of operation, liquidity or financial condition. As previously stated, however, except with respect to the litigation in California discussed above, the Company has not accrued any amounts for the lead pigment or lead-based paint litigation and any significant liability ultimately determined to be attributable to the Company relating to such litigation may result in a material impact on the Company’s results of operations, liquidity or financial condition for the annual or interim period during which such liability is accrued.

Other litigation.

On December 18, 2019, the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection, the Commissioner of the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection, and the Administrator of the New Jersey Spill Compensation Fund filed a lawsuit against the Company in the Superior Court of New Jersey Law Division in Camden County, New Jersey. The plaintiffs

s

eek to recover natural resource damages, punitive damages, and litigation fees and costs, as well as other costs, damages, declaratory relief, and penalties pursuant to New Jersey state statutes and common law theories in connection with the alleged discharge of hazardous substances and pollutants at the Company’s Gibbsboro, New Jersey site, a former manufacturing plant and related facilities. The Company intends to vigorously defend against this litigation.

Option Rights

The fair value of the Company’s option rights was estimated at the date of grant using a Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions for all options granted:

The risk-free interest rate is based upon the U.S. Treasury yield curve at the time of grant. The expected life of option rights was calculated using a scenario analysis model. Historical data was used to aggregate the holding period from actual exercises, post-vesting cancellations and hypothetical assumed exercises on all outstanding option rights. The expected dividend yield of stock is the Company’s best estimate of the expected future dividend yield. Expected volatility of stock was calculated using historical and implied volatilities.

Grants of option rights for non-qualified and incentive stock options have been awarded to certain officers and key employees under the 2006 Employee Plan. The option rights generally become exercisable to the extent of one-third of the optioned shares for each full year following the date of grant and generally expire

ten years

after the date of grant. Unrecognized compensation expense with respect to option rights granted to eligible employees amounted to

$

67.8

million

at

December 31, 2019

. The unrecognized compensation expense is being amortized on a straight-line basis over the

three

: The carrying amounts reported for Short-term borrowings approximate fair value.

•

Long-term debt (including current portion)

: The fair values of the Company’s publicly traded debt are based on quoted market prices. The fair values of the Company’s non-publicly traded debt are estimated using discounted cash flow analyses, based on the Company’s current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements. The Company's publicly traded debt and non-traded debt are classified as level 1 and level 2, respectively, in the fair value hierarchy. See the debt table below.

The following table summarizes the Company’s assets and liabilities measured on a recurring basis in accordance with the Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures Topic of the ASC:



(1)

The deferred compensation plan assets consists of the investment funds maintained for the future payments under the Company’s executive deferred compensation plans, which are structured as rabbi trusts. The investments are marketable securities accounted for under the Debt and Equity Securities Topic of the ASC. The level 1 investments are valued using quoted market prices multiplied by the number of shares. The level 2 investments are valued based on vendor quotes. The cost basis of the investment funds is

$

54.8

million

.

(2)

The net investment hedge asset is the fair value of the cross currency swap (see

Note 1

). The fair value is based on a valuation model that uses observable inputs, including interest rate curves and foreign currency rate.

(3)

The deferred compensation plan liabilities are the Company’s liabilities under its deferred compensation plans. The liabilities represent the fair value of the participant shadow accounts, and the value is based on quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets.

Except for the acquisition-related fair value measurements described in

Note 3

and the impairment described in

Note 6

, there were no assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. The acquisition and impairment-related fair value measurements qualified as level 3 measurements.

The table below summarizes the carrying amounts and fair values of the Company's publicly traded debt and non-traded debt.

NOTE 17 –

REVENUE

On January 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASU No. 2014-09, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers" (ASC 606) using the modified retrospective method applied to all contracts. Financial results included in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 are presented under ASC 606, while the year ended December 31, 2017 is presented under the previous accounting standard, ASC 605. The only significant change that resulted from the adoption of ASC 606 was that certain advertising support that was previously classified as Selling, general and administrative expenses is now classified as a reduction of revenue. This reclassification had no effect on Net income, and therefore, there was no adjustment to the opening balance of Retained earnings.

The Company manufactures and sells paint, stains, supplies, equipment and floor covering through company-operated stores, branded and private label products through retailers, and a broad range of industrial coatings directly to global manufacturing customers through company-operated branches. A large portion of the Company’s revenue is recognized at a point in time and made to customers who are not engaged in a long-term supply agreement or any form of contract with the Company. These sales are paid for at the time of sale in cash, credit card or on account with the vast majority of customers having terms between 30 and 60 days, not to exceed one year. Many customers who purchase on account take advantage of early payment discounts offered by paying within 30 days of being invoiced. The Company uses both historical information and current trends to estimate the expected amount of discounts to which customers are likely to be entitled.

The remaining revenue is governed by long-term supply agreements and related purchase orders (“contracts”) that specify shipping terms and aspects of the transaction price including rebates, discounts and other sales incentives, such as advertising support. Contracts are at standalone pricing. The performance obligation in these contracts is determined by each of the individual purchase



orders and the respective stated quantities, with revenue being recognized at a point in time when obligations under the terms of the agreement are satisfied. This generally occurs with the transfer of control of our products to the customer. Sales, value add, and other taxes we collect concurrent with revenue-producing activities are excluded from revenue. Refer to

Note 21

for the Company's disaggregation of Net sales by reportable segment. As the reportable segments are aligned by similar economic factors, trends and customers, this disaggregation best depicts how the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows are affected by economic factors.

The Company has made payments or credits for rebates or incentives at the beginning of a long-term contract where future revenue is expected and before satisfaction of performance obligations. Under these circumstances, the Company recognizes a contract asset and amortizes these prepayments over the expected benefit life of the long-term contract typically on a straight-line basis.

The majority of variable consideration in the Company’s contracts include a form of volume rebate, discounts, and other incentives, where the customer receives a retrospective percentage rebate based on the amount of their purchases. In these situations, the rebates are accrued as a fixed percentage of sales and recorded as a reduction of net sales until paid to the customer per the terms of the supply agreement. Forms of variable consideration such as tiered rebates, whereby a customer receives a retrospective price decrease dependent on the volume of their purchases, are calculated using a forecasted percentage to determine the most likely amount to accrue. Management creates a baseline calculation using historical sales and then utilizing forecast information, estimates the anticipated sales volume each quarter to calculate the expected reduction to sales. The remainder of the transaction price is fixed as agreed upon with the customer, limiting estimation of revenues including constraints.

The Company’s Accounts receivable and current and long-term contract assets and liabilities are summarized in the following table.

The difference between the opening and closing balances of the Company’s contract assets and contract liabilities primarily results from the timing difference between the Company’s performance and the customer’s payment.

Provisions for returns are established and the expected costs continue to be recognized as contra-revenue per ASC 606 when the products are sold. The Company only offers an assurance type warranty on products sold, and there is no material service to the customer beyond fixing defects that existed at the time of sale and no warranties are sold separately.

Warranty liabilities are excluded from the table above and discussed in

Note 1

. Amounts recognized during the year from deferred revenue were not material. The Company records a right of return liability within each of its operations to accrue for expected customer returns. Historical actual returns are used to estimate future returns as a percentage of current sales. Obligations for returns and refunds were not material individually or in the aggregate.

Other General Expense - Net

Included in

Other general expense - net

were the following:

Provisions for environmental matters–net represent initial provisions for site-specific estimated costs of environmental investigation or remediation and increases or decreases to environmental-related accruals as information becomes available upon which more accurate costs can be reasonably estimated and as additional accounting guidelines are issued. During 2018, the Company reached a series of agreements on remediation plans at one of the Company's four major sites, resulting in a significant



increase to provisions for environmental matters–net for 2018. See

Note 10

for further details on the Company’s environmental-related activities.

The

Indirect tax credits includes a gain of

$

33.5

million

recognized by Sherwin-Williams do Brasil Industria e Comercio Ltda. (Sherwin-Williams Brazil) in the fourth quarter of 2019 related to the recovery of certain social contribution (PIS/COFINS) taxes paid over gross sales including ICMS receipts, a type of state level value-added tax in Brazil. In 2014, Sherwin-Williams Brazil filed a lawsuit against the Brazilian tax authorities to challenge the inclusion of ICMS on the PIS/COFINS tax base. During 2019, Sherwin-Williams Brazil received a favorable final, non-appealable decision against the Brazilian tax authorities. Upon clarification regarding monetization of the credits, the Company recognized the benefit. The Brazilian Office of the Attorney General of the National Treasury has sought clarification from the Brazilian Federal Supreme Court of certain matters, including the amount (i.e. gross or net credit amount) and timing of these credits. Clarification is expected to be provided in the first half of 2020. If the Brazilian tax authorities challenge the amount or timing of these credits, the Company may become subject to new litigation related to the indirect tax credits already monetized or it could affect the Company's ability to monetize future indirect tax credits.

Other income and Other expense included items of revenue, gains, expenses and losses that were unrelated to the primary business purpose of the Company. There were no items within Other income or Other expense that were individually significant at

NOTE 19 –

INCOME TAXES

During 2019, the Company recorded an increase to the tax provision of

$

74.3

million

related to the reversal of net tax benefits recognized in previous tax years from federal renewable energy tax credit funds with DC Solar Solutions, Inc. and certain of its affiliates (“DC Solar”). During 2011 and 2013 through 2017, the Company invested in legal entities ("Funds") that purchased mobile solar generators from DC Solar. In December 2018, the Company became aware of an ongoing investigation by federal authorities, which included the seizure of DC Solar's assets. The Company promptly initiated an investigation. During the second quarter of 2019, based on additional information revealed during the course of the investigation, the Company determined that it is more likely than not that the tax benefits expected to be received by the Company related to its investments in the Funds will no longer be ultimately realizable. The facts relating to Company investments in the Funds continue to be developed and there are, and will continue to be, material differences in facts relevant to each Fund, as well as to funds owned by other investors. The ultimate tax results relating to the Company's investments continue to be uncertain. The Company’s management will continue to use its best judgment based upon the facts and circumstances related to the Company's investments in the Funds when determining



the scope and timing of disclosures. The Company continues to participate with other fund investors to gather facts and obtain expert advice in assessing its tax position in these investments.

On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Act) was enacted. The Tax Act significantly revised the U.S. corporate income tax system by, among other things, lowering corporate income tax rates from

35%

to

21%

, implementing a territorial tax system and imposing a repatriation tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 118 provided a measurement period that should not extend beyond one year from the enactment date for companies to complete the accounting under the Tax Act.

In accordance with SAB No. 118, based on the information available as of December 31, 2017 the Company recorded a provisional reduction of income taxes of

$

607.9

million

as a result of the Tax Act. The Company’s deferred tax liabilities were reduced by

$

560.2

million

due to the lower income tax rate. The remaining

$

47.7

million

is the effects of the implementation of the territorial tax system and the remeasurement of U.S. deferred tax liabilities on unremitted foreign earnings.

During the second quarter of 2018, the Company made purchase accounting adjustments related to the Valspar acquisition which resulted in the reversal of

$

27.5

million

of income tax benefits related to the remeasurement of U.S. deferred tax liabilities. No other material adjustments were made under SAB No. 118 for the 2018 tax year. The Company completed its analysis of the Tax Act and finalized its accounting in the fourth quarter of 2018.

Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes using the enacted tax rates and laws that are currently in effect.

Significant components of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities as of

December 31, 2019

,


and


were as follows:

As of

December 31, 2019

, the Company’s net deferred income tax liability relates primarily to deferred tax liabilities recorded for intangible assets acquired through the Valspar acquisition.

Netted against the Company’s other deferred tax assets were valuation allowances of

$

84.6

million

,

$

73.5

million

and

$

44.1

million

at

December 31, 2019

,


and


, respectively. The increase in the valuation allowance in


is primarily due to net operating losses of certain foreign subsidiaries, as well as foreign tax credit carryforwards due to uncertainty of their realization. The Company has

$

21.3

million

of domestic net operating loss carryforwards acquired through acquisitions that have expiration dates through the tax year 2037, foreign tax credits of

$

22.5

million

that expire in calendar years 2027 through 2029 and foreign net operating losses of

$

311.9

million

. The foreign net operating losses are related to various jurisdictions that provide for both indefinite carryforward periods and others with carryforward periods that range from the tax years


to 2039.



Significant components of the provisions for income taxes were as follows:

Under provisions of the Tax Act, the Company received an income tax benefit of

$

10.4

million

and

$

8.6

million

in 2019 and 2018, respectively, related to foreign derived intangible income and incurred income tax expense of

$

7.9

million

and

$

5.5

million

in 2019 and 2018, respectively, related to Global Intangible Low Taxed Income (GILTI). The Company has made an accounting policy election to record GILTI as a period cost.

Significant components of income before income taxes as used for income tax purposes, were as follows:

A reconciliation of the statutory federal income tax rate to the effective tax rate follows:

The increase in the effective tax rate for 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily due to an increase to the 2019 tax provision of

$

74.3

million

related to the reversal of net tax benefits recognized in previous tax years from federal renewable energy tax credit funds with DC Solar. In addition, the Company had received tax benefits in 2018 from filing amended U.S. income tax returns. The Company did not receive any significant tax benefits in 2019 related to amended returns. Due to the expiration of various state statutes that reduced potential audit exposure, favorable adjustments to 2018 state income tax returns filed in 2019 and the recognition of favorable tax attributes related to state tax credits the negative impact of state and local income taxes decreased in 2019 compared to 2018. The tax benefit related to employee share based payments in 2019 was consistent with the benefit in 2018. There were no significant adjustments recorded in the 2019 tax year related to the Tax Act.



The Company and its subsidiaries file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, and various state and foreign jurisdictions. The IRS is currently auditing the Company’s 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2016 income tax returns. No significant adjustments have been proposed by the IRS at this point in the audits. As of

December 31, 2019

, the federal statute of limitations has not expired for the 2013 through 2018 tax years.

As of

December 31, 2019

, the Company is subject to non-U.S. income tax examinations for the tax years of 2013 through


. In addition, the Company is subject to state and local income tax examinations for the tax years 1998 through


.

A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:

The increase in unrecognized tax benefits was primarily due to the reversal of tax benefits recognized in previous tax years from federal renewable energy tax credit funds as discussed above. Other increases in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits at

December 31, 2019

were related to a number of positions taken on current and amended income tax returns filed in the U.S. federal, and various state and foreign jurisdictions. At

December 31, 2019

,


and


, the Company had unrecognized tax benefits of

$

195.3

million

,

$

83.0

million

,

$

49.5

million

, respectively, the recognition of which would have an effect on the effective tax rate.

Included in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits at

December 31, 2019

is

$

17.3

million

related to tax positions for which it is reasonably possible that the total amounts could significantly change during the next twelve months. This amount represents a decrease in unrecognized tax benefits comprised primarily of items related to federal audits of partnership investments and expiring statutes in federal, foreign and state jurisdictions.

The Company classifies all income tax related interest and penalties as income tax expense. During the year ended

December 31, 2019

, there was an increase in income tax interest and penalties of

$

1.6

million

. There was an increase in income tax interest and penalties of

$

4.9

million

and a decrease of

$

.8

million

for the years ended

December 31, 2018

and


, respectively. The Company  accrued

$

26.2

million

,

$

24.8

million

and

$

14.6

million

at

December 31, 2019

,


and


, respectively, for the potential payment of interest and penalties.

REPORTABLE SEGMENT INFORMATION

The Company reports its segment information in the same way that management internally organizes its business for assessing performance and making decisions regarding allocation of resources in accordance with the Segment Reporting Topic of the ASC. The Company has

three

reportable operating segments: The Americas Group, Consumer Brands Group and Performance Coatings Group (individually, a Reportable Segment and collectively, the Reportable Segments). Factors considered in determining the

three

Reportable Segments of the Company include the nature of business activities, the management structure directly accountable to the Company’s chief operating decision maker (CODM) for operating and administrative activities, availability of discrete financial information and information presented to the Board of Directors. The Company reports all other business activities and immaterial operating segments that are not reportable in the Administrative segment.

The Company’s CODM has been identified as the Chief Executive Officer because he has final authority over performance assessment and resource allocation decisions. Because of the diverse operations of the Company, the CODM regularly receives discrete financial information about each Reportable Segment as well as a significant amount of additional financial information about certain divisions, business units or subsidiaries of the Company. The CODM uses all such financial information for performance assessment and resource allocation decisions. The CODM evaluates the performance of and allocates resources to the Reportable Segments based on segment profit or loss and cash generated from operations. The accounting policies of the Reportable Segments are the same as those described in

Note 1

of this report.



The Americas Group consisted of

4,758

company-operated specialty paint stores in the United States, Canada, Latin America and the Caribbean region at

December 31, 2019

. Each store in this segment is engaged in servicing the needs of architectural and industrial paint contractors and do-it-yourself homeowners. The Americas Group company-owned stores market and sell Sherwin-Williams

®

and other controlled brand architectural paint and coatings, protective and marine products, OEM product finishes and related products. The majority of these products are produced by manufacturing facilities in the Consumer Brands Group. In addition, each store sells select purchased associated products. The Americas Group sells a variety of architectural paints, coatings and related products through dedicated dealers, home centers, distributors, hardware stores and other retailers throughout Latin America. The Americas Group meets regional customer demands through developing, licensing, manufacturing, distributing and selling a variety of architectural paints, coatings and related products in North and South America. The loss of any single customer would not have a material adverse effect on the business of this segment. At

December 31, 2019

, The Americas Group consisted of operations from subsidiaries in


foreign countries. During


, this segment opened


net new stores, consisting of


new stores opened (


in the United States,


in Canada, and


in South America) and


stores closed (


in the United States,


in South America and


in Mexico). In


and


, this segment opened


and


net new stores, respectively. The CODM uses discrete financial information about The Americas Group, supplemented with information by geographic region, product type and customer type, to assess performance of and allocate resources to The Americas Group as a whole. In accordance with ASC 280-10-50-9, The Americas Group as a whole is considered the operating segment, and because it meets the criteria in ASC 280-10-50-10, it is also considered a Reportable Segment.

The Consumer Brands Group supplies a broad portfolio of branded and private-label architectural paints, stains, varnishes, industrial products, wood finishes products, wood preservatives, applicators, corrosion inhibitors, aerosols, caulks and adhesives to retailers and distributors throughout North America, as well as in Australia, New Zealand, China and Europe. The Consumer Brands Group also supports the Company's other businesses around the world with new product research and development, manufacturing, distribution and logistics. Approximately


%

of the total sales of the Consumer Brands Group in


were intersegment transfers of products primarily sold through The Americas Group. At

December 31, 2019

, the Consumer Brands Group consisted of operations in the United States and subsidiaries in


foreign countries. Sales and marketing of certain controlled brand and private labeled products is performed by a direct sales staff. The products distributed through third-party customers are intended for resale to the ultimate end-user of the product. The Consumer Brands Group had sales to certain customers that, individually, may be a significant portion of the sales of the segment. However, the loss of any single customer would not have a material adverse effect on the overall profitability of the segment. This segment incurred most of the Company’s capital expenditures related to ongoing environmental compliance measures at sites currently in operation. The CODM uses discrete financial information about the Consumer Brands Group, supplemented with information by product type and customer type, to assess performance of and allocate resources to the Consumer Brands Group as a whole. In accordance with ASC 280-10-50-9, the Consumer Brands Group as a whole is considered the operating segment, and because it meets the criteria in ASC 280-10-50-10, it is also considered a Reportable Segment.

The Performance Coatings Group develops and sells industrial coatings for wood finishing and general industrial (metal and plastic) applications, automotive refinish, protective and marine coatings, coil coatings, packaging coatings and performance-based resins and colorants worldwide. This segment licenses certain technology and trade names worldwide. Sherwin-Williams

®

and other controlled brand products are distributed through The Americas Group and this segment’s


company-operated branches and by a direct sales staff and outside sales representatives to retailers, dealers, jobbers, licensees and other third-party distributors. The Performance Coatings Group had sales to certain customers that, individually, may be a significant portion of the sales of the segment. However, the loss of any single customer would not have a material adverse effect on the overall profitability of the segment. During


, this segment opened


new branches and closed


branches for a net decrease of


branch. At

December 31, 2019

, the Performance Coatings Group consisted of operations in the United States and subsidiaries in


foreign countries. The CODM uses discrete financial information about the Performance Coatings Group, supplemented with information about geographic divisions, business units and subsidiaries, to assess performance of and allocate resources to the Performance Coatings Group as a whole. In accordance with ASC 280-10-50-9, the Performance Coatings Group as a whole is considered the operating segment, and because it meets the criteria in ASC 280-10-50-10, it is also considered a Reportable Segment.

The Administrative segment includes the administrative expenses of the Company’s corporate headquarters site. Also included in the Administrative segment is interest expense, interest and investment income, certain expenses related to closed facilities and environmental-related matters, and other expenses which are not directly associated with the Reportable Segments. The Administrative segment does not include any significant foreign operations. Also included in the Administrative segment is a real estate management unit that is responsible for the ownership, management and leasing of non-retail properties held primarily for use by the Company, including the Company’s headquarters site, and disposal of idle facilities. Sales of this segment represents external leasing revenue of excess headquarters space or leasing of facilities no longer used by the Company in its primary businesses. Material gains and losses from the sale of property are infrequent and not a significant operating factor in determining the performance of the Administrative segment.

No single geographic area outside the United States was significant relative to consolidated net external sales or consolidated long-lived assets. Export sales and sales to any individual customer were each

less than 10 percent of consolidated sales to unaffiliated customers

during all years presented.

In the reportable segment financial information that follows, Segment profit was total net sales and intersegment transfers less operating costs and expenses. Identifiable assets were those directly identified with each reportable segment. The Administrative segment assets consisted primarily of cash and cash equivalents, investments, deferred pension assets and headquarters property, plant and equipment. The margin for each reportable segment was based upon total net sales and intersegment transfers. Domestic intersegment transfers were primarily accounted for at the approximate fully absorbed manufactured cost, based on normal capacity volumes, plus customary distribution costs for paint products. Non-paint domestic and all international intersegment transfers were accounted for at values comparable to normal unaffiliated customer sales. All intersegment transfers are eliminated within the Administrative segment.
