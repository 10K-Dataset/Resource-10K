PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS

Overview

We are North America’s

No. 1 specialty retailer of consumer electronics, personal computers,

entertainment software and appliances with revenues for our fiscal year ended

March 2, 2002, of $19.6 billion. We operate retail stores and commercial Web

sites under the brand names Best Buy (BestBuy.com), Media Play (MediaPlay.com),

On Cue (OnCue.com), Sam Goody (SamGoody.com), Suncoast (Suncoast.com), Magnolia

Hi-Fi (MagnoliaHiFi.com) and Future Shop (FutureShop.ca).

We began in 1966 as an

audio components retailer, and in the early 1980s, with the introduction of the

videocassette recorder, expanded into video products. In 1983, we revised our

marketing strategy and began using mass-merchandising techniques, which

included offering a wider variety of products and operating stores under a

“superstore” concept. In 1989, we dramatically changed our method of retailing

by introducing a self-service, noncommissioned, discount–style store

concept designed to give the customer more control over the purchasing process.

The Best Buy store concept, now employed in 481 stores across the United

States, has continued to evolve to include more interactive displays and, for

certain products, a higher level of customer service, with the latest version

including a more effective labor model and improved merchandising. In fiscal

2000, we introduced a small–market Best Buy store concept that serves

communities of generally less than 200,000 people and offers merchandise in the

same product categories as larger stores, with a product assortment tailored to

each respective community. In fiscal 2001, we re-launched Best Buy stores

online shopping site, BestBuy.com. Our clicks-and-mortar strategy is designed

to empower consumers to research and purchase products seamlessly across the

Best Buy retail environment — online or in retail stores. The online site

offers products in all of Best Buy stores’ principal product categories except

appliances.

In the fourth quarter of

fiscal 2001, we acquired the common stock of Magnolia Hi-Fi, Inc. for $88

million in cash, including transaction costs, and the common stock of Musicland

Stores Corporation for $425 million, including transaction costs, plus

long-term debt valued at $271 million. Magnolia Hi-Fi is a Seattle-based,

high-end retailer of audio and video products that operates 13 stores in

Washington, Oregon and California. We believe Magnolia Hi-Fi has expansion

potential of up to 150 stores nationwide. However, prior to pursuing an

aggressive growth strategy, we believe we must refine the store concept and

broaden the scope of products and services currently offered at Magnolia Hi-Fi.

Musicland is one of the largest national retailers of movies, prerecorded

music, video games and other entertainment–related products with 1,321

stores in 49 states, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico

and the Virgin Islands. Our intention is to enhance the Musicland business by

improving the customer experience and diversifying the revenue mix, thereby

boosting sales productivity and profitability. We also view Musicland’s

small-market stores as an attractive growth opportunity. In the third quarter

of fiscal 2002, we acquired the common stock of Future Shop Ltd. for $368

million, net of cash acquired, including transaction costs. Future Shop, which

currently operates 95 stores, is Canada’s largest consumer electronics retailer

and offers product categories similar to that at Best Buy stores. We acquired

Future Shop to further our expansion plans, leverage our expertise in consumer

electronics retailing and increase shareholder value. The acquisition marked

our initial expansion into international operations. Additional information

regarding our acquisitions is included in note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated

Financial Statements on page 41 of our Annual Report, contained in exhibit 13.1

to this report, and is incorporated herein by reference.

Our vision is to make

life fun and easy. Our business strategy is to bring technology and consumers

together in a retail environment that focuses on educating consumers on the

features and benefits of technology and entertainment while maximizing overall

profitability. We believe our stores offer consumers meaningful advantages in

store environment, product value, selection and service, all of which further

our objective of achieving a significant market share in the markets we serve.

The acquisitions of Musicland, Magnolia Hi-Fi and Future Shop give us access to

new distribution channels, more customer visits and the ability to leverage

Best Buy stores’ core competencies with their operations. We also expect

additional benefits from the cross merchandising of products and information sharing

across our distribution channels.

Operating

Segments

We

currently operate three segments: Best Buy, Musicland and International. Best

Buy is primarily a specialty retailer of consumer electronics, home office

equipment, entertainment software and appliances. Also included in the Best Buy

segment is Seattle-based Magnolia Hi-Fi, a high-end retailer of audio and video

products. The Musicland segment is primarily a mall-based retailer of movies,

prerecorded music, video games and other entertainment-related products. The

International segment consists of Future Shop, a specialty retailer of consumer

electronics, home office equipment, entertainment software and appliances with

operations in Canada.

The following table

reconciles stores open at the end of fiscal 2001 to the number of stores open

at the end of the fiscal 2002:


* The International segment consists of Future Shop stores. Future Shop

was acquired in the third quarter of fiscal 2002.

Best

Buy Stores

Overview

At the end of fiscal

2002, we operated 481 Best Buy stores in 44 states. The stores average 44,900

retail square feet and produce average annual sales of approximately

$38 million. Best Buy stores collectively represent 21.6 million

retail square feet, or 67% of our total retail square footage. During fiscal

2002, we launched our latest store concept, which features flexible

architecture, improved merchandising, faster checkout, better product

adjacencies and a more efficient labor model. Most new Best Buy stores opened

in fiscal 2003 are expected to incorporate the features of this latest store

format.

The following table reconciles Best Buy stores open at the beginning

and end of each of the last five fiscal years:

Merchandise

Best

Buy stores generally offer merchandise in five product categories: consumer

electronics, home office, entertainment software, appliances and “other”

products. Consumer electronics, Best Buy’s largest category, based on revenues,

consists of video and audio equipment. Video products include television sets,

DVD players, cameras, camcorders, VCRs and digital broadcast satellite systems.

Audio products include car stereos, portable audio equipment, home theater

audio systems, audio components, shelf systems and speakers. The home office

category includes desktop and notebook computers and related peripheral

equipment, telephones, wireless communication devices and personal digital

assistants. Entertainment software products include compact discs, video game

hardware and software, DVD and VHS movies, and computer software. The appliance

category includes major appliances such as washers, dryers, ranges,

refrigerators, freezers and dishwashers, as well as vacuums, microwaves and

housewares. The “other” product category includes extended service contracts,

blank recording media, furniture, and other miscellaneous products such as

batteries, business cases and storage products.

The following table presents Best Buy stores’ sales, by category, as a

percentage of total Best Buy stores’ sales:


Operations

Best Buy stores follow

standardized and detailed operating procedures called Standard Operating

Platform (SOP). The SOP includes procedures for inventory management,

transaction processing, customer relations, store administration, product sales

and merchandise display.

Best Buy store operations

are organized into three divisions. Each division is divided into regions and

is under the supervision of a senior vice president who oversees store

performance through regional vice presidents. Regional vice presidents have

responsibility for a number of districts within their respective region.

District managers monitor store operations closely and meet regularly with

store managers to discuss merchandising, new product introductions, sales

promotions, customer loyalty programs, employee satisfaction surveys and store

operating performance. Similar meetings are conducted at the corporate level

with divisional and regional management. A senior vice president of retail

operations has overall responsibility for retail store processing and

operations including labor management. Each district also has a loss prevention

manager, with product security personnel employed at each store to control

inventory shrinkage. Advertising, merchandise buying and pricing, and inventory

policies for Best Buy stores are centrally controlled.

Best Buy stores are open

seven days a week for approximately 73 hours a week. A store is typically

staffed by one manager and four to five assistant managers. The average staff

ranges from 65 to 150 people, depending on store size and sales volume.

Distribution

Generally, merchandise is shipped to Best Buy stores from six

distribution centers located in California, Georgia, Minnesota, Ohio, Oklahoma

and Virginia. Best Buy stores also currently operate a dedicated distribution

center for entertainment software in Minnesota. In fiscal 2004, we expect to

open an additional general distribution center in upstate New York. The

majority of Best Buy stores’ merchandise, except for major appliances and

large-screen televisions, is shipped directly from manufacturers to a

distribution center. Major appliances and large-screen televisions are shipped

to satellite warehouses in each major market. Best Buy stores are dependent

upon the distribution centers for inventory storage and shipment of most

merchandise. However, in order to meet release dates for selected products and

to improve inventory management, certain merchandise is shipped directly to the

stores from manufacturers and distributors. We believe distribution centers can

most effectively service Best Buy stores within a 600 to 700-mile radius and

that our current distribution centers, and the planned addition of the New York

distribution center in fiscal 2004, will accommodate expansion plans for the

next several years. On average, Best Buy stores receive product shipments two

or three times a week depending on sales volume. Generally, e-commerce

merchandise sales are either picked up at Best Buy retail stores, or fulfilled

through the distribution centers.

Seasonality

Similar

to many retailers, Best Buy stores’ business is seasonal. Revenues and earnings

are typically greater during the second half of the fiscal year, which includes

the holiday selling season.

Competition

Best

Buy stores’ industry is highly competitive. Best Buy stores compete nationally

against other consumer electronics retailers, specialty home office retailers,

mass merchants, home improvement superstores, entertainment software

superstores, electronics boutiques and a growing number of direct-to-consumer

alternatives. Best Buy stores also compete against independent dealers,

regional chain discount stores, wholesale clubs, mail-order and Internet

retailers, video rental stores and other specialty retail stores. Mass

merchandisers continue to increase their assortment of consumer electronics

products—primarily those that are less complex to sell, install and operate.

Similarly, large home improvement retailers are expanding their assortment of appliances.

In addition, consumers are increasingly downloading entertainment and computer

software directly via the Internet.

We believe Best Buy stores’ formats and brand

marketing strategies distinguish them from most competitors by positioning Best

Buy retail stores as the destination for new technology and entertainment

products in a fun, informative and no-pressure shopping environment. Best Buy

stores compete by aggressively advertising and emphasizing a broad product

assortment, value pricing and financing alternatives. In addition, we believe

our e-commerce operations, coupled with the knowledgeable sales associates and

service capabilities of Best Buy retail stores, have effectively positioned us

to compete successfully despite an increasingly competitive environment.

Magnolia

Hi-Fi

Overview

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001, we acquired Magnolia Hi-Fi, a

retailer of high-end consumer electronics, founded in Seattle in


1954. At the end of fiscal 2002, Magnolia Hi-Fi operated 13 stores in

Washington, Oregon and California that average 10,200 retail square feet and

generate average annual sales per store of $7.6 million. Collectively,

Magnolia Hi-Fi stores represent approximately 133,000 retail square feet, less

than 1% of our total retail square footage.

The following table reconciles Magnolia Hi-Fi stores open at the

beginning and end of each fiscal year since the date of acquisition:

Merchandise

Magnolia Hi-Fi stores offer audio and video systems for homes,

automobiles and businesses, as well as certain consumer electronics and

wireless communication devices. Magnolia Hi-Fi also operates a state-of-the-art

design center, as well as in-house repair and installation departments. In

addition, Magnolia Hi-Fi provides custom home and car installation services.

The following table presents Magnolia Hi-Fi sales, by category, as a

percentage of total Magnolia Hi-Fi sales:

Operations

Magnolia Hi-Fi stores are

typically managed by a store manager, an audio/video sales manager and a mobile

electronics sales manager. Most Magnolia Hi–Fi stores are open seven days

a week for 65 to 75 hours a week. Depending on an individual store’s volume,

store staffing includes 10 to 28 commissioned sales personnel, two to six

commissioned mobile electronic installers, and two to 11 digital product sales

personnel, cashiers and warehouse personnel. Advertising, merchandise buying

and pricing, and inventory policies for Magnolia Hi-Fi stores are centrally

controlled.

Distribution

Magnolia

Hi-Fi’s merchandise inventory is received and warehoused at its distribution

center in Washington as well as a regional warehouse in California. All

inventory is bar coded and scanned to ensure accurate inventory tracking. In

addition, a computerized inventory replenishment program is used to maintain

optimal inventory levels at each retail store location.

Merchandise is delivered to retail

stores an average of four times each week, via Magnolia Hi-Fi’s in-house

distribution system.

Seasonality

Similar

to many retailers, Magnolia Hi-Fi’s business is seasonal. Revenues and earnings

are typically greater during the second half of the fiscal year, which includes

the holiday selling season.

Competition

Magnolia Hi-Fi competes with a variety of national, regional and local

retailers, including large consumer electronics superstores, mass merchants and

small specialty stores.

Magnolia Hi-Fi has positioned itself between large mass merchants and

high-end specialty boutiques. We believe Magnolia Hi-Fi’s superior-quality

product offerings, its extensively trained sales staff and its focus on

exceptional customer service both before and after the sale, in combination

with the leveraging of Best Buy stores’ core competencies, effectively position

Magnolia Hi-Fi to meet current and future competitive challenges.

Musicland Segment

Overview

Musicland, which was

acquired in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001, is one of the largest national

retailers of movies, prerecorded music, video games and other entertainment–related

products. Its mall-based stores include the Sam Goody and Suncoast brands. In

addition, Musicland operates small-market On Cue stores and metropolitan, large–format

Media Play stores. At the end of fiscal 2002, Musicland operated 1,321 stores

in 49 states, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the

Virgin Islands, with 8.8 million total retail square feet, or

approximately 27% of our total retail square footage. Additional information

regarding our


Musicland operating

segment is included in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of

Operations and Financial Condition beginning on page 24 of our Annual Report,

contained in exhibit 13.1 to this report, and is incorporated herein by

reference. In addition, selected Musicland segment financial data is included

in note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page 52

of our Annual Report, contained in exhibit 13.1 to this report and, is

incorporated herein by reference.

The following is a general overview of Musicland’s four retail store

concepts:

Sam Goody

- Sam Goody

stores are predominantly located in malls and average approximately 4,800

retail square feet, although they range in size from 1,000 to 30,000 square

feet. At the end of fiscal 2002, we operated 615 Sam Goody stores in 48 states,

the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the Virgin

Islands. The total retail square footage of Sam Goody stores was approximately

3.0 million square feet, or 9% of our total retail square footage. Sam

Goody stores average approximately $1.2 million in annual revenues per

location.

Suncoast -

Suncoast

stores are

mall-based and average approximately 2,400 retail square feet. At the end of

fiscal 2002, there were 398 Suncoast stores in 47 states, the District of

Columbia and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. The total retail square footage

of Suncoast stores was approximately 1.0 million square feet, or 3% of our

total retail square footage. Suncoast stores average approximately

$1.1 million in annual revenues per location.

On Cue

- On Cue

stores are located in small or rural cities, generally with populations of

10,000 to 30,000, and average approximately 6,100 retail square feet. At the

end of fiscal 2002, we operated 232 On Cue stores in 32 states with total

retail square footage of approximately 1.4 million square feet, or 4% of

our total retail square footage. On Cue stores average approximately $700,000

in annual revenues per location. In fiscal 2003, we announced plans to begin

changing the name of On Cue stores to the Sam Goody name as the result of brand

recognition research we conducted during fiscal 2002.

Media Play -

Media

Play is a superstore format retailer located in metropolitan markets. Media

Play stores are operated primarily in freestanding and strip mall locations in

urban and suburban areas and average approximately 45,000 retail square feet.

At the end of fiscal 2002, we operated 76 Media Play stores in 19 states with

total retail square footage of approximately 3.4 million, or 11% of our

total retail square footage. Media Play stores average approximately

$7.3 million in annual revenues per location.

Merchandise

The following is an overview of the merchandise offered at each of

Musicland’s four retail store concepts:

Sam Goody -

Sam

Goody stores generally offer music entertainment products such as compact

discs, DVD’s, audiocassettes, music and movie videos, sheet music,

music-inspired apparel, posters and other music-related accessories. In fiscal

2002, we launched a new mix of products in Sam Goody stores. We doubled the

assortment of DVD movies and introduced video gaming, categories that carry

lower profit margins but are expected to generate higher sales growth. We also

expanded our assortment of hardware products that play music and movies, a

natural extension of Sam Goody’s principal product offerings.

Suncoast -

Suncoast

stores feature newly released and classic movies, special interest videos and

video recordings of popular TV shows. Complementary products include apparel,

posters and other products inspired by new releases, as well as blank

videotapes, storage cases and other video-related accessories.

On Cue -

On

Cue stores provide a wide assortment of entertainment products including

movies, music, books, computer software, electronics, video games and related

products.

Media Play -

Media

Play offers a large assortment of entertainment products including movies,

music, books, computer software, video games, electronics, musical instruments

and toys.

The following table presents Musicland sales, by category, as a

percentage of total Musicland sales:


Operations

Sam Goody, Suncoast and

On Cue stores are typically managed by a store manager and an assistant

manager. Media Play stores are typically managed by a general manager, an

assistant general manager and three to five department managers. Most Musicland

stores are open from 65 to 80 hours per week, seven days a week, depending

on mall hours. Store staffing levels fluctuate with the size of the store and

anticipated sales volume. Advertising, merchandise buying and pricing, and

inventory policies for Musicland stores are centrally controlled.

Distribution

The majority of

Musicland’s inventory is shipped from its distribution center located in

Indiana. From time to time, in order to meet release dates for selected

products and to improve inventory management, certain merchandise is shipped

directly to the stores from manufacturers and distributors.

Seasonality

Similar to many retailers, Musicland’s business is

seasonal. Revenues and earnings are typically greater during the second half of

the fiscal year, which includes the holiday selling season.

Competition

Musicland’s industry is

highly competitive. Increased downloading of entertainment and computer

software directly via the Internet, the progression of CD recording technology

and slumping music sales have all led to more intense competitive conditions.

The industry has begun to test various copy-protection techniques as a

potential means to mitigate the impact of CD recording technology advancements.

Musicland retail stores also compete with specialty retail chains, mass

merchants, bookstores and consumer electronics stores, as well as video rental

stores, mail order clubs and various Internet-based retailers.

We believe that

Musicland’s convenience-based strategy, service levels and broad product

assortment, in combination with the leveraging of Best Buy stores’ core

competencies and the re-merchandising strategy, position Musicland to meet

current and future competitive challenges.

International Segment

Overview

At the end of fiscal 2002, we operated 95 Future Shop

stores in 10 Canadian provinces. The stores average 20,200 retail square feet

and produce average annual sales of approximately $15.3 million per store.

Future Shop stores collectively represent 1.9 million retail square feet,

or 6% of our total retail square footage. Reference is made to Part II, Item

7A., “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk,” of this

report for a discussion regarding risks associated with foreign operations.

The International segment was established in

connection with our acquisition of Future Shop in November of fiscal 2002. At

the end of fiscal 2002, Future Shop operated 95 stores and was Canada’s largest

consumer electronics retailer. Additional information regarding our

International operating segment is included in Management’s Discussion and

Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition beginning on page 25

of our Annual Report, contained in exhibit 13.1 to this report, and is

incorporated herein by reference. In addition, selected International segment

financial data is included in note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial

Statements on page 52 of our Annual Report, contained in exhibit 13.1 to this

Merchandise

Future Shop stores offer a large assortment of home office equipment,

consumer electronics, entertainment software and appliances. Home office

equipment includes products such as desktop and notebook computers and related

peripheral equipment, telephones, wireless communication devices and personal

digital assistants. Consumer electronics include products such as television

sets, DVD players, cameras, camcorders, VCRs and digital broadcast satellite

systems. Entertainment software includes products such as compact discs, video

game hardware and software, DVD and VHS movies and computer software.

Appliances include major


appliances such as washers, dryers, ranges, refrigerators, freezers and

dishwashers, as well as vacuums, microwaves and housewares.

The following table presents Future Shop sales, by category, as a

percentage of total sales:

*

Since date of acquisition on November 4, 2001

Operations

Future Shop stores use a

standardized operating system. The operating system includes procedures for

inventory management, transaction processing, customer relations, store

administration, staff training and performance appraisal as well as merchandise

display. Advertising, merchandise buying and pricing, and inventory policies

for Future Shop stores are centrally controlled.

Future Shop’s store operations are organized into three divisions, each

headed by a vice president. Each vice president has several regional managers

who closely monitor store operations and meet regularly with store managers to

review management and staff training programs, as well as customer feedback and

requests, store operating performance and other matters. Meetings involving

store management, product managers, advertising, financial and administrative

staff, as well as senior regional and global headquarters personnel, are held

quarterly to review operating results and to establish future objectives.

Future Shop stores are typically open seven days a week for

approximately 60 to 75 hours a week. A typical store is staffed by a general

manager, several department sales managers, a customer service manager and 35

to 45 associate staff, depending on store size and sales volume.

Distribution

The majority of Future Shop’s merchandise, exclusive of appliances, is

shipped directly from suppliers to distribution centers in British Columbia and

Ontario. Future Shop uses contract carriers to ship merchandise from the

distribution centers to retail stores. Appliance sales are fulfilled by the

distribution centers or by a contracted third-party distributor. Future Shop stores

are dependent upon the distribution centers for inventory storage and shipment

of most merchandise. However, in order to meet release dates for selected

products, and to improve inventory management, certain merchandise is shipped

directly to the stores from manufacturers and distributors. While Future Shop

stores typically receive product shipments twice a week, shipments are

accelerated during high sales volume periods.

Seasonality

Similar to many retailers, Future Shop’s business is

seasonal. Revenues and earnings are typically greater during the second half of

the fiscal year, which includes the holiday selling season.

Competition

Future Shop’s industry is highly competitive. Future Shop competes

against a variety of Canadian retailers, including major department stores,

independent consumer electronics and appliance dealers, mail order

distributors, discount stores, warehouse clubs and superstores. In addition,

Future Shop competes with Internet-based retailers in Canada and the United

States. Mass merchandisers continue to increase their assortment of consumer

electronics products—primarily those that are less complex to sell, install and

operate. Similarly, large home improvement retailers are expanding their

assortment of appliances. In addition, Canadian consumers are increasingly

downloading entertainment and computer software directly via the Internet.

We believe Future Shop’s low price leadership, large product assortment

and focus on customer service in combination with the leveraging of Best Buy

stores’ core competencies, effectively position Future Shop to meet current and

future competitive conditions.

Our Employees

At the end of fiscal

2002, we employed approximately 94,000 full-time, part-time and seasonal

employees across all of our operating segments.  There are currently no collective bargaining agreements covering

any of our employees with the exception of unions that represent hourly

employees at 13 Musicland stores. We have not experienced a strike or work

stoppage and we believe that we have favorable employee relations.

Best Buy Stores

At the end of fiscal 2002, we operated 481 Best Buy stores totaling

approximately 21.6 million retail square feet.

Best Buy stores are

serviced by the following major distribution centers:

In addition, Best Buy

stores lease space in 20 satellite warehouses in major metropolitan markets for

MARKET RISK

Our debt is not subject

to material interest rate volatility risk. The rates on a substantial portion

of our debt may be reset, but not more than one percentage point higher than

the current rates. If the rates on the debt were to be reset one percentage

point higher, annual interest expense would increase by approximately $8

million. We do not manage the risk through the use of derivative instruments.

We have market risk

arising from changes in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of our

acquisition of Future Shop, in Canada, in November fiscal 2002. At this time,

we do not manage the risk through the use of derivative instruments. A 10%

adverse change would not have a significant impact on our results of operations

or financial position.
