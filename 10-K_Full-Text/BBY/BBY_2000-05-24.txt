PART I

ITEM 1.  BUSINESS

General

Best Buy Co., Inc. (the "Company" or "Best Buy"), is the nation's largest volume specialty retailer of name-brand consumer electronics, home
office equipment, entertainment software and appliances. The Company started in 1966 as an audio component systems retailer, and in the early 1980s, with the introduction of the videocassette
recorder, expanded into video products. In 1983, the Company changed its marketing strategy to use mass-merchandising techniques for a wider variety of products, and began to operate its
stores with a "superstore" format. In 1989, Best Buy dramatically changed its method of retailing by introducing its Concept II store format, a self-service, noncommissioned,
discount-style sales environment designed to give the customer more control over the purchasing process. The Company determined that an increasing number of customers had become knowledgeable enough
to select products without the assistance of a commissioned salesperson and preferred to make purchases in a more convenient and customer-friendly environment.

In
fiscal 1995, the Company developed a strategy to further enhance its store format. The strategy, known as Concept III, incorporated a larger store format created to produce a more
informative and exciting shopping experience for the customer. Through focus group interviews and other research, the Company determined that customers wanted more product information and a larger
product selection. In order to meet these evolving consumer preferences, the Company developed an enhanced store format, which features more hands-on and interactive product
demonstrations. In fiscal 1999, the Company introduced its Concept IV store format. This format features improved merchandising, signage and customer service, and was expected to better address
consumers' needs as the consumer electronics industry, in particular, progresses into new digital products. Concept IV was designed to reinforce the Company's image as the destination for new
technology in a fun, informative and no-pressure-shopping environment. With its innovative retail format, the Company is a national sales leader in all of its principal product categories
except appliances, where it currently ranks third. In fiscal 2000, the Company introduced its small-market store format, developed to serve communities with generally less than 200,000 people. These
30,000 square foot stores offer the same product
categories as larger stores, but have more flexible floor plans and product assortments tailored to their communities.

During
fiscal 2000, the Company increased its store count by approximately 15%, with the addition of 47 new stores, including nine small-market stores and, as of February 26,
2000, was operating 357 stores in 39 states. The Company anticipates opening approximately 60 stores in fiscal 2001.

Business Strategy

The Company's business strategy is to offer consumers an enjoyable and convenient shopping experience while maximizing the Company's profitability. Best Buy
believes it offers consumers meaningful advantages in store environment, product value, selection and service. An objective of this strategy has been to achieve a dominant market share in the markets
Best Buy serves. The Company currently holds a leading, and in some cases a dominant, share in its mature markets. The Company's


current
store format features interactive displays, and for certain product categories, a high-level of customer assistance, all designed to enhance the customer's shopping experience. As
part of its overall strategy, the Company:

•

Generally
offers a retail format similar to a self-service discount store for many products that consumers are familiar with and provides a
higher level of customer service and product information for more technically complex and integrated products.

•

Provides
a selection of brand name products comparable to retailers that specialize in the Company's principal product categories and seeks to ensure a
high level of product availability for customers.

•

Seeks
to provide customers with the best product value available in the market area through active comparison shopping programs, daily price changes,
lowest-price guarantees and special promotions, including interest-free financing and home delivery.

•

Provides
a variety of services not offered by certain competitors, including convenient financing programs, product delivery and installation, and
post-sale services including repair and warranty services and computer upgrades.

•

Locates
stores at sites that are easily accessible from major highways and thoroughfares and seeks to create sufficient concentrations of stores in major
markets to maximize the leverage on fixed costs including advertising and operations management.

•

Controls
costs and enhances operating efficiency by centrally controlling all buying, merchandising and distribution, and vertically integrating certain
support functions such as advertising.

Best
Buy's store format is a key component of its business strategy. The Company believes that because consumers are generally familiar with certain products the Company sells and are
accustomed to discount shopping formats, they increasingly resist efforts to direct their choice of product and appreciate controlling the purchase decision. For products that are relatively easy for
consumers to understand and purchase, the Company employs a self-service, discount-style store format, featuring easy-to-locate product groupings, emphasizing
customer choice and product information. These products include entertainment software and less complex consumer electronics products such as VCRs and smaller-sized televisions. For other, more
complex products such as personal computers, big-screen television sets, appliances, digital phones and digital cameras, the Company provides dedicated and specially trained sales
assistance. Sales staff in these product categories help customers understand the features and benefits of new technology and can assist customers in the purchase of accessories and registration for
service with providers.

Best
Buy continuously evaluates the retail environment and regularly uses focus groups and customer surveys to assess customer preferences. Through these processes, Best Buy concluded
that customers want access to more product information in order to be more confident about their buying decisions.
Most stores contain a demonstration area for home theater systems, big-screen televisions and audio speaker areas. These demonstration areas allow customers to experience and compare
product performance firsthand. Most of the stores also feature one or more "high-touch" sales areas where specially trained salespeople assist customers with more complex products such as
digital cameras, digital phones, camcorders, digital broadcast satellite systems (DBS) and personal digital assistants. Best Buy believes that these demonstration and display areas further
differentiate it from competing retailers and should also provide an advantage for the Company relative to competitors such as catalog and Internet retailers. In addition, all Best Buy stores feature
a configure-to-order process for personal computers that enables computer buyers to tailor-order a computer system from such vendors as Compaq, Hewlett-Packard and Micron.

The
Company's stores are in large, open buildings with high ceilings. Best Buy's stores average approximately 44,000 square feet. The stores feature interactive displays and skilled
employee demonstrations; most stores feature large viewing areas for big-screen and projection televisions and interactive speaker environments. The Company expects to open approximately
60 new stores in fiscal 2001, including 12 small-market format stores.


The
Company believes that its advertising strategy continues to contribute to its increasing market share and brand image. Best Buy spends approximately 3% of store sales on
advertising, including the weekly distribution of approximately 40 million newspaper inserts. The Company is reimbursed by vendors for a substantial portion of advertising expenditures through
cooperative advertising arrangements. The Company has vertically integrated advertising and promotion capabilities and operates its own in-house advertising agency. This capability allows
the Company to respond rapidly to competitors in a cost-effective manner. In many of its markets, the Company is able to secure and deliver to its stores merchandise and to create, produce
and run an advertisement all within a period of less than one week.

Print
advertising generally consists of four-color weekly inserts, typically 28 to 32 pages, that emphasize a variety of product categories and feature an extensive
name-brand selection with a wide range of price points. The Company also produces all of its television commercials, each with a specific marketing message. Television commercials account
for about one-third of total advertising expenditures. The Company also utilizes a national brand image campaign to move Best Buy's image beyond that of a low-price specialty
retailer to one that positions the Company as the destination for new technology products that enhance customers' time, whether leisure or work, and make leisure time more fun. The Company believes
that building customer brand loyalty is a significant element in its business strategy.

Product
service and repair are important aspects of Best Buy's brand strategy, providing the opportunity to differentiate itself from the retailers operating exclusively as
bricks-and-mortar retailers or Internet retailers. The Company generally offers to service and repair all of the products it sells, with the exception of entertainment
software, and has been designated by substantially all of its major suppliers as an authorized servicer. In addition, the Company makes its in-store technical support staff available to
assist customers with the custom configuration of personal computers and peripheral products. The Company also delivers major appliances and large electronics products and installs car stereos,
vehicle security systems and major appliances. In fiscal 2000, the Company began a multi-year project to expand and improve its service capabilities by undertaking efforts to improve the
quality of service and leverage its Service, Retail and Marketing functions to provide value added services to the customer.

In
fiscal 2000, the Company created BestBuy.com, Inc. ("BestBuy.com") its wholly-owned subsidiary and continued developing a comprehensive Internet service designed to offer
products in all of the Company's principal product categories. Management expects to launch the new BestBuy.com business to the public in June 2000. The Company's Internet vision includes
developing a fully integrated "clicks-and-mortar" strategy, becoming the market leader in providing entertainment and technology solutions to consumers via the Internet and
developing interactive consumer relationships that create lifetime value. The "clicks-and-mortar" strategy will leverage the Company's existing nationwide store network with
Best Buy's brand awareness, substantial advertising and promotional activities, warranty
and repair capabilities, and supply chain, warehousing and logistics network. The strategy includes providing the consumer with a synchronized experience across all selling channels, whether the
consumer is researching, purchasing, receiving or returning products, or obtaining entertainment. BestBuy.com intends to take full advantage of the Web's unique capabilities while focusing on
retailing fundamentals. While e-commerce does not currently represent a significant portion of the Company's business, the Company believes the development of a comprehensive Internet
business represents a significant growth opportunity. The Company believes it's fully integrated "clicks-and-mortar" strategy will also provide a competitive advantage over
other Internet retailers.

During
fiscal 2000, the Company and BestBuy.com formed several strategic alliances to provide better solutions for the Company's customers. Investments were made in
Simplexity.com™ and etown.com™. Simplexity.com provides telecommunications service options by market, and etown.com, a leading online source of consumer electronics
information, allows access to independent editorials and product information. Subsequent to year-end, the Company also finalized a comprehensive strategic alliance with Microsoft
Corporation. The agreement with Microsoft encompasses significant co-marketing between the Microsoft Network of Internet Services (MSN™), BestBuy.com and Best Buy's retail
stores via direct marketing and advertising inserts, among other things. Microsoft will provide technology support to Best Buy and BestBuy.com and will also support BestBuy.com with prominent
placement across Microsoft properties, including MSNBC, the WebTV Network™, the


Expedia.com™
travel service, the MSN Hotmail™ Web-based e-mail service and the MSN eShop online shopping service. In connection with the
alliance, Microsoft purchased approximately 3.9 million shares of Best Buy common stock for $200 million.

Product Selection and Merchandising

Best Buy provides a broad selection of name-brand models within each product line in order to provide customers with a meaningful assortment. The
Company currently offers approximately 5,800 products, exclusive of entertainment software titles and accessories, in its four principal product categories. In addition, the Company offers a selection
of accessories supporting its principal product categories.

The
home office category, Best Buy's largest product category, includes personal computers and related peripheral equipment, telephones, digital and cellular phones, pagers, answering
machines, fax machines, copiers and calculators. As of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000, approximately half of the sales in this category were derived from sales of personal computers including
desktops, notebooks and configure-to-order computers. The retail market for personal computers is promotional and competitive, with competition primarily from retail stores and
factory-to-customer direct channels of distribution. The Company's operating results can be affected by significant changes in promotional activity, consumer demand,
availability of personal computers and the timing of computer model transitions by manufacturers. The timing of significant new software releases can also impact sales of personal computers. The
Company believes that it is well positioned to withstand competition in the retail market for personal computer products, traditionally low margin items, due to its experience in the market and its
significantly improved ability to manage inventories in this category. The Company also believes that its broad product lines, including those that generate higher gross profit margins, and its
relatively low cost structure contribute to its ability to compete in this category. In addition, the Company believes that the related services it offers, such as knowledgeable salespeople,
in-store computer configuration, maintenance and upgrades, are distinct advantages compared to Internet discount and factory direct computer retailers. Changing technology and hardware
requirements necessary to support new software, including online services, are expected to continue to be primary factors in the growth in sales of personal computers and related products in the
future. Personal computer unit sales volume growth has been driven by technology improvements, the increasing popularity of the Internet and declining retail-selling prices. In fiscal 2000, Internet
service provider rebate offers to new subscribers on the purchase of their personal computers further stimulated computer sales. While the sales of personal computer hardware generate relatively low
gross profit margins, the Company's selling strategies have enabled it to generate higher total transaction profit margins through the sale of accessories and services that complete a home computer
system. Although
the number of computer manufacturers selling through retail distribution channels declined in fiscal 2000, Best Buy added vendors such as Emachine and Micron to its list of home office brand name
products which already included brand names such as AT&T, Canon, Compaq, Epson, Fujitsu, Hewlett-Packard, Lexmark, Motorola, NEC, Nokia, Panasonic, Samsung, Sharp, Sony and Toshiba.

Best
Buy's second largest product category is consumer electronics, consisting of video and audio equipment. Video products include television sets, DVD players, VCRs, camcorders and
DBS systems. Audio products include audio components, audio systems, shelf systems, portable audio equipment, car stereos and security systems. The Company continues to expand its product selection of
consumer electronics by offering higher-end products and components that have greater appeal to audio and video enthusiasts. In recent years, the introduction of digital audio players,
digital television, DVD, minidiscs and DBS systems continues the migration of the consumer electronics category into digital technology. The replacement of existing analog technology with digital
products represents a significant sales growth opportunity for the Company; although as prices drop, quantities increase and new technology becomes more affordable, the transition could impact sales
of current products. To date, however, increasingly affordable digital consumer electronics products have contributed to the Company's sales growth. The Company sells consumer electronics with brand
names such as Advent, Aiwa, Bose, Clarion, DIRECTV, Funai, JBL, JVC, Kenwood, KLH, Magnavox, Panasonic, RCA, Rockford Fosgate, Samsung, Sanyo, Sony, Technics, Toshiba, WebTV and Yamaha.

Best
Buy's entertainment software category includes compact discs, DVD movies, pre-recorded videocassettes, computer software, and video game hardware and software. The
Company is one of the


few
large consumer electronics retailers that sell a broad selection of entertainment software in all of its stores. Best Buy customizes a portion of the entertainment software assortment for
particular stores based upon the demographics of the market. Entertainment software sales are impacted by the strength of new releases. Video game hardware, video game software and computer software
sales are also impacted by the development of new technology. The increase in sales of DVD players in fiscal 2000 and significant expansion in the number of movie titles available in the DVD format,
as well as high demand for recorded music led to the Company's sales growth in the entertainment software category.

The
major appliance category includes microwave ovens, washing machines, dryers, air conditioners, dishwashers, refrigerators, freezers, ranges and vacuum cleaners. This category
includes brand names such as Amana, Bisell, Eureka, Fantom Technologies, Frigidaire, General Electric, GE Profile, Hoover, Hotpoint, Maytag, Panasonic, Roper, Royal Appliance, Samsung, Sanyo, Sharp,
Tappan, Whirlpool and White-Westinghouse. Sales in this category are impacted by new housing activity. In addition, sales in the major appliance category have been favorably impacted by a decline in
the number of smaller retailers selling major appliances. An increase in the large home improvement retailers entering the major appliance market could impact sales in the future.

In
addition to products in its four main categories, the Company sells cameras and other photographic equipment and ready-to-assemble furniture designed for
use with computer and audio/video equipment. Sales of new digital cameras have contributed to the growth in this category. The Company also sells performance service plans (PSPs) on behalf of an
unrelated third party. These PSPs cover product repair and/or replacement for a specified period of time following the purchase of a product, extending and enhancing the manufacturer's warranty.

The
following table shows the percentage of store sales from each of Best Buy's principal product lines for each of the last three years.

Store Locations and Expansion

The Company's expansion strategy generally has been to enter major metropolitan areas with the simultaneous opening of several stores and then to expand into
contiguous non-metropolitan markets. In fiscal 2000, the Company broadened its existing strategy and opened nine small-market stores, which were designed for communities of less than
200,000 people. As of February 26, 2000, approximately two-thirds of the Company's stores were in metropolitan markets.

The
entry into a new market is preceded by a detailed market analysis, which includes a review of competitors, demographics and economic data. Best Buy's store location strategy
enables it to increase the effectiveness of its advertising expenditures and to create a high level of consumer awareness. In addition, the clustering of stores allows the Company to maintain more
effective management control and utilize its distribution facilities more efficiently. Currently, Best Buy stores cover approximately 55- to- 60% of the United States
population and serve 43 of the 50 largest metropolitan markets.


When
entering a major metropolitan market, the Company establishes a district office, service center and major appliance warehouse. Each new store requires working capital of
approximately $4 million for merchandise inventory (net of vendor financing), leasehold improvements, fixtures and equipment. Pre-opening costs of approximately $600,000 per store,
excluding advertising costs associated with the grand opening of a store, are incurred through hiring, relocating and training new employees, and in merchandising the store. These costs are expensed
as incurred.

The
Company opened 47 stores in fiscal 2000 including entry into the markets of Sacramento, San Diego and San Francisco, Calif.; Jacksonville and Tallahassee, Fla.; Albany and
Rochester, NY.; and Richmond and Norfolk, Va. The Company expects to open approximately 60 stores in fiscal 2001, including entry into the densely populated metropolitan New York area and Portland,
Oregon. Included in the approximately 60 stores scheduled to open in fiscal 2001 are approximately 12 small-market format stores. The Company also plans to remodel or relocate approximately 10 stores
to larger facilities.

In
May 1999, the Company opened a new distribution center in Dinuba, Calif., replacing its leased facility in Ontario, Calif. In April 2000, the Company began
construction on a new 700,000 square foot distribution center in Dublin, Ga. that is expected to open in the second half of fiscal 2001. The Company believes with the addition of the new facility it
has the necessary distribution capacity to support its fiscal 2001 expansion plans. Additionally, the Company plans to use third-party distributors for fulfillment of a portion of the merchandise sold
via the Company's expanded Internet site.

Suppliers, Purchasing and Distribution

The Company's marketing strategy depends, in part, upon its ability to offer a broad selection of name brand products to its customers and is, therefore,
dependent upon satisfactory and stable supplier relationships. In fiscal 2000, Best Buy's 20 largest suppliers accounted for over half of the merchandise purchased by the Company, with five suppliers,
Compaq, Hewlett-Packard, IBM, Panasonic and Sony, representing approximately 30% of the Company's total purchases. The loss of or disruption in supply, including disruptions in supply due to
manufacturers' product quality or component parts availability issues, from any one of these major suppliers could have a material adverse effect on the Company's sales. Although, later in
fiscal 2000 IBM discontinued its sales of personal computers through retail channels, the Company believes it has adequately replaced this product through alternative sources. Higher than
expected demand also places a strain on certain suppliers at times, resulting in suppliers limiting or temporarily discontinuing their supply of products to retailers, including the Company. Best Buy
generally does not have long-term written contracts with its major suppliers and does not have any indication that any current suppliers will discontinue selling merchandise to the
Company. The Company has not experienced significant difficulty in maintaining satisfactory sources of supply, and management expects that adequate sources of supply will continue to exist for the
types of merchandise sold in its stores.

Best
Buy's centralized marketing staff purchases substantially all of the Company's merchandise. The buying staff within the Company's Marketing Department is responsible for product
assortment, promotion planning and product pricing. An inventory management staff in the Marketing Department is responsible for overall product acquisition and inventory management, including
allocations and replenishment of store inventory. Except for certain entertainment software, there are generally no agreements with suppliers for the return of unsold inventory. Merchandise remaining
at the time of new product introduction is generally sold on a close-out basis and may be subject to a reduction in selling price to levels at or below the Company's cost.

The
Company has made product availability to consumers a high priority and continues to make investments in facilities, personnel and systems to assure that its in-stock
position will be among the highest in the industry. The Company utilizes an automatic replenishment system for restocking its stores. Replenishment of store inventories is based on inventory levels,
historical and projected sales trends, promotions and seasonality. The Company utilizes an extensive merchandise planning and daily inventory monitoring system to manage inventory and increase
inventory turns. The Company's strategic initiative to design and implement systems and practices to improve the Company's assortment planning, product sourcing and advertising effectiveness has
resulted in significant benefits as demonstrated by recent increases in gross profit margins.

The
majority of the Company's merchandise, except for major appliances, is shipped directly from manufacturers to the Company's distribution centers. In addition, the Company operates
a dedicated distribution center for entertainment software in Minnesota. Major appliances are shipped to satellite warehouses in each of the Company's major markets. In order to meet release dates for
selected entertainment software titles and certain computer products, and to improve inventory management, certain merchandise is shipped directly to the stores from manufacturers and distributors.
The


Company
is, however, dependent upon the distribution centers for inventory storage and shipment of most merchandise to its stores. The Company believes that its distribution centers can most
effectively service stores within a 600- to 700- mile radius and that its current distribution centers, with the addition of Dublin, Ga., will accommodate the Company's
expansion plans for the next several years. The Company plans to continue investing in new systems and material handling equipment to reduce labor costs and improve accuracy in filling orders.

Management Information Systems

Best Buy has developed proprietary software that provides daily information on sales, gross margins, and inventory levels by store and by stockkeeping unit.
These systems allow the Company to compare current performance against historical performance and the current year's budget. Best Buy uses point-of-sale bar code scanning from
which sales information is compiled at the end of each day. The Company uses Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) with selected suppliers for the more efficient transmittal of purchase orders, shipping
notices and invoices. The Company believes the systems it has developed have the ability to continue to improve customer service, operational efficiency and management's ability to monitor critical
performance indicators. Best Buy continuously assesses its information systems needs to increase efficiency, improve decision-making and support the Company's growth. Major components of the Company's
systems development plan for fiscal 2001 include support of its e-commerce division, retail store and e-commerce integration initiatives, development of systems to support the
Company's service operations and continued improvement in its supply chain and store systems. The Company also plans to initiate a project to replace its core financial, human resource and inventory
management systems.

Store Operations

Best Buy has developed a standardized and detailed system for operating its stores called Standard Operating Platforms (SOPs). The system includes procedures
for inventory management, transaction processing, customer relations, store administration and merchandise display. The Company's store operations are organized into two divisions. Each division is
divided into regions and is under the
supervision of a senior vice president who oversees store performance through several regional managers, each of whom has responsibility for a number of districts within the region. District managers
monitor store operations closely and meet regularly with store managers to discuss SOPs, merchandising, new product introductions, sales promotions, customer loyalty programs, employee satisfaction
surveys and store operating performance. Similar meetings are conducted at the corporate level with divisional and regional management. A senior vice president of retail operations has overall
responsibility for retail store processing and operations including labor management. Each district also has a loss prevention manager, with product security personnel employed at each store to
control inventory shrinkage. Advertising, pricing and inventory policies are controlled at corporate headquarters.

The
Company's stores are open seven days and six evenings a week. A store is typically staffed by one manager, four or five assistant managers and an average staff ranging from 65 to
150 people, depending on store size. Approximately 60% of a store's staff, which includes product specialists and a support staff of cashiers and customer service and stock handling employees, is
employed on a part-time basis. Store managers are paid a salary and have the opportunity to earn bonuses if their stores exceed sales and gross margin quotas, meet certain budget criteria
in controlling expenses and achieve certain administrative goals.

The
Company has an employee development department which provides managers with a variety of tools to teach employees the core skills they need to meet their performance objectives.
In the stores, Sales, Inventory, Operations and Merchandising managers undergo comprehensive training in their specialty areas, which include store operations, selling, managerial, training and
communications skills. The retail selling and sales support teams receive a thorough orientation to the Company's industry and its business objectives. Sales personnel are trained to ask specific
questions of customers to determine their needs and to present products, accessories and services that meet those expressed needs. Stores hold monthly team meetings to review store performance,
Company focus, and changes and modifications in operating procedures. Specialized product training is also conducted at these monthly meetings. The Company staffs store management positions with both
personnel promoted from


within
the stores and those recruited from outside of the Company. In connection with expansion into new markets, Best Buy recruits local management personnel who have valuable knowledge about the new
market. The Company has a store management development program designed to help support the increased rate of store growth by developing and integrating new managers who have generally completed a
year of training prior to assuming full management responsibility.

Credit Policy

Approximately one-third of store revenues are paid for by cash or check, with the remainder paid for by major credit cards or the Best Buy
private-label credit card. The Company utilizes special financing offers to stimulate sales. Generally, these financing offers allow customers to purchase certain products with repayment terms
typically ranging from 90 days to 18 months without a finance charge. The longer financing offers, generally those beyond six months, typically require minimum monthly payments to avoid
the finance charge. The special financing offers are only provided to customers who qualify for Best Buy's private-label credit card. The private-label credit card allows these customers to obtain
financing on purchases of merchandise at Best Buy stores through arrangements between the Company and unaffiliated third-party institutions with consumer credit programs. The Company is generally able
to qualify a new customer for credit on the spot, typically in less than five minutes. Receivables from private-label credit card sales are sold, without recourse to the Company, to unaffiliated
third-party institutions. The Company receives payment from these institutions within one to three days following the sale.

Competition

Consumer electronics retailers realized significant sales increases in fiscal 2000 driven by strong consumer spending, continued demand for personal
computers and rapid consumer acceptance of new digital technology products such as DVD, digital phones and digital cameras. However, alternative
channels of distribution such as Internet and factory direct shopping services are expanding. Retailing in each of the Company's product categories also can be highly competitive. Additionally while
many retail stores have exited the market, new competition is emerging as evidenced by the entrance of large home improvement retailers into the major appliance market. Although these new channels or
points of distribution are not yet creating significant competition for the Company, they could become significant over time. Management believes that the Company's own e-commerce
initiative, coupled with product knowledge, brand imaging, expertise and services capabilities of its retail stores, will effectively position the Company to meet the increased competition from
e-commerce and mail-order retailers.

effective advertising, a more customer-focused product assortment, improved product in-stock levels and better customer service have contributed to market share gains
over the past year. Management believes that its store format and brand positioning distinguish the Company from most of its competitors by positioning the Company as the destination for new
technology in a fun, informative and no-pressure shopping environment. The Company competes by aggressively advertising and emphasizing a broad product assortment, low prices, financing
alternatives and service.

The
Company currently competes nationally against consumer electronics retailers such as Circuit City and RadioShack; computer superstores such as CompUSA; home office retailers such
as Office Depot, Office Max and Staples; mass merchants such as Sears, Wal-Mart and Target; home improvement superstores such as Home Depot; and entertainment software superstores owned by
Musicland and Tower Records. The Company also competes against independent dealers, regional chain discount stores, wholesale clubs, and mail-order and Internet retailers.

Employees

As of February 26, 2000, the Company had approximately 55,000 employees, of whom approximately 28,000 were part-time or seasonal employees.
There are currently no collective bargaining agreements covering any of the Company's employees. The Company has not experienced a strike or work stoppage, and management believes that its employee
relations are good.


ITEM 2.  PROPERTIES

The Company's stores, most of which are leased, include sales space, inventory storage, management offices and employee areas. The leases provide for a fixed
minimum rent and essentially all contain provisions of scheduled escalation dates and amounts. The terms of a majority of the leases including renewal options extend beyond the year 2020. At
February 26, 2000, the Company owned nine of its operating retail store locations. Management expects to sell and lease back these properties in fiscal 2001.

As
of February 26, 2000, the Company utilized over 3.4 million square feet of distribution facilities, including centers in Bloomington, Minn.; Ardmore, Okla.; Staunton,
Va.; Dinuba, Calif.; Findlay, Ohio, and a dedicated distribution center for entertainment software in Edina, Minn. The Company also operated satellite warehouses for major appliances in its major
markets. The Company opened a new distribution center in Dinuba, Calif. in May 1999 that replaced the former leased distribution center located in Ontario, Calif. In April 2000, the
Company began construction on a new 700,000 square foot distribution center in Dublin, Ga., which is expected to be completed the second half of fiscal 2001.

The
Company's principal corporate offices are in a 360,000 square-foot facility it owns in Eden Prairie, Minn. The Company also owns another facility, with approximately
180,000 square feet, in Eden Prairie, Minn. that houses its Information Technology Department. In addition to owning these two facilities, the Company also leases another 340,000 square feet of office
space in close proximity to its main corporate office. In fiscal 2002, the Company expects to begin construction on a new corporate campus in Richfield, Minn. The new corporate facility, which will
replace existing owned and leased facilities, is expected to be completed in fiscal 2003.

ITEM 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

The Company is involved in various legal proceedings arising during the normal course of conducting business. The resolution of those proceedings is not
expected to have a material impact on the Company's financial condition.
