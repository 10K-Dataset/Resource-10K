Description of Business

Best Buy Co., Inc.
(“Best Buy,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) is a specialty retailer of consumer
electronics, home-office products, entertainment software, appliances and
related services. We operate retail stores and Web sites under the brand names
Best Buy (BestBuy.com, BestBuyCanada.ca and BestBuy.com.cn), Five Star
(Five-Star.cn), Future Shop (FutureShop.ca), Geek Squad (GeekSquad.com and
GeekSquad.ca), Magnolia Audio Video (MagnoliaAV.com) and Pacific Sales Kitchen
and Bath Centers (PacificSales.com). References to our Web site addresses do
not constitute incorporation by reference of the information contained on the
Web sites.

Our vision is to make life fun and easy for consumers. Our business
strategy is to treat customers as unique individuals, meeting their needs with
end-to-end solutions, and engaging and energizing our employees to serve them,
while maximizing overall profitability. We believe we offer consumers
meaningful advantages in store environment, product value, product selection,
and a variety of in-store and in-home services related to the merchandise we
offer, all of which advance our objectives of enhancing our business model,
gaining market share and improving profitability.

Information About Our Segments

During fiscal
2007, we operated two reportable segments: Domestic and International. The
Domestic segment is comprised of all U.S. store and online operations,
including Best Buy, Geek Squad, Magnolia Audio Video and Pacific Sales Kitchen
and Bath Centers (“Pacific Sales”). We acquired Pacific Sales in the first
quarter of fiscal 2007. U.S. Best Buy stores offer a wide variety of consumer
electronics, home-office products, entertainment software, appliances and
related services. Geek Squad provides residential and commercial computer
repair, support and installation services. Magnolia Audio Video stores offer
high-end audio and video products and related services. Pacific Sales stores
offer high-end home-improvement products, appliances and related services. The
International segment is comprised of all Canada store and online operations,
including Best Buy, Future Shop and Geek Squad, as well as all China store and
online operations, including Best Buy, Geek Squad and Jiangsu Five Star
Appliance Co. (“Five Star”). We acquired a 75% interest in Five Star in the
second quarter of fiscal 2007. We opened our first China Best Buy store in
Shanghai in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007. Our International segment offers
products and services similar to our Domestic segment’s offerings. However,
Canada Best Buy stores do not carry appliances. Further, Five Star stores and
our China Best Buy store do not carry entertainment software.

Domestic Segment

We were incorporated in the state of Minnesota in 1966 as Sound of
Music, Inc. We began as an audio components retailer and, with the
introduction of the videocassette recorder in the early 1980s, expanded into
video products. In 1983, we changed our name to Best Buy Co., Inc. and
began using mass-merchandising techniques, which included offering a wider
variety of products and operating stores under a “superstore” concept. In 1989,
we dramatically changed our method of retailing by introducing a self-service,
noncommissioned, discount-style store concept designed to give the
customer more control over the purchasing process.

In fiscal 2000, we established our first online shopping site,
BestBuy.com. Our “clicks-and-mortar” strategy is designed to empower consumers
to research and purchase products seamlessly, either online or in our retail
stores. The BestBuy.com online shopping site offers expanded assortments in all
of our principal product groups.

In fiscal 2001, we acquired Magnolia Hi-Fi, Inc. — a Seattle-based,
high-end retailer of audio and video products and services — to access an
upscale customer segment. During fiscal 2004, Magnolia Hi-Fi began doing
business as Magnolia Audio Video.

In fiscal 2003, we acquired Geek Squad. Geek Squad provides residential
and commercial computer repair, support and installation services. We acquired
Geek Squad to further our plans of providing technology support services to
customers. Geek Squad service is available in all U.S. Best Buy stores, as well
as in 12 stand-alone stores, with more than 10,000 agents. Our goal is to
build Geek Squad into North America’s largest provider of residential and
commercial computer repair, support and installation


services, and we believe that over time it will become a significant
component of our business.

In fiscal 2005, we opened our first Magnolia Home Theater
store-within-a-store experience within a U.S. Best Buy store. We believe
Magnolia Home Theater — with its high-end brands, home-like displays and
specially trained employees — offers a unique solution for our customers.
The Magnolia Home Theater store-within-a-store experience was offered in more
than 300 U.S. Best Buy stores at the end of fiscal 2007. During fiscal 2008, we
plan to add the Magnolia Home Theater store-within-a-store experience to more
than 50 additional new and existing U.S. Best Buy stores.

In fiscal 2005, we also began converting U.S. Best Buy stores to our customer
centricity operating model. Stores operating under the customer centricity
model, also known as segmented stores, offer variations in product assortments,
staffing, promotions and store design, and are focused on key customer
segments. The segmented stores tailor their store merchandising, staffing,
marketing and presentation to address specific customer groups. Originally,
these customer groups included affluent professional males, young entertainment
enthusiasts who appreciate a digital lifestyle, upscale suburban moms, families
who are practical technology adopters and small businesses.

In fiscal 2007, based on the segmented stores’ operating results, as
well as positive customer feedback, we completed the transition of all
remaining U.S. Best Buy stores to the customer centricity operating model. Also
in fiscal 2007, we evolved our customer centricity segmentation to address the
needs of customer lifestyle groups, rather than specific customer types. Our
stores now focus on affluent suburban families, trend-setting urban dwellers,
and the closely knit families of Middle America. Best Buy For Business seeks to
satisfy the needs of small business owners, who can be found within all of our
lifestyle groups.

On March 7, 2006,
we acquired Pacific Sales. Based in southern California, Pacific Sales
specializes in the sale of high-end kitchen appliances, plumbing fixtures, home
entertainment products and home furnishings. We acquired Pacific Sales to
enhance our ability to grow with an affluent customer base and premium brands
using a proven and successful showroom format. Utilizing the existing store
format, we expect to increase the number of stores in order to capitalize on
the expanding high-end segment of the U.S. appliance market.

At March 3,
2007, we operated 822 U.S. Best Buy stores in 49 states and the District of
Columbia that averaged approximately 40,500 retail square feet. Collectively,
U.S. Best Buy stores totaled approximately 33.3 million retail square feet at
the end of fiscal 2007, or about 80% of our total retail square footage. In
fiscal 2007, U.S. Best Buy retail stores generated average revenue of
approximately $39.2 million per store.

At March 3,
2007, we operated 20 Magnolia Audio Video stores in California, Washington and
Oregon that averaged approximately 9,700 retail square feet. Collectively,
Magnolia Audio Video stores totaled approximately 0.2 million retail square
feet at the end of fiscal 2007, or less than 1% of our total retail square
footage. In fiscal 2007, Magnolia Audio Video retail stores generated average
revenue of approximately $8.0 million per store.

At March 3, 2007, we operated 14 Pacific Sales stores in
California that averaged approximately 30,300 retail square feet. Collectively,
Pacific Sales stores totaled approximately 0.4 million retail square feet at
the end of fiscal 2007, or about 1% of our total retail square footage. In
fiscal 2007, Pacific Sales retail stores generated average revenue of
approximately $21.1 million per store.

International Segment

Our
International segment was established in connection with our acquisition of
Canada-based Future Shop Ltd. in fiscal 2002. The Future Shop acquisition
provided us with an opportunity to increase revenue, gain market share and
leverage our operational expertise in consumer electronics retailing. Since the
acquisition, we have continued to build on Future Shop’s position as the
leading consumer electronics retailer in Canada.

During fiscal
2003, we launched our dual-branding strategy in Canada by introducing the Best
Buy brand. The dual-branding strategy allows us to retain Future Shop’s brand
equity and attract more customers by offering a choice of store experiences. As
we expand the presence of Best Buy stores in Canada, we expect to gain
continued operating efficiencies by leveraging our capital investments, supply
chain management, advertising, merchandising and administrative functions. Our
goal is to reach differentiated customers with each brand by giving them the
unique shopping experiences they desire. The primary differences between our
two brands in Canada are:

In-store
experience

— The customer’s
interaction with store employees is different at each of the two brands.


Future Shop stores have
predominantly commissioned sales associates who take a more proactive role in
assisting customers. Through their expertise and attentiveness, the sales
associate drives the transaction. In contrast, Canada Best Buy store employees
are noncommissioned, and the stores offer more interactive displays and
grab-and-go merchandising. This design allows customers to drive the
transaction as they experience the products themselves, with store employees
available to demonstrate and explain product features.

Products
and services

—

Only Future Shop stores carry appliances. In addition, Geek
Squad service is not available in Future Shop stores, but is available in all
Canada Best Buy stores.

Store
size —

At the end of fiscal 2007,
the average Future Shop store was approximately 20,500 retail square feet,
compared with an average of approximately 25,300 retail square feet for Canada
Best Buy stores. Canada Best Buy stores generally have wider aisles, as well as
more square footage devoted to entertainment software.

On June 8, 2006,
we acquired a 75% interest in Five Star, one of China’s largest appliance and
consumer electronics retailers. We made the investment in Five Star to further
our international growth plans, to increase our knowledge of Chinese customers
and to obtain an immediate retail presence in China.

On December 28,
2006, we opened our first China Best Buy store in Shanghai. We plan to open two
to three additional Best Buy stores in China during the next 12 to 18 months.

At March 3,
2007, we operated 121 Future Shop stores throughout all of Canada’s provinces
and 47 Canada Best Buy stores in Ontario, Quebec, Alberta, British Columbia,
Manitoba and Saskatchewan. Collectively, our stores in Canada totaled
approximately 3.7 million retail square feet at the end of fiscal 2007, or
about 9% of our total retail square footage. In fiscal 2007, Canada retail
stores generated average revenue of approximately $26.3 million per store.

At March 3,
2007, we operated 135 Five Star stores in seven of China’s 34 provinces and one
China Best Buy store in Shanghai. Collectively, our stores in China totaled
approximately 4.3 million retail square feet at the end of fiscal 2007, or
about 10% of our total retail square footage.

As previously announced, we anticipate continuing our international
growth strategy by opening test stores in Mexico and Turkey within the next 12
to 18 months.

Discontinued Operations

In fiscal 2004, we sold our interest in Musicland Stores Corporation (“Musicland”).
The transaction resulted in the transfer of all of Musicland’s assets other
than a distribution center in Franklin, Indiana, and selected nonoperating
assets. In fiscal 2005, we reversed previously recorded valuation allowances on
deferred tax assets related to the disposition of our interest in Musicland and
recognized a tax benefit. Musicland’s financial results have been classified
separately as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements
for all periods presented.

Operations

Domestic Segment

U.S. Best Buy
store operations are organized into eight territories. Each territory is
divided into districts and is under the management of a retail field officer
who oversees store performance through district managers. District managers monitor
store operations and meet regularly with store managers to discuss
merchandising, new product introductions, sales promotions, customer loyalty
programs, employee satisfaction surveys and store operating performance.
Similar meetings are conducted at the corporate level with divisional and
regional management. Each district also has a loss prevention manager, with
product security personnel employed at each store to control physical inventory
losses. Advertising, merchandise purchasing and pricing, as well as inventory
policies, are centrally controlled.

U.S. Best Buy
stores are generally open 80 hours per week, seven days a week, with extended
holiday hours. A typical store is staffed by one general manager and five
managers. The average staff per store in fiscal 2007 was approximately 128
employees and varied by store depending on sales volumes.

U.S. Best Buy
stores follow a standardized and detailed operating procedure called our
Standard Operating Platform (“SOP”). The SOP includes procedures for inventory
management, transaction processing, customer relations, store administration,
product sales and services, and merchandise display. All stores operate in the
same manner under the SOP.


Magnolia Audio Video stores are typically managed by a store manager,
an audio/video sales manager and, if the store contains mobile products, a
mobile electronics sales manager. Magnolia Audio Video stores are generally
open 73 hours per week, seven days a week. Depending on an individual store’s
volume and product offerings, store staffing includes six to 18 commissioned
sales personnel and one to three hourly personnel. Corporate management for
Magnolia Audio Video stores centrally controls advertising, merchandise
purchasing and pricing, as well as inventory policies.

Pacific Sales stores are typically managed by a store manager who also
sells appliances. Pacific Sales stores are generally open 40 hours per week,
five days a week. Depending on an individual store’s volume and product
offerings, store staffing includes approximately 10 noncommissioned sales
personnel and approximately five hourly sales support personnel. Corporate
management for Pacific Sales stores centrally controls advertising, merchandise
purchasing and pricing, as well as inventory policies.

International
Segment

Canada store operations are organized to support two brands, each
headed by a vice president. Each vice president has national management that
closely monitor store operations and meets regularly with store managers to
review management and staff training programs, customer feedback and requests,
store operating performance and other matters. Meetings involving store
management, product managers, and advertising, financial and administrative
staff, as well as senior management, are held quarterly to review operating
results and to establish future objectives.

Canada stores are generally open 60 to 75 hours per week, seven days a
week. An average Future Shop store is staffed by a general manager, an
operations manager, one to four department managers and 48 to 95 sales
associates, as well as part-time sales associates. An

average

Canada Best Buy store is staffed with a general manager;
assistant managers for operations, merchandising, inventory and sales; and 80
to 110 sales associates, including full-time and part-time sales associates.
The number of sales associates is dependent upon store size and sales volume.

Canada stores
use a standardized operating system. The operating system includes procedures
for inventory management, transaction processing, customer relations, store
administration, staff training and performance appraisals, as well as
merchandise display. Advertising, merchandise purchasing and pricing, and
inventory policies are centrally controlled.

Five Star stores
are generally open 77 to 84 hours per week, 7 days a week. The sales staff at
Five Star stores consists primarily of employees of our vendors. A typical Five
Star store is staffed by 50 to 200 vendor employees who sell products; a
general manager; six to 10 department managers; and 27 to 100 sales associates,
as well as part-time sales associates. Corporate management at Five Star
centrally controls advertising, merchandise purchasing and pricing and
inventory policies for major brand products, while individual regions control
these operations for local brands. Meetings involving store management and
corporate management are held on a regular basis to review operating results
and establish future objectives.

Our China Best Buy store employs an operating model similar to our U.S.
Best Buy and Canada Best Buy stores. Our China Best Buy store is staffed with a
general manager; assistant managers for operations, merchandising, inventory
and sales; and approximately 340 sales associates, including full-time and
part-time sales associates. Advertising, merchandise purchasing and pricing,
and inventory policies for our China Best Buy store are centrally controlled by
corporate management. Meetings involving store management and corporate
management are held on a regular basis to review operating results and
establish future objectives.

Merchandise

Domestic Segment

U.S. Best Buy
stores offer merchandise in four product groups: consumer electronics,
home-office, entertainment software and appliances. Consumer electronics, the
largest product group in fiscal 2007 based on revenue, consists of video and
audio products and services. Video products include televisions, digital
cameras, home theater system installation, DVD players, digital camcorders and
accessories. Audio products include MP3 players, home theater audio systems,
mobile electronics including car stereo and satellite radio products, and
related accessories. The home-office product group includes notebook and
desktop computers, computer support services, telephones, networking and
accessories. Entertainment software products include DVD movies, video game
hardware and software, CDs and computer software. The appliances product group
includes major appliances as well as vacuum cleaners, small electrics,
housewares and services.


Magnolia Audio
Video stores offer merchandise in two product groups: consumer electronics and
home-office. Consumer electronics, the largest product group in fiscal 2007
based on revenue, consists of video and audio products. Video products include
televisions, DVD players, home theater system installation, warranties and
accessories. Audio products include home audio components, mobile electronics,
home theater audio systems and accessories. The home-office product group consists
primarily of home theater furniture.

Pacific Sales
stores offer merchandise in two product groups: consumer electronics and
appliances. Appliances, the largest product group in fiscal 2007 based on
revenue, consists of major appliances as well as small electrics, housewares,
plumbing, bathroom fixtures and services. Consumer electronics consists of
video and audio products, including televisions, and home theater systems and
installation.

Within our Domestic segment product groups, as well as within our International
segment product groups, we include a variety of services that we provide in
connection with the merchandise offered within the product groups. In-store
services include computer set-up, repair and software installation, as well as
the installation of mobile electronics. In-home services include computer
set-up, repair, software installation and home networking, and the delivery and
installation of appliances and home theater systems. Services were not a
significant part of our revenue in fiscal 2007. Our services offerings generally
provide higher gross margins than our merchandise assortment and has been a
contributor to year-over-year gross margin gains. However, the infrastructure
supporting that business has also increased our selling, general and
administrative expenses (“SG&A”) rate. We expect to continue to expand our
services offerings such that services revenue will become a more significant
component of our business over time.

International Segment

Canada Best Buy
and Future Shop stores offer merchandise in four product groups: consumer
electronics, home-office, entertainment software and, for Future Shop only,
appliances. Consumer electronics, the largest product group in fiscal 2007
based on revenue, consists of video and audio products. Video products include
televisions, digital cameras, DVD players, digital camcorders and accessories.
Audio products include MP3 players, home audio components, car stereos,
speakers and accessories. The home-office product group includes desktop and
notebook computers, computer support services, telephones and accessories.

Entertainment software
products include DVDs, video game hardware and software, computer software and
CDs. The appliances product group includes major appliances as well as small
electrics, vacuum cleaners and housewares.

Although Canada
Best Buy and Future Shop stores carry similar product groups (except for
appliances), there are differences in product brands and depth of selection
within product groups. On average, approximately 35% of the product assortment
(excluding entertainment software) overlaps between the two store brands.

China stores offer merchandise in three product groups: consumer
electronics, home-office and appliances. Our China stores do not carry
entertainment software. Appliances, the largest product group in fiscal 2007
based on revenue, includes major appliances, air conditioners, small electrics
and housewares. The consumer electronics product group consists of video and
audio products, including televisions, digital cameras, MP3 players and
accessories. The home-office product group includes desktop and notebook
computers, computer support services, telephones and accessories.

Distribution

Domestic Segment

Generally, U.S.
Best Buy stores’ merchandise, except for major appliances and large-screen
televisions, is shipped directly from manufacturers to our distribution centers
located in California, Georgia, Indiana, Minnesota, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma
and Virginia. Major appliances and large-screen televisions are shipped
to satellite warehouses in each major market. U.S. Best Buy stores are
dependent upon the distribution centers for inventory storage and shipment of
most merchandise. However, in order to meet release dates for selected products
and to improve inventory management, certain merchandise is shipped directly to
the stores from our suppliers. All inventory is bar-coded and scanned to
ensure accurate tracking. In addition, a computerized inventory replenishment
program is used to manage inventory levels at each store. On average, U.S. Best
Buy stores receive product shipments two or three times per week, depending on
sales volume. Contract carriers ship merchandise from the distribution centers
to stores. Generally, online merchandise sales are either picked up at U.S.
Best Buy stores or fulfilled directly to customers through our distribution
centers.


Magnolia Audio
Video stores’ merchandise is received and warehoused at either a Magnolia Audio
Video distribution center in California or the U.S. Best Buy distribution
center in California. All inventory is bar-coded and scanned to ensure accurate
tracking. In addition, a computerized

inventory
replenishment program is used to manage inventory

levels at each store.
Merchandise is delivered to stores an average of three times per week pursuant
to an in-house distribution system.

Pacific Sales stores’ merchandise is received and warehoused at a
distribution center in California. All inventory is bar-coded or marked with
vendor serial numbers to ensure accurate tracking. In addition, a computerized
inventory replenishment program is used to manage inventory levels at each
store. Most merchandise is fulfilled directly to customers through our
distribution center.

International Segment

Our Canada
stores’ merchandise is shipped directly from our suppliers to our distribution
centers in British Columbia and Ontario. Our Canada stores are dependent upon
the distribution centers for inventory storage and shipment of most
merchandise. However, in order to meet release dates for selected products and
to improve inventory management, certain merchandise is shipped directly to the
stores from manufacturers and distributors. All inventory is bar-coded and
scanned to ensure accurate tracking. In addition, a computerized inventory
replenishment program is used to manage inventory levels at each store. Our
Canada stores typically receive product shipments twice per week, with
accelerated shipments during periods of high sales volume. Contract carriers
ship merchandise from the distribution centers to stores.

Our Five Star
stores’ merchandise is housed in more than 50 distribution centers located
throughout the Five Star retail chain, the largest of which is located in
Nanjing, Jiangsu. Our Five Star stores are dependent upon the distribution
centers for inventory storage and shipment of most merchandise. In addition,
the distribution centers also provide installation services and act as service
centers for Five Star customers. Most merchandise is fulfilled directly to
customers through our distribution centers.

Our China store’s merchandise is shipped directly from our suppliers to
our distribution center in Shanghai’s Song Jiang District. Our China store is
dependent upon the distribution center for inventory storage and shipment of
most merchandise. However, in order to meet release dates for selected products
and to improve inventory management, certain merchandise is shipped directly to
the store from manufacturers and distributors. In certain circumstances,
merchandise is shipped directly to our customers from manufacturers and
distributors. Our China store typically receives product shipments three to
four times per week, with accelerated shipments during periods of high sales
volume.

Suppliers

Our strategy
depends, in part, upon our ability to offer customers a broad selection of
name-brand products and, therefore, our success is dependent upon satisfactory
and stable supplier relationships. In fiscal 2007, our 20 largest suppliers
accounted for over three-fifths of the merchandise we purchased, with five
suppliers — Sony, Hewlett-Packard, Samsung, Gateway, and Toshiba —
representing over one-third of total merchandise purchased. The loss of or
disruption in supply from any one of these major suppliers could have a
material adverse effect on our revenue and earnings. We generally do not have
long-term written contracts with our major suppliers that would require them to
continue supplying us with merchandise. We have no indication that any of our
suppliers plans to discontinue selling us merchandise. We have not experienced
significant difficulty in maintaining satisfactory sources of supply, and we
generally expect that adequate sources of supply will continue to exist for the
types of merchandise we sell.

We operate three global sourcing offices in China in order to purchase
products directly from manufacturers in Asia. These offices have improved our
product sourcing efficiency and provide us with the capability to offer private-label
products that complement our existing product assortment. In the future, we
expect purchases from our global sourcing offices to increase as a percentage
of total purchases. We also believe that the expected increase in our global
sourcing volumes will help drive gross profit rate improvements by lowering our
overall product cost.

Store Development

The addition of
new stores has played, and we believe will continue to play, a significant role
in our growth and success. Our store development program has historically
focused on entering new markets; adding stores within existing markets; and
relocating, remodeling and expanding existing stores. During fiscal 2007, we
opened 96 new stores, acquired 145 stores and relocated 20 other stores.
Further, we added the Magnolia Home Theater store-within-a-store experience to nearly
200 new and existing


U.S. Best Buy
stores during fiscal 2007. During fiscal 2007, we closed six Canada Geek Squad
stores and four Five Star stores.

During fiscal 2008, we expect to open
approximately 130 new stores in the United States, Canada and China. Most of
the new stores will be opened in markets where we already have stores,
leveraging our infrastructure and making shopping more convenient for our
customers. In the U.S., we anticipate opening approximately 90 Best Buy stores,
as well as relocating approximately eight existing Best Buy stores. We also
expect to open up to five Pacific Sales stores. In Canada, we expect to open three
to five Best Buy stores and seven to nine Future Shop stores, as well as
relocating approximately two existing Future Shop stores. In China, we plan to
open 20 to 23 Five Star stores. We also expect to open two to three additional
Best Buy stores in China in the next 12 to 18 months. Finally, we anticipate
extending our international presence by opening test stores in Mexico and
Turkey, also within the next 12 to 18 months.

Additional
information regarding our outlook for fiscal 2008 is included in the

Outlook for Fiscal 2008

section of Item 7,

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial


Condition
and Results of Operations

, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Intellectual Property

We believe we own valuable intellectual
property including trademarks, service marks and tradenames, some of which are
of material importance to our business, and include “Best Buy,” the “Yellow Tag”
logo, “Geek Squad,” “Five Star,” “Future Shop,” “Magnolia Audio Video” and “Pacific
Sales.” Some of our intellectual property is the subject of numerous United
States and foreign trademark and service mark registrations. Our trademarks in
the United States generally have 10 year renewable terms. We believe our
intellectual property has significant value and is an important factor in the
marketing of our company, our stores and our Web sites. We also believe we own
valuable patents and intellectual property for which we have patents pending.
We are not aware of any facts that could negatively impact our continuing use
of any of our intellectual property.

In accordance
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”),
our balance sheets include the cost of acquired intellectual property only. The
only material acquired intellectual properties presently included in our
balance sheets are the Future Shop, Five Star and Pacific Sales tradenames,
which had a total carrying value of $81 million at the end of fiscal 2007. The
values of these tradenames are based on the continuation of the Future Shop,
Five Star and Pacific Sales brands. We currently classify these tradenames as
indefinite-lived intangible assets. If we were to abandon the Future
Shop, Five Star or Pacific Sales brand, we would incur an impairment charge
based on the then-carrying value of the associated tradename.

Seasonality

Our revenue and
earnings are typically greater during our fiscal fourth quarter, which includes
the majority of the holiday selling season in the United States and Canada.

Working Capital

We fund our
business operations through a combination of available cash and cash
equivalents, short-term investments and cash flows generated from operations.
In addition, our revolving credit facilities are available for additional
working capital needs or investment opportunities.

Customers

We do not have
a significant concentration of sales with any individual customer and,
therefore, the loss of any one customer would not have a material impact on our
business. No single customer has accounted for 10% or more of our total
revenue.

Backlog

Our stores and
online shopping sites do not have a material amount of backlog orders.

Government Contracts

No material
portion of our business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination
of contracts or subcontracts at the election of any government.

Competition

Our stores compete against other consumer
electronics retailers, specialty home-office retailers, mass merchants,
home-improvement superstores and a growing number of direct-to-consumer
alternatives. Our stores also compete against independent dealers, regional
chain discount stores, wholesale clubs, video rental stores and other specialty
retail stores. Mass merchants continue to increase their assortment of consumer
electronics products, primarily those that are less complex to sell, install
and operate, and have been expanding their product offerings into higher-end
categories. Similarly, large home-improvement retailers are expanding their
assortment of appliances. In addition, consumers are increasingly downloading
entertainment and computer software directly via the Internet.

We compete
principally on the basis of customer service; installation and support
services; store environment, location and convenience; product assortment and
availability; value pricing; and financing alternatives.

We believe our store experience, broad product assortment, store
formats and brand marketing strategies differentiate us from most competitors
by positioning our stores as the destination for new technology and
entertainment products in a fun and informative shopping environment. Our
stores compete by aggressively advertising and emphasizing a complete
product and service solution, value pricing and financing alternatives. In
addition, our trained and knowledgeable sales and service staffs allow us to
tailor the offerings to meet the needs of our customers.


Research and Development

We have not engaged in any material research and development activities
during the past three fiscal years.

Environmental Matters

We are not aware of any federal, state or local provisions which have
been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the
environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, that
have materially affected, or will materially affect, our net earnings or
competitive position, or have resulted or will result in material capital
expenditures. During fiscal 2007, we had no material capital expenditures for
environmental control facilities and no such material expenditures are
anticipated in the foreseeable future.

Number of Employees

At the end of fiscal 2007, we employed approximately 140,000 full-time,
part-time and seasonal employees. We consider our employee relations to be
good. There are currently no collective bargaining agreements covering any of
our employees, and we have not experienced a strike or work stoppage.

Item 1A. Risk Factors.

Described below
are certain risks that our management believes are applicable to our business
and the industry in which we operate. There may be additional risks that are
not presently material or known. There are also risks within the economy and
the capital markets, both domestically and internationally, that affect
business generally, and our company and industry as well, such as inflation;
higher interest rates; higher fuel and other energy costs; higher transportation
costs; higher costs of labor, insurance and healthcare; foreign currency
exchange rate fluctuations;


and higher
levels of unemployment, which have not been described. You should carefully
consider each of the following risks and all other information set forth in
this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

If any of the events described below were to occur, our business,
financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or access to the capital
markets could be materially adversely affected. The following risks could cause
our actual results to differ materially from our historical results and from
results predicted by forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf
related to conditions or events that we anticipate may occur in the future. All
forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf are qualified by the
risks described below.

If we do not anticipate and respond to changing consumer preferences in
a timely manner, our operating results could suffer.

Our business depends, in large part, on our ability to introduce
successfully new products, services and technologies to consumers; the
frequency of such introductions; the level of consumer acceptance; and the
related impact on the demand for existing products, services and technologies. Failure
to predict accurately constantly changing consumer tastes, preferences,
spending patterns and other lifestyle decisions, or to address effectively
consumer concerns, could have a material adverse effect on our revenue, results
of operations and standing with our customers.

Our growth is dependent on the success of our strategies.

Our growth is dependent on our ability to identify, develop and execute
strategies. While we believe customer centricity and the pursuit of
international growth opportunities will enable us to grow our business,
misjudgments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations.

Our results of operations could deteriorate if we fail to attract,
develop and retain qualified employees.

Our performance is dependent on attracting and retaining a large and
growing number of employees. We believe our competitive advantage is providing
unique end-to-end solutions for each individual customer, which requires us to
have highly trained and engaged employees. Our success depends in part upon our
ability to attract, develop and retain a sufficient number of qualified
employees, including store, service and administrative personnel. The turnover
rate in the retail industry is high, and qualified individuals of the requisite
caliber and number needed to fill these positions may be in short supply in
some areas. Competition for such qualified individuals could require us to pay
higher wages to attract a sufficient number of employees. Our inability to
recruit a sufficient number of qualified individuals in the future may delay
planned openings of new stores or affect the speed with which we expand
initiatives such as Best Buy For Business and services. Delayed store openings,
significant increases in employee turnover rates or significant increases in
labor costs could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations.

We face strong competition from traditional store-based retailers,
Internet businesses and other forms of retail commerce, which could materially
affect our revenue and profitability.

The retail business is highly competitive. We
compete for customers, employees, locations, products and other important
aspects of our business with many other local, regional, national and
international retailers. Pressure from our competitors, some of which have a
greater market presence and more financial resources than we do, could require
us to reduce our prices or increase our costs of doing business. As a result of
this competition, we may experience lower revenue and/or higher operating
costs, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations.

Our growth strategy includes expanding our business, both in existing
markets and by opening stores in new markets.

Our future growth is dependent, in part, on our ability to build or
lease new stores. We compete with other retailers and businesses for suitable
locations for our stores. Local land use, local zoning issues, environmental
regulations and other regulations applicable to the types of stores we desire
to construct may impact our ability to find suitable locations, and also
influence the cost of constructing and leasing our stores. We also may have
difficulty negotiating leases or real estate purchase agreements on acceptable
terms. Failure to manage effectively these and other similar factors will
affect our ability to build or lease new stores, which may have a material adverse effect on
our future profitability.

We seek to
expand our business in existing markets in order to attain a greater overall
market share. Because our stores typically draw customers from their local
areas, a new store may draw customers away from our nearby existing stores


and may cause
customer traffic and comparable store sales performance to decline at those
existing stores.

We also intend to open stores in new markets. The risks associated with
entering a new market include difficulties in attracting customers due to a
lack of customer familiarity with our brand, our lack of familiarity with local
customer preferences and seasonal differences in the market. In addition, entry
into new markets may bring us into competition with new competitors or with
existing competitors with a large, established market presence. While we have a
strong track record of profitable new-store growth, we cannot ensure that our
new stores will be profitably deployed; as a result, our future profitability
may be materially adversely affected.

Risks associated with the vendors from whom our products are sourced
could materially adversely affect our revenue and gross profit.

The products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and
international vendors. Global sourcing has become an increasingly important
part of our business and positively affects our financial performance. O

ur 20 largest suppliers account for over
three-fifths of the merchandise we purchase.

If any of our key vendors
fails to supply us with products, we may not be able to meet the demands of our
customers and revenue could decline. We require all of our vendors to comply
with applicable laws, including labor and environmental laws, and otherwise be
certified as meeting our required vendor standards of conduct. Our ability to
find qualified vendors who meet our standards and supply products in a timely
and efficient manner is a significant challenge, especially with respect to
goods sourced from outside the United States. Political or financial
instability, merchandise quality issues, trade restrictions, tariffs, foreign
currency exchange rates, transportation capacity and costs, inflation, outbreak
of pandemics and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our
control. These and other issues affecting our vendors could materially
adversely affect our revenue and gross profit.

We are subject to certain regulatory and legal developments which could
have a material adverse impact on our business.

Our regulatory and legal environment exposes us to complex compliance
and litigation risks that could materially affect our operations and financial
results. In our major global markets, we are subject to increasing regulations,
which increase our cost of doing business. The most significant compliance and
litigation risks we face are:

·

The difficulty in
complying with sometimes conflicting regulations in local, national or
international jurisdictions and new or changing regulations that affect how we
operate;

·

The impact of changes in
tax laws (or interpretations thereof);

·

The impact of litigation
trends, including class actions involving consumers and shareholders, and labor
and employment matters; and

·

The
significant uncertainties of operating globally, including the costs and
difficulties of managing international operations, foreign currencies, complex
laws, contractual obligations and intellectual property rights.

We rely heavily on our management information systems for inventory
management, distribution and other functions. If our systems fail to perform
these functions adequately or if we experience an interruption in their
operation, our business and results of operations could be materially adversely
affected.

The efficient operation of our business is dependent on our management
information systems. We rely heavily on our management information systems to manage
our order entry, order fulfillment, pricing, point-of-sale and inventory
replenishment processes. The failure of our management information systems to
perform as we anticipate could disrupt our business and could result in
decreased revenue, increased overhead costs and excess or out-of-stock
inventory levels, causing our business and results of operations to suffer
materially.

A disruption in our relationship with Accenture, who manages our
information technology and human resources operations, could materially
adversely affect our business and results of operations.

We have engaged Accenture to manage our information technology and
human resources operations. We rely heavily on our management information
systems for inventory management, distribution and other functions. We also
rely heavily on human resources support to attract, develop and retain a
sufficient number of qualified employees. Any disruption in our relationship
with Accenture could result in decreased revenue and increased


overhead costs, causing our business and results of operations to
suffer materially.

Failure to protect the integrity and security of our customers’
information could expose us to litigation and materially damage our standing
with our customers.

The increasing costs associated with information security — such
as increased investment in technology, the costs of compliance with consumer
protection laws and costs resulting from consumer fraud — could cause our
business and results of operations to suffer materially. Additionally, the
success of our online operations depends upon the secure transmission of
confidential information over public networks, including the use of cashless
payments. While we are taking significant steps to protect customer and
confidential information, there can be no assurance that advances in computer
capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other
developments will prevent the compromise of our customer transaction processing
capabilities and personal data. If any such compromise of our information
security were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our
reputation, business, operating results and financial condition and may
increase the costs we incur to protect against such information security
breaches.

Failure in our pursuit or execution of new business ventures, strategic
alliances and acquisitions could have a material adverse impact on our
business.

Our growth strategy includes expansion via new business ventures,
strategic alliances and acquisitions. While we employ several different
valuation methodologies to assess a potential growth opportunity, we can give
no assurance that new business ventures and strategic alliances will positively
affect our financial performance. Acquisitions may result in the diversion of
our capital and our management’s attention from other business issues and
opportunities. We may not be able to assimilate or integrate successfully
companies that we acquire, including their personnel, financial systems,
distribution, operations and general operating procedures. If we fail to
assimilate or integrate acquired companies successfully, our business could
suffer materially. We may also encounter challenges in achieving appropriate
internal control over financial reporting in connection with the integration of
an acquired company. In addition, the integration of any acquired company, and
its financial results, into ours may have a material adverse effect on our
operating results.

We are highly dependent on the cash flows and net earnings we generate
during our fourth fiscal quarter, which includes the majority of the holiday
selling season.

Approximately one-third of our revenue and more than one-half of
our net earnings are generated in our fourth fiscal quarter, which includes the
majority of the holiday selling season in the United Sates and Canada.
Unexpected events or developments such as natural disasters, man-made disasters
and adverse economic conditions in our fourth quarter could have a material
adverse effect on our revenue and earnings.

The foregoing should not be construed as an exhaustive list of all
factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those
expressed in forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf.

Note: At the end of fiscal

the end of fiscal 2007 were leased.


At the end of fiscal 2007, we operated 121 Future Shop stores, 47
Canada Best Buy stores, 135 Five Star stores and one China Best Buy store,
totaling approximately 7.9 million retail square feet.

Our
International segment leases approximately 1.1 million square feet of
distribution center space in Brampton, Ontario, and approximately 0.4 million
square feet of distribution center space in Burnaby, British Columbia to
service our Canada operations.

We also lease
approximately 0.6 million square feet of distribution center space in Jiangsu
province, and an additional 0.6 million square feet of distribution center
space throughout the Five Star retail chain to support our Five Star
distribution network.

The principal office for our Canada operations is located in a 141,000-square-foot
leased facility in Burnaby, British Columbia. The principal office for our Five
Star operations is located in a 46,000-square-foot owned facility in
Nanjing, Jiangsu. The principal office for our China Best Buy operations is located
in a 27,000-square-foot leased facility in Shanghai.

Global Sourcing

In support of our global sourcing initiative, we lease office space in
China totaling approximately 32,000 square feet at the end of fiscal 2007.

Operating Leases

Almost all of
our stores and a majority of our distribution facilities are leased. Terms of
the lease agreements generally range from 10 to 20 years. Most of the leases
contain renewal options and escalation clauses.

Additional information regarding our operating leases is available in

Item 3. Legal Proceedings.

On December 8,
2005, a purported class action lawsuit captioned,

Jasmen
Holloway, et al. v. Best Buy Co., Inc.,

was filed against us in
the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. This federal
court action alleges that we discriminate against women and minority
individuals on the basis of gender, race, color and/or national origin in our
stores with respect to recruitment, hiring, job assignments, transfers,
promotions, compensation, allocation of weekly hours and other terms and
conditions of employment. The plaintiffs seek an end to discriminatory policies
and practices, an award of back and front pay, punitive damages and injunctive
relief, including rightful place relief for all class members. We believe the
allegations are without merit and intend to defend this action vigorously.

We are involved in various other legal proceedings arising in the
normal course of conducting business. We believe the amounts provided in our
consolidated financial statements, as prescribed by GAAP, are adequate in light
of the probable and estimable liabilities. The resolution of those proceedings
is not expected to have a material effect on our results of operations or
financial condition.

Item 5. Market
for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer
Purchases of Equity Securities.

Market Information

Our common stock is traded on the New York
Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol BBY. The table below sets forth the high
and low sales prices of our common stock as reported on the New York Stock
Exchange — Composite Index during the periods indicated.

Holders

As of April 30, 2007, there were 3,683 holders of record of Best
Buy common stock.

Dividends

In fiscal 2004,
our Board initiated the payment of a regular quarterly cash dividend, then
$0.07 per common share per quarter. A quarterly cash dividend has been paid in
each subsequent quarter. Effective with the quarterly cash dividend paid in the
third quarter of fiscal 2005, we increased our quarterly cash dividend per
common share by 10%. Effective with the quarterly cash dividend paid in the
third quarter of fiscal 2006, we increased our quarterly cash dividend per
common share by 9%, to $0.08 per common share per quarter. Effective with the
quarterly cash dividend paid in the third quarter of fiscal 2007, we increased
our quarterly cash dividend per common share by 25% to $0.10 per common share
per quarter. The payment of cash dividends is subject to customary legal and
contractual restrictions.

Future dividend payments will depend on our earnings, capital
requirements, financial condition and other factors considered relevant by our
Board.

Purchases of Equity Securities by the Issuer
and Affiliated Purchasers

From time to
time, we repurchase our common stock in the open market pursuant to programs
approved by our Board. We may repurchase our common stock for a variety of
reasons, such as acquiring shares to offset dilution related to equity-based
incentives, including stock options and our employee stock purchase plan, and
optimizing our capital structure.

In June 2006,
our Board authorized a $1.5 billion share repurchase program. The program, which
became effective on June 21, 2006, terminated and replaced a $1.5 billion
share repurchase program authorized by our Board in April 2005. There is
no expiration date governing the period over which we can make our share
repurchases under the June 2006 share repurchase program.

During the
fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, we purchased and retired 2.3 million shares at a
cost of $116 million pursuant to the June 2006 share repurchase program.
At the end of fiscal 2007, $1.2 billion of the $1.5 billion originally
authorized by our Board was available for future share repurchases.

We consider
several factors in determining when to make share repurchases including, among
other things, our cash needs and the market price of our stock. We expect that
cash provided by future operating activities, as well as available cash and
cash equivalents and short-term investments, will be the sources of funding for
our share repurchase program. Based on the anticipated amounts to be generated
from those sources of funds in relation to the remaining authorization approved
by our Board under the June 2006 share repurchase program, we do not
expect that future share repurchases will have a material impact on our
short-term or long-term liquidity.


The following table presents the total number of shares repurchased
during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 by fiscal month, the average price
paid per share, the number of shares that were purchased as part of a publicly
announced repurchase plan, and the approximate dollar value of shares that may
yet be purchased pursuant to the $1.5 billion share repurchase program as of
the end of fiscal 2007:

Item 6. Selected Financial Data.

The following table presents our selected financial data. The table
should be read in conjunction with Item 7,

Management’s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

, and
Item 8,

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

,
of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Certain prior-year amounts have
been reclassified to conform to the current-year presentation. In fiscal 2004,
we sold our interest in Musicland. All fiscal years presented reflect the classification
of Musicland’s financial results as discontinued operations.

Five-Year
Financial Highlights

$ in millions,
except per share amounts

(1)

Fiscal
2007 included 53 weeks. All other periods presented included 52 weeks.

(2)

In the first quarter of fiscal 2006, we
early-adopted the fair value recognition provisions of Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 123 (revised 2004),

Share-Based
Payment

(“123(R)”), requiring us to recognize expense related to the
fair value of our stock-based compensation awards. We elected the modified
prospective transition method as permitted by SFAS No. 123(R) and,
accordingly, financial results for years prior to fiscal 2006 have not been
restated. Stock-based compensation expense in fiscal 2007 and 2006 was $121
($82 net of tax) and $132 ($87 net of tax), respectively. Stock-based
compensation expense recognized in our financial results for years prior to
fiscal 2006 was not significant.

During
the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, following a review of our lease accounting
practices, we recorded a cumulative charge of $36 pre-tax ($23 net of tax) to
correct our accounting for certain operating lease matters. Additionally,
during the same quarter, we established a sales return liability which reduced
gross profit by $15 pre-tax ($10 net of tax). Further, in fiscal 2005 we
recognized a $50 tax benefit related to the reversal of valuation allowances on
deferred tax assets as a result of the favorable resolution of outstanding tax
matters with the Internal Revenue Service regarding the disposition of our
interest in Musicland. The tax benefit was classified as discontinued
operations.

(4)

Effective
on March 3, 2002, we adopted SFAS No. 142,

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.

During fiscal 2003, we
completed the required goodwill impairment testing and recognized an after-tax,
noncash impairment charge of $40 that was reflected in our fiscal 2003
financial results as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle.
Also effective on March 3, 2002, we changed our method of accounting for
vendor allowances in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) Issue No. 02-16,

Accounting by a Reseller for Cash
Consideration Received from a Vendor.

The change resulted in an after-tax,
noncash charge of $42 that also was reflected in our fiscal 2003 financial
results as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle.

Earnings

splits effected in August 2005 and May 2002.

Comprised of revenue at stores and Web sites
operating for at least 14 full months, as well as remodeled and expanded

locations. Relocated stores are excluded from the comparable store sales
calculation until at least 14 full months after reopening. Acquired stores are
included in the comparable store sales calculation beginning with the first
full quarter following the first anniversary of the date of acquisition. The
calculation of the comparable store sales percentage gain excludes the effect
of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. All comparable store sales
percentage calculations reflect an equal number of weeks. The method of
calculating comparable store sales varies across the retail industry. As a
result, our method of calculating comparable store sales may not be the same as
other retailers’ methods.

During fiscal 2004, we refined our
methodology for calculating our comparable store sales percentage gain to
reflect the impact of non-point-of-sale (non-POS) revenue transactions. We
refined our comparable store sales calculation in light of changes in our
business. Previously, our comparable store sales calculation was based on store
POS revenue. The comparable store sales percentage gains for fiscal 2007, 2006,
2005 and 2004 have been computed using the refined methodology. The comparable
store sales percentage gain for fiscal 2003 has not been computed using the refined
methodology. Refining the methodology for calculating our comparable store
sales percentage gain did not impact previously reported revenue, net earnings
or cash flows.

Item 7.
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations.

We believe
transparency and clarity are the primary goals of successful financial
reporting. We remain committed to increasing the transparency of our financial reporting,
providing our shareholders with informative financial disclosures and
presenting an accurate view of our financial position and operating results.

In accordance
with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, our management,
including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an
evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting and concluded that
such control was effective as of March 3, 2007. In addition, our
independent registered public accounting firm expressed an unqualified opinion
on management’s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over
financial reporting. Management’s report on the effectiveness of our internal
control over financial reporting and the related report of our independent
registered public accounting firm are included in Item 8,

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,

of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations (“MD&A”) is designed to provide a reader of our financial
statements with a narrative from the perspective of our management on our
financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and certain other factors
that may affect our future results. Our MD&A is presented in nine sections:

We believe our
MD&A should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial
Statements and related Notes included in Item 8,

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,

of this Annual
Report on Form 10-K.

Our fiscal year
ends on the Saturday nearest the end of February. Fiscal 2007 included 53
weeks, whereas our fiscal 2006 and 2005 each included 52 weeks.

Unless otherwise noted, this MD&A relates only to results from
continuing operations. Fiscal 2005 reflects the classification of Musicland’s
financial results as discontinued operations.

Overview

Best Buy Co., Inc.
is a specialty retailer of consumer electronics, home-office products,
entertainment software, appliances and related services.

We operate two
reportable segments: Domestic and International. The Domestic segment is
comprised of all U.S. store and online operations, including Best Buy, Geek
Squad, Magnolia Audio Video and Pacific Sales. U.S. Best Buy stores offer a
wide variety of consumer electronics, home-office products, entertainment
software, appliances and related services, operating 822 stores in 49 states
and the District of Columbia at the end of fiscal 2007. Geek Squad offers
residential and commercial computer repair, support and installation services in
all U.S. Best Buy stores and 12 stand-alone stores at the end of fiscal 2007.
Magnolia Audio Video stores offer high-end audio and video products and related
services from 20 stores located in California, Washington and Oregon at the end
of fiscal 2007. Pacific Sales stores offer high-end home-improvement products,
appliances and related services, operating 14 stores in Southern California at
the end of fiscal 2007. We acquired Pacific Sales in the first quarter of fiscal
2007.

The
International segment is comprised of all Canada store and online operations,
including Best Buy, Future Shop and Geek Squad, as well as all China store and
online operations, including Best Buy, Five Star and Geek Squad. We acquired a
75% interest in Five Star in the second quarter of fiscal 2007. We opened our
first Best Buy store in China on December 28, 2006. Our International
segment offers products and services similar to our Domestic segment’s
offerings. However, Canada Best Buy stores do not carry appliances. Further,
Five Star stores and our China Best Buy store do not carry entertainment
software. At the end of fiscal 2007, we operated 47 Canada Best Buy stores in
Ontario, Quebec, Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba and Saskatchewan; 121
Future Shop stores throughout all of Canada’s provinces; 135 Five Star stores
located in seven of China’s 34 provinces; and one China Best Buy store in
Shanghai.


In support of
our retail store operations, we also operate Web sites for each of our brands
(BestBuy.com, BestBuyCanada.ca, BestBuy.com.cn, Five-Star.cn, FutureShop.ca,
GeekSquad.com, GeekSquad.ca, MagnoliaAV.com and PacificSales.com).

Our business, like that of many retailers, is seasonal. Historically,
we have realized more of our revenue and earnings in the fiscal fourth quarter,
which includes the majority of the holiday selling season in the United States
and Canada, than in any other fiscal quarter. The timing of new-store openings,
costs associated with the development of new businesses, as well as general
economic conditions may also affect our future quarterly results.

Acquisitions

Pacific Sales Kitchen and
Bath Centers, Inc.

On March 7, 2006, we acquired all of the
common stock of Pacific Sales for $411 million, or $408 million, net of cash
acquired, including transaction costs. We acquired Pacific Sales, a high-end
home-improvement and appliance retailer, to enhance our ability to grow with an
affluent customer base and premium brands using a proven and successful
showroom format. Utilizing the existing store format, we expect to expand the
number of stores in order to capitalize on the expanding high-end segment of
the U.S. appliance market. At March 3, 2007, Pacific Sales operated 14
showrooms in Southern California and contributed revenue of $296 million to our
consolidated financial results in fiscal 2007.

Jiangsu Five Star Appliance Co., Ltd.

On June 8,
2006, we acquired a 75% interest in Five Star for $184 million, including a
working capital injection of $122 million and transaction costs. Five Star is
one of China’s largest appliance and consumer electronics retailers, with 135
stores located in seven of China’s 34 provinces. We made the investment in Five
Star to further our international growth plans, to increase our knowledge of
Chinese customers and to obtain an immediate retail presence in China.

Five Star employs a business model that carries a significantly lower
gross profit rate and a significantly lower selling, general and administrative
expenses (“SG&A”) rate than our other operations. Consistent with China’s
statutory requirements, Five Star’s fiscal year ends on December 31.
Therefore, we have elected to consolidate Five Star’s financial results on a
two-month lag. Five Star’s operations for the period of June 8, 2006,
through December 31, 2006, contributed revenue of $563 million to our
consolidated financial results in fiscal 2007.

Financial Reporting Changes

To maintain
consistency with our accounting policies, we reclassified selected balances
from receivables to cash and cash equivalents in our February 25, 2006,
consolidated balance sheet. This reclassification had no effect on previously
reported operating income, net earnings or shareholders’ equity.

In November 2005,
the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Staff Position (“FSP”)
No. FAS 123(R)-3,

Transition
Election Related to Accounting for Tax Effects of Share-Based Payment Awards.

During the third quarter of fiscal 2007, we elected to adopt the alternative
transition method provided in FSP No. FAS 123(R)-3 for calculating
the tax effects of stock-based compensation. The alternative transition method
includes simplified methods to determine the beginning balance of the
additional paid-in capital (“APIC”) pool related to the tax effects of
stock-based compensation, and to determine the subsequent impact on the APIC
pool and the statement of cash flows of the tax effects of stock-based awards
that were fully vested and outstanding upon the adoption of Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 123(R),

Share-Based Payment

.

In accordance with SFAS No. 154,

Accounting Changes and Error Corrections,

the change in accounting
principle related to our adoption of the alternative transition method has been
applied retrospectively to our fiscal 2006 consolidated statement of cash
flows. The effect on the consolidated statement of cash flows was a
decrease in operating activities with an offsetting increase in financing
activities of $22 million in fiscal 2006. The adoption of FSP No. FAS
123(R)-3 did not have an impact on our operating income, net earnings or
shareholders’ equity.

Business Strategy and Core Philosophies

Our business,
broadly defined, is about meeting the needs and wants of consumers, not all of
which are confined to consumer electronics. We believe that our assets position
us to solve more customer problems than ever. Specifically, our assets include
140,000 engaged employees; valuable relationships with vendors all over the
world; emerging relationships with companies like Accenture, Apple and Car Phone
Warehouse; and all of the other mutually enriching business relationships that
our people continue to establish and develop wherever we go, from Asia to
Silicon Valley.


We also have a
sizeable cash balance. All of these assets are at our disposal as we envision
how we’ll deepen our relationships with customers and increase shareholder
value.

Our business
strategy is customer centricity. We define customer centricity through its
parts, which we call our three core philosophies: inviting our employees to contribute
their unique ideas and experiences in service of customers; treating customers
uniquely and honoring their differences; and meeting customers’ unique needs,
end-to-end.

We start with a
view of all of our customers, including what their problems are and what their
desires are. We try to match that against everything we know about the
solutions that now exist, or that could be created. Then we figure out how to
get customers the right solutions by using our employees’ unique capabilities,
as well as our network of vendors and outside partners. If we accomplish what
we have set out to do, we believe these solutions may give us something unique
in the marketplace, and something truly differentiated.

Mass merchants,
direct sellers, other specialty retailers and online retailers are increasingly
interested in our product categories because of rising demand. We believe that
by understanding our customers better than our competitors do, and by inspiring
our employees to have richer interactions with customers, we can differentiate
ourselves and compete more effectively. We further believe that this strategy
can be successful for us with a variety of products and services, store
formats, customer groups and even countries.

Our customer centricity strategy provides the framework to grow and
further enhance our business in the future. Examples of new growth areas so far
have included our dual brand strategy in Canada, our Magnolia Home Theater
store-within-a-store, our Geek Squad services business, our acquisition of
Pacific Sales, and our entry into China last year with the Five Star
acquisition and the opening of our first Best Buy store in Shanghai.

Profitably Scaling Customer Centricity

In fiscal 2007,
we had six key priorities aimed at scaling customer centricity.

First, we
implemented a single, customer-centric operating model at all U.S. Best Buy
stores and at the corporate campus. Moving to a single operating model
eliminated redundant work and allowed us to redeploy our efforts to support
growth areas. In the coming year, we plan to continue this work by refining the
store operating model.

Second, we
opened 80 new U.S. Best Buy stores and added nearly 200 Magnolia Home Theater
locations inside new and existing U.S. Best Buy stores, taking advantage of
rising consumer interest in flat-panel TVs. We also enhanced the home theater
area of more than 130 additional new and existing U.S. Best Buy stores. We
gained market share in flat-panel TVs last year due in part to these investments.
Additional home theater investments are planned for the coming year so we can
serve a broader array of needs.

Third, we built
our small business capabilities. We added Best Buy For Business locations to nearly
200 U.S. Best Buy stores, and trained more than 500 Microsoft-certified
professionals by year-end. We plan to continue to grow this business in the
coming year by adding capabilities in Voice over Internet Protocol (VOIP),
through our acquisition of Speakeasy, Inc. (“Speakeasy”). We believe this
acquisition also will improve our ability to form strong relationships with
small business customers, as customers wish to save on their telecommunications
costs and have a single source for their technology needs.

Fourth, we grew
our services business by driving productivity improvements in computer services
and home theater installation. We implemented new scheduling, routing and
dispatch tools; launched a centralized repair facility (called Geek Squad
City); and began a move to test a market-based approach to home visits and
gained economies of scale. In the coming year, we hope to accelerate the growth
of our services business, particularly our home theater installation business,
based on consumer demand.

Fifth, we began
to enhance our ability to provide complete solutions to customers. Our stores
and Web sites need better tools and capabilities for describing, demonstrating
and selling solutions such as digital music subscriptions, digital cable and
voice over Internet telephony. We made modest progress in this area during the
year and plan to accelerate this work in the coming year, starting with the
infrastructure to support ongoing subscription relationships.

Sixth, we have embarked on a controlled international growth strategy,
beginning with China, where we have operated sourcing offices for over three
years. Through our acquisition of Five Star, we expanded our retail footprint
into China. We also opened our first Best Buy store in China, an 80,000-square-foot
store located in Shanghai. We anticipate advancing our international growth
strategy by opening two to three additional Best Buy stores in China


within the next 12 to 18 months, and by opening test stores in Mexico
and Turkey, also within the next 12 to 18 months.

Results of Operations

Fiscal 2007 Summary

·

Net earnings in fiscal
2007 increased 21% to $1.4 billion, or $2.79 per diluted share, compared with
$1.1 billion, or $2.27 per diluted share, in fiscal 2006. The increase was
driven by revenue growth, including the addition of new stores during fiscal
2007 and a comparable store sales gain of 5.0%, and a decrease in our SG&A
rate. These factors were partially offset by a decrease in our gross profit
rate and a higher effective income tax rate.

·

Revenue in fiscal 2007
increased 16% to $35.9 billion. The increase reflected market share gains and
was driven by the addition of new Best Buy and Future Shop stores during fiscal
2007, a full year of revenue from stores added in fiscal 2006, a 5.0% comparable
store sales increase, and the acquisitions of Five Star and Pacific Sales. The
remainder of the increase was due primarily to the inclusion of an extra week
of business in fiscal 2007 and the favorable effect of fluctuations in foreign
currency exchange rates.

·

Our gross profit rate in
fiscal 2007 decreased by 0.6% of revenue to 24.4% of revenue. The decrease was
due primarily to a lower-margin revenue mix, including increased revenue from
notebook computers and video gaming hardware. Also contributing to the
decrease, in order of impact, were a more promotional environment in the
consumer electronics and home-office product groups, and the inclusion of our
China operations for a portion of the year.

·

Our SG&A rate in
fiscal 2007 decreased by 0.9% of revenue to 18.8% of revenue. The decrease was
due primarily to the leveraging effect of the 16% growth in revenue and reduced
performance-based incentive compensation. Also contributing to the decrease in
our SG&A rate in fiscal 2007, in order of impact, were controlled expenses
related to our strategic initiatives and expense reduction efforts. These
factors were partially offset by increased expenses related to asset
impairments, litigation and business closure costs.

·

Net earnings in fiscal
2007 included income of $20 million ($13 million net of tax, or $0.03 per
diluted share) related to the gain from the sale of our investment in Golf
Galaxy, Inc. In addition, net earnings in fiscal 2007 included income of
$19 million ($12 million net of tax, or $0.02 per diluted share) related to
additional recognition of gift card breakage (gift cards sold where the
likelihood of the gift card being redeemed by the customer is remote). The gift
card breakage was recorded as a result of determining our legal obligation to remit
the value of unredeemed gift cards to certain states not reflected in our
initial fiscal 2006 gift card breakage recognition.

·

During fiscal 2007, we
added Magnolia Home Theater rooms to nearly 200 new and existing U.S. Best Buy
locations, bringing the total number of Magnolia Home Theater rooms inside U.S.
Best Buy stores to more than 300 at the end of fiscal 2007.

·

Effective with the cash
dividend paid in the third quarter of fiscal 2007, we increased our quarterly
cash dividend per common share by 25%, to $0.10 per common share. During fiscal
2007, we made four dividend payments totaling $0.36 per common share, or $174
million in the aggregate.

·

During fiscal 2007, we purchased and retired 11.8 million

shares
of our common stock at a cost of $599 million pursuant to our share repurchase
programs.

·

In fiscal 2007, we and The
Best Buy Children’s Foundation contributed approximately $25 million to local
communities. The Best Buy Children’s Foundation supports educational programs
that integrate and leverage today’s technology.


Consolidated
Results

The following table presents selected
consolidated financial data for each of the past three fiscal years ($ in
millions, except per share amounts):

Note: All periods
presented reflect the classification of Musicland’s financial results as
discontinued operations.

(1)

Fiscal
2007 included 53 weeks. Fiscal 2006 and 2005 each included 52 weeks.

(2)

During
the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, following a review of our lease accounting
practices, we recorded a cumulative pre-tax charge of $36 ($23 net of tax, or
$0.05 per diluted share) to correct our accounting for certain operating lease
matters. Additionally, we established a sales return liability which reduced
revenue by $65 and gross profit by $15 ($10 net of tax, or $0.02 per diluted
share). Finally, based on the favorable resolution of outstanding tax matters
with the Internal Revenue Service regarding the disposition of our interest in
Musicland, we recorded a $50 tax benefit. The tax benefit is included in gain
on disposal of discontinued operations.

(3)

Comprised of revenue at store and Web
sites operating for at least 14 full months, as well as remodeled and expanded
locations. Relocated stores are excluded from the comparable store sales
calculation until at least 14 full months after reopening. Acquired stores are
included in the comparable store sales calculation beginning with the first
full quarter following the first anniversary of the date of acquisition. The
calculation of the comparable store sales percentage gain excludes the effect
of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. All comparable store sales
percentage calculations reflect an equal number of weeks. The method of
calculating comparable store sales varies across the retail industry. As a
result, our method of calculating comparable store sales may not be the same as
other retailers’ methods.

Continuing Operations

Fiscal 2007 Results Compared With Fiscal 2006

Fiscal 2007 net
earnings were $1.4 billion, or $2.79 per diluted share, compared with $1.1
billion, or $2.27 per diluted share, in fiscal 2006. The increase was driven by
revenue growth, including the addition of new stores during fiscal 2007 and a
comparable store sales gain of 5.0%, and a decrease in our SG&A rate. These
factors were partially offset by a decrease in our gross profit rate and a
higher effective income tax rate. Net earnings in fiscal 2007 also benefited
from net interest income of $111 million, compared with net interest income of
$77 million in the prior fiscal year.

Revenue in
fiscal 2007 increased 16% to $35.9 billion, compared with $30.8 billion in
fiscal 2006. The increase resulted primarily from the addition of 87 new Best
Buy and Future Shop stores during fiscal 2007, a full year of revenue from new
stores added in fiscal 2006, a 5.0% comparable store sales gain, and the
acquisitions of Five Star and Pacific Sales. The remainder of the revenue
increase was due primarily to the inclusion of an extra week of business in
fiscal 2007, the favorable effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange
rates and income related to our additional recognition of gift card breakage.
The addition of new Best Buy and Future Shop stores during the past two fiscal
years accounted for nearly four-tenths of the revenue increase in fiscal 2007; the
comparable store sales gain accounted for three-tenths of the revenue increase;
the acquisitions of Five Star and Pacific Sales accounted for nearly two-tenths
of the revenue increase; the inclusion of an extra week of business in fiscal
2007 accounted for one-tenth of the revenue increase; and the remainder of the
revenue increase was due to the favorable effect of fluctuations in foreign
currency exchange rates, as well as income related to our additional
recognition of gift card breakage.

Our comparable
store sales gain in fiscal 2007 benefited from a higher average transaction amount
driven by the continued growth in higher-ticket items, including flat-panel


televisions and
notebook computers. In addition, comparable store sales were driven by
continued customer demand for and the increased affordability of these products,
as strong unit volume growth was somewhat muted by declines in average selling
prices. Products having the largest impact on our fiscal 2007 comparable store
sales gain included flat-panel televisions, notebook computers, video gaming
and MP3 players and accessories. An increase in online purchases also
contributed to the fiscal 2007 comparable store sales gain, as we continued to
add features and capabilities to our Web sites. Revenue from our online
operations increased approximately 36% in fiscal 2007 and added to the overall
comparable store sales increase.

Our gross
profit rate in fiscal 2007 decreased by 0.6% of revenue to 24.4% of revenue.
The decrease was due primarily to a lower-margin revenue mix, including
increased revenue from notebook computers and video gaming hardware. Also
contributing to the decrease, in order of impact, were a more promotional
environment in the consumer electronics and home-office product groups, and the
inclusion of our China operations for a portion of the year. Our China
operations, which carry a significantly lower gross profit rate than our other
operations, reduced our gross profit rate in fiscal 2007 by approximately 0.2%
of revenue.

Our SG&A
rate in fiscal 2007 decreased by 0.9% of revenue to 18.8% of revenue. The
decrease was due primarily to the leveraging effect of the 16% growth in
revenue and reduced performance-based incentive compensation. Also contributing
to the decrease, in order of impact, were controlled expenses related to our
strategic initiatives and expense reduction efforts. Our China operations,
which carry a significantly lower SG&A rate than our other operations,
reduced our SG&A rate by approximately 0.1% of revenue in fiscal 2007.
These factors were partially offset by expenses related to increased asset
impairments, litigation and business closure costs.

Because retailers do not uniformly record costs of operating their
supply chain between cost of goods sold and SG&A, our gross profit rate and
SG&A rate may not be comparable to other retailers’ corresponding rates.
For additional information regarding costs classified in cost of goods sold and
SG&A, refer to Note 1,

Fiscal 2006 Results Compared With Fiscal 2005

Fiscal 2006
earnings from continuing operations were $1.1 billion, or $2.27 per diluted
share, compared with $934 million, or $1.86 per diluted share, in fiscal 2005.
The increase was driven primarily by revenue growth, including the addition of
new stores during fiscal 2006 and a comparable store sales gain of 4.9%, and a
significant increase in our gross profit rate. These factors were partially
offset by an increase in our SG&A expenses. In addition, earnings from
continuing operations in fiscal 2006 benefited from net interest income of $77
million, compared with net interest income of $1 million in fiscal 2005, and a
lower effective income tax rate.

Revenue in
fiscal 2006 increased 12% to $30.8 billion, compared with $27.4 billion in
fiscal 2005. The increase resulted from the addition of 103 stores in fiscal
2006, a full year of revenue from new stores added in fiscal 2005, a 4.9% comparable
store sales gain and the favorable effect of fluctuations in foreign currency
exchange rates. The addition of new stores during the past two fiscal years
accounted for more than one-half of the revenue increase in fiscal 2006. The
comparable store sales gain accounted for nearly four-tenths of the revenue
increase, and the remainder of the revenue increase was due primarily to the
favorable effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, as well as
income related to our initial recognition of gift card breakage.

We believe our
comparable store sales gain in fiscal 2006 benefited from continued demand for
the latest technologies and advanced product features. In addition, the
increased affordability of consumer electronics products contributed to the
comparable store sales gain. Products having the largest impact on our fiscal
2006 comparable store sales gain included flat-panel televisions, MP3 players
and accessories, notebook computers, digital cameras and accessories and video
gaming hardware. Flat-panel television sales were very strong as unit volume
growth and increased screen size more than offset declines in the average
selling prices of these products. MP3 products also generated strong comparable
store sales gains as customers continue to adopt, upgrade and add accessories
to digital music players.

Our gross
profit rate in fiscal 2006 increased by 1.3% of revenue to 25.0% of revenue.
The increase was driven by the continued transformation of our supply chain,
which enabled us to improve margins through lower product costs, more effective
pricing strategies and increased sales of higher-margin services; and
private-label products. We


also benefited
from better product transition management and a more stable promotional
environment.

Our SG&A rate in fiscal 2006 increased by 1.3% of revenue to 19.7%
of revenue. The increase was due primarily to increased performance-based
incentive compensation resulting from our strong financial performance; a
growing number of stores operating under the higher-cost, customer-centric
labor model; costs associated with supporting our services business and the
absence of favorable settlements with two credit card companies as recognized
in fiscal 2005. These factors were partially offset by expense leverage resulting
from a higher revenue base, as well as the absence of charges recognized in
fiscal 2005 to correct our accounting for leases and to settle litigation. The
change in our accounting for stock-based compensation increased our fiscal 2006
SG&A rate by approximately 0.4% of revenue compared with the prior fiscal
year.

Segment Performance

Domestic

The following table presents selected
financial data for our Domestic segment for each of the past three fiscal years
($ in millions):

(1)

Fiscal
2007 included 53 weeks. Fiscal 2006 and 2005 each included 52 weeks.

(2)

Comprised of revenue at store and Web
sites operating for at least 14 full months, as well as remodeled and expanded
locations. Relocated stores are excluded from the comparable store sales
calculation until at least 14 full months after reopening. Acquired stores are
included in the comparable store sales calculation beginning with the first
full quarter following the first anniversary of the date of acquisition. All
comparable store sales percentage calculations reflect an equal number of
weeks. The method of calculating comparable store sales varies across the
retail industry. As a result, our method of calculating comparable store sales
may not be the same as other retailers’ methods.

In fiscal 2007,
our Domestic segment’s operating income was $1.9 billion, or 6.1% of revenue,
compared with $1.6 billion, or 5.8% of revenue, in fiscal 2006. The Domestic
segment’s operating income rate in fiscal 2007 benefited from revenue gains,
including the addition of 80 new Best Buy stores during fiscal 2007 and a 4.1%
comparable store sales increase, and a decrease in the SG&A rate, partially
offset by a decrease in the gross profit rate.

Our Domestic
segment’s revenue in fiscal 2007 increased 13% to $31.0 billion. The addition
of new stores during the past two fiscal years accounted for nearly one-half of
the revenue increase in fiscal 2007; a 4.1% comparable store sales gain
accounted for approximately three-tenths of the revenue increase; the inclusion
of an extra week of business in fiscal 2007 accounted for over one-tenth of the
revenue increase; and the remainder of the revenue increase was due primarily
to the acquisition of Pacific Sales and income related to our additional
recognition of gift card breakage.

Our Domestic
segment’s comparable store sales gain in fiscal 2007 benefited from a higher
average transaction amount driven by the continued growth in higher-ticket
items, including flat-panel televisions and notebook computers. Also
contributing to the fiscal 2007 comparable store sales gain was an increase in
online purchases, as we continued to add features and capabilities to our Web
sites. Revenue from our Domestic segment’s online operations increased
approximately 39% in fiscal 2007 and added to the overall comparable store
sales increase.

Our Domestic
segment’s consumer electronics product group posted an 8.7% comparable store
sales gain in fiscal 2007, driven by sales of flat-panel televisions and MP3
players and accessories, partially offset by declines in tube and projection
televisions. Comparable store sales gains from flat-panel television
unit-volume growth and increased screen size were somewhat muted by declines in
average selling prices.


A 3.0%
comparable store sales gain in our Domestic segment’s entertainment software
product group was due primarily to sales growth in video gaming, driven by the
increased affordability of existing platforms, as well as the launches of Sony
Playstation 3 and Nintendo Wii. The comparable store sales gains were partially
offset by continued softness in sales of new music and movie releases.

Our Domestic
segment’s home-office product group recorded a 0.5% comparable store sales
decrease in fiscal 2007, driven primarily by declines in desktop computers and
printers. The comparable store sales declines were partially offset by growth
in notebook computers, reflecting continued consumer demand for portable
technology.

A 2.1%
comparable store sales decline in our Domestic segment’s appliances product
group was driven primarily by declines in sales of small appliances. Comparable
store sales of major appliances were flat in fiscal 2007, as benefits from the
expansion of our improved appliance assortments were offset by a softer housing
market.

Our
Domestic segment’s gross profit rate in fiscal 2007 decreased by 0.5% of
revenue to 24.8% of revenue.

The decrease was due primarily to a
lower-margin revenue mix, including increased revenue from notebook computers
and video gaming hardware. Also contributing to the decrease was a more
promotional environment in the consumer electronics and home-office product groups.

Our Domestic segment’s SG&A rate in fiscal 2007 decreased by 0.7%
of revenue to 18.8% of revenue. The decrease was due primarily to the
leveraging effect of the 13% growth in revenue and reduced performance-based
incentive compensation. Also contributing to the decrease, in order of impact,
were controlled expenses related to our strategic initiatives and expense
reduction efforts. These factors were partially offset by expenses related to
increased asset impairments, litigation and business closure costs.

International

The following table presents selected
financial data for our International segment for each of the past three fiscal
years ($ in millions):

(1)

Fiscal
2007 included 53 weeks. Fiscal 2006 and 2005 each included 52 weeks.

(2)

Comprised of revenue at stores and
Web sites operating for at least 14 full months, as well as remodeled and
expanded locations. Relocated stores are excluded from the comparable store
sales calculation until at least 14 full months after reopening. Acquired
stores are included in the comparable store sales calculation beginning with
the first full quarter following the first anniversary of the date of
acquisition. The calculation of the comparable store sales percentage gain
excludes the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. All
comparable store sales percentage calculations reflect an equal number of
weeks. The method of calculating comparable store sales varies across the
retail industry. As a result, our method of calculating comparable store sales
may not be the same as other retailers’ methods.

In fiscal 2007, our International segment’s
operating income was $110 million, or 2.2% of revenue, compared with $56
million, or 1.6% of revenue, in fiscal 2006. The increase in our International
segment’s operating income resulted primarily from revenue gains, including the
acquisition of Five Star and an 11.7% comparable store sales increase, and a
significant reduction in the SG&A rate. These factors were partially offset
by a decrease in the gross profit rate.

Our International segment’s revenue increased 41% to $4.9 billion in
fiscal 2007, compared with $3.5 billion in fiscal 2006. The acquisition of Five
Star accounted for nearly four-tenths of the revenue increase in fiscal 2007;
the 11.7% comparable store sales gain accounted for nearly three-tenths of the
revenue increase; the addition of new Best Buy and Future Shop stores during
the past two fiscal years accounted for over one-tenth of the revenue increase;
the favorable effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates
accounted for over one-tenth of the revenue increase; and the inclusion of an
extra week of business in fiscal 2007 accounted for the remainder of the
revenue increase.

We believe the comparable store sales increase reflected market share
gains and was driven by increased sales of flat-panel televisions, video gaming
and notebook computers, partially offset by declines in tube and projection
televisions. Our International segment reported comparable store sales
increases in fiscal 2007 in the consumer electronics, home-office,
entertainment software and appliances product groups of 15.5%, 7.6%, 12.1% and
8.1%, respectively. Revenue from our International segment’s online operations
increased approximately 19% and added to the overall comparable store sales
increase.

Our International segment’s gross profit rate in fiscal 2007 decreased
by 1.3% of revenue to 21.6% of revenue. Our China operations, which carry a
significantly lower gross profit rate than our Canada operations, reduced our
International segment’s gross profit rate by approximately 1.1% of revenue in
fiscal 2007. The remainder of the decrease in our International segment’s gross
profit rate was due primarily to increased financing costs, resulting from
increased borrowing rates and a shift toward longer-term financing programs in
conjunction with strong flat-panel television sales.

Our International segment’s SG&A rate in
fiscal 2007 decreased by 1.9% of revenue to 19.4% of revenue. Our China
operations, which carry a significantly lower SG&A rate than our Canada
operations, reduced our International segment’s SG&A rate by approximately
0.7% of revenue in fiscal 2007. The remainder of the decrease in our
International segment’s SG&A rate was due primarily to, in order of impact,
the leveraging effect of the 41% growth in revenue; improvements in the labor
model used in our Canada Best Buy stores; reduced Canada headquarters payroll
costs at the end of fiscal 2006; and the leveraging effect of the 11.7%
comparable store sales gain on advertising expense as a percentage of revenue.
A performance-driven increase in incentive-based compensation, expenses
incurred related to the closure of all six Canada Geek Squad stores in the
second quarter of fiscal 2007 and increased asset impairment charges partially
offset the decrease.

throughout all of Canada’s provinces; 44 Canada Best Buy stores in Ontario,
Quebec, Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba and Saskatchewan; and five Canada
Geek Squad stores in British Columbia and Ontario.

Discontinued
Operations

In fiscal 2004, we sold our interest in Musicland. The buyer assumed
all of Musicland’s liabilities, including approximately $500 million in lease
obligations and paid no cash consideration, in exchange for all of the capital
stock of Musicland. The transaction also resulted in the transfer

of all of Musicland’s assets, other than a
distribution center in Franklin, Indiana, and selected nonoperating assets.

On March 25, 2005, we received
notification from the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) of a favorable
resolution of outstanding tax matters regarding the disposition of our interest
in Musicland. Based on the agreement with the IRS, we reversed previously recorded
valuation allowances on deferred tax assets related to the disposition of our
interest in Musicland and recognized a $50 million tax benefit in fiscal 2005.

Additional
Consolidated Results

Net Interest
Income

Net interest income increased to $111 million in fiscal 2007, compared
with net interest income of $77 million in fiscal 2006. The increase in net
interest income was due primarily to higher investment yields. Fiscal 2007 net
interest income included $11 million of interest expense related to our
financing leases, compared with $8 million of interest expense in fiscal 2006.

We recognized
net interest income of $77 million in fiscal 2006, compared with net interest
income of $1 million in fiscal 2005. The increase in net interest income was
primarily a result of higher yields on investments and higher average
investment balances. Fiscal 2006 net interest income included $8 million of
interest expense related to our financing leases, while fiscal 2005 included
$21 million of interest expense related to our financing leases as a result of
correcting our accounting for leases in fiscal 2005.

For additional information regarding net interest income, refer to Note
7,

Net Interest Income

, of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8,

Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data

, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Effective Income Tax Rate

Our effective
income tax rate increased to 35.3% in fiscal 2007, compared with 33.7% in
fiscal 2006. The increase in the effective income tax rate in fiscal 2007 was
due primarily to a change in the composition of taxable income between foreign
and domestic entities.


Our effective income tax rate decreased to 33.7% in fiscal 2006,
compared with 35.3% in fiscal 2005. The decrease in the effective income tax
rate in fiscal 2006 was due primarily to increased income tax benefits from our
foreign operations and higher levels of tax-exempt interest.

Impact of Inflation and Changing Prices

Highly competitive market conditions and the general economic
environment minimized inflation’s impact on the selling prices of our products
and services, and on our expenses. In addition, price deflation and the
continued commoditization of key technology products affect our ability to
increase our gross profit rate.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Summary

We ended fiscal
2007 with $3.8 billion of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments,
consistent with the end of fiscal 2006. Working capital, the excess of current
assets over current liabilities, was $2.8 billion at the end of fiscal 2007, up
from $1.9 billion at the end of fiscal 2006. The increase in working capital
was due primarily to the reclassification of $402 million of convertible
debentures from short-term to long-term debt and an increase in other current
assets, driven by restricted cash assumed in connection with the acquisition of
Five Star. Five Star’s restricted cash represents bank deposits pledged as
security for certain vendor payables.

Cash equivalents consist primarily of money market accounts and other
highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less when
purchased. Our short-term investments are comprised of municipal and U.S.
government debt securities as well as auction-rate securities and variable-rate
demand notes, with original maturities greater than 90 days but less than one
year. Long-term investments are also comprised of municipal and U.S. government
debt securities, but with original maturities of one year or more.

In accordance
with our investment policy, we place our investments with issuers who have
high-quality credit and limit the amount of investment exposure to any one
issuer. We seek to preserve principal and minimize exposure to interest-rate
fluctuations by limiting default risk, market risk and reinvestment risk.

The carrying
amount of our investments approximated fair value at March 3, 2007, and February 25,
2006, due to the rapid turnover of our portfolio and the highly liquid nature
of these investments. Therefore, there were no significant realized or
unrealized gains or losses.

Our liquidity is affected by restricted cash and investments in debt
securities that are pledged as collateral or restricted to use for vendor
payables, general liability insurance, workers’ compensation insurance and
warranty programs. Restricted cash and investments in debt securities, which
are included in other current assets, totaled $382 million and $178 million as
of March 3, 2007, and February 25, 2006, respectively. The increase
in restricted cash and investments in debt securities was due primarily to
restricted cash assumed in connection with the acquisition of Five Star.

Cash Flows

The following table summarizes our cash flows
from operating, investing and financing activities for each of the past three
fiscal years ($ in millions):

Operating
Activities

Cash provided
by operating activities was $1.8 billion in fiscal 2007, compared with $1.7
billion in fiscal 2006 and $2.0 billion in fiscal 2005. For fiscal 2007,
compared with fiscal 2006, increased net earnings and increases in deferred
income taxes and depreciation expense were partially offset by changes in
operating assets and liabilities.

Net earnings increased to $1.4 billion in fiscal 2007, compared with
$1.1 billion in fiscal 2006. The changes in operating assets and liabilities
were due primarily to


changes in accrued income taxes and merchandise inventories. The
increase in cash used for changes in accrued income taxes resulted mainly from
a higher effective income tax rate combined with the timing of payments. The
increase in cash used for changes in merchandise inventories was due primarily
to increased inventory levels. Inventory levels increased due to the addition
of new stores, expanded product assortments in key product categories and
improved in-stock positions.

Investing Activities

Cash used in investing activities was $780 million in fiscal 2007,
compared with $754 million in fiscal 2006 and $1.4 billion in fiscal 2005. The
change in cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2007, compared with
fiscal 2006, was due primarily to cash used to acquire Pacific Sales and Five
Star, and higher capital expenditures, partially offset by increased net sales
of investments in debt securities. Refer to “Capital Expenditures” below for
additional information. In fiscal 2007, we used cash for the construction of
new retail locations, information systems and other store projects, including
relocations and remodels. The primary purposes of the cash investment activity
were to support our expansion plans and improve our operational efficiency.

Financing Activities

Cash used in financing activities was $513 million in fiscal 2007,
compared with $619 million and $459 million in fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005,
respectively. The change in cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2007,
compared with fiscal 2006, was due primarily to a decrease in repurchases of
our common stock. During fiscal 2007, we repurchased $599 million of our common
stock, compared with $772 million in fiscal 2006. The decrease in repurchases
of common stock was partially offset by a decrease in proceeds from the
issuance of common stock in connection with our stock-based compensation
programs.

Sources of
Liquidity

Our most significant sources of liquidity continue to be funds
generated by operating activities, available cash and cash equivalents, and
short-term investments. We believe funds generated from the expected results of
operations, available cash and cash equivalents, and short-term investments
will be sufficient to finance anticipated expansion plans and strategic
initiatives for the next fiscal year. In addition, our revolving credit
facilities are available for additional working capital needs or investment
opportunities. There can be no assurance, however, that we will continue to
generate cash flows at or above current levels or that we will be able to
maintain our ability to borrow under our revolving credit facilities.

Our Domestic segment has a $200 million bank revolving credit facility
which is guaranteed by certain of our subsidiaries. The facility expires on December 22,
2009. Borrowings under this facility are unsecured and bear interest at rates
specified in the credit agreement. We also pay certain facility and agent fees.
There were no borrowings outstanding under these facilities for any period
presented. However, amounts outstanding under letters of credit reduce amounts
available under this facility. At March 3, 2007, and February 25, 2006,
$200 million and $199 million, respectively, were available under this
facility.

We also have inventory financing facilities through which certain
suppliers receive payments from a designated finance company on invoices we owe
them. At March 3, 2007, and February 25, 2006, $39 million and $59
million, respectively, were outstanding and included in accrued liabilities in
our consolidated balance sheets; and $196 million and $177 million,
respectively, were available for use under these inventory financing
facilities.

Our International segment has a $21 million revolving demand facility
for our Canada operations, of which $17 million is available from February through
July, and $21 million is available from August through January of
each year. There is no set expiration date for this facility. All borrowings
under this facility are made available at the sole discretion of the lender and
are payable on demand. Borrowings under this facility are unsecured and bear
interest at rates specified in the agreement. There were no borrowings
outstanding under this facility for any period presented. However, amounts
outstanding under letters of credit and letters of guarantee reduced amounts
available under this facility to $16 million and $17 million, at March 3,
2007, and February 25, 2006, respectively.

Our International segment also has a $23 million revolving demand
facility to finance working capital requirements for our China operations. This
facility may be terminated at any time and is subject to review by
June 30, 2007. $20 million in borrowings were outstanding under this
facility as of the balance sheet date. Borrowings under this facility are
secured by a guarantee of Best Buy Co., Inc. and bear interest at rates
specified in the agreement.

Our ability to
access our credit facilities is subject to our compliance with the terms and
conditions of the credit facilities, including financial covenants. The
financial


covenants
require us to maintain certain financial ratios. At the end of fiscal 2007, we
were in compliance with all such covenants. In the event we were to default on
any of our other debt, it would constitute a default under our credit
facilities as well.

An interest
coverage ratio represents the ratio of pre-tax earnings before fixed charges
(interest expense and the interest portion of rent expense) to fixed charges.
Our interest coverage ratio, calculated as reported in Exhibit No. 12.1 of
this Annual Report on Form 10-K, was 10.3 and 9.8 in fiscal 2007 and
2006, respectively.

Our credit ratings at April 30, 2007,
were as follows:

BBB

Stable

(1)

In
April 2006, Fitch Ratings revised its rating from BBB with a positive
outlook to BBB+ with a stable outlook. The upgrade reflected our leading market
position and successful operating strategy, which has resulted in strong
revenue growth and operating performance. The upgrade also reflected our highly
liquid balance sheet and considered our exposure to a very competitive industry
and changes in consumer spending over time.

(2)

In
April 2006, Moody’s Investors Service revised its rating from Baa3 with a
positive outlook to Baa2 with a stable outlook. The upgrade was based on our
ability to generate comparable store sales gains, while improving operating
profit margins, our continued investment in opening or converting stores to the
customer-centric platform, our ability to maintain our liquidity and credit
metrics, and expectations that our varied growth initiatives will not adversely
affect revenue or net earnings.

Factors that can affect our credit ratings include changes in our
operating performance, the economic environment, conditions in the retail and
consumer electronics industries, our financial position and changes in our
business strategy. We do not currently foresee any reasonable circumstances
under which our credit ratings would be significantly downgraded. If a
downgrade were to occur, it could adversely impact, among other things, our
future borrowing costs, access to capital markets and vendor financing terms
and result in higher long-term lease costs. In addition, the conversion rights
of the holders of our convertible subordinated debentures could be accelerated
if our credit ratings were to be significantly downgraded.

Capital Expenditures

A component of our long-term strategy is our capital expenditure
program. This program includes, among other things, investments in new stores,
store remodeling, store relocations and expansions, new distribution facilities
and information technology enhancements. During fiscal 2007, we invested $733
million in property and equipment, including opening 96 new stores, adding
Magnolia Home Theater rooms inside nearly 200 new and existing U.S. Best Buy
stores, relocating 20 stores and upgrading our information technology systems.
Capital expenditures are funded through cash provided by operating activities,
as well as available cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments.

Outlook for
Fiscal 2008

expenditure plans in fiscal 2008.

Debt and Capital

In January 2002,
we sold convertible subordinated debentures having an aggregate principal
amount of $402 million. The proceeds from the offering, net of $6 million in
offering expenses, were $396 million. The debentures mature in 2022 and are
callable at par, at our option, for cash on or after January 15, 2007.

Holders may
require us to purchase all or a portion of their debentures on January 15,
2012, and January 15, 2017, at a purchase price equal to 100% of the
principal amount of the debentures plus accrued and unpaid interest up to but
not including the date of purchase. We have the option to settle the purchase
price in cash, stock, or a combination of cash and stock. On January 15,
2007, holders had the option to require us to purchase all or a portion of
their debentures, at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of
the debentures plus accrued and unpaid interest up to but not including the
date of purchase. However, no debentures were so purchased.

The debentures
become convertible into shares of our common stock at a conversion rate of
21.7391 shares per $1,000 principal amount of debentures, equivalent to an
initial conversion price of $46.00 per share, if the closing price of our
common stock exceeds a specified price for 20 consecutive trading days in a 30-trading
day period preceding the date of conversion, if our credit rating falls below
specified levels, if the debentures are called for redemption or if certain
specified corporate transactions occur. During a portion of fiscal 2007, our
closing stock price exceeded the specified stock price for more than 20 trading
days in a 30-day trading period. Therefore,

debenture holders had the option to convert their debentures

into
shares of our common stock. However, no debentures were so converted. Due to
changes in the price of our common stock, the debentures were no longer
convertible at March 3, 2007, and have not been convertible through May 1,
2007.

The debentures
have an interest rate of 2.25% per annum. The interest rate may be reset, but
not below 2.25% or above 3.25%, on July 15, 2011, and July 15, 2016.
One of our subsidiaries has guaranteed the convertible debentures.

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, in connection with the review
of our lease accounting practices, we recorded a $107 million financing lease
obligation for lease transactions that did not qualify for sale-leaseback
accounting treatment. At the end of fiscal 2007, $171 million was outstanding
under financing lease obligations.

Share Repurchases and Dividends

From time to
time, we repurchase our common stock in the open market pursuant to programs
approved by our Board. We may repurchase our common stock for a variety of
reasons, such as acquiring shares to offset dilution related to equity-based
incentives, including stock options and our employee stock purchase plan, and
optimizing our capital structure.

In June 2006,
our Board authorized a $1.5 billion share repurchase program. The program,
which became effective June 21, 2006, terminated and replaced a $1.5
billion share repurchase program authorized by our Board in April 2005.
There is no expiration date governing the period over which we can make our
share repurchases under the June 2006 share repurchase program.

The April 2005
share repurchase program, which became effective on April 27, 2005,
terminated and replaced a $500 million share repurchase program authorized by
our Board in June 2004.

During fiscal
2007, we purchased and retired 5.6 million shares at a cost of $267 million
under the June 2006 share repurchase program, and 6.2 million shares at a
cost of $332 million under the April 2005 share repurchase program. At the
end of fiscal 2007, $1.2 billion of the $1.5 billion originally authorized by
our Board was available for future share repurchases under the June 2006
share repurchase program.

During fiscal
2006, we purchased and retired 16.5 million shares at a cost of $711 million
under the April 2005 share repurchase program, and 1.8 million shares at a
cost of $61 million under the June 2004 share repurchase program.

We consider
several factors in determining when to make share repurchases including, among
other things, our cash needs and the market price of our stock. We expect that
cash provided by future operating activities, as well as available cash and
cash equivalents and short-term investments, will be the sources of funding for
our share repurchase program. Based on the anticipated amounts to be generated
from those sources of funds in relation to the remaining authorization approved
by our Board under the June 2006 share repurchase program, we do not
expect that future share repurchases will have a material impact on our
short-term or long-term liquidity.


In fiscal 2004,
our Board initiated the payment of a regular quarterly cash dividend, then
$0.07 per common share per quarter. A quarterly cash dividend has been paid in
each subsequent quarter. Effective with the quarterly cash dividend paid in the
third quarter of fiscal 2005, we increased our quarterly cash dividend per
common share by 10%. Effective with the quarterly cash dividend paid in the
third quarter of fiscal 2006, we increased our quarterly cash dividend per
common share by 9%, to $0.08 per common share per quarter. Effective with the
quarterly cash dividend paid in the third quarter of fiscal 2007, we increased
our quarterly cash dividend per common share by 25% to $0.10 per common share
per quarter. The payment of cash dividends is subject to customary legal and
contractual restrictions. During fiscal 2007, we made four dividend payments
totaling $0.36 per common share, or $174 million in the aggregate.

During fiscal 2007, we returned a total of $773 million to shareholders
through share repurchases and dividend payments.

Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements and
Contractual Obligations

Other than
operating leases, we do not have any off-balance-sheet financing. We
finance a portion of our new-store development program through sale-leaseback
transactions. These transactions involve selling stores to unrelated parties
and then leasing the stores back. The leases are accounted for as operating
leases in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States (“GAAP”)

.

A summary
of our operating lease obligations by fiscal year is included in the “Contractual
Obligations” section below. Additional information regarding our operating
leases is available in Item 2,

Properties

, and
Note 8,

Leases

, of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8,

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

,
of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Our
debt-to-capitalization ratio, which represents the ratio of total debt,
including the current portion of long-term debt, to total capitalization (total
debt plus total shareholders’ equity), improved to 9% at the end of fiscal
2007, compared with 10% at the end of fiscal 2006. The improvement was due
primarily to an increase in shareholders’ equity. We view our
debt-to-capitalization ratio as an important indicator of our creditworthiness.
Our adjusted debt-to-capitalization ratio, including capitalized operating
lease obligations (rental expense for all operating leases multiplied by
eight), was 49% at the end of fiscal 2007, consistent with the end of fiscal
2006.

Our adjusted
debt-to-capitalization ratio, including capitalized operating lease
obligations, is considered a non-GAAP financial measure and is not in
accordance with, or preferable to, the ratio determined in accordance with
GAAP. However, we have included this information as we believe that our
adjusted debt-to-capitalization ratio, including capitalized operating lease
obligations, is important for understanding our operations and provides
meaningful additional information about our ability to service our long-term
debt and other fixed obligations, and to fund our future growth. In addition,
we believe our adjusted debt-to-capitalization ratio, including capitalized
operating lease obligations, is relevant because it enables investors to
compare our indebtedness to retailers who own, rather than lease, their stores.
Our decision to own or lease real estate is based on an assessment of our
financial liquidity, our capital structure, our desire to own or to lease the
location, the owner’s desire to own or to lease the location, and the alternative
that results in the highest return to our shareholders.

The most
directly comparable GAAP financial measure to our adjusted
debt-to-capitalization ratio, including capitalized operating lease
obligations, is our debt-to-capitalization ratio. Our debt-to-capitalization
ratio excludes capitalized operating lease obligations in both the numerator
and denominator of the calculation in the following table.


The following table presents a reconciliation
of the numerator and denominator used in the calculation of our adjusted
debt-to-capitalization ratio, including capitalized operating lease obligations
($ in millions):

The multiple of eight times rental
expense used to calculate our capitalized operating lease obligations total is

credit rating agencies that rate our creditworthiness.

Operating
lease obligations do not include payments to landlords covering real estate
taxes and common area maintenance. These charges, if included, would increase
total operating lease obligations by $1.6 billion at March 3, 2007.

(2)

Purchase
obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are
enforceable, are legally binding and specify all significant terms, including
fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price
provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Purchase obligations
do not include agreements that are cancelable without penalty. Additionally,
although they are not legally binding agreements, we included open purchase
orders in the table above. Substantially all open purchase orders are fulfilled
within 30 days.

(3)

Included
in other long-term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet at March 3,
2007, was a $75 million obligation for deferred compensation. As the specific
payment dates for the deferred compensation are unknown, the related balances
have not been reflected in the “Payments Due by Period” section of the above
table.


Critical Accounting Estimates

Our
consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. In
connection with the preparation of our financial statements, we are required to
make assumptions and estimates about future events, and apply judgments that
affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and the
related disclosures. We base our assumptions, estimates and judgments on
historical experience, current trends and other factors that management
believes to be relevant at the time our consolidated financial statements are
prepared. On a regular basis, management reviews the accounting policies,
assumptions, estimates and judgments to ensure that our financial statements
are presented fairly and in accordance with GAAP. However, because future
events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results
could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be
material.

Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 1,

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

,
of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8,

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

,
of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Management believes that the
following accounting estimates are the most critical to aid in fully
understanding and evaluating our reported financial results, and they require
management’s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, resulting from
the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently
uncertain. Management has reviewed these critical accounting estimates and
related disclosures with the Audit Committee of our Board.

Inventory
  Reserves

We value our
  inventory at the lower of the average cost of the inventory or fair market
  value through the establishment of markdown and inventory loss reserves.

Our markdown reserve
  represents the excess of the carrying value, typically average cost, over the
  amount we expect to realize from the ultimate sale or other disposal of the
  inventory. Markdowns establish a new cost basis for our inventory. Subsequent
  changes in facts or circumstances do not result in the reversal of previously
  recorded markdowns or an increase in that newly established cost basis.

Our inventory loss
  reserve represents anticipated physical inventory losses (e.g., theft) that
  have occurred since the last physical inventory date. Independent physical
  inventory counts are taken on a regular basis to ensure the inventory
  reported in our consolidated financial statements is properly stated. During
  the interim period between physical inventory counts, we reserve for
  anticipated physical inventory losses on a location-by-location
  basis.

Our markdown reserve
  contains uncertainties because the calculation requires management to make
  assumptions and to apply judgment regarding inventory aging, forecasted
  consumer demand, the promotional environment and technological obsolescence.

Our inventory loss
  reserve contains uncertainties because the calculation requires management to
  make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding a number of factors,
  including historical results and current inventory loss trends.

We have not made any
  material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish our markdown
  or inventory loss reserves during the past three fiscal years.

We do not believe
  there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the
  future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our markdown reserve.
  However, if estimates regarding consumer demand are inaccurate or changes in
  technology affect demand for certain products in an unforeseen manner, we may
  be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. A 10% difference in our
  actual markdown reserve at March 3, 2007, would have affected net
  earnings by approximately $3 million in fiscal 2007.

We do not believe
  there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the
  future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our inventory loss
  reserve. However, if our estimates regarding physical inventory losses are
  inaccurate, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. A
  10% difference in actual physical inventory losses reserved for at March 3,
  2007, would have affected net earnings by approximately $4 million in fiscal
  2007.

Long-Lived
  Assets

Long-lived
  assets other than goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets,
  which are separately tested for impairment, are evaluated for impairment
  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value
  may not be recoverable.

When evaluating long-lived
  assets for potential impairment, we first compare the carrying value of the
  asset to the asset’s estimated future cash flows (undiscounted and without
  interest charges). If the estimated future cash flows are less than the
  carrying value of the asset, we calculate an impairment loss. The impairment
  loss calculation compares the carrying value of the asset to the asset’s
  estimated fair value, which may be based on estimated future cash flows
  (discounted and with interest charges). We recognize an impairment loss if
  the amount of the asset’s carrying value exceeds the asset’s estimated fair
  value. If we recognize an impairment loss, the adjusted carrying amount of
  the asset becomes its new cost basis. For a depreciable long-lived
  asset, the new cost basis will be depreciated (amortized) over the remaining
  useful life of that asset.

Using the impairment
  evaluation methodology described herein, we recorded long-lived asset
  impairment charges totaling $32 million, in the aggregate, during fiscal
  2007.

Our impairment loss
  calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make
  assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate future cash flows and asset
  fair values, including forecasting useful lives of the assets and selecting
  the discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows.

We have not made any
  material changes in our impairment loss assessment methodology during the
  past three fiscal years.

We do not believe
  there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the
  estimates or assumptions we use to calculate long-lived asset
  impairment losses. However, if actual results are not consistent with our
  estimates and assumptions used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair
  values, we may be exposed to losses that could be material.

Goodwill
  and Intangible Assets

We evaluate goodwill
  and other intangible assets for impairment annually and whenever events or
  changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the goodwill or other
  intangible assets may not be recoverable. We complete our impairment
  evaluation by performing internal valuation analyses, considering other
  publicly available market information and using an independent valuation
  firm, as appropriate.

In the fourth quarter
  of fiscal 2007, we completed our annual impairment testing of goodwill and
  other intangible assets using the methodology described herein, and
  determined there was no impairment.

The
  carrying value of goodwill at March 3, 2007, was $919 million. The
  carrying value of other intangible assets at March 3, 2007, was $81
  million.

We determine fair
  value using widely accepted valuation techniques, including discounted cash
  flow and market multiple analyses. These types of analyses contain
  uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to
  apply judgment to estimate industry economic factors and the profitability of
  future business strategies. It is our policy to conduct impairment testing
  based on our current business strategy in light of present industry and
  economic conditions, as well as future expectations.

We have not made any
  material changes in our impairment loss assessment methodology during the
  past three fiscal years.

We do not believe
  there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the
  future estimates or assumptions we use to test for impairment losses on goodwill
  and other intangible assets. However, if actual results are not consistent
  with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to an impairment charge
  that could be material.

Tax
  Contingencies

Our
  income tax returns, like those of most companies, are periodically audited by
  domestic and foreign tax authorities. These audits include questions
  regarding our tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of
  deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. At
  any one time, multiple tax years are subject to audit by the various tax
  authorities. In evaluating the exposures associated with our various tax
  filing positions, we record reserves for probable exposures. A number of
  years may elapse before a particular matter, for which we have established a
  reserve, is audited and fully resolved or clarified. We adjust our tax
  contingencies reserve and income tax provision in the period in which actual
  results of a settlement with tax authorities differs from our established reserve,
  the statute of limitations expires for the relevant tax authority to examine
  the tax position or when more information becomes available.

Effective March 4, 2007, we adopted
  FASB Interpretation (“FIN”) No. 48,

Accounting
  for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109.

We are currently evaluating the impact, if any, the adoption of FIN No. 48
  will have on retained earnings.

Our tax contingencies
  reserve contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions
  and to apply judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various
  filing positions.

Our effective income
  tax rate is also affected by changes in tax law, the tax jurisdiction of new
  stores or business ventures, the level of earnings and the results of tax
  audits.

Although management
  believes that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable,
  actual results could differ, and we may be exposed to losses or gains that
  could be material.

To the extent we
  prevail in matters for which reserves have been established, or are required
  to pay amounts in excess of our reserves, our effective income tax rate in a
  given financial statement period could be materially affected. An unfavorable
  tax settlement would require use of our cash and would result in an increase
  in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution. A favorable tax
  settlement would be recognized as a reduction in our effective income tax
  rate in the period of resolution.

Acquisitions —
  Purchase Price Allocation

In accordance with
  accounting for business combinations, we allocate the purchase price of an
  acquired business to its identifiable assets and liabilities based on
  estimated fair values. Minority interests’ proportionate ownership of assets
  and liabilities are recorded at historical carrying values. The excess of the
  purchase price over the amount allocated to the assets and liabilities, if
  any, is recorded as goodwill.

We use all available
  information to estimate fair values. We typically engage outside appraisal
  firms to assist in the fair value determination of inventory, identifiable
  intangible assets such as tradenames, and any other significant assets or
  liabilities. We adjust the preliminary purchase price allocation, as
  necessary, up to one year after the acquisition closing date as we obtain
  more information regarding asset valuations and liabilities assumed.

Our purchase price
  allocation methodology contains uncertainties because it requires management
  to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the fair value of
  acquired assets and liabilities. Management estimates the fair value of
  assets and liabilities based upon quoted market prices, the carrying value of
  the acquired assets and widely accepted valuation techniques, including
  discounted cash flows and market multiple analyses. Unanticipated events or
  circumstances may occur which could affect the accuracy of our fair value
  estimates, including assumptions regarding industry economic factors and
  business strategies.

During the last three
  fiscal years, we completed two significant acquisitions. On March 7,
  2006, we acquired Pacific Sales for $411 million including transaction costs.
  On June 8, 2006, we acquired a 75% interest in Five Star for $184
  million, including a working capital injection of $122 million and
  transaction costs. See Note 3,

Acquisitions

We do not believe there is
  a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future
  estimates or assumptions we use to complete the purchase price allocation and
  estimate the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities. However, if
  actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may
  be exposed to losses or gains that could be material.


New Accounting Standards

In July 2006, the FASB issued FIN No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an Interpretation of FASB
Statement No. 109.

FIN No. 48 provides guidance regarding
the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure in the financial
statements of tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return,
including the decision whether to file or not to file in a particular
jurisdiction. FIN No. 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
2006. We will adopt FIN No. 48 beginning in the first quarter of fiscal
2008. The cumulative effect of applying the provisions of FIN No. 48 upon
initial adoption will be reported as an adjustment to retained earnings as of
the beginning of fiscal 2008. We are evaluating the impact, if any, the
adoption of FIN No. 48 will have on our operating income, net earnings or
retained earnings.

In May 2007,
the FASB issued FSP FIN No. 48-1,

Definition
of “Settlement” in FASB Interpretation No. 48

. FSP FIN No. 48-1 provides guidance on how a company
should determine whether a tax position is effectively settled for the purpose
of recognizing previously unrecognized tax benefits. FSP FIN No. 48-1
is effective upon initial adoption of FIN No. 48, which we will adopt in
the first quarter of fiscal 2008, as indicated above.

In September 2006,
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) issued Staff Accounting
Bulletin (“SAB”) No. 108,

Considering the Effects of
Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year
Financial Statements

, which provides interpretive guidance on the
consideration of the effects of prior-year misstatements in quantifying
current-year misstatements for the purpose of a materiality assessment. SAB No. 108
is effective for fiscal years ending after November 15, 2006. We adopted
SAB No. 108 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007. The cumulative effect of
initially applying the provisions of SAB No. 108 may be reported as a
cumulative adjustment to retained earnings at the beginning of the year of
adoption. The adoption of SAB No. 108 had no impact on our net earnings or
financial position.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157,

Fair Value Measurements

. SFAS No. 157 defines fair
value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted
accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS
No. 157 applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit
fair value measurements, the FASB having previously concluded in those
accounting pronouncements that fair value is the relevant measurement
attribute. Accordingly, SFAS No. 157 does not require any new fair value
measurements. SFAS No. 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
2007. We plan to adopt SFAS No. 157 beginning in the first quarter of
fiscal 2009. We are evaluating the impact, if any, the adoption of SFAS No. 157
will have on our operating income or net earnings.

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159,

The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and
Financial Liabilities

. SFAS No. 159 permits companies to choose
to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value.
The objective is to improve financial reporting by providing companies with the
opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring
related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex
hedge accounting provisions. SFAS No. 159 is effective for fiscal years
beginning after November 15, 2007. Companies are not allowed to adopt SFAS
No. 159 on a retrospective basis unless they choose early adoption. We
plan to adopt SFAS No. 159 at the beginning of fiscal 2009. We are evaluating
the impact, if any, the adoption of SFAS No. 159 will have on our
operating income or net earnings.

Outlook for Fiscal 2008

Our outlook for
fiscal 2008 is based on information presently available and contains certain
assumptions regarding future economic conditions. Differences in actual
economic conditions compared with our assumptions could have a material impact
on our fiscal 2008 results. Refer to Item 1A,

Risk Factors

,
of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional important factors
that could cause future results to differ materially from those contemplated by
the following forward-looking statements.

Looking forward
to fiscal 2008, we are projecting net earnings in a range of $3.10 to $3.25 per
diluted share, an average increase of 14%. We expect the earnings growth to be
driven primarily by an increase in revenue of approximately 9% and a reduction
in our SG&A rate, partially offset by a decrease in our gross profit rate.
Our effective income tax rate for fiscal 2008 is projected to be approximately
36%.

Specifically, we are forecasting revenue of $39.0 billion in fiscal
2008, compared with revenue of $35.9 billion in fiscal 2007. We expect the
opening of approximately 130 new stores will drive more than half of the
revenue growth. For the fiscal year, we are projecting an increase in
comparable store sales of 3% to 5%. Our fiscal 2008 reporting period will
include 52 weeks, whereas our fiscal 2007 reporting period included 53 weeks.


Our fiscal 2008
outlook assumes an improvement in our operating income rate of approximately
0.3% of revenue, compared with fiscal 2007. The improvement in our operating
income rate is expected to be driven by a reduction in our SG&A rate of
0.6% to 0.7% of revenue as we continue to improve efficiency and leverage
revenue growth. The improvement in our SG&A rate is expected is to be
partially offset by a decline in our gross profit rate of 0.3% to 0.4% of
revenue, driven primarily by a lower-margin revenue mix.

Consistent with management’s focus on long-term revenue and earnings
growth generation, we do not provide a specific forecast for quarterly earnings
per share. However, we anticipate that our expected operating income rate improvement
and annual earnings growth will be realized in the second half of the fiscal
year. Our guidance assumes a modest operating income rate decline and no
material improvement in net earnings for the first half of the fiscal year. This
outlook includes the impact of a continuation of the change in revenue mix, a
significant increase in new-store openings, higher spending on our services
business and call centers, and reduced leverage on expenses in the first half
of the fiscal year, which seasonally has lower revenue than the second half. We
expect greater benefits in the second half of the fiscal year from leveraging
our operating model across more stores and refining our store operating model
to improve employee productivity. Additionally, we expect gross profit rate pressure
due to the change in revenue mix to moderate in the second half of the fiscal
year, amid a more rational promotional environment.

Capital expenditures in fiscal 2008 are expected to be $800 million
to $850 million, excluding expenditures associated with acquiring Speakeasy and
any additional acquisitions. Of that total, we expect approximately $500
million will support our planned new-store openings and various store
enhancement projects, including the costs of adding Magnolia Home Theater rooms
to additional U.S. Best Buy stores. Specifically, the capital expenditures are
expected to support the opening of approximately 90 new U.S. Best Buy stores;
up to five Pacific Sales stores; three to five Canada Best Buy stores; seven to
nine Future Shop stores; 20 to 23 Five Star stores; and two to three China Best
Buy stores. We also anticipate opening test stores in Mexico and Turkey within
the next 12 to 18 months. In addition, we anticipate relocating approximately eight
U.S. Best Buy stores and approximately two Future Shop stores, and we expect to
remodel and enhance certain existing stores.

Capital
expenditures in fiscal 2008 also are expected to include approximately $230
million in technology investments intended, among other things, to improve our supply
chain and service delivery capabilities, as well as increase our operating
efficiencies.

During fiscal
2008, we plan to continue our quarterly cash dividend program. We will continue
to evaluate the amount of our quarterly dividend based on our strong cash and
short-term investments position at the end of fiscal 2007, and our cash flows
generated during fiscal 2008.

We also expect
to continue repurchasing our common stock during fiscal 2008 pursuant to the
$1.5 billion share repurchase program authorized by our Board in June 2006.
There is no stated expiration date governing the period over which we can make
our share repurchases.

We intend to update our annual earnings guidance if we are reasonably
confident that annual results are expected to change materially.

Subsequent Event

Effective May 1, 2007, we acquired Speakeasy
for $97 million in cash, including transaction costs, subject to certain
post-closing adjustments. In connection with this transaction, we also repaid
$6 million of Speakeasy’s debt. We acquired Speakeasy to strengthen our
technology portfolio for small business customers, delivered through Best Buy
For Business. The acquisition will be accounted for in the first quarter of
fiscal 2008 using the purchase method in accordance with SFAS No. 141,

Business Combinations

. Accordingly, the net assets will be
recorded at their estimated fair values, and operating results will be included
in our financial statements from the date of acquisition. The purchase price
will be allocated on a preliminary basis using information currently available.
Goodwill is projected to be approximately $75 million and is not expected to be
deductible for tax purposes. The allocation of the purchase price to the assets
and liabilities acquired will be finalized no later than the first quarter of
fiscal 2009, as we obtain more information regarding asset valuations,
liabilities assumed and revisions of preliminary estimates of fair values made
at the date of acquisition.


Item 7A.
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.

Our debt is not subject to material interest-rate volatility risk. The
rates on a substantial portion of our debt may be reset, but not more than one
percentage point higher than the current rates. If the rates on the debt were
to be reset one percentage point higher, our annual interest expense would
increase by approximately $4 million. We do not manage our debt interest-rate
volatility risk through the use of derivative instruments.

We have market risk arising from changes in foreign currency exchange
rates related to our International operations. A 10% adverse change in the
foreign currency exchange rate would not have a significant impact on our
results of operations or financial position. We do not manage our foreign
currency exchange rate risk through the use of derivative instruments.

Changes in the overall level of interest
rates affect interest income generated from our short-term and long-term
investments in debt securities. If overall interest rates were one percentage
point lower than current rates, our annual interest income would decline by
approximately $29 million based on our short-term and long-term investments as
of March 3, 2007. We do not manage our investment interest-rate volatility
risk through the use of derivative instruments.

Overall, there have been no material changes in our primary risk
exposures or management of market risks since the prior year. We do not expect
any material changes in our primary risk exposures or management of market
risks for the foreseeable future.


Item 8. Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data.

Management’s
Report on the Financial Statements

Our management
is responsible for the preparation, integrity and objectivity of the
accompanying consolidated financial statements and the related financial
information. The financial statements have been prepared in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and
necessarily include certain amounts that are based on estimates and informed
judgments. Our management also prepared the related financial information
included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and is responsible for
its accuracy and consistency with the financial statements.

The
consolidated financial statements have been audited by Deloitte &
Touche LLP for the years ended March 3, 2007, and February 25, 2006,
and by Ernst & Young LLP for the year ended February 26, 2005,
independent registered public accounting firms who conducted their audits in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States). The independent registered public accounting firms’
responsibility is to express an opinion as to the fairness with which such
financial statements present our financial position, results of operations and
cash flows in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States.

Management’s
Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate
internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Our internal control over financial
reporting is designed under the supervision of our principal executive officer
and principal financial officer, and effected by our Board of Directors,
management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States and include those policies and procedures that:

(1)

Pertain
to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly
reflect our transactions and the dispositions of our assets;

(2)

Provide
reasonable assurance that our transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States, and that our receipts and expenditures
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and
Board of Directors; and

(3)

Provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect
on our financial statements.

Because of its
inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent
or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be
effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial
statement preparation and presentation.

Under the supervision and with the
participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and
principal financial officer, we assessed the effectiveness of our internal
control over financial reporting as of March 3, 2007, using the criteria
set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission (“COSO”) in

Internal Control —
Integrated Framework.

Based on its assessment, management has
concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as
of March 3, 2007. During its assessment, management did not identify any
material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting.
Management has excluded from its assessment the internal control over financial
reporting at Pacific Sales Kitchen and Bath Centers, which was acquired on March 7,
2006, and whose financial statements reflect total assets and total revenues
constituting 3% and 1%, respectively, of the consolidated financial statement
amounts as of and for the year ended March 3, 2007. Management has also
excluded from its assessment the internal control over financial reporting at
Jiangsu Five Star Appliance Co., in which a 75% interest was acquired on June 8,
2006, and whose financial statements reflect total assets and total revenues
constituting 5% and 2%, respectively, of the consolidated financial statement
amounts as of and for the year ended March 3, 2007. Deloitte &
Touche LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited our
consolidated financial statements for the year ended March 3, 2007,
included in Item 8,

Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data,

of this Annual Report on Form 10-K,
has issued an unqualified attestation report on management’s assessment of
internal control over financial reporting.

Report of Independent Registered Public
Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of

Best Buy Co., Inc.

:

We have audited
the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Best Buy Co., Inc. and
subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of March 3, 2007 and February 25,
2006, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, changes in
shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years ended March 3,
2007 and February 25, 2006. Our audit also included the financial
statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a). These financial
statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the
Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits. The
financial statements of the Company for the year ended February 26, 2005,
were audited by other auditors whose report, dated May 5, 2005, expressed
an unqualified opinion on those statements.

We conducted
our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion,
such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of Best Buy Co., Inc. and subsidiaries as
of March 3, 2007 and February 25, 2006, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the years ended March 3, 2007
and February 25, 2006, in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, such financial
statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated
financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material
respects, the information set forth therein.

As discussed in
Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, effective February 27,
2005, Best Buy Co., Inc. and subsidiaries changed their method of
accounting for share-based payments to adopt Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 123(R)

Share-Based Payment.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of March 3, 2007,
based on the criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated
Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission and our report dated April 25, 2007, expressed an
unqualified opinion on management’s assessment of the effectiveness of the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting and an unqualified opinion
on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial
reporting.

Report of
Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board
of Directors and Shareholders of

Best Buy Co., Inc.

:

We have audited management’s assessment, included in the accompanying
Management’s Annual Report of Internal Control over Financial Reporting, that
Best Buy Co., Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) maintained effective
internal control over financial reporting as of March 3, 2007, based on
criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated
Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission. As described in Management’s Annual Report of Internal
Control Over Financial Reporting, Management has excluded from its assessment
the internal control over financial reporting at Pacific Sales Kitchen and Bath
Centers, which was acquired on March 7, 2006, and whose financial
statements reflect total assets and total revenues constituting 3% and 1%,
respectively, of the consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the
year ended March 3, 2007. Management has also excluded from its assessment
the internal control over financial reporting at Jiangsu Five Star Appliance
Co., in which a 75% interest was acquired on June 8, 2006, and whose
financial statements reflect total assets and total revenues constituting 5%
and 2%, respectively, of the consolidated financial statement amounts as of and
for the year ended March 3, 2007. The Company’s management is responsible
for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an
opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial
reporting based on our audit.

We conducted
our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective
internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control
over financial reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and
performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our
opinions.

A company’s
internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under
the supervision of, the company’s principal executive and principal financial
officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company’s
board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial
reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the
maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention
or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of the
inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including
the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls,
material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected
on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of
the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to
the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures
may deteriorate.

In our opinion,
management’s assessment that the Company maintained effective internal control
over financial reporting as of March 3, 2007, is fairly stated, in all
material respects, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control-Integrated
Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all
material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of March 3,
2007, based on the criteria established in

Internal
Control-Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We have also
audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements and
financial statement schedule as of and for the year ended March 3, 2007,
of the Company and our report dated April 25, 2007, expressed an
unqualified opinion on those financial statements and financial statement
schedule and included an explanatory paragraph relating to the Company’s change
effective February 27, 2005, in its method of accounting for share-based
payments.

Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies

Description of
Business

Best Buy Co., Inc. is a specialty retailer of consumer
electronics, home-office products, entertainment software, appliances and
related services, with fiscal 2007 revenue from continuing operations of $35.9
billion.

We operate two reportable segments: Domestic and International. The
Domestic segment is comprised of all U.S. store and online operations of Best
Buy, Geek Squad, Magnolia Audio Video and Pacific Sales Kitchen and Bath Centers, Inc.
(“Pacific Sales”). We acquired Pacific Sales on March 7, 2006. U.S. Best
Buy stores offer a wide variety of consumer electronics, home-office products,
entertainment software, appliances and related services through 822 stores at
the end of fiscal 2007. Geek Squad provides residential and commercial computer
repair, support and installation services in all U.S. Best Buy stores and at 12
stand-alone stores at the end of fiscal 2007. Magnolia Audio Video stores offer
high-end audio and video products and related services through 20 stores at the
end of fiscal 2007. Pacific Sales stores offer high-end home-improvement
products, appliances and related services through 14 stores at the end of
fiscal 2007.

The International segment is comprised of all Canada store and online operations,
including Best Buy, Future Shop and Geek Squad, as well as all China store and
online operations, including Best Buy, Geek Squad and Jiangsu Five Star
Appliance Co., Ltd. (“Five Star”). We acquired a 75% interest in Five Star on June 8,
2006. We opened our first China Best Buy store in Shanghai on December 28,
2006. The International segment offers products and services similar to those
offered by the Domestic segment. However, Canada Best Buy stores do not carry
appliances. Further, Five Star stores and our China Best Buy store do not carry
entertainment software. At the end of fiscal 2007, the International segment
operated 121 Future Shop stores and 47 Best Buy stores in Canada, and 135 Five
Star stores and one Best Buy store in China.

In support of
our retail store operations, we also maintain Web sites for each of our brands
(BestBuy.com, BestBuyCanada.ca, BestBuy.com.cn, Five-Star.cn, FutureShop.ca, GeekSquad.com,
GeekSquad.ca, MagnoliaAV.com and PacificSales.com).

In fiscal 2004, we sold our interest in Musicland Stores Corporation (“Musicland”).
The transaction resulted in the transfer of all of Musicland’s assets other
than a distribution center in Franklin, Indiana, and selected nonoperating
assets. In fiscal 2005, we reversed previously recorded valuation allowances on
deferred tax assets related to the disposition of our interest in Musicland and
recognized a tax benefit. As described in Note 2,

Discontinued Operations

, we have
classified Musicland’s financial results as discontinued operations for all
periods presented. These Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, except
where otherwise indicated, relate to continuing operations only.

Basis of Presentation

The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Best Buy Co., Inc.
and its subsidiaries. Investments in unconsolidated entities over which we
exercise significant influence but do not have control are accounted for using
the equity method. Our share of the net earnings or loss was not significant
for any period presented. We have eliminated all intercompany accounts and
transactions.

Effective June 8, 2006, we acquired a 75% interest in Five Star.
Consistent with China’s statutory requirements, Five Star’s fiscal year ends on
December 31. Therefore, we have elected to consolidate Five Star’s
financial results on a two-month lag. There were no significant intervening
events which would have materially affected our consolidated financial
statements had they been recorded during the fiscal year. See Note 3,

Acquisitions

, for further details regarding this
transaction.

Reclassifications

To maintain consistency and comparability, certain amounts from
previously reported consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to
conform to the current-year presentation:

·

We reclassified selected
balances from receivables to cash and cash equivalents in our February 25,
2006, consolidated balance sheet.

·

During the third quarter
of fiscal 2007, we made a one-time election to adopt the alternative transition
method described in Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Staff
Position (“FSP”) No. FAS 123(R)-3,

Transition
Election Related to


$ in millions, except per share amounts

Accounting for the Tax Effects of Share-Based Payment Awards.

This election resulted in the reclassification of excess tax benefits from
operating activities to financing activities, as presented in the statement of
cash flows. See

Stock-Based Compensation

below,
for further details.

These
reclassifications had no effect on previously reported operating income, net
earnings or shareholders’ equity.

Change in Accounting
Principle

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, we elected to change our accounting
principle to recognize the purchase and sale of investments in marketable debt
and equity securities on the trade date. Prior to the fourth quarter of fiscal
2007, we recognized these transactions in our consolidated financial statements
on the settlement date. We concluded that use of the trade date was preferable
to the settlement date as trade date reflects the risks and rewards of
investment ownership on a more timely basis. In addition, this method more
closely aligns with the standard methodology utilized by our new investment
custodian to account for investment transactions. In accordance with Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 154,

Accounting Changes and Error Corrections,

this change in accounting principle has been applied retrospectively to our
consolidated financial statements for all prior periods. This change in
accounting principle had no effect on previously reported operating income, net
earnings, shareholders’ equity or cash flows. The effect on the consolidated
balance sheets for each applicable quarter was as follows in fiscal 2007 and
2006 (unaudited):

This change in accounting principle had no effect on any quarter of
fiscal 2007 or 2006 other than those in the table above.

Use of Estimates in the Preparation of
Financial Statements

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) requires us to make
estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported
amounts in the consolidated balance sheets and statements of earnings, as well
as the disclosure of contingent liabilities. Future results could be materially
affected if actual results differ from these estimates and assumptions.

Fiscal Year

Our fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest the end of February.
Fiscal 2007 included 53 weeks and fiscal 2006 and 2005 each included 52 weeks.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash primarily
consists of cash on hand and bank deposits. Cash equivalents primarily consist
of money market accounts and other highly liquid investments with an original
maturity of three months or less when purchased. We carry these investments at
cost, which approximates market value. The amounts of cash equivalents at March 3,
2007, and February 25, 2006, were $695 and $350, respectively, and the
weighted-average interest rates were 4.8% and 3.3%, respectively.

Outstanding checks in excess of funds on deposit (“book overdrafts”)
totaled $183 and $230 at March 3, 2007, and February 25, 2006,
respectively, and are reflected as current liabilities in our consolidated
balance sheets.

Merchandise Inventories

Merchandise
inventories are recorded at the lower of average cost or market. In-bound
freight-related costs from our vendors are included as part of the net
cost of merchandise inventories. Also included in the cost of inventory are
certain vendor allowances that are not a reimbursement of specific, incremental
and identifiable costs to promote a vendor’s products. Other costs associated
with acquiring, storing and transporting


$ in millions, except per share amounts

merchandise
inventories to our retail stores are expensed as incurred and included in cost
of goods sold.

Our inventory
loss reserve represents anticipated physical inventory losses (e.g., theft)
that have occurred since the last physical inventory date. Independent physical
inventory counts are taken on a regular basis to ensure that the inventory
reported in our consolidated financial statements

is properly stated. During the interim period between physical inventory
counts, we reserve for anticipated

physical inventory losses on a
location-by-location basis.

Our markdown reserve represents the excess of the carrying

value, typically average cost, over the amount we
expect to realize from the ultimate sale or other disposal of the inventory.

Markdowns establish a new cost basis for our inventory. Subsequent changes in
facts or circumstances do not result in the reversal of previously recorded
markdowns or an increase in that newly established cost basis.

Restricted Assets

Restricted cash and investments in debt securities totaled $382 and
$178, at March 3, 2007, and February 25, 2006, respectively, and are
included in other current assets. Such balances are pledged as collateral or
restricted to use for vendor payables, general liability insurance, workers’
compensation insurance and warranty programs. The increase in restricted cash
and investments in debt securities compared with February 25, 2006, was
due primarily to restricted cash assumed in connection with the acquisition of
Five Star. Five Star’s restricted cash represents bank deposits pledged as
security for certain vendor payables.

Property and Equipment

Property and
equipment are recorded at cost. We compute depreciation using the straight-line
method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Leasehold improvements
are depreciated over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the period
from the date the assets are placed in service to the end of the initial lease
term. Leasehold improvements made significantly after the initial lease term
are depreciated over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the
remaining lease term, including renewal periods, if reasonably assured.
Accelerated depreciation methods are generally used for income tax purposes.

When property
is fully depreciated, retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost and
accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain
or loss is reflected in the consolidated statement of earnings.

Repairs and
maintenance costs are charged directly to expense as incurred. Major renewals
or replacements that substantially extend the useful life of an asset are
capitalized and depreciated.

Costs
associated with the acquisition or development of software for internal use are
capitalized and amortized over the expected useful life of the software, from
three to seven years. A subsequent addition, modification or upgrade to
internal-use software is capitalized only to the extent that it enables the
software to perform a task it previously did not perform. Capitalized software
is included in fixtures and equipment. Software maintenance and training costs
are expensed in the period incurred.

Property under
capital lease is comprised of buildings and equipment used in our retail operations
and corporate support functions. The related depreciation for capital lease
assets is included in depreciation expense. Accumulated depreciation for
property under capital lease was $6 and $5 at March 3, 2007, and February 25,
2006, respectively.

Estimated useful lives by major asset
category are as follows:

Asset

Life

(in years)

Buildings

30–40

Leasehold improvements

3–25

Fixtures and equipment

3–20

Property under capital lease

3–20

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, we removed from our fixed
asset balances $621 of fully depreciated assets that were no longer in service.
This asset adjustment was based primarily on an analysis of our fixed asset
records and certain other validation procedures and had no net impact to our
fiscal 2007 consolidated balance sheet, statement of earnings or statement of
cash flows.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Costs
Associated With Exit Activities

We account for
the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets in accordance with SFAS No. 144,

Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of
Long-Lived Assets

, which requires long-lived assets, such as property
and equipment, to be evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in


$ in millions, except per share amounts

circumstances
indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. Factors
considered important that could result in an impairment review include, but are
not limited to, significant underperformance relative to historical or planned
operating results, significant changes in the manner of use of the assets or
significant changes in our business strategies. An impairment loss is
recognized when the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to result from
the use of the asset plus net proceeds expected from disposition of the asset
(if any) are less than the carrying value of the asset. When an impairment loss
is recognized, the carrying amount of the asset is reduced to its estimated
fair value based on quoted market prices or other valuation techniques.

The present
value of costs associated with location closings, primarily future lease costs
(net of expected sublease income), are charged to earnings when a location is vacated.

Pre-tax asset impairment charges recorded in
selling, general and administrative expenses (“SG&A”) by segment were as
follows in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005:

The impairment charges in fiscal 2007 and 2006 related to technology
and store assets that were taken out of service due to changes in our business.
The impairment charges in fiscal 2005 related to technology assets that were
taken out of service due to changes in our business and charges associated with
the disposal of corporate facilities that had been vacated.

Leases

We conduct the
majority of our retail and distribution operations from leased locations. The
leases require payment of real estate taxes, insurance and common area
maintenance, in addition to rent. The terms of our lease agreements generally
range from 10 to 20 years. Most of the leases contain renewal options and
escalation clauses, and certain store leases require contingent rents based on
factors such as specified percentages of revenue or the consumer price index.
Other leases contain covenants related to the maintenance of financial ratios.

For leases that
contain predetermined fixed escalations of the minimum rent, we recognize the
related rent expense on a straight-line basis from the date we take possession
of the property to the end of the initial lease term. We record any difference
between the straight-line rent amounts and amounts payable under the
leases as part of deferred rent, in accrued liabilities or long-term
liabilities, as appropriate.

Cash or lease
incentives (“tenant allowances”) received upon entering into certain store
leases are recognized on a straight-line basis as a reduction to rent from the
date we take possession of the property through the end of the initial lease
term. We record the unamortized portion of tenant allowances as a part of
deferred rent, in accrued liabilities or long-term liabilities, as appropriate.

At March 3,
2007, and February 25, 2006, deferred rent included in accrued liabilities
in our consolidated balance sheets was $18 and $16, respectively, and deferred
rent included in long-term liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets was
$237 and $211, respectively.

Prior to fiscal
2007, we capitalized straight-line rent amounts during the major construction
phase of leased properties. Beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2007, we
adopted on a prospective basis, FSP No. FAS 13-1,

Accounting for Rental Costs Incurred During a Construction Period.

FSP No. FAS 13-1 requires companies to expense rent payments for
building or ground leases incurred during the construction period. The adoption
of FSP No. FAS 13-1 did not have a significant effect on our
operating income or net earnings. Straight-line rent is expensed as incurred
subsequent to the major construction phase, including the period prior to the
store opening.

Transaction
costs associated with the sale and leaseback of properties and any related gain
or loss are recognized on a straight-line basis over the initial period of the
lease agreements. We do not have any retained or contingent interests in the
properties nor do we provide any guarantees in connection with the sale and
leaseback of properties, other than a corporate-level guarantee of lease
payments.

We also lease certain equipment under noncancelable operating and capital
leases. Assets acquired under capital leases are depreciated over the shorter
of the useful life of the asset or the lease term, including renewal periods,
if reasonably assured.


$ in millions, except per share amounts

Goodwill and Intangible Assets

Goodwill

Goodwill is the
excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets
acquired in business combinations accounted for under the purchase method. We
do not amortize goodwill but test it for impairment annually, or when
indications of potential impairment exist, utilizing a fair value approach at
the reporting unit level. A reporting unit is the operating segment, or a
business unit one level below that operating segment, for which discrete
financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by segment management.

Tradenames

We have an
indefinite-lived intangible asset related to our Pacific Sales tradename
which is included in the Domestic segment. We also have indefinite-lived
intangible assets related to our Future Shop and Five Star tradenames which are
included in the International segment.

We determine fair values utilizing widely accepted valuation
techniques, including discounted cash flows and market multiple analyses.
During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, we completed our annual impairment
testing of our goodwill and tradenames, using the valuation techniques as
described above, and determined there was no impairment.

The changes in the carrying amount of
goodwill and tradenames by segment for continuing operations were as follows in
fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005:

Adjustment
related to the resolution of certain tax matters associated with our
acquisition of Future Shop.

Lease Rights

Lease rights
represent costs incurred to acquire the lease of a specific commercial
property. Lease rights are recorded at cost and are amortized to rent expense
over the remaining lease term, including renewal periods, if reasonably
assured. Amortization periods range up to 16 years, beginning with the date we
take possession of the property.

The gross cost and accumulated amortization of lease rights were $32
and $13 at March 3, 2007; and $29 and $10 at February 25, 2006. Lease
rights amortization was $4, $3 and $4 in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005,
respectively. Current lease rights amortization is expected to be approximately
$3 for each of the next five fiscal years.

Investments

Short-term and
long-term investments are comprised of municipal and United States government
debt securities as well as auction-rate securities and variable rate-demand
notes. In accordance with SFAS No. 115,

Accounting
for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities

, and based on
our ability to market and sell these instruments, we classify auction-rate
securities, variable-rate demand notes and other investments in debt securities
as available-for-sale and carry them at amortized cost, which approximates fair
value. Auction-rate securities and variable-rate demand notes are similar to
short-term debt instruments because their interest rates are reset
periodically. Investments in these securities can be sold for cash on the
auction date. We classify auction-rate securities and variable-rate demand
notes as short-term or long-term investments based on the reset dates.


$ in millions, except per share amounts

In accordance with our investment policy, we
place our investments with issuers who have high-quality credit and limit the
amount of investment exposure to any one issuer. We seek to preserve principal
and minimize exposure to interest-rate fluctuations by limiting default risk,
market risk and reinvestment risk.

We also hold investments in marketable equity
securities and classify them as available-for-sale. Investments in marketable
equity securities are included in other assets in our consolidated balance
sheets. Investments in marketable equity securities are reported at fair value,
based on quoted market prices when available. All unrealized holding gains or
losses are reflected net of tax in accumulated other comprehensive income in
shareholders’ equity.

We review the
key characteristics of our debt and marketable equity securities portfolio and
their classification in accordance with GAAP on an annual basis, or when
indications of potential impairment exist. If a decline in the fair value of a
security is deemed by management to be other than temporary, the cost basis of
the investment is written down to fair value, and the amount of the write-down
is included in the determination of net earnings.

Insurance

We are self-insured for certain losses related to health, workers’
compensation and general liability claims, although we obtain third-party
insurance coverage to limit our exposure to these claims. A portion of these
self-insured losses is managed through a wholly-owned insurance captive. We
estimate our self-insured liabilities using a number of factors including
historical claims experience, an estimate of incurred but not reported claims,
demographic factors, severity factors and valuations provided by independent
third-party actuaries. Our self-insurance liabilities included in the
consolidated balance sheets were as follows:

Inventory Financing

We have
inventory financing facilities through which certain suppliers receive payments
from a designated finance company on invoices we owe them. Amounts due under
the facilities are collateralized by a security interest in certain merchandise
inventories. The amounts extended bear interest, if we exceed certain terms, at
rates specified in the agreements. We impute interest based on our borrowing
rate where there is an average balance outstanding. Imputed interest is not
significant. Certain agreements have provisions that entitle the lenders to a
portion of the cash discounts provided by the suppliers.

At March 3,
2007, and February 25, 2006, $39 and $59, respectively, were outstanding
and included in accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets; and
$196 and $177, respectively, were available for use under these inventory
financing facilities.

Borrowings and payments on our inventory financing facilities were
classified as financing activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows
in other, net.

Income Taxes

We account for
income taxes under the liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets
and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences
attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of
existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and operating
loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
measured using enacted income tax rates in effect for the year in which those
temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on
deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in income tax rates is
recognized in our consolidated statement of earnings in the period that
includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the
carrying amounts of deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that such
assets will not be realized.

In determining
our provision for income taxes, we use an annual effective income tax rate
based on annual income, permanent differences between book and tax income, and
statutory income tax rates. The effective income tax rate also reflects our
assessment of the ultimate outcome of tax audits. We adjust our annual
effective income tax rate as additional information on outcomes or events becomes
available. Discrete events such as audit settlements or changes in tax laws are
recognized in the period in which they occur.

Our income tax
returns, like those of most companies, are periodically audited by domestic and
foreign tax authorities. These audits include questions regarding our tax
filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions


$ in millions, except per share amounts

and the
allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. At any one time, multiple
tax years are subject to audit by the various tax authorities. In evaluating
the exposures associated with our various tax filing positions, we record
reserves for probable exposures. A number of years may elapse before a
particular matter, for which we have established a reserve, is audited and
fully resolved or clarified. We adjust our tax contingencies reserve and income
tax provision in the period in which actual results of a settlement with tax
authorities differs from our established reserve, the statute of limitations
expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position or when
more information becomes available. We include our tax contingencies reserve,
including accrued penalties and interest, in accrued income taxes on our
consolidated balance sheets and in income tax expense in our consolidated
statements of earnings.

In July 2006, the FASB issued FASB
Interpretation (“FIN”) No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an Interpretation of FASB
Statement No. 109

. In May 2007, the FASB issued FSP FIN No. 48-1,

Definition of “Settlement” in FASB
Interpretation No.48

. We will adopt FIN No. 48 and FSP FIN No. 48-1
beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2008. See

New
Accounting Standards

below for further details.

Long-Term Liabilities

The major components of long-term liabilities at March 3, 2007,
and February 25, 2006, included long-term rent-related liabilities,
deferred compensation plan liabilities, self-insurance reserves and advances
received under vendor alliance programs.

Foreign Currency

Foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities are translated into
U.S. dollars using the exchange rates in effect at our consolidated balance
sheet date. Results of operations and cash flows are translated using the
average exchange rates throughout the period. The effect of exchange rate
fluctuations on translation of assets and liabilities is included as a
component of shareholders’ equity in accumulated other comprehensive income.
Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions, which are included in
SG&A, have not been significant.

Revenue Recognition

We recognize
revenue when the sales price is fixed or determinable, collectibility is
reasonably assured and the customer takes possession of the merchandise, or in
the case of services, at the time the service is provided.

Amounts billed to customers for shipping and
handling are included in revenue. Revenue is

reported net of estimated
sales returns and excludes sales taxes.

We estimate our
sales returns reserve based on historical return rates. We initially
established our sales returns reserve in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005. Our
sales returns reserve was $104 and $78, at March 3, 2007, and February 25,
2006, respectively.

We sell
extended service contracts on behalf of an unrelated third party. In
jurisdictions where we are not deemed to be the obligor on the contract,
commissions are recognized in revenue at the time of sale. In jurisdictions
where we are deemed to be the obligor on the contract, commissions are
recognized in revenue ratably over the term of the service contract.
Commissions represented 2.2%, 2.5% and 2.6% of revenues in fiscal 2007, 2006
and 2005, respectively.

For revenue transactions that involve multiple deliverables, we defer
the revenue associated with any undelivered elements. The amount of revenue
deferred in connection with the undelivered elements is determined using the
relative fair value of each element, which is generally based on each element’s
relative retail price. See additional information regarding our customer
loyalty program in

Sales Incentives

below.

Gift Cards

We sell gift
cards to our customers in our retail stores, through our Web sites, and through
selected third parties. We do not charge administrative fees on unused gift
cards and our gift cards do not have an expiration date. We recognize income
from gift cards when: (i) the gift card is redeemed by the customer; or (ii) the
likelihood of the gift card being redeemed by the customer is remote (“gift
card breakage”) and we determine that we do not have a legal obligation to
remit the value of unredeemed gift cards to the relevant jurisdictions. We
determine our gift card breakage rate based upon historical redemption
patterns. Based on our historical information, the likelihood of a gift card
remaining unredeemed can be determined 24 months after the gift card is issued.
At that time, we recognize


$ in millions, except per share amounts

breakage income
for those cards for which the likelihood of redemption is deemed remote and we
do not have a legal obligation to remit the value of such unredeemed gift cards
to the relevant jurisdictions. Gift card breakage income is included in revenue
in our consolidated statements of earnings.

We began recognizing gift card breakage
income during the third quarter of fiscal 2006. Gift card breakage income was
as follows in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005:

Due
to the resolution of certain legal matters associated with gift card
liabilities, we recognized $19 and $27 of gift card breakage income in fiscal
2007 and 2006, respectively, that related to prior fiscal years.

Sales Incentives

We frequently
offer sales incentives that entitle our customers to receive a reduction in the
price of a product or service. Sales incentives include discounts, coupons and
other offers that entitle a customer to receive a reduction in the price of a
product or service by submitting a claim for a refund or rebate. For sales
incentives issued to a customer in conjunction with a sale of merchandise or
services, for which we are the obligor, the reduction in revenue is recognized
at the time of sale, based on the retail value of the incentive expected to be
redeemed.

Customer Loyalty Program

We have a
customer loyalty program which allows members to earn points for each qualifying
purchase. Points earned enable members to receive a certificate that may be
redeemed on future purchases at U.S. Best Buy stores. There are two ways that
members may participate and earn loyalty points.

First, we have
a customer loyalty card where members earn points for each purchase completed
at U.S. Best Buy stores or through our BestBuy.com Web site. We account for our
customer loyalty program in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”)
Issue No. 00-22,

Accounting for “Points”
and Certain Other Time-Based or Volume-Based Sales Incentive Offers, and
Offers for Free Products or Services to Be Delivered in the Future

.
The retail value of points earned by our customer loyalty members is included
in accrued liabilities and recorded as a reduction of revenue at the time the
points are earned, based on the percentage of points that are projected to be
redeemed. Prior to October 2006, we charged a loyalty program membership
fee which was initially deferred and then recognized in revenue ratably over
the membership period. Beginning in October 2006, we no longer charge a
membership fee for our customer loyalty program.

Second, we have
a co-branded credit card agreement with a third-party bank (the “Bank”) for the
issuance of a customer loyalty credit card bearing the Best Buy brand.
Cardholders earn points for qualifying purchases, including purchases made at
Best Buy. Points earned enable cardholders to receive certificates that may be
redeemed on future purchases at U.S. Best Buy stores. The Bank is the sole
owner of the accounts issued under the program and absorbs losses associated
with non-payment by the cardholders and fraudulent usage of the accounts. We
are responsible for redeeming the points earned by the cardholders. The Bank
pays fees to us based on the number of credit card accounts activated and card
usage, and reimburses us for certain costs associated with the program. In
accordance with EITF No. 00-21

, Revenue Arrangements
with Multiple Deliverables

, we defer revenue received from
cardholder account activations and recognize revenue on a straight-line basis
over the remaining term of the agreement. Card usage fees are recognized in
revenue as actual credit card usage occurs.

Vendor Allowances

We receive
vendor allowances for various programs, primarily volume incentives and
reimbursements for specific costs such as markdowns, margin protection,
advertising and sales incentives. Vendor allowances provided as reimbursement
of specific, incremental and identifiable costs incurred to promote a vendor’s
products are included as an expense reduction when the cost is incurred. All
other vendor allowances, including vendor allowances received in excess of our
cost to promote a vendor’s product, are initially deferred and recorded as a reduction
of merchandise inventories. The deferred amounts are then included as a
reduction of cost of goods sold when the related product is sold.

Vendor allowances included in revenue for reimbursement of
vendor-provided sales incentives and in SG&A for reimbursement of specific,
incremental and identifiable SG&A costs to promote a vendor’s products were
as follows in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005:

Advertising
Costs

Advertising costs, which are included in SG&A, are expensed the
first time the advertisement runs. Advertising costs consist primarily of print
and television advertisements as well as promotional events. Net advertising
expenses were $692, $644 and $597 in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
Allowances received from vendors for advertising of $140, $123 and $115, in
fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, were classified as reductions of
advertising expenses.

Pre-Opening Costs

Non-capital expenditures associated with opening new stores are
expensed as incurred.

Stock-Based Compensation

SFAS No. 123(R)

At the beginning of fiscal 2006, we early-adopted the fair value
recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004),

Share-Based Payment

(123(R)), requiring us to recognize
expense related to the fair value of our stock-


$ in millions, except per share amounts

based compensation awards. We elected the modified prospective
transition method as permitted by SFAS No. 123(R). Under this transition
method, stock-based compensation expense in fiscal 2007 and 2006 includes: (i) compensation
expense for all stock-based compensation awards granted prior to, but not yet
vested as of February 26, 2005, based on the grant date fair value
estimated in accordance with the original provisions of SFAS No. 123,

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation

; and (ii) compensation
expense for all stock-based compensation awards granted subsequent to February 26,
2005, based on the grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with the
provisions of SFAS No. 123(R). We recognize compensation expense on a
straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award (or to an
employee’s eligible retirement date, if earlier). Total stock-based
compensation expense included in our consolidated statement of earnings in
fiscal 2007 and 2006 was $121 ($82, net of tax) and $132 ($87, net of tax),
respectively. In accordance with the modified prospective transition method of
SFAS No. 123(R), financial results for prior periods have not been
restated.

APB Opinion No. 25

Prior to fiscal 2006, we applied Accounting Principles Board (“APB”)
Opinion No. 25,

Accounting for Stock
Issued to Employees

, and related Interpretations in accounting for
stock-based compensation awards. Prior to fiscal 2006, no stock-based
compensation expense was recognized in our consolidated statements of earnings
for non-qualified stock options (“stock options”), as the exercise price was
equal to the market price of our stock on the date of grant. In addition, we
did not recognize any stock-based compensation expense for our employee stock purchase
plan (“ESPP”), as it was intended to be a plan that qualifies under Section 423
of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. However, we did recognize
stock-based compensation expense for share awards.

We recognized compensation expense for time-based share awards on a
straight-line basis over the vesting period (or to an employee’s eligible
retirement date, if earlier) based on the fair value of the award on the grant
date. We recognized compensation expense for market-based share awards based
on the current stock price, the number of shares expected to ultimately vest
and the vesting period. Outside valuation advisors assisted us in determining
the number of shares ultimately expected to vest. We recognized compensation
expense for performance-based awards on a straight-line basis over the
requisite service period (or to an employee’s eligible retirement date, if
earlier) based on management’s estimate of the likelihood of achieving company
or personal performance goals. If an award recipient’s relationship with us is
terminated, all shares still subject to restrictions are forfeited and returned
to the plan.

Stock-based
compensation income recognized in fiscal 2005 on a pre-tax basis was $1. The
fiscal 2005 income reflects a change in vesting assumptions based on our total
shareholder return relative to the performance of the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index (“S&P 500”) and an increase in our expected forfeiture
rate.

Transition

In
November 2005, the FASB issued FSP No. FAS 123(R)-3,

Transition Election Related to Accounting for Tax
Effects of Share-Based Payment Awards.

During the third quarter of
fiscal 2007, we elected to adopt the alternative transition method provided in
FSP No. FAS 123(R)-3 to calculate the tax effects of stock-based
compensation. The alternative transition method includes simplified methods to
determine the beginning balance of the additional paid-in capital (“APIC”) pool
related to the tax effects of stock-based compensation, and to determine the
subsequent impact on the APIC pool and the statement of cash flows of the tax
effects of stock-based awards that were fully vested and outstanding upon the
adoption of SFAS No. 123(R).

In accordance with SFAS No. 154

,

Accounting Changes and Error Corrections

,
this change in accounting principle has been applied retrospectively to our
fiscal 2006 consolidated statement of cash flows. The effect on the
consolidated statement of cash flows was a decrease in operating activities
with an offsetting increase in financing

activities of $22 in
fiscal 2006. The adoption of FSP No. FAS 123(R)-3 did not have an
impact on our operating income, net earnings or shareholders’ equity.

In the fourth
quarter of fiscal 2005, we increased our expected participant stock option
forfeiture rate as a result of transferring to a third-party provider
certain corporate employees, and the departure of certain senior executives.
This higher level of expected stock option forfeitures reduced our fiscal 2005
pro forma stock-based compensation expense. Fiscal 2005 pro forma stock-based
compensation expense may not be indicative of future stock-based
compensation expense.

The weighted-average fair value of stock
options granted during fiscal 2005 used in computing pro forma compensation
expense was $14.18 per share. The fair value of each stock option was estimated
on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model
with the following assumptions in fiscal 2005:

Risk-free interest rate

3.4%

Expected dividend yield

historical data and observable market prices of similar equity instruments.

We estimated the
expected life of stock options based upon historical experience.

New Accounting Standards

In July 2006,
the FASB issued FIN No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty
in Income Taxes, an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109.

FIN
No. 48 provides guidance regarding the recognition, measurement,
presentation and disclosure in the financial statements of tax positions taken
or expected to be taken on a tax return, including the decision whether to file
or not to file in a particular jurisdiction. FIN No. 48 is effective for
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. We will adopt FIN No. 48
beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2008. The cumulative effect of
applying the provisions of FIN No. 48 upon initial adoption will be
reported as an adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of fiscal
2008. We are evaluating the impact, if any, the adoption of FIN No. 48
will have on our operating income, net earnings or retained earnings.

In May 2007,
the FASB issued FSP FIN No. 48-1,

Definition
of “Settlement” in FASB Interpretation No. 48

. FSP FIN No. 48-1 provides guidance on how a company
should determine whether a tax position is effectively settled for the purpose
of recognizing previously unrecognized tax benefits. FSP FIN No. 48-1
is effective upon initial adoption of FIN No. 48, which we will adopt in
the first quarter of fiscal 2008, as indicated above.

In September 2006,
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) issued Staff Accounting
Bulletin (“SAB”) No. 108,

Considering the Effects of
Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year
Financial Statements

, which provides interpretive guidance on the
consideration of the effects of prior-year misstatements in quantifying
current-year misstatements for the purpose of a materiality assessment. SAB No. 108
is effective for fiscal years ending after November 15, 2006.


$ in millions, except per share amounts

We adopted SAB No. 108
in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007. The cumulative effect of initially
applying the provisions of SAB No. 108, may be reported as a cumulative
adjustment to retained earnings at the beginning of the year of adoption. The
adoption of SAB No. 108 had no impact on our net earnings or financial
position.

In September 2006,
the FASB issued SFAS No. 157,

Fair Value Measurements

.
SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring
fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures
about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 applies under other accounting
pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements, the FASB having
previously concluded in those accounting pronouncements that fair value is the
relevant measurement attribute. Accordingly, SFAS No. 157 does not require
any new fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 is effective for fiscal
years beginning after December 15, 2007. We plan to adopt SFAS No. 157
beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2009. We are evaluating the impact, if
any, the adoption of SFAS No. 157 will have on our operating income or net
earnings.

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159,

The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and
Financial Liabilities

. SFAS No. 159 permits companies to choose
to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value.
The objective is to improve financial reporting by providing companies with the
opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring
related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex
hedge accounting provisions. SFAS No. 159 is effective for fiscal years
beginning after November 15, 2007. Companies are not allowed to adopt SFAS
No. 159 on a retrospective basis unless they choose early adoption. We
plan to adopt SFAS No. 159 at the beginning of fiscal 2009. We are
evaluating the impact, if any, the adoption of SFAS No. 159 will have on
our operating income or net earnings.

Discontinued
Operations

In fiscal 2004,
we sold our interest in Musicland. The buyer assumed all of Musicland’s
liabilities, including approximately $500 in lease obligations and paid no cash
consideration, in exchange for all of the capital stock of Musicland. The
transaction also resulted in the transfer

of
all of Musicland’s assets, other than a distribution center in Franklin,
Indiana, and selected nonoperating assets.

On March 25, 2005, we received notification from the Internal
Revenue Service (“IRS”) of a favorable resolution of outstanding tax matters
regarding the disposition of our interest in Musicland. Based on the agreement
with the IRS, we reversed previously recorded valuation allowances on deferred
tax assets related to the disposition of our interest in Musicland and
recognized a $50 tax benefit in fiscal 2005.

In accordance with SFAS No. 144, Musicland’s financial results are
reported separately as discontinued operations for all periods presented. No
assets or liabilities of Musicland were included in our consolidated balance
sheets at March 3, 2007, or February 25, 2006.

3.   Acquisitions

Pacific Sales Kitchen and Bath Centers, Inc.

On March 7,
2006, we acquired all of the common stock of Pacific Sales for $411, or $408,
net of cash acquired, including transaction costs. We acquired Pacific Sales, a
high-end home-improvement and appliance retailer, to enhance our ability to
grow with an affluent customer base and premium brands using a proven and
successful showroom format. Utilizing the existing store format, we expect to
expand the number of stores in order to capitalize on the expanding high-end
segment of the U.S. appliance market. The acquisition was accounted for using
the purchase method in accordance with SFAS No. 141,

Business
Combinations

. Accordingly, we recorded the net assets at their
estimated fair values, and included operating results in our Domestic segment
from the date of acquisition. We allocated the purchase price on a preliminary
basis using information then available. The allocation of the purchase price to
the assets and liabilities acquired was finalized in the fourth quarter of
fiscal 2007. There were no significant adjustments to the preliminary purchase
price allocation. All goodwill is deductible for tax purposes.

Jiangsu Five
Star Appliance Co., Ltd.

On June 8, 2006, we acquired a 75%
interest in Five Star for $184, including a working capital injection of $122
and transaction costs. Five Star is an appliance and consumer electronics
retailer with 135 stores located in seven of China’s 34 provinces. We made the
investment in Five Star to further our international growth plans, to increase
our knowledge of Chinese customers and to obtain an immediate retail presence
in China. The acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method in
accordance with SFAS No. 141,

Business Combinations

.
Accordingly, we recorded the net assets at their estimated fair values, and
included operating results in our International segment from the date of
acquisition. We allocated the purchase price on a preliminary basis using
information currently available. The allocation of the purchase price to the
assets and liabilities acquired will be finalized no later than the second
quarter of fiscal 2008, as we obtain more information regarding asset valuations,
liabilities assumed and revisions of preliminary estimates of fair values made
at the date of purchase. None of the goodwill is deductible for tax purposes.

and the highly liquid nature of these investments. Therefore, there were no
significant realized or unrealized gains or losses.

Marketable Equity Securities

The carrying
values of our investments in marketable equity securities at March 3,
2007, and February 25, 2006, were $4 and $28, respectively. Net unrealized

At February 25, 2006, our investments
included 1,276,001 shares of Golf Galaxy, Inc. (“Golf Galaxy”) common
stock with a carrying value of $24. On February 13, 2007, Golf Galaxy
completed a merger with Dick’s Sporting Goods, Inc. Under the terms of the
merger agreement, each outstanding share of Golf Galaxy common stock was
converted into the right to receive $18.82 per share in cash, without interest.
In connection with the merger, we sold our 1,276,001 shares of Golf Galaxy
common stock and recognized a $20 gain on the sale in fiscal 2007, which was
included in gain on investments in our consolidated statement of earnings.

Since holders of our debentures due in 2022 could
have required us to purchase all or a portion of their debentures on January 15,
2007, we classified our debentures in the current portion of long-term debt at February 25,
2006. However, no holders of our debentures exercised this put option on January 15,
2007. The next time the holders of our debentures could require us to purchase
all or a portion of their debentures is January 15, 2012. Therefore, we
classified our debentures as long-term debt at March 3, 2007.

Certain debt is secured by property and equipment with a net book value
of $80 and $41 at March 3, 2007, and February 25, 2006, respectively.

Convertible Debentures

In January 2002, we sold
convertible subordinated debentures having an aggregate principal amount of
$402. The proceeds from the offering, net of $6 in offering expenses, were
$396. The debentures mature in 2022 and are callable at par, at our option, for
cash on or after January 15, 2007.

Holders may
require us to purchase all or a portion of their debentures on January 15,
2012, and January 15, 2017, at a purchase price equal to 100% of the
principal amount of the debentures plus accrued and unpaid interest up to but
not including the date of purchase. We have the option to settle the purchase
price in cash, stock, or a combination of cash and stock. On January 15,
2007, holders had the option to require us to purchase all or a portion of
their debentures, at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of
the debentures plus accrued and unpaid interest up to but not including the
date of purchase. However, no debentures were so purchased.

The debentures
become convertible into shares of our common stock at a conversion rate of
21.7391 shares per $0.001 principal amount of debentures, equivalent to an
initial conversion price of $46.00 per share, if the closing price of our
common stock exceeds a specified price for 20 consecutive trading days in a 30-trading
day period preceding the date of conversion, if our credit rating falls below
specified levels, if the debentures are called for redemption or if certain
specified corporate transactions occur. During a portion of fiscal 2007, our
closing stock price exceeded the specified stock price for more than 20

trading days in a 30-day trading period.
Therefore, debenture holders had the option to convert their debentures into
shares of our

common stock. However, no debentures were so converted.
Due to changes in the price of our common stock, the debentures were no longer
convertible at March 3, 2007, and have not been convertible through May 1,
2007.

The debentures have an interest rate of 2.25% per annum. The interest
rate may be reset, but not below 2.25% or above 3.25%, on July 15, 2011,
and July 15, 2016. One of our subsidiaries has guaranteed the convertible
debentures.

Credit Facilities

Our Domestic
segment has a $200 bank revolving credit facility which is guaranteed by
certain of our subsidiaries. The facility expires on December 22, 2009.
Borrowings under this facility are unsecured and bear interest at rates
specified in the credit agreement. We also pay certain facility and agent fees.
The agreement contains covenants that require us to maintain certain financial
ratios. We were in compliance with all such covenants at March 3, 2007, and
February 25, 2006. There were no borrowings outstanding under this facility for
any period presented. However, amounts outstanding under letters of credit
reduce amounts available under this facility. At March 3, 2007, and February 25,
2006, $200 and $199, respectively, were available under this facility.

Our
International segment has a $21 revolving demand facility for our Canada
operations, of which $17 is available from February through July and
$21 is available from August through January of each year. There is
no set expiration date for this facility. There were no borrowings outstanding
under this facility at March 3, 2007, and February 25, 2006.
Outstanding letters of credit and letters of guarantee reduced the amount available
under this facility to $16 and $17 at March 3, 2007, and February 25,
2006, respectively. All borrowings under this facility are made available at
the sole discretion of the lender and are payable on demand. Borrowings under
this facility are unsecured and bear interest at rates specified in the
agreement. The agreement for this facility contains certain reporting and
operating covenants. We were in compliance with all such covenants at March 3,
2007, and February 25, 2006.

Our International segment also has a $23 revolving demand facility to
finance working capital requirements for our China operations. This facility
may be terminated at any time and is subject to review by June 30, 2007. At
the balance sheet date, there were $20 in borrowings outstanding under this
facility. Borrowings under this facility are secured by a guarantee of Best Buy
Co., Inc. and bear interest at rates specified in the agreement. The
agreement for this facility contains certain reporting and operating covenants.
We were in compliance with all such covenants at the balance sheet date.

Shareholders’
Equity

Stock Compensation Plans

Our 2004
Omnibus Stock and Incentive Plan (“Omnibus Plan”) authorizes us to grant or
issue non-qualified stock options (“stock options”), incentive stock options, share
awards and other equity awards up to a total of 24 million shares. At
March 3, 2007, we have not granted incentive stock options. Under the
terms of the Omnibus Plan, awards may be granted to our employees, officers,
advisors, consultants and directors. Awards issued under the Omnibus Plan vest
as determined by the Compensation and Human Resources Committee of our Board at
the time of grant. At March 3, 2007, a total of 7.9 million shares were
available for future grants under the Omnibus Plan. Our Board amended the
Omnibus Plan, subject to shareholder approval at the Regular Meeting of
Shareholders scheduled for June 27, 2007, to increase the number of shares
subject to the plan to 38 million shares.

Upon adoption
and approval of the Omnibus Plan, all of our previous stock compensation plans
were terminated. However, existing awards under those plans will continue to
vest in accordance with the original vesting schedule and will expire at the
end of their original term.

Our outstanding
stock options have a 10-year term. Outstanding stock options issued to
employees generally vest over a four-year period, and outstanding stock options
issued to directors vest immediately upon grant. Share awards vest based either
upon attainment of established goals or upon continued employment (“time-based”).
Outstanding share awards that are not time-based vest at the end of a
three-year incentive period based either upon our total shareholder return (“TSR”)
compared with the TSR of companies that comprise the S&P 500 or growth in
our common stock price (“market-based”), or upon the achievement of company or
personal performance goals (“performance-based”). Time-based share awards vest
over a period of at least three years, during which no more than 25% may vest
at the time of the award, and no more than 25% may vest on each anniversary
date thereafter. Stock-based compensation expense associated with our
time-based share awards was not significant for any period presented.

Our ESPP permits employees to purchase stock at 85% of the market price
of our common stock at the beginning or at the end of the semi-annual purchase
period, whichever is less.

aggregate intrinsic value of our stock options (the amount by which the market
price of the stock on the date of exercise exceeded the exercise price of the
option) exercised during fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, was $160, $197 and $156,
respectively. At March 3, 2007, there was $154 of unrecognized

The actual income tax benefit
realized from stock option exercises was $55, $53 and $59, in fiscal 2007, 2006
and 2005, respectively.

Prior to fiscal
2006, we used the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to estimate the fair value
of each stock option. For grants subsequent to our adoption of SFAS No. 123(R),
we estimate the fair value of each stock option using a lattice model. We
believe the lattice model more accurately estimates stock-based compensation
expense as it incorporates additional variables, including historical exercise
behavior.

The fair value of each stock option was estimated on the date of grant
using a lattice model in fiscal 2007 and 2006 and the Black-Scholes
option-pricing model in fiscal 2005, with the following assumptions:

Earnings per Share

Our basic earnings per share calculation is
computed based on the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding. Our
diluted earnings per share calculation is computed based on the
weighted-average number of common shares outstanding adjusted by the number of
additional shares that would have been outstanding had the potentially dilutive
common shares been issued. Potentially dilutive shares of common stock include
stock options, nonvested share awards and shares issuable under our ESPP, as
well as common shares that would have resulted from the assumed conversion of
our convertible debentures (see Note 5,

Debt

).
Since the potentially dilutive shares related to the convertible debentures are
included in the calculation, the related interest expense, net of tax, is added
back to earnings from continuing operations, as the interest would not have
been paid if the convertible debentures had been converted to common stock.
Nonvested market-based share awards and nonvested performance-based share awards
are included in the average diluted shares outstanding each period if
established market or performance criteria have been met at the end of the
respective periods.

At March 3, 2007, stock options to
purchase 28.4 million shares of common stock were outstanding as follows

The computation of dilutive shares outstanding excludes the
out-of-the-money stock options because such outstanding options’ exercise
prices were greater than the average market price of our common shares and,
therefore, the effect would be antidilutive (i.e., including such options would
result in higher earnings per share).

Repurchase of Common Stock

Our Board authorized a $1,500
share repurchase program in June 2006. The program terminated and replaced
a $1,500 share repurchase program authorized by the Board in April 2005.
The April 2005 share repurchase program terminated and replaced a $500
share repurchase program authorized by the Board in June 2004. There is no
expiration date governing the period over which we can make our share
repurchases under the June 2006 share repurchase program.

During fiscal 2007, we purchased and retired 5.6 million shares at a
cost of $267 under the June 2006 share repurchase program, and 6.2 million
shares at a cost of $332 under the April 2005 share repurchase
program. At March 3, 2007, $1,233 remains available for future purchases
under the June 2006 share repurchase program.

Comprehensive Income

Comprehensive
income is computed as net earnings plus certain other items that are recorded
directly to shareholders’ equity. In addition to net earnings, the significant
components of comprehensive income include foreign currency translation
adjustments and unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, on available-for-sale
marketable equity securities. Foreign currency translation adjustments do not
include a provision for income tax expense when earnings from foreign
operations are considered to be indefinitely reinvested outside the United
States.

Comprehensive income was $1,332,
$1,252 and $1,047 in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

During fiscal 2006, we entered into a capital lease agreement totaling
$16 for a distribution center. During fiscal 2005, we entered into a capital
lease agreement totaling $10 for a corporate facility. These leases were
noncash transactions and have been eliminated from our consolidated statements
of cash flows.

Fiscal 2005 Lease Accounting Correction

We conducted an
extensive review of our lease accounting practices during the fourth quarter of
fiscal 2005 in light of the views expressed by the SEC in its letter dated February 7,
2005, to the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Center for
Public Company Audit Firms. In the letter, the SEC expressed its views
regarding operating lease accounting matters and the related interpretation/application
of these matters under existing GAAP.

Following our
review, we recorded a cumulative fourth-quarter charge of $36 pre-tax
($23 net of tax) to correct our accounting for certain operating lease matters.
Of the $36 pre-tax charge, $15 was recorded as a charge to SG&A, while the
remaining $21 was recorded as a charge to interest expense. We determined that
no restatement was required due to the immaterial impact of the errors on
fiscal 2005 and prior periods.

The $15 charge
to SG&A was primarily related to rent holidays. Rent holidays are
considered to be any period during which a tenant has the right to control use
of the leased property, but rent payments are not required.

Historically,
we recognized rent expense beginning at the inception of the contractual lease
term, which was generally when the store opened. Effective with the fourth
quarter of fiscal 2005 and through fiscal 2006, we recognized rent expense
beginning when we took possession of the property unless we were actively constructing
the facility, in which case straight-line rent amounts were capitalized.
As discussed in Note 1,

Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies — Leases

, beginning in the first quarter of
fiscal 2007, we adopted on a prospective basis FSP No. FAS 13-1,

Accounting for Rental Costs Incurred During a Construction Period

,
which requires companies to expense rent payments for building and ground lease
obligations incurred during the construction period.

The $21 charge
to interest expense was related to the change in accounting for certain leases
as financing leases rather than operating leases, as these lease transactions did
not qualify for sale-leaseback treatment in accordance with SFAS No. 98,

Accounting for Leases: Sale-Leaseback

Transactions

Involving Real Estate, Sales-Type Leases of
Real Estate, Definition of the Lease Term, and Initial Direct Costs of Direct
Financing Leases.

For financing leases, the gross cost of
constructing the asset is included in property and equipment and amounts reimbursed
from the landlord are recorded as financing obligations. In fiscal 2005, we
made a $107 adjustment to increase property and equipment, and financing
obligations. This adjustment was considered a noncash transaction and has been
excluded from the consolidated statements of cash flows. Financing obligations
are included in our consolidated balance sheets


$ in millions, except per share amounts

in current
portion of long-term debt and long-term debt, as appropriate.

These adjustments had no effect on our historical or future cash flows,
or the timing of our lease payments.

Benefit
Plans

We sponsor
retirement savings plans for employees meeting certain age and service
requirements. Participants may choose from various investment options including
our company stock. Participants can contribute up to 50% of their eligible
compensation annually as defined by the plan document, subject to IRS
limitations. Prior to January 2007, we matched up to 50% of the first 5%
of participating employees’ pre-tax earnings. Beginning in January 2007,
we changed the match to 100% of the first 3% of participating employees’
pre-tax earnings and 50% of the next 2% of participating employees’ pre-tax
earnings. Our matching contribution is subject to annual approval by the
Compensation and Human Resources Committee of the Board. The total matching
contributions, net of forfeitures, were $26, $19 and $14 in fiscal 2007, 2006
and 2005, respectively.

We have a non-qualified, unfunded deferred compensation plan for highly
compensated employees and our Board whose contributions are limited under
qualified defined contribution plans. Amounts contributed and deferred under
the deferred compensation plan are credited or charged with the performance of
investment options offered under the plan and elected by the participants. In
the event of bankruptcy, the assets of this plan are available to satisfy the
claims of general creditors. The liability for compensation deferred under this
plan was $75 and $74 at March 3, 2007, and February 25, 2006,
respectively, and is included in long-term liabilities. We manage the risk of
changes in the fair value of the liability for deferred compensation by
electing to match our liability under the plan with investment vehicles that
offset a substantial portion of our exposure. The cash value of the investment
vehicles, which includes funding for future deferrals, was $82 and $78 at March 3,
2007, and February 25, 2006, respectively, and is included in other
assets. Both the asset and the liability are carried at fair value.

our tax contingencies reserve based on the resolution and clarification of
certain federal and state income tax matters, including favorable rulings from
the IRS and certain state jurisdictions.

The IRS has
completed its audits through fiscal 2002. All tax years since the acquisition
of Future Shop in fiscal 2002 are still subject to audit with Revenue Canada.

Management believes that the realization of the deferred tax assets is
more likely than not, based upon the expectation that we will generate the
necessary taxable income in future periods and, accordingly, no valuation
reserves have been provided. At March 3, 2007, we had net operating loss carryforwards
from our International operations of $29, which expire beginning in fiscal 2010
and through fiscal 2027. We expect to fully utilize the net operating loss
carryforwards and, therefore, no valuation allowances have been recorded.

Contingencies
and Commitments

Contingencies

On December 8,
2005, a purported class action lawsuit captioned,

Jasmen Holloway, et al. v. Best Buy Co., Inc.

, was
filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California
alleging we discriminate against women and minority individuals on the basis of
gender, race, color and/or national origin with respect to our employment
policies and practices. The action seeks an end to discriminatory policies and
practices, an award of back and front pay, punitive damages and injunctive
relief, including rightful place relief for all class members. As of March 3,
2007, no accrual had been established as it was not possible to estimate the
possible loss or range of loss because this matter had not advanced to a stage
where we could make any such estimate. We believe the allegations are without
merit and intend to defend this action vigorously.

We are involved
in various other legal proceedings arising in the normal course of conducting
business. We believe the amounts provided in our consolidated financial
statements, as prescribed by GAAP, are adequate in light of the probable and
estimable liabilities. The resolution of those other proceedings is not
expected to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial
condition.

Commitments

We engage
Accenture LLP (“Accenture”) to assist us with improving our operational
capabilities and reducing our costs in the information systems, procurement and
human resources areas. Our future contractual obligations to Accenture are

expected to range from $76 to $334 per year
through 2012, the end of the contract period. Prior to our engagement of
Accenture, a significant portion of these costs were incurred as part of normal
operations.

We had
outstanding letters of credit for purchase obligations with a fair value of $85
at March 3, 2007.

At March 3,
2007, we had commitments for the purchase and construction of facilities valued
at approximately $69. Also, at March 3, 2007, we had entered into lease
commitments for land and buildings for 115 future locations. These lease
commitments with real estate developers provide for minimum rentals ranging
from seven to 20 years, which if consummated based on current cost estimates, will
approximate $84 annually over the initial lease terms.

These minimum rentals have been
included in the future minimum lease payments included in Note 8,

Leases

.

Related
Party Transactions

Elliot S.
Kaplan, a director, is a partner with the law firm of Robins, Kaplan, Miller &
Ciresi L.L.P. (“RKMC”), which serves as our primary outside general counsel.
Our Board periodically reviews the fees paid to RKMC to ensure that they are
competitive with fees charged by other law firms comparable in size and expertise.
We paid legal fees of $9, $7 and $6 to RKMC during fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005,
respectively. In addition, RKMC earned a contingent fee of $6 in fiscal 2005 in
connection with the settlement of our claims against two credit card companies,
which we believe resulted in a significantly greater recovery for us than we


$ in millions, except per share amounts

would have
received if we had not opted out of a related class action lawsuit against the
same defendants. The Board has approved the transactions and our continued
business dealings with RKMC.

We purchase
certain store fixtures from Phoenix Fixtures, Inc. (“Phoenix”), a company
owned by the brother of Richard M. Schulze, our Chairman of the Board. The
decision to conduct business with Phoenix was based on both qualitative and
quantitative factors including product quality, pricing, customer service and
design flexibility. Our Board reviewed our transactions with Phoenix and has
approved the transactions and our continued business dealings with Phoenix. The
total amounts paid to Phoenix during fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005 were $19, $18
and $20, respectively.

The Audit Committee of our Board, comprised of all independent
directors, has responsibility for reviewing related party transactions and
presenting them to the Board for approval.

Subsequent Event

Acquisition of Speakeasy, Inc.

Effective May 1, 2007, we acquired
Speakeasy, Inc. (“Speakeasy”) for $97 in cash, including transaction costs,
subject to certain post-closing adjustments. In connection with this
transaction, we also repaid $6 of Speakeasy’s debt. We acquired Speakeasy to
strengthen our technology portfolio for small business customers, delivered
through Best Buy For Business. The acquisition will be accounted for in the
first quarter of fiscal 2008 using the purchase method in accordance with SFAS No. 141,

Business Combinations

. Accordingly, the
net assets will be recorded at their estimated fair values, and operating
results will be included in our financial statements from the date of
acquisition. The purchase price will be allocated on a preliminary basis using
information currently available. Goodwill is projected to be approximately $75
and is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes. The allocation of the
purchase price to the assets and liabilities acquired will be finalized no
later than the first quarter of fiscal 2009, as we obtain more information
regarding asset valuations, liabilities assumed and revisions of preliminary
estimates of fair values made at the date of acquisition.

15.

Condensed
Consolidating Financial Information

Our convertible
debentures, due in 2022, are guaranteed by our wholly owned indirect subsidiary
Best Buy Stores, L.P. Investments in subsidiaries of Best Buy Stores, L.P.,
which have not guaranteed the convertible debentures, are accounted for under
the equity method. We reclassified certain prior-year amounts as
described in Note 1,

Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies

. The aggregate principal balance and carrying
amount of our convertible debentures, which mature in 2022, was $402 at March 3,
2007.

Additional
information regarding the convertible debentures is included in Note 5,

Debt

.

In June 2004,
we redeemed our convertible debentures due in 2021 for $355. These debentures
were guaranteed by Best Buy Stores, L.P. and certain of our other wholly owned
subsidiaries.

In fiscal 2004,
we sold our interest in Musicland. Best Buy Co., Inc.’s fiscal 2005 gain
on disposal of discontinued operations included a $50 tax benefit resulting
from the favorable resolution of outstanding tax matters with the IRS regarding
the disposition of our interest in Musicland. Additional information regarding
Musicland is included in Note 2,

Discontinued
Operations

.

We file a
consolidated U.S. federal income tax return. Income taxes are allocated in
accordance with our tax allocation agreement. U.S. affiliates receive no tax
benefit for taxable losses, but are allocated taxes at the required effective
income tax rate if they have taxable income.

Net
earnings in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 included income of $19 ($12 net
of tax, or $0.02 per diluted share) related to gift card breakage (gift cards sold
where the likelihood of the gift card being redeemed by the customer is remote)
for prior fiscal years. This gift card breakage was recorded as a result of
determining our legal obligation with respect to the value of unredeemed gift
cards not reflected in our initial fiscal 2006 gift card breakage recognition.
In addition, net earnings in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 included income
of $20 ($13 net of tax, or $0.03 per diluted share) related to the gain from
the sale of our investment in Golf Galaxy, Inc.

Comprised of
revenue at stores and Web sites operating for at least 14 full months, as well
as remodeled and expanded locations. Relocated stores are excluded from the
comparable store sales calculation until at least 14 full months after
reopening. Acquired stores are included in the comparable store sales
calculation beginning with the first full quarter following the first
anniversary of the date of the acquisition The calculation of the comparable
store sales percentage change excludes the impact of fluctuations in foreign
currency exchange rates.

All comparable store sales percentage calculations reflect an
equal number of weeks. The method of calculating comparable store sales varies
across the retail industry. As a result, our method of calculating comparable
store sales may not be the same as other retailers’ methods.
