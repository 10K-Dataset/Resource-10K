PART I

Item 1.

Business

The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc. was incorporated in
    Delaware in September 1930 under the name of McCann-Erickson
    Incorporated as the successor to the advertising agency
    businesses founded in 1902 by A.W. Erickson and in 1911 by
    Harrison K. McCann. The Company has operated under the
    Interpublic name since January 1961.

About
    Us

The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc., together with its
    subsidiaries (the “Company,” “Interpublic,”
    “we,” “us” or “our”), is one of
    the world’s largest advertising and marketing services
    companies, comprised of communication agencies around the world
    that deliver custom marketing solutions on behalf of our
    clients. These agencies cover the spectrum of marketing
    disciplines and specialties, from traditional services such as
    consumer advertising and direct marketing, to emerging services
    such as mobile and search engine marketing. With hundreds of
    offices in over 100 countries and approximately 42,000
    employees, our agencies develop marketing programs that build
    brands, influence consumer behavior and sell products.

To meet the challenge of an increasingly complex consumer
    culture, we create customized marketing solutions for each of
    our clients. These solutions vary from project-based work
    between one agency and its client to long-term, fully-integrated
    campaigns involving several of our companies working on behalf
    of a client. Furthermore, our agencies cover all major markets
    geographically and can operate in a single region or align work
    globally across many markets.

The role of the holding company is to provide resources and
    support to ensure that our agencies can best meet our
    clients’ needs. Based in New York City, Interpublic sets
    company-wide financial objectives and corporate strategy,
    directs collaborative inter-agency programs, establishes
    financial management and operational controls, guides personnel
    policy, conducts investor relations and initiates, manages and
    approves mergers and acquisitions. In addition, we provide
    limited centralized functional services that offer our companies
    operational efficiencies, including accounting and finance,
    marketing information retrieval and analysis, legal services,
    real estate expertise, travel services, recruitment aid,
    employee benefits and executive compensation management.

Our
    Strategy

We compete in a fast-changing industry. To keep pace with the
    trends transforming the media landscape, including new
    technologies, a proliferation of media channels and changes in
    consumer habits, we believe a marketing communications group
    must have a broad spectrum of innovative agency brands to help
    clients navigate a fragmented market.

To keep our company well-positioned, we support our
    agencies’ initiatives to expand their high-growth
    capabilities and build their offerings in key developing
    markets. When appropriate, we also develop relationships with
    companies that are building leading-edge marketing tools that
    complement our agencies and the programs they are developing for
    clients. In addition, we look for opportunities within our
    company to modernize operations through mergers, strategic
    alliances and the development of internal programs that
    encourage intra-company collaboration.

In 2006, we took a number of steps to lead our company forward
    strategically. These initiatives include merging two of our
    companies to form Draftfcb, a modern, integrated global
    agency; a realignment of our media assets with our two largest
    global advertising networks to create a closer working
    relationship between the two disciplines; a newly focused Lowe
    with hubs in eight key markets; and strategic digital
    investments both internally and externally.

To manage the broadest range of clients, we continue to maintain
    separate agency brands in competing disciplines. Having distinct
    agencies allows us to create custom solutions best suited to
    specific clients, as well as avoid potential conflicts of
    interest among clients in the same industry.

Our
    Brands

Within Interpublic, we have some of the world’s best known
    and most innovative communication specialists.



Globally, we offer three distinct options for clients seeking
    large-scale, integrated capabilities across all our disciplines.
    These include Draftfcb, Lowe Worldwide and McCann Worldgroup.

Launched in 2006, Draftfcb is a modern agency model for clients
    seeking creative and accountable marketing programs. With more
    than 130 years of combined expertise, the newly formed
    company has its roots in both consumer advertising and
    behavioral, data-driven direct marketing. The agency is the
    first global, behavior-based, highly creative and accountable
    marketing communications organization to operate with a single
    income statement.

Lowe Worldwide is a premier creative agency that operates in the
    world’s largest advertising markets. Lowe is focused on
    delivering and sustaining high-value ideas for some of the
    world’s largest clients. The quality of the agency’s
    product is evident in its global creative rankings and its
    standing in major markets, including the United Kingdom, United
    States, India, Sweden and much of Latin America. By partnering
    with Interpublic’s marketing services companies, Lowe
    generates and executes ideas that are frequently recognized for
    effectiveness, amplified by smart communication channel planning.

McCann Worldgroup, one of the world’s leading marketing
    communications companies, offers

best-in-class

communications tools and resources to many of the world’s
    top companies and most famous brands. As more and more marketers
    seek additional ways to reach consumers, McCann Worldgroup is
    exceptionally qualified to meet their demands, in all regions of
    the world and in all marketing disciplines, through its
    operating units: McCann Erickson Advertising, with operations in
    over 100 countries; MRM Worldwide for relationship marketing and
    digital expertise; Momentum Worldwide for experiential
    marketing; and McCann Healthcare Worldwide for healthcare
    communications.

Within our group, we also have a unique roster of strong
    full-service domestic agency brands, including Campbell-Ewald,
    Campbell Mithun, Deutsch, Hill Holliday, The Martin Agency and
    Mullen. The integrated marketing programs created by this group
    have helped build some of the most powerful brands in the U.S.,
    across all sectors and industries.

Interpublic also has two leading media specialists, Initiative
    and Universal McCann. To develop creative ideas that resonate
    with consumers, brand-building agencies must work closely with
    media agencies. Initiative and Universal McCann operate
    independently but were aligned with Draftfcb and McCann
    Erickson, respectively, in late 2006. This approach is intended
    to improve cross-media communications and our ability to deliver
    integrated marketing programs. Our “aligned model”
    with respect to media differentiates us from our principal
    competitors.

Interpublic also has exceptional specialist firms across the
    full range of marketing services. These include FutureBrand
    (corporate branding), Jack Morton (experiential marketing),
    Octagon (sports marketing), Regan Campbell Ward (healthcare
    communications), and WeberShandwick (public relations), all of
    which report into our Constituency Management Group
    (“CMG”). We also have

best-in-class

digital agencies, led by R/GA. To further strengthen our
    emerging-media offering, in late 2006 we formed the Futures
    Marketing Group, which houses existing high-growth media
    offerings such as the Interpublic Emerging Media Lab and fosters
    new media investments and alliances. Many more of our marketing
    specialists can be found using the “Company Finder”
    tool on our website, www.interpublic.com.

To help clients target fast-growth demographic segments in the
    U.S. market, Interpublic owns a stake in several
    multicultural agencies, including abecé (Hispanic), Accent
    Marketing (Hispanic), The Axis Agency (African American),
    Casanova Pendrill (Hispanic), IW Group (Asian-Pacific American)
    and SiboneyUSA (Hispanic).

Our
    Financial Reporting Segments

For financial reporting purposes, we have two reportable
    segments: Integrated Agency Network (“IAN”), which is
    comprised of Draftfcb, Lowe, McCann, our media agencies and our
    leading stand-alone agencies, and CMG, which is comprised of the
    bulk of our specialist marketing service offerings. We also
    report results for the “Corporate and other” group.
    Until December 31, 2005, we had an additional segment,
    Motorsports operations (“Motorsports”), which was sold
    during 2004 and had immaterial residual operating results in
    2005. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements
    for further discussion.

Principal
    Markets

Our agencies are located in over 100 countries, including every
    significant world market. We provide services for clients whose
    businesses are broadly international in scope, as well as for
    clients whose businesses are limited to



a single country or a small number of countries. The United
    States (“U.S.”), Europe (excluding the United Kingdom
    (“U.K.”)), the U.K., Asia Pacific and Latin America
    represented 55.6%, 16.8%, 9.1%, 8.3% and 4.9% of our total
    revenue, respectively, in 2006. For further discussion
    concerning revenues and long-lived assets on a geographical
    basis for each of the last three years, see Note 15 to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements.

Sources
    of Revenue

Our revenues are primarily derived from the planning and
    execution of advertising programs in various media and the
    planning and execution of other marketing and communications
    programs. Most of our client contracts are individually
    negotiated and accordingly, the terms of client engagements and
    the basis on which we earn commissions and fees vary
    significantly. Our client contracts are complex arrangements
    that may include provisions for incentive compensation and
    govern vendor rebates and credits. Our largest clients are
    multinational entities and, as such, we often provide services
    to these clients out of multiple offices and across various
    agencies. In arranging for such services to be provided, we may
    enter into global, regional and local agreements.

Revenues for creation, planning and placement of advertising are
    determined primarily on a negotiated fee basis and, to a lesser
    extent, on a commission basis. Fees are usually calculated to
    reflect hourly rates plus proportional overhead and a

mark-up.

Many clients include an incentive compensation component in
    their total compensation package. This provides added revenue
    based on achieving mutually agreed-upon qualitative

and/or

quantitative metrics within specified time periods. Commissions
    are earned based on services provided, and are usually derived
    from a percentage or fee over the total cost to complete the
    assignment. Commissions can also be derived when clients pay us
    the gross rate billed by media and we pay for media at a lower
    net rate; the difference is the commission that we earn, which
    is either retained in total or shared with the client depending
    on the nature of the services agreement.

We pay the media charges with respect to contracts for
    advertising time or space that we place on behalf of our
    clients. To reduce our risk from a client’s non-payment, we
    typically pay media charges only after we have received funds
    from our clients. Generally, we act as the client’s agent
    rather than the primary obligor. In some instances we agree with
    the media provider that we will only be liable to pay the media
    after the client has paid us for the media charges.

We also generate revenue in negotiated fees from our public
    relations, sales promotion, event marketing, sports and
    entertainment marketing and corporate and brand identity
    services.

Our revenue is directly dependent upon the advertising,
    marketing and corporate communications requirements of our
    clients and tends to be higher in the second half of the
    calendar year as a result of the holiday season and lower in the
    first half as a result of the post-holiday slow-down in client
    activity. Depending on the terms of the client contract, fees
    for services performed can be primarily recognized three ways:
    proportional performance, straight-line (or monthly basis) or
    completed contract. Fee revenue recognized on a completed
    contract basis also contributes to the higher seasonal revenues
    experienced in the fourth quarter because the majority of our
    contracts end at December 31. As is customary in the
    industry, our contracts generally provide for termination by
    either party on relatively short notice, usually 90 days.
    See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
    further discussion of our revenue recognition accounting
    policies.

Clients

In the aggregate, our top ten clients based on revenue accounted
    for approximately 25% of revenue in 2006 and 2005. Based on
    revenue for the year ended December 31, 2006, our largest
    clients were General Motors Corporation, Johnson &
    Johnson, Microsoft, Unilever and Verizon. While the loss of the
    entire business of any one of our largest clients might have a
    material adverse effect upon our business, we believe that it is
    unlikely that the entire business of any of these clients would
    be lost at the same time. This is because we represent several
    different brands or divisions of each of these clients in a
    number of geographic markets, as well as provide services across
    multiple advertising and marketing disciplines, in each case
    through more than one of our agency systems. Representation of a
    client rarely means that we handle advertising for all brands or
    product lines of the client in all geographical locations. Any
    client may transfer its business from one of our agencies to a
    competing agency, and a client may reduce its marketing budget
    at any time.



Personnel

As of December 31, 2006, we employed approximately 42,000
    persons, of whom approximately 18,000 were employed in the
    U.S. Because of the service character of the advertising
    and marketing communications business, the quality of personnel
    is of crucial importance to our continuing success. There is
    keen competition for qualified employees.

Item 1A.

Risk
    Factors

We are subject to a variety of possible risks that could
    adversely impact our revenues, results of operations or
    financial condition. Some of these risks relate to the industry
    in which we operate, while others are more specific to us. The
    following factors set out potential risks we have identified
    that could adversely affect us. See also Statement Regarding
    Forward-Looking Disclosure.

•

We have numerous material weaknesses in our internal
    control over financial reporting and extensive work remaining to
    remediate these weaknesses.

We have identified numerous material weaknesses in our internal
    control over financial reporting, and our internal control over
    financial reporting was not effective as of December 31,
    2006. For a detailed description of these material weaknesses,
    see Item 8, Management’s Assessment of Internal
    Control Over Financial Reporting, in this report. Each of our
    material weaknesses results in more than a remote likelihood
    that a material misstatement will not be prevented or detected.
    Given the extensive material weaknesses identified, there is a
    risk of errors not being prevented or detected, which could
    require us to restate our financial statements in the future.
    Any such restatements could result in or contribute to
    regulatory actions or civil litigation, ratings downgrades,
    negative publicity or difficulties in attracting or retaining
    key clients, employees and management personnel.

We incurred significant professional fees and other expenses in
    2006 to prepare our consolidated financial statements and to
    comply with the requirements of Section 404 of the
    Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, in particular as a result of the
    extent of the deficiencies in our internal control over
    financial reporting and the extensive additional work and
    resources required to obtain reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of our financial statements. The cost of this work
    will continue to be significant in 2007 and beyond.

Because of our decentralized structure and our many disparate
    accounting systems of varying quality and sophistication, we
    have extensive work remaining to remediate our material
    weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting. We have
    developed a work plan with the goal of remediating all of the
    identified material weaknesses by the time we file our Annual
    Report on

Form 10-K

for the year ending December 31, 2007. There can be no
    assurance, however, as to when the remediation plan will be
    fully implemented and all the material weaknesses remediated.
    Until our remediation is completed, there will also continue to
    be a risk that we will be unable to file future periodic reports
    with the SEC in a timely manner and that a default could result
    under the indentures governing our debt securities, under any of
    our credit facilities or under any credit facilities of our
    subsidiaries.

•

Ongoing SEC investigations regarding our accounting
    restatements could adversely affect us.

The SEC opened a formal investigation in response to the
    restatement we first announced in August 2002 and the
    investigation expanded to encompass the restatement we presented
    in our Annual Report on

Form 10-K

for the year ended December 31, 2004 that we filed in
    September 2005 (the “2005 Restatement”). In
    particular, since we filed our 2004 Annual Report on

Form 10-K,

we have received subpoenas from the SEC relating to matters
    addressed in our 2005 Restatement. We have also responded to
    inquiries from the SEC staff concerning the restatement of the
    first three quarters of 2005 that we made in our 2005 Annual
    Report on

Form 10-K.

We continue to cooperate with the investigation. We expect that
    the investigation will result in monetary liability, but because
    the investigation is ongoing, in particular with respect to the
    2005 Restatement, we cannot reasonably estimate the amount,
    range of amounts or timing of a resolution. Accordingly, we have
    not yet established any accounting provision relating to these
    matters. Adverse developments in connection with the
    investigation, including any expansion of the scope of the
    investigation, could also negatively impact us and could divert
    the efforts and attention of our management team from our
    ordinary business operations.

•

We operate in a highly competitive industry.



The marketing communications business is highly competitive. Our
    agencies and media services must compete with other agencies,
    and with other providers of creative or media services, in order
    to maintain existing client relationships and to win new
    clients. The client’s perception of the quality of an
    agency’s creative work, our reputation and the
    agencies’ reputations are important factors in determining
    our competitive position. An agency’s ability to serve
    clients, particularly large international clients, on a broad
    geographic basis is also an important competitive consideration.
    On the other hand, because an agency’s principal asset is
    its people, freedom of entry into the business is almost
    unlimited and a small agency is, on occasion, able to take all
    or some portion of a client’s account from a much larger
    competitor.

Many companies put their advertising and marketing
    communications business up for competitive review from time to
    time. We have won and lost client accounts in the past as a
    result of such periodic competitions. Our ability to attract new
    clients and to retain existing clients may also, in some cases,
    be limited by clients’ policies or perceptions about
    conflicts of interest. These policies can, in some cases,
    prevent one agency, or even different agencies under our
    ownership, from performing similar services for competing
    products or companies.

•

We may lose or fail to attract and retain key employees
    and management personnel.

Employees, including creative, research, media, account and
    practice group specialists, and their skills and relationships
    with clients, are among our most important assets. An important
    aspect of our competitiveness is our ability to attract and
    retain key employees and management personnel. Our ability to do
    so is influenced by a variety of factors, including the
    compensation we award, and could be adversely affected by our
    recent financial or market performance.

•

As a marketing services company, our revenues are highly
    susceptible to declines as a result of unfavorable economic
    conditions.

Economic downturns often more severely affect the marketing
    services industry than other industries. In the past, some
    clients have responded to weak economic performance in any
    region where we operate by reducing their marketing budgets,
    which are generally discretionary in nature and easier to reduce
    in the short-term than other expenses related to operations.
    This pattern may recur in the future.

•

Downgrades of our credit ratings could adversely affect
    us.

Our long-term debt is currently rated Ba3 with negative outlook
    by Moody’s, B CreditWatch negative by Standard and
    Poor’s, and B with negative outlook by Fitch. It is
    possible that our credit ratings will be reduced further.
    Ratings downgrades or comparatively weak ratings can adversely
    affect us, because ratings are an important factor influencing
    our ability to access capital. Our clients and vendors may also
    consider our credit profile when negotiating contract terms, and
    if they were to change the terms on which they deal with us, it
    could have a significant adverse effect on our liquidity.

•

Our liquidity profile could be adversely affected.

In previous years, we have experienced operating losses and weak
    operating cash flow. Until our margins consistently improve in
    connection with our turnaround, cash generation from operations
    could be challenged in certain periods. This could have a
    negative impact on our liquidity in future years and could lead
    us to seek new or additional sources of liquidity to fund our
    working capital needs. There can be no guarantee that we would
    be able to access any new sources of liquidity on commercially
    reasonable terms or at all. If we were unable to do so, our
    liquidity position could be adversely affected.

•

If some of our clients experience financial distress,
    their weakened financial position could negatively affect our
    own financial position and results.

We have a large and diverse client base, and at any given time,
    one or more of our clients may experience financial distress,
    file for bankruptcy protection or go out of business. If any
    client with whom we have a substantial amount of business
    experiences financial difficulty, it could delay or jeopardize
    the collection of accounts receivable, may result in significant
    reductions in services provided by us and may have a material
    adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations
    and liquidity. For a description of our client base, see
    Item 1, Business — Clients.

•

International business risks could adversely affect our
    operations.



International revenues represent a significant portion of our
    revenues, approximately 44% in 2006. Our international
    operations are exposed to risks that affect foreign operations
    of all kinds, including local legislation, monetary devaluation,
    exchange control restrictions and unstable political conditions.
    These risks may limit our ability to grow our business and
    effectively manage our operations in those countries. In
    addition, because a significant portion of our business is
    denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, such
    as the Euro, Pound Sterling, Canadian Dollar, Brazilian Real,
    Japanese Yen and South African Rand, fluctuations in exchange
    rates between the U.S. dollar and such currencies may
    materially affect our financial results.

•

In 2006 and prior years, we recognized impairment charges
    and increased our deferred tax valuation allowances, and we may
    be required to record additional charges in the future related
    to these matters.

We evaluate all of our long-lived assets (including goodwill,
    other intangible assets and fixed assets), investments and
    deferred tax assets for possible impairment or realizability at
    least annually and whenever there is an indication of impairment
    or lack of realizability. If certain criteria are met, we are
    required to record an impairment charge or valuation allowance.
    In the past, we have recorded substantial amounts of goodwill,
    investment and other impairment charges, and have been required
    to establish substantial valuation allowances with respect to
    deferred tax assets and loss carry-forwards.

As of December 31, 2006, we have substantial amounts of
    long-lived assets, investments and deferred tax assets on our
    Consolidated Balance Sheet. Future events, including our
    financial performance and strategic decisions, could cause us to
    conclude that further impairment indicators exist and that the
    asset values associated with long-lived assets, investments and
    deferred tax assets may have become impaired. Any resulting
    impairment loss would have an adverse impact on our reported
    earnings in the period in which the charge is recognized.

•

We may not be able to meet our performance targets and
    milestones.

From time to time, we communicate to the market certain targets
    and milestones for our financial and operating performance
    including, but not limited to, the areas of revenue growth,
    operating expense reduction and operating margin growth. These
    targets and milestones are intended to provide metrics against
    which to evaluate our performance, but they should not be
    understood as predictions or guidance about our expected
    performance. Our ability to meet any target or milestone is
    subject to inherent risks and uncertainties, and we caution
    investors against placing undue reliance on them. See
    “Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Disclosure.”

•

We are subject to regulations and other governmental
    scrutiny that could restrict our activities or negatively impact
    our revenues.

Our industry is subject to government regulation and other
    governmental action, both domestic and foreign. There has been
    an increasing tendency on the part of advertisers and consumer
    groups to challenge advertising through legislation, regulation,
    the courts or otherwise, for example on the grounds that the
    advertising is false and deceptive or injurious to public
    welfare. Through the years, there has been a continuing
    expansion of specific rules, prohibitions, media restrictions,
    labeling disclosures and warning requirements with respect to
    the advertising for certain products. Representatives within
    government bodies, both domestic and foreign, continue to
    initiate proposals to ban the advertising of specific products
    and to impose taxes on or deny deductions for advertising,
    which, if successful, may have an adverse effect on advertising
    expenditures and consequently our revenues.

Properties

Substantially all of our office space is leased from third
    parties. Several of our leases will be expiring within the next
    few months, while the remainder will be expiring within the next
    18 years. Certain leases are subject to rent reviews or
    contain escalation clauses, and certain of our leases require
    the payment of various operating expenses, which may also be
    subject to escalation. Physical properties include leasehold
    improvements, furniture, fixtures and equipment located in our
    offices. We believe that facilities leased or owned by us are
    adequate for the purposes for which they are currently used and
    are well maintained. See Note 18 to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements for a discussion of our lease commitments.



Item 3.

Legal
    Proceedings

We are or have been involved in legal and administrative
    proceedings of various types. While any litigation contains an
    element of uncertainty, we have no reason to believe that the
    outcome of such proceedings or claims will have a material
    adverse effect on our financial condition except as described
    below.

SEC
    Investigation

The SEC opened a formal investigation in response to the
    restatement we first announced in August 2002 and the
    investigation expanded to encompass our 2005 Restatement. In
    particular, since we filed our 2004 Annual Report on

Form 10-K,

we have received subpoenas from the SEC relating to matters
    addressed in our 2005 Restatement. We have also responded to
    inquiries from the SEC staff concerning the restatement of the
    first three quarters of 2005 that we made in our 2005 Annual
    Report on

Form 10-K.

We continue to cooperate with the investigation. We expect that
    the investigation will result in monetary liability, but because
    the investigation is ongoing, in particular with respect to the
    2005 Restatement, we cannot reasonably estimate the amount,
    range of amounts or timing of a resolution. Accordingly, we have
    not yet established any provision relating to these matters.

EXECUTIVE
    SUMMARY

We are one of the world’s largest advertising and marketing
    services companies, comprised of communication agencies around
    the world that deliver custom marketing solutions on behalf of
    our clients. These agencies cover the spectrum of marketing
    disciplines and specialties, from traditional services such as
    consumer advertising and direct marketing, to emerging services
    such as mobile and search engine marketing. To meet the
    challenge of an increasingly complex consumer culture, we create
    customized marketing solutions for each of our clients. These
    solutions vary from project-based work between one agency and
    its client to long-term, fully-integrated campaigns involving
    several of our companies working on behalf of a client.
    Furthermore, our agencies cover all major markets geographically
    and can operate in a single region or align work globally across
    many markets.

Our strategy is focused on improving organic revenue growth and
    our operating income, and we are working to achieve a level of
    organic revenue growth comparable to industry peers and
    double-digit operating margins by 2008. We analyze

period-to-period

changes in our operating performance by determining the portion
    of the change that is attributable to foreign currency rates and
    the change attributable to the net effect of acquisitions and
    divestitures, and the remainder is considered the organic
    change. For purposes of analyzing this change, acquisitions and
    divestitures are treated as if they occurred on the first day of
    the quarter during which the transaction occurred.

Revenue is directly dependent upon the advertising, marketing
    and corporate communications requirements of our clients. For
    2006, our revenues were negatively affected primarily by the
    client losses and dispositions that occurred in 2005, and we
    expect our operating margin will continue to be negatively
    affected, as compared to our peers, by high expenses for
    professional fees, although to a decreasing extent. It is
    typical in our industry to lose or resign from client accounts
    and assignments for many reasons, including conflicts with
    recent client wins. We



THE
    INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
    OPERATIONS — (Continued)

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)

believe we are continuing our turnaround and our results for
    2006 reflect the challenges we face improving revenues and
    operating margins. However, we have achieved some notable
    success in new client wins as well as fewer client losses in
    2006, which supports our efforts in our turnaround.

Our reported results are affected by fluctuations in the
    exchange rates of the foreign currencies of our international
    businesses, principally the Brazilian Real, Canadian Dollar,
    Japanese Yen, Pound Sterling, South African Rand and Euro. In
    2006, the U.S. Dollar was weaker against most of these
    currencies compared to 2005. In 2005, the U.S. Dollar was
    weaker against most of these currencies compared to 2004. As a
    result, the net effect of foreign currency changes from
    comparable prior year periods was to increase revenues and
    operating expenses in 2006 and 2005.

As discussed in more detail in this MD&A, for 2006 compared
    to 2005:

•

Total revenue declined by 1.3%.

•

Organic revenue increase was 1.0% primarily due to higher
    revenue from existing clients.

•

Operating margin was 1.7% in 2006, compared to (1.7%) in 2005.
    Operating margin was negatively impacted by restructuring and
    other reorganization-related charges and long-lived asset
    impairment and other charges by 1.0% and 1.5% in 2006 and 2005,
    respectively. Excluding the impact of these items, operating
    margin improved to 2.7% in 2006 from (0.2%) in 2005.

•

Operating expenses were $6,084.8 in 2006, compared to $6,378.5
    in 2005, a decrease of 4.6%. Operating expenses were negatively
    impacted by restructuring and other reorganization-related
    charges and long-lived asset impairment and other charges of
    $61.7 and $91.3, in 2006 and 2005, respectively. Excluding the
    impact of these items, operating expenses decreased by $264.1,
    or 4.2%, in 2006.

•

Total salaries and related expenses decreased 1.4% mainly due to
    net divestitures and lower severance charges, partly offset by
    higher incentive compensation. The organic increase was 0.5%.

•

Total office and general expenses decreased 9.1% mainly due to
    the effect of net divestitures and lower professional fees. The
    organic decrease was 5.2%.

•

As of December 31, 2006, cash and cash equivalents and
    marketable securities decreased $234.4 primarily due to working
    capital usage, as well as costs associated with capital markets
    activity and capital expenditures, partially offset by improved
    operating results.

We made substantial progress in remediating previous material
    weaknesses.

CRITICAL
    ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

Our Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance
    with generally accepted accounting principles in the United
    States of America. Preparation of the Consolidated Financial
    Statements and related disclosures requires us to make
    judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts
    reported and disclosed in the accompanying notes. We believe
    that of our significant accounting policies, the following
    critical accounting estimates involve management’s most
    difficult, subjective or complex judgments. We consider these
    accounting estimates to be critical because changes in the
    underlying assumptions or estimates have the potential to
    materially impact our financial statements. Management has
    discussed with our Audit Committee the development, selection,
    application and disclosure of these critical accounting
    estimates. We regularly evaluate our judgments, assumptions and
    estimates based on historical experience and various other
    factors that we believe to be relevant under the circumstances.
    Actual results may differ from these estimates under different
    assumptions or conditions.

Revenue
    Recognition

Our revenues are primarily derived from the planning and
    execution of advertising programs in various media and the
    planning and execution of other marketing and communications
    programs. Most of our client contracts are individually
    negotiated and accordingly, the terms of client engagements and
    the basis on which we earn commissions and fees vary
    significantly. Our client contracts are complex arrangements
    that may include provisions for incentive compensation and
    govern vendor rebates and credits. Our largest clients are
    multinational entities and, as such, we often provide services
    to these clients out of multiple offices and across



THE
    INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
    OPERATIONS — (Continued)

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)

various agencies. In arranging for such services to be provided,
    it is possible for a global, regional and local agreement to be
    initiated. Multiple agreements of this nature are reviewed by
    legal counsel to determine the governing terms to be followed by
    the offices and agencies involved. Critical judgments and
    estimates are involved in determining both the amount and timing
    of revenue recognition under these arrangements.

Revenue for our services is recognized when all of the following
    criteria are satisfied: (i) persuasive evidence of an
    arrangement exists; (ii) the price is fixed or
    determinable; (iii) collectibility is reasonably assured;
    and (iv) services have been performed. Depending on the
    terms of a client contract, fees for services performed can be
    primarily recognized in one of three ways: proportional
    performance, straight-line (or monthly basis) or completed
    contract. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements for further information.

Depending on the terms of the client contract, revenue is
    derived from diverse arrangements involving fees for services
    performed, commissions, performance incentive provisions and
    combinations of the three. Commissions are generally earned on
    the date of the broadcast or publication. Contractual
    arrangements with clients may also include performance incentive
    provisions designed to link a portion of the revenue to our
    performance relative to both qualitative and quantitative goals.
    Performance incentives are recognized as revenue for
    quantitative targets when the target has been achieved and for
    qualitative targets when confirmation of the incentive is
    received from the client. The classification of client
    arrangements to determine the appropriate revenue recognition
    involves judgments. If the judgments change there can be a
    material impact on our financial statements, and particularly on
    the allocation of revenues between periods. Incremental direct
    costs incurred related to contracts where revenue is accounted
    for on a completed contract basis are generally expensed as
    incurred. There are certain exceptions made for significant
    contracts or for certain agencies where the majority of the
    contracts are project-based and systems are in place to properly
    capture appropriate direct costs.

Substantially all of our revenue is recorded as the net amount
    of our gross billings less pass-through expenses charged to a
    client. In most cases, the amount that is billed to clients
    significantly exceeds the amount of revenue that is earned and
    reflected in our financial statements, because of various
    pass-through expenses such as production and media costs. In
    compliance with Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”)
    Issue

No. 99-19,

Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an
    Agent

, we assess whether our agency or the third-party
    supplier is the primary obligor. We evaluate the terms of our
    client agreements as part of this assessment. In addition, we
    give appropriate consideration to other key indicators such as
    latitude in establishing price, discretion in supplier selection
    and credit risk to the vendor. Because we operate broadly as an
    advertising agency based on our primary lines of business and
    given the industry practice to generally record revenue on a net
    versus gross basis, we believe that there must be strong
    evidence in place to overcome the presumption of net revenue
    accounting. Accordingly, we generally record revenue net of
    pass-through charges as we believe the key indicators of the
    business suggest we generally act as an agent on behalf of our
    clients in our primary lines of business. In those businesses
    (primarily sales promotion, event, sports and entertainment
    marketing and corporate and brand identity services) where the
    key indicators suggest we act as a principal, we record the
    gross amount billed to the client as revenue and the related
    costs incurred as operating expenses. Revenue is reported net of
    taxes assessed by governmental authorities that are directly
    imposed on our revenue producing transactions.

The determination as to whether revenue in a particular line of
    business should be recognized net or gross involves difficult
    judgments. If we make these judgments differently, it could
    significantly affect our financial performance. If it were
    determined that we must recognize a significant portion of
    revenues on a gross basis rather than a net basis, it would
    positively impact revenues, but have no impact on our operating
    income and an adverse impact on operating margin. Conversely, if
    it were determined that we must recognize a significant portion
    of revenues on a net basis rather than a gross basis, it would
    negatively impact revenues, but have no impact on our operating
    income and a positive impact on operation margin.

We receive credits from our vendors and media outlets for
    transactions entered into on behalf of our clients that, based
    on the terms of our contracts and local law, are either remitted
    to our clients or retained by us. If amounts are to be passed
    through to clients they are recorded as liabilities until
    settlement or, if retained by us, are recorded as revenue when
    earned.

Negotiations with a client at the close of a current engagement
    could result in either payments to the client in excess of the
    contractual liability or in payments less than the contractual
    liability. These items, referred to as concessions, relate
    directly to the operations of the period and are recorded as
    operating expense or income.

Concession income or expense may also be realized in connection
    with settling vendor discount or credit liabilities that were
    established as part of the 2005 Restatement. In these
    situations, and given the historical nature of these
    liabilities, we have recorded such items as other income or
    expense in order to prevent distortion of current operating
    results. See also Notes 1 and 4 to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements.

Stock-Based
    Compensation

On January 1, 2006, we adopted SFAS No. 123
    (revised 2004),

Share-Based Payment

(“SFAS No. 123R”).
    SFAS No. 123R requires compensation costs related to
    share-based transactions, including employee stock options, to
    be recognized in the financial statements based on fair value.
    We implemented SFAS No. 123R using the modified
    prospective transition method. Under this transition method, the
    compensation expense recognized beginning January 1, 2006
    includes compensation expense for (i) all stock-based
    payments granted prior to, but not yet vested as of
    January 1, 2006, based on the grant-date fair value
    estimated in accordance with the original provisions of
    SFAS No. 123, and (ii) all stock-based awards
    granted subsequent to December 31, 2005 based on the
    grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with the
    provisions of SFAS No. 123R. Compensation cost is
    generally recognized ratably over the requisite service period,
    net of estimated forfeitures.

We use the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to estimate the
    fair value of options granted, which requires the input of
    subjective assumptions including the option’s expected term
    and the price volatility of the underlying stock. Changes in the
    assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value and
    our results of operations could be materially impacted. The
    expected volatility factor is based on a blend of historical
    volatility of our common stock and implied volatility of our
    tradable forward put and call options to purchase and sell
    shares of our common stock. The expected term is based on the
    average of an assumption that outstanding options are exercised
    upon achieving their full vesting date and will be exercised at
    the midpoint between the current date (i.e., the date awards
    have been ratably vested through) and their full contractual
    term. Additionally, we calculate an estimated forfeiture rate
    which impacts our recorded expense. See Note 14 to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

Income
    Taxes

The provision for income taxes includes federal, state, local
    and foreign taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
    recognized for the estimated future tax consequences of
    temporary differences between the financial statement carrying
    amounts and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and
    liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to
    apply to taxable income in the year in which the temporary
    differences are expected to be reversed. Changes to enacted tax
    rates would result in either increases or decreases in the
    provision for income taxes in the period of changes. We evaluate
    the realizability of our deferred tax assets and recognize a
    valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that all or
    a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized.

The realization of our deferred tax assets is primarily
    dependent on future earnings. Any reduction in estimated
    forecasted results may require that we record additional
    valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets. Once a
    valuation allowance has been established, it will be maintained
    until there is sufficient positive evidence to conclude that it
    is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be
    realized. A pattern of sustained profitability will generally be
    considered as sufficient positive evidence to reverse a
    valuation allowance. If the allowance is reversed in a future
    period, our income tax provision will be correspondingly
    reduced. Accordingly, the increase and decrease of valuation
    allowances has had and could have a significant negative or
    positive impact on our future earnings. See Note 9 to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)

Goodwill
    and Other Intangible Assets

We account for our business combinations using the purchase
    accounting method. The total costs of the acquisitions are
    allocated to the underlying net assets, based on their
    respective estimated fair market values and the remainder
    allocated to goodwill and other intangible assets. Considering
    the characteristics of advertising, specialized marketing and
    communication services companies, our acquisitions usually do
    not have significant amounts of tangible assets as the principal
    asset we typically acquire is creative talent. As a result, a
    substantial portion of the purchase price is allocated to
    goodwill. Determining the fair market value of assets acquired
    and liabilities assumed requires management’s judgment and
    involves the use of significant estimates, including future cash
    inflows and outflows, discount rates, asset lives and market
    multiples.

We review goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite
    lives not subject to amortization during the fourth quarter or
    whenever events or significant changes in circumstances indicate
    that the carrying value may not be recoverable. We evaluate the
    recoverability of goodwill at a reporting unit level. We
    identified 14 reporting units for the 2006 annual impairment
    testing that are either the entities at the operating segment
    level or one level below the operating segment level. We review
    intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization
    whenever events or circumstances indicate that a carrying amount
    of an asset may not be recoverable. Intangible assets with
    definite lives subject to amortization are amortized on a
    straight-line basis with estimated useful lives of up to
    15 years. Events or circumstances that might require
    impairment testing include the loss of a significant client, the
    identification of other impaired assets within a reporting unit,
    loss of key personnel, the disposition of a significant portion
    of a reporting unit, or a significant adverse change in business
    climate or regulations.

SFAS No. 142,

Goodwill and Other Intangible
    Assets

, specifies a two-step process for goodwill impairment
    testing and measuring the magnitude of any impairment. The first
    step of the impairment test is a comparison of the fair value of
    a reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill.
    Goodwill allocated to a reporting unit whose fair value is equal
    to or greater than its carrying value is not impaired, and no
    further testing is required. Should the carrying amount for a
    reporting unit exceed its fair value, then the first step of the
    impairment test is failed and the magnitude of any goodwill
    impairment is determined under the second step. The second step
    is a comparison of the implied fair value of a reporting
    unit’s goodwill to its carrying value. Goodwill of a
    reporting unit is impaired when its carrying value exceeds its
    implied fair value. Impaired goodwill is written down to its
    implied fair value with a charge to expense in the period the
    impairment is identified.

The fair value of a reporting unit is estimated using
    traditional valuation techniques such as the income approach,
    which incorporates the use of the discounted cash flow method
    and the market approach, which incorporates the use of earning
    and revenue multiples. These techniques use projections which
    require the use of significant estimates and assumptions as to
    matters such as future revenue growth, profit margins, capital
    expenditures, assumed tax rates and discount rates. We believe
    that the estimates and assumptions made are reasonable but they
    are susceptible to change from period to period. For example,
    our strategic decisions or changes in market valuation multiples
    could lead to impairment charges. Actual results of operations,
    cash flows and other factors used in a discounted cash flow
    valuation will likely differ from the estimates used and it is
    possible that differences and changes could be material.

Our annual impairment reviews as of October 1st, 2006
    resulted in an impairment charge of $27.2 at one of our domestic
    advertising reporting units. See Note 8 to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements for further information. The excess of the
    fair value over the carrying value at the low end of the
    valuation range for each of the non-impaired reporting units
    ranged from $0.2 to $1,990.2 and $2.4 to $1,501.9 in 2006 and
    2005, respectively. For 2006, this excess ranged from $2.4 to
    $2,400.2 at the high end of the valuation range. In order to
    evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the
    goodwill impairment test, we applied a hypothetical 10% decrease
    to the fair values of each reporting unit. For 2006, this would
    result in the total carrying value being less than the total
    fair value at the low end of the range by $46.8, which would
    have triggered additional step two tests. For 2005, this
    hypothetical 10% decrease would result in the total carrying
    value being less than the total fair value at the low end of the
    range by $38.2, which would have triggered additional step two
    tests.

Pension
    and Postretirement Benefits

We use various actuarial assumptions in determining our net
    pension and postretirement benefit costs and obligations. These
    assumptions include discount rates and expected returns on plan
    assets and are updated annually or more frequently with the
    occurrence of significant events. Changes in the related pension
    and postretirement benefit costs may occur in the future due to
    changes in the assumptions.

The discount rate is one of the significant assumptions that
    impacts our net pension and postretirement costs and
    obligations. The discount rates are determined at the beginning
    of the year based on prevailing interest rates as of the
    measurement date and are adjusted to match the duration of the
    underlying obligation. For 2007, we plan to use weighted average
    discount rates of 5.68%, 4.82% and 5.75% for the domestic
    pension plans, foreign plans and the postretirement plan,
    respectively. Changes in the discount rates are generally due to
    increases or decreases in long-term interest rates. A higher
    discount rate will decrease our pension cost. A 25 basis
    point increase or decrease in the discount rate would have
    decreased or increased the 2006 net pension and
    postretirement cost by $2.3 and $0.1, respectively. In addition,
    a 25 basis point increase or decrease in the discount rate
    would have decreased or increased the December 31, 2006
    benefit obligation by $31.4.

The expected rate of return on pension plan assets is another
    significant assumption that impacts our net pension cost and is
    determined at the beginning of the year. Changes in the rates
    are due to lower or higher expected future returns based on the
    mix of assets held and studies performed by our external
    investment advisors. For 2007, we plan to use weighted average
    expected rates of return of 8.16% and 7.57% for the domestic and
    foreign pension plans, respectively. A lower expected rate of
    return will increase our net pension cost. A 25 basis point
    increase or decrease in the expected return on plan assets would
    have decreased or increased the 2006 net pension cost by
    $1.1. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements
    for further information.

Revenue decreased due to net divestitures partially offset by
    organic revenue increases and changes in foreign currency
    exchange rates. Net divestitures primarily impacted the
    Integrated Agency Networks (“IAN”) segment, largely
    from Draftfcb and McCann during 2005. There were net organic
    revenue increases in both our international and domestic
    locations. The international organic increase was driven by
    higher revenue from existing clients primarily in the Asia
    Pacific and Latin America regions partially offset by net client
    losses, primarily in 2005, at IAN as well as decreases in the
    events marketing businesses at the Constituency Management Group
    (“CMG”) in the United Kingdom region. The domestic
    organic increase was primarily driven by growth in the public
    relations and branding businesses at CMG as well as higher
    revenue from existing clients, partially offset by net client
    losses and decreased client spending at IAN.

Revenue decreased during 2005 due to net divestitures and
    organic revenue decreases, partially offset by changes in
    foreign currency exchange rates. The revenue decline from net
    divestitures was largely due to dispositions at McCann during
    2005 primarily in the Europe and United States regions and the
    sale of the Motorsports business during 2004. The organic
    revenue decrease was driven by IAN, partially offset by an
    increase at CMG. The decrease at IAN was a result of client
    losses and a reduction in revenue from existing clients
    primarily in our European offices. The increase at CMG was
    primarily driven by growth in public relations businesses
    internationally and the sports marketing businesses domestically
    as a result of increased spending from existing clients and
    client wins.

Salaries
    and Related Expenses

Salaries and related expenses are the largest component of
    operating expenses and consist of payroll costs, employee
    performance incentives, including short and long-term incentive
    awards, and other benefits associated with client service
    professional staff and administrative staff. Salaries and
    related expenses do not vary significantly with short-term
    changes in revenue levels. However, salaries may fluctuate due
    to the timing of hiring freelance contractors who are utilized
    to support business development, changes in the funding levels
    of short and long-term incentive awards and changes in foreign
    currency exchange rates. Our financial performance over the past
    few years has lagged behind our peers, primarily due to lower
    revenue growth. As a result, salaries and related expenses
    reflect significant severance charges, primarily incurred in
    previous years, and investments in hiring creative talent to
    realign the business for revenue growth and improved operating
    margins. Also, salaries and related expenses reflect the hiring
    of additional finance professionals and information technology
    staff to upgrade system infrastructure and to address weaknesses
    in our accounting and control environment, as well as to develop
    shared services.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
    OPERATIONS — (Continued)

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)

    Compared to 2005

Salaries and related expenses decreased during 2006 due to net
    divestitures, primarily from the sale of several businesses at
    IAN during 2005, partially offset by changes in foreign currency
    exchange rates and a slight organic increase. Total salaries and
    related expenses as a percentage of revenue remained flat as a
    result of the decline in revenue. Key factors behind the change
    in salaries and related expenses from the prior year were a
    significant reduction in severance expense of $63.7, offset by
    an increase in long-term incentive awards and bonus awards of
    $67.2. Expenses related to incentive awards increased in 2006
    due to long-term equity based awards granted in June 2006 and
    the full year impact of awards granted in August 2005, while
    expenses related to bonus awards increased primarily due to
    performance. The slight organic increase reflected in CMG and
    Corporate was offset by a decrease at IAN and was primarily the
    result of higher salary costs to upgrade our talent and to
    support revenue initiatives and technology-related projects,
    increased incentive awards and bonus awards. This was partially
    offset by a decrease in severance expense, primarily at
    international locations within IAN, which we incurred in 2005
    due to client losses.

    Compared to 2004

Salaries and related expenses increased primarily due to an
    organic increase and changes in foreign currency exchange rates,
    partially offset by net divestitures, primarily at McCann during
    2005 and the sale of the Motorsports business during 2004. The
    organic increase was primarily the result of higher severance
    expense, largely recorded in the fourth quarter of 2005 for
    international headcount reductions within IAN as a result of
    client losses, the hiring of additional creative talent to
    enable future revenue growth, additional staff to address
    weaknesses in our accounting and control environment, and to
    develop shared services at certain locations.

Office
    and General Expenses

Office and general expenses include rent expense, professional
    fees, expenses attributable to the support of client service
    professional staff, depreciation and amortization costs, bad
    debt expense relating to accounts receivable, the costs
    associated with the development of a shared services center and
    implementation costs associated with upgrading our information

    include costs directly attributable to client engagements. These
    costs include

out-of-pocket

costs such as travel for client service professional staff,
    production costs and other direct costs that are rebilled to our

    Compared to 2005

Office and general expenses for 2006 declined as a result of
    significant reductions in professional fees, which decreased by
    $93.7, primarily for projects related to our restatement
    activities and internal control compliance that occurred in
    2005, lower production expenses, lower bad debt expenses and net
    divestitures, primarily due to the sale of several businesses at
    IAN during 2005. The decline in office and general expenses
    occurred in both segments as well as Corporate. Partially
    offsetting this decrease were higher rent expense and reduced
    foreign exchange gains on certain balance sheet items. The above
    items resulted in an organic decline which was primarily
    reflected at Corporate and IAN.

    Compared to 2004

Office and general expenses for 2005 increased as a result of an
    organic increase and changes in foreign currency exchange rates,
    partially offset by net divestitures, primarily at McCann during
    2005 and the sale of the Motorsports business during 2004. The
    organic increase was primarily the result of higher professional
    fees,

primarily at IAN and our Corporate group, driven by our ongoing
    efforts in internal control compliance, the 2005 Restatement
    process and the preliminary development, application and
    maintenance of information technology systems and processes
    related to our shared services initiatives.

Restructuring

Other
    Reorganization-Related Charges

Other reorganization-related charges primarily represent
    severance charges directly associated with two significant
    strategic business decisions: the merger of Draft Worldwide and
    Foote, Cone and Belding Worldwide to create a global integrated
    marketing organization called Draftfcb; and our realignment of
    our media business to meet evolving client needs. In addition,
    we have recorded lease termination charges in relation to the
    exit of certain properties for these strategic business
    decisions. These charges were separated from salaries and
    related expenses and office and general expenses as they did not
    result from charges that occurred in the normal course of
    business. We expect charges relating to these business decisions
    to be complete during the first half of 2007.

Restructuring
    Charges (Reversals)

We record charges and (reversals) primarily related to changes
    in assumptions in connection with lease termination and other
    exit costs and severance and termination costs for the 2003 and
    2001 restructuring programs. The 2003 program was initiated in
    response to softness in demand for advertising and marketing
    services. The 2001 program was initiated following the
    acquisition of True North Communications Inc. and was designed
    to integrate the acquisition and improve productivity. A summary
    of the net charges and (reversals) for the 2003 and 2001
    restructuring program is as follows:

During the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 net
    lease termination and other exit costs were primarily related to
    adjustments to management’s estimates to decrease the
    restructuring reserves as a result of changes in sublease rental
    income assumptions and utilization of previously vacated
    properties relating to the 2003 program by certain of our
    agencies due to improved economic conditions in certain markets.

During the year ended December 31, 2004 net lease
    termination and other exit costs were recorded primarily for the
    2003 restructuring program for the vacating of 43 offices
    located primarily in the U.S. and Europe. Charges were recorded
    at net present value and were net of estimated sublease rental
    income. These charges were partially offset primarily by
    management’s adjustments to estimates as a result of our
    negotiation of terms upon the exit of leased properties and for
    other reasons similar to those mentioned above for 2006 and
    2005. Severance and termination costs were recorded for a
    worldwide workforce reduction of approximately 400 employees.
    The restructuring program affected employee groups across all
    levels and functions, including executive, regional and account
    management and administrative, creative and media production
    personnel. These charges were partially



THE
    INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
    OPERATIONS — (Continued)

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)

offset by adjustments to management’s estimates to reduce
    the prior restructuring reserves primarily as a result of
    decreases in the number of terminated employees, change in
    amounts paid to terminated employees and change in estimates of
    related restricted stock payments and payroll taxes.

Long-Lived
    Asset Impairment and Other Charges

Long-lived assets include land, buildings, equipment, goodwill
    and other intangible assets. Buildings, equipment and other
    intangible assets with finite lives are generally depreciated or
    amortized on a straight-line basis over their respective
    estimated useful lives. When necessary, we record an impairment
    charge for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset
    exceeds the implied fair value. See Note 1 to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements for fair value determination
    and impairment testing methodologies.

The following table summarizes long-lived asset impairment and
    other charges:

IAN

— Our long-term projections, which
    were updated in the fourth quarter of 2006, showed previously
    unanticipated declines in discounted future operating cash flows
    due primarily to recent client losses at one of our domestic
    advertising reporting units. These discounted future operating
    cash flow projections indicated that the implied fair value of
    goodwill at this reporting unit was less than its book value,
    resulting in a goodwill impairment charge of $27.2.


IAN

— A triggering event occurred
    subsequent to our 2005 annual impairment test when a major
    client was lost by Lowe’s London agency and the possibility
    of losing other clients was considered a higher risk due to
    recent management defections and changes in the competitive
    landscape. This caused projected revenue growth to decline. As a
    result of these changes, our long-term projections showed
    declines in discounted future operating cash flows. These
    revised cash flows indicated that the implied fair value of
    Lowe’s goodwill was less than the related book value
    resulting in a goodwill impairment charge of $91.0 at our Lowe
    reporting unit.

IAN

— During the third quarter of 2005, we
    recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $5.8 at a reporting
    unit within our sports and entertainment marketing business. The
    long-term projections showed previously unanticipated declines
    in discounted future operating cash flows and, as a result,
    these discounted future operating cash flows indicated that the
    implied fair value of goodwill was less than the related book
    value.


IAN

— During the third quarter of 2004, we
    recorded goodwill impairment charges of $220.2 at The
    Partnership reporting unit, which was comprised of Lowe
    Worldwide, Draft Worldwide, Mullen, Dailey & Associates
    and Berenter Greenhouse & Webster (“BGW”).
    Our long-term projections showed previously unanticipated
    declines in discounted future operating cash flows due to recent
    client losses, reduced client spending, and declining industry
    valuation metrics. These discounted future operating cash flow
    projections indicated that the implied fair value of goodwill
    was less than the related book value. The Partnership was
    subsequently disbanded in the fourth quarter of 2004 and the
    remaining goodwill was allocated to the agencies within the
    Partnership based on the relative fair value of its component
    agencies at the time of disbandment.

CMG

— As a result of the annual impairment
    review, a goodwill impairment charge of $91.7 was recorded at
    our CMG reporting unit, which was comprised of Weber Shandwick,
    GolinHarris, DeVries, MWW Group and FutureBrand. The fair value
    of CMG was adversely affected by declining industry market
    valuation metrics, specifically, a decrease in the EBITDA
    multiples used in the underlying valuation calculations. The
    impact of the lower EBITDA multiples indicated that the implied
    fair value of goodwill was less than the related book value.

Motorsports
    Contract Termination Costs

We recorded a pre-tax charge of $113.6 during 2004 terminating a
    series of agreements with the British Racing Drivers Club and
    Formula One Administration Limited, which released us from
    certain guarantees and lease obligations in the United Kingdom.

Interest
    Expense

The increase in interest expense during 2006 was primarily due
    to increases in non-cash amortization of approximately $27.0.
    This included the amortization of fees and deferred warrant
    costs incurred as a result of the ELF Financing transaction,
    prior year benefit from the amortization of gains on terminated
    swaps and the amortization of the remaining costs associated
    with our previous committed credit agreement. Additionally, the
    increase was due to one-time fees associated with the exchange
    of our Floating Rate Notes in 2006. The

2006 year-over-year

comparison benefited from the fact that we did not incur waiver
    and consent fees similar to those incurred in 2005 for the
    amendment of the indentures governing our debt securities and
    our credit facility.

The increase in interest expense during 2005 was primarily due
    to waiver and consent fees incurred for the amendment of our
    existing debt agreements in 2005 and higher average interest
    rates on newly issued debt when compared to extinguished debt.

Interest
    Income

The increase in interest income during 2006 was primarily due to
    an increase in interest rates and higher average cash balances
    compared to the prior year.

The increase in interest income during 2005 was primarily due to
    an increase in average interest rates as well an increase in
    cash and cash equivalents primarily resulting from our
    Series B Cumulative Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock
    offering.

Loss on early extinguishment of debt

— In
    November 2006, we exchanged $400.0 of our 4.50% Convertible
    Senior Notes due 2023 (the “4.50% Notes”) for
    $400.0 aggregate principal amount of 4.25% Convertible
    Senior Notes due 2023 (the “4.25% Notes”). In
    accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”)
    Issue

No. 96-19,

Debtor’s Accounting for a Modification or Exchange of
    Debt Instruments

, this exchange is treated as an
    extinguishment of the 4.50% Notes and an issuance of
    4.25% Notes for accounting purposes because the present
    value of the remaining cash flows plus the fair value of the
    embedded conversion option under the terms of the original
    instrument differ substantially from the new instrument. As a
    result, we recorded a non-cash charge at issuance of $77.0,
    reflecting the difference between the fair value of the new debt
    and the carrying value of the old debt. The difference between
    fair value and carrying value will be amortized to interest
    expense through March 15, 2012, which is the first date
    holders may require us to repurchase the 4.25% Notes. This
    results in a reduction of reported interest expense of
    $14.4 per year in future annual periods. We also recorded a
    non-cash charge of $3.8 for the extinguishment of unamortized
    debt issuance costs related to the exchanged 4.50% Notes.

Gains (losses) on sales of businesses

— In
    connection with the 2005 sale of a European FCB agency, we
    released $11.1 into income in the fourth quarter of 2006. This
    primarily related to certain contingent liabilities that we
    retained subsequent to the sale, which were resolved in the
    fourth quarter of 2006. During the fourth quarter of 2005, we
    had net gains related to the sale of a McCann agency of $18.6,
    offset partially by a loss of $13.0 from the sale of a European
    FCB agency. In 2004, we had net losses related to the sale of 19
    agencies. The losses related primarily to the sale of a

U.S.-based

promotions agency, which resulted in a loss of $8.6, and a $6.2
    loss for the final liquidation of the Motorsports investment.

We have evaluated each asset held for sale and disposed entity
    on an individual and an aggregate basis to determine if they
    should be classified as a component of discontinued operations
    in our consolidated financial statements. We believe that the
    impact of these dispositions and assets held for sale are not
    material to our consolidated financial statements. These
    dispositions and assets held for sale, in the aggregate,
    provided income to continuing operations of $2.5 for the year
    ended December 31, 2006.

Vendor discount and credit
    adjustments

— These adjustments reflect the
    reversal of certain liabilities, primarily established during
    the 2005 Restatement, where the statute of limitations has
    lapsed or where negotiations with clients have resulted in
    concessions. We may have similar reversals in the future,
    although to a lesser extent than in 2006. We believe that
    presenting amounts realized due to lapses in the statute of
    limitations or concession settlements as other income or expense
    prevents the trend of operating results from being distorted.
    For further information on vendor discounts and credits see
    Notes 1 and 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Gains on sales of

available-for-sale

securities and miscellaneous investment
    income

— In the second quarter of 2006, we
    had net gains of $20.9 related to the sale of an investment
    located in Asia Pacific and the sale of our remaining ownership
    interest in an agency within The Lowe Group. In addition, during
    the third quarter of 2006, we sold our interest in a German
    advertising agency and recognized the related remaining
    cumulative translation adjustment balance, which resulted in a
    non-cash benefit of $17.0. In 2005, we had net gains of $8.3
    related to the



THE
    INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
    OPERATIONS — (Continued)

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)

sale of our remaining equity ownership interest in an agency
    within FCB, and net gains on sales of

available-for-sale

securities of $7.9, of which $3.8 related to appreciation of
    Rabbi Trust investments restricted for the purpose of paying our
    deferred compensation and deferred benefit arrangement
    liabilities.

Investment Impairments

— We recorded
    charges of $12.2 during 2005, primarily related to a $7.1
    adjustment of the carrying amount of our remaining
    unconsolidated investment in Latin America to fair value as a
    result of our intent to sell and $3.7 related to a decline in
    value of certain

available-for-sale

investments that were determined to be other than temporary.

We recorded investment impairment charges of $63.4 during 2004,
    primarily related to a $50.9 charge for an unconsolidated
    investment in a German advertising agency as a result of a
    decrease in projected operating results. Additionally, we
    recorded impairment charges of $4.7 related to unconsolidated
    affiliates primarily in Israel, Brazil, Japan and India, and
    $7.8 related to several other

available-for-sale

investments.

Litigation Reversals

— During 2004 the
    settlement of thirteen class actions under the federal
    securities laws became final and we agreed to pay $115.0,
    comprised of $20.0 in cash and $95.0 in shares of our common
    stock valued at $14.50 per share. We received insurance
    proceeds of $20.0, which we recorded as a reduction in
    litigation charges. We also recorded a reduction of $12.5
    relating to a decrease in the share price between the tentative
    settlement date and the final settlement date.

The tax provision for 2006 was primarily impacted by domestic
    losses, foreign profits subject to tax at different rates and
    losses in certain foreign locations where we receive no tax
    benefit due to 100% valuation allowances. Other factors included
    state and local taxes, the write-off of deferred tax assets from
    restricted stock, the release of valuation allowances,
    non-deductible financing costs and the reversal of previously
    claimed foreign tax credits.

The tax provision for 2005 was primarily impacted by an increase
    in valuation allowances, a non-deductible asset impairment,
    state and local taxes and the resolution of various income tax
    audits and issues.

Valuation
    Allowance

Under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    (“SFAS”) No. 109,

Accounting for Income
    Taxes

, we are required to evaluate the realizability of our
    deferred tax assets. SFAS No. 109 requires that a
    valuation allowance be recognized when it is more likely than
    not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be
    realized. In circumstances where there is significant negative
    evidence, establishment of valuation allowance must be
    considered. We believe that cumulative losses in the most recent
    three-year period represent significant negative evidence under
    the provisions of SFAS No. 109 and, as a result, we
    recognized a valuation allowance for certain deferred tax
    assets. The deferred tax assets for which an allowance was
    recognized relate primarily to tax credit carryforwards, foreign
    tax loss and U.S. capital loss carryforwards, which may not
    be realized in the future.

During 2006 and 2005, valuation allowances of $63.6 and $69.9,
    respectively, were recorded in continuing operations on existing
    deferred tax assets, each year’s loss and temporary
    differences. The total valuation allowance as of
    December 31, 2006 and 2005 was $504.0 and $501.0,
    respectively.

    INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)

During 2004, a valuation allowance of $236.0 was established in
    continuing operations on existing deferred tax assets and 2004
    losses with no benefit. The total valuation allowance as of
    December 31, 2004 was $488.6.

For additional information, see Note 9 to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements.

Segment
    Results of Operations

As discussed in Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements, we have two reportable segments as of
    December 31, 2006: IAN and CMG. We also report results for
    the Corporate and other group. As of December 31, 2005, we
    had an additional segment, Motorsports operations
    (“Motorsports”), which was sold during 2004 and had
    immaterial residual operating results in 2005.

On June 1, 2006, we announced we would merge two units
    included in our IAN segment, Draft Worldwide (“Draft”)
    and Foote, Cone & Belding Worldwide (“FCB”),
    to create a global integrated marketing organization. The new
    merged entity, Draftfcb, remains within the IAN segment.

The revenue decline in 2006 was a result of net divestitures,
    primarily from the sale of several businesses at Draftfcb and
    McCann in 2005, partially offset by an organic increase and
    changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The organic increase
    was driven primarily by McCann and Draftfcb, partially offset by
    decreases at Lowe and The Works, one of our independent
    agencies. The organic increase at McCann was the result of
    higher revenue from existing clients across domestic and
    international regions, primarily Asia Pacific and Latin America.
    McCann’s increase was primarily driven by digital, direct
    and event marketing services. The increase at Draftfcb was
    primarily the result of increased spending from existing clients
    partially offset by net client losses, primarily in 2005, across
    domestic and most international regions, primarily Europe, Asia
    Pacific and Latin America. The decrease at Lowe was primarily
    due to reduced spending by existing clients and net client
    losses, primarily in domestic locations in 2005. The revenue
    decrease at The Works, a dedicated General Motors resource, was
    primarily due to the loss of the General Motors U.S. media
    buying business in 2005.

The revenue decline in 2005 primarily resulted from organic
    revenue decreases and net divestitures, partially offset by
    changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The organic revenue
    decrease was primarily driven by declines at Deutsch and Lowe,
    partially offset by increases at Draftfcb and Mullen. The
    decline at Deutsch was due to client losses and reduced spending
    from existing clients domestically, partially offset by client
    wins. The decline

at Lowe was primarily driven by client losses and reduced
    spending from existing clients in their European offices, as
    well as reduced spending domestically. Draftfcb experienced
    growth mainly domestically due to client wins and increased
    spending from existing clients. Although McCann is a significant
    part of the business, they did not contribute considerably to
    the organic change in revenue year over year. The decrease due
    to net divestitures primarily related to the sale of small
    businesses at McCann and Draftfcb.

Operating income increased during 2006 due to a decrease in
    office and general expenses of $139.7, a decrease in salaries
    and related expenses of $99.2, partially offset by a decrease in
    revenue of $97.2. The primary drivers for our reduced office and
    general expenses related to lower production expenses of $46.4,
    reduced professional fees of $26.3 and lower bad debt expense of
    $22.2. The primary drivers for our reduced salaries and related
    expenses related to lower severance expense of $63.1 and
    decreased salaries of $42.0.

The organic segment operating income increase was driven
    primarily by increases at McCann, partially offset by net
    decreases at our independent agencies. The increase at McCann
    was due to higher revenue as discussed above in the revenue
    section and reduced office and general expenses and salaries and
    related expenses. Office and general expenses decreased due to
    lower production expenses, reduced professional fees in
    connection with accounting projects, such as those related to
    our restatement activities, and lower bad debt expenses.
    Salaries and related expenses decreased primarily due to reduced
    severance expense for headcount reductions that occurred in
    international locations in 2005 and reduced pension costs,
    partially offset by higher incentive and bonus awards due to
    improved performance. The net decline at our independent
    agencies was driven by decreased revenue, primarily at The
    Works, for the reasons mentioned above in the revenue section.

    Compared to 2004

A decrease in revenues of $71.4, an increase in salaries and
    related expenses of $202.3 and an increase in office and general
    expenses of $53.7 were the primary drivers that contributed to
    the decrease in operating income during 2005. IAN’s organic
    operating income decrease was primarily driven by McCann,
    Draftfcb, Lowe and Deutsch. The decrease at McCann was primarily
    caused by increased severance, temporary staffing costs, salary
    and related benefits and professional fees. Higher severance
    expense was the result of international headcount reductions.
    Temporary staffing and salary and related benefits were impacted
    by additional staffing necessary to address weaknesses in our
    accounting and control environment. Professional fees increased
    as a result of costs associated with the 2005 Restatement
    process and internal control compliance. The decrease at
    Draftfcb was due to higher salaries and freelance costs as
    additional staff were hired to service new clients and
    additional business from existing clients as well as increased
    severance costs reflecting headcount reductions at our
    international agencies. At Lowe, the decrease was primarily due
    to organic revenue decreases as compared to the prior year.
    Deutsch experienced organic revenue decreases as compared to the
    prior year, partially offset by lower salaries, related benefits
    and freelance costs due to client losses and reduced incentive
    compensation expense as a result of a reduction in operating
    performance. Also, operating income of most units was negatively
    impacted by higher professional fees to support the 2005
    Restatement process and internal control compliance.

Revenue growth was a result of organic revenue increases in the
    public relations and branding businesses domestically, which was
    due to higher revenue from existing clients. Additionally, there
    were organic revenue increases domestically in the sports
    marketing and events marketing businesses due to higher revenue
    from existing clients and client wins. The domestic increase was
    partially offset by declines at some CMG agencies that lost
    clients. Internationally, the decline related primarily to a
    decrease in the events marketing and sports marketing businesses
    caused by client losses. The international decrease was
    partially offset by increases in the public relations and
    branding businesses due to higher revenue from existing clients.

Revenue growth was a result of an organic revenue increase in
    the public relations businesses internationally and the sports
    marketing businesses domestically as a result of increased
    spending from existing clients and client wins. Domestically,
    the increase in the sports marketing businesses was offset by a
    decline in the events marketing businesses. Although revenue
    from the events marketing businesses declined domestically, they
    had an overall positive impact on our organic revenue increase
    due to international client wins. Partially offsetting this
    increase were the dispositions of two businesses in 2005 and
    three businesses in 2004.

    offset by a decrease in office and general expenses of $14.6 and
    an increase in revenue of $16.0. The primary driver for our

    salaries expense of $22.3 and the primary driver for our
    decrease in office and general expenses was lower production
    expenses of $19.8. The slight organic segment operating income
    decrease was due to decreases in the sports marketing businesses
    and other CMG agencies, offset by growth at the public relations
    and branding businesses. The decline in the sports marketing

businesses was due to revenue decreases due to client losses and
    increases in salaries and related expenses due to higher bonus
    awards related to improved domestic performance. The decrease in
    other CMG agencies was due to decreased revenue for the reasons
    described in the revenue section. Growth at the public relations
    businesses was driven by increased revenue, partially offset by
    higher salaries and related expenses from increased headcount to
    support the growth in the business. The increase at the branding
    businesses was driven primarily by higher revenue from existing
    clients.

    Compared to 2004

Operating income decreased due to an increase of $23.3 in salary
    and related expenses and an increase in office and general
    expenses of $15.8, partially offset by an increase in revenue of
    $8.4. The organic operating income decrease was primarily driven
    by increases in salary expense across all businesses due to
    increased headcount to address weaknesses in our accounting and
    control environment. The decrease was also attributable to
    increases in salary expenses in the public relations businesses
    to support revenue growth.

CORPORATE
    AND OTHER

    as well as certain other centrally managed expenses that are not
    fully allocated to operating divisions, as shown in the table
    below. The amounts allocated to operating divisions are
    calculated monthly based on a formula that uses the revenues of
    the operating unit. Amounts allocated also include specific
    charges for information technology-related projects, which are
    allocated based on utilization. See Note 15 to the

    divisions, partially offset by higher rent, depreciation and
    amortization and increased salaries and related expenses. We
    incurred lower professional fees for accounting projects, which
    included those related to our prior-year restatement activities.
    Higher rent, depreciation and amortization were due to
    software-related costs from our ongoing initiatives to
    consolidate and upgrade our financial systems, as well as to
    further develop our shared services. Salaries and related
    expenses increased due to higher headcount, primarily related to
    our technology initiatives, and for larger incentive
    compensation and bonus awards related to performance. Amounts
    allocated to operating divisions increased primarily due to the
    implementation of new information technology-related projects,
    the consolidation of information technology support staff, and
    the allocation of audit fees, which are now being allocated back
    to operating divisions.

    Compared to 2004

Corporate and other expenses increased primarily due to higher
    salaries and related expenses and professional fees. Salary

environment and to develop shared services. Professional fees
    increased due to costs associated with internal control
    compliance, costs associated with the 2005 Restatement process,
    and related audit costs. Amounts allocated to operating
    divisions increased primarily due to the implementation of new
    information technology-related projects and the consolidation of
    information technology support staff, the costs of which were
    not being allocated back to operating divisions in 2004.

LIQUIDITY
    AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

CASH
    FLOW OVERVIEW

Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities decreased by
    $234.4 to $1,957.1 during 2006 primarily due to fees associated
    with capital market activity, capital expenditures and working
    capital usage, partially offset by improved operating results
    and proceeds from sales of investments. Of this change,
    marketable securities decreased by $114.2. A summary of our cash
    flow activities is as follows:

Operating
    Activities

Cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to
    improved operating results during 2006, partially offset by
    working capital usage of $250.6. Working capital usages reflects
    changes in accounts receivable, expenditures billable to
    clients, prepaid expenses and other current assets, accounts
    payable and accrued liabilities. Media buying on behalf of our
    clients affects our working capital and operating cash flow. In
    most of our businesses, we collect funds from our clients which
    we use, on their behalf, to pay production costs and media
    costs. The amounts involved substantially exceed our revenues,
    and primarily impact the level of accounts receivable,
    expenditures billable to clients, accounts payable and accrued
    media and production liabilities in any given period for these
    pass-through arrangements. Our assets include both cash received
    and accounts receivable from clients for these pass-through
    arrangements, while our liabilities include amounts owed on
    behalf of clients to media and production suppliers. Generally,
    we pay production and media charges after we have received funds
    from our clients, and our risk from client nonpayment has
    historically not been significant.

During 2006, a reduction in accounts payable of $370.0 was
    partially offset by a reduction in accounts receivable of
    $235.4. The change in accounts payable includes a reduction of
    our vendor discount and credit liabilities established as part
    of the 2005 Restatement of $73.6, of which $53.1 was satisfied
    through cash payments. Cash used by changes in accrued
    liabilities of $21.4 was primarily the result of higher accrued
    media liabilities, offset by payments for professional fees
    primarily related to our prior year restatement activities.
    Accrued liabilities are also affected by the timing of certain
    payments. For example, while employee incentive awards are
    accrued throughout the year, they are generally paid during the
    first quarter of the subsequent year.

The net loss of $31.7 during 2006 includes non-cash items that
    are not expected to generate cash or require the use of cash.
    Net non-cash expense items of $294.4 primarily include the loss
    on early extinguishment of debt, long lived asset impairment and
    other charges, add-back of depreciation of fixed assets and the
    amortization of intangible assets, restricted stock awards and
    non-cash compensation, bond discounts and deferred financing
    costs.

Investing
    Activities

Cash provided by investing activities during 2006 primarily
    reflects net maturities of short-term marketable securities,
    capital expenditures, acquisitions and divestitures and
    purchases and sales of investments. The cash flows attributable
    to short-term marketable securities vary from one period to
    another because of changes in the



THE
    INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
    OPERATIONS — (Continued)

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)

maturity profile of our treasury investments. The net amount of
    these securities was $193.8 lower as of December 31, 2006
    compared to December 31, 2005. Cash provided by investing
    activities was also impacted by capital expenditures of $127.8,
    primarily related to computer hardware and leasehold
    improvements.

Financing
    Activities

Cash used in financing activities during 2006 reflects fees and
    costs of $90.1 that we incurred in connection with our financing
    transactions. This includes fees of $41.8 and call spread costs
    of $29.2 for our new credit agreement and related transactions
    in the second quarter. We incurred fees of $19.1 in the fourth
    quarter when we exchanged $400.0 of our 4.50% Convertible
    Senior Notes due 2023 for the same aggregate principal amount of
    our 4.25% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023 and when we
    exchanged all of our $250.0 Floating Rate Notes due 2008 for the
    same aggregate principal amount of Floating Rate Notes due 2010.
    These costs are being amortized in interest expense. In
    addition, $3.5 of fees, incurred as part of the Floating Rate
    Note exchange, were recorded in interest expense and will not be
    amortized.

Cash used in financing activities also included dividend
    payments of $47.0 on our Series A and Series B
    Preferred Stock.

LIQUIDITY
    OUTLOOK

We expect our operating cash flow, cash and cash equivalents to
    be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating requirements at
    a minimum for the next twelve months.

We believe that a conservative approach to liquidity is
    appropriate for our Company, in view of the cash requirements
    resulting from, among other things, high professional fees,
    liabilities to our clients for vendor discounts and credits, any
    potential penalties or fines that may have to be paid in
    connection with the ongoing SEC investigation, the normal cash
    variability inherent in our operations and other unanticipated
    requirements. In addition, until our margins consistently
    improve in connection with our turnaround, cash generation from
    operations could be challenged in certain periods.

A reduction in our liquidity in future periods as a result of
    the above items or other business objectives could lead us to
    seek new or additional sources of liquidity to fund our working
    capital needs. From time to time we evaluate market conditions
    and financing alternatives for opportunities to raise additional
    financing or otherwise improve our liquidity profile and enhance
    our financial flexibility. There can be no guarantee that we
    would be able to access new sources of liquidity on commercially
    reasonable terms, or at all.

Funding
    Requirements

Our most significant funding requirements include: our
    operations, non-cancelable operating lease obligations, capital
    expenditures, payments related to vendor discounts and credits,
    debt service, preferred stock dividends, contributions to
    pension and postretirement plans, acquisitions and dispositions
    and taxes.

Our non-cancelable lease commitments primarily relate to office
    premises and equipment. These commitments are partially offset
    by sublease rental income we receive under non-cancelable
    subleases.

Capital expenditures are primarily to upgrade computer and
    telecommunications systems and to modernize offices.

Of the liabilities recognized as part of the 2005 Restatement,
    we estimate that we will pay approximately $100.0 related to
    vendor discounts and credits, internal investigations and
    international compensation arrangements over the next
    12 months.

We have no significant scheduled amounts of long-term debt due
    until March 2008, when holders of our $400.0
    4.50% Convertible Senior Notes may require us to repurchase
    the Notes for cash at par.

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)

We pay annual dividends on each share of Series B Preferred
    Stock in the amount of $52.50 per share, or $27.6.
    Dividends on each share of Series B Preferred Stock are
    payable quarterly in cash or, if certain conditions are met, in
    common stock, at our option. See Note 12 to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

We have not paid any dividends on our common stock since
    December of 2002. The terms of our Series B Preferred Stock
    do not permit us to pay dividends on our common stock unless all
    accumulated and unpaid dividends on our Series B Preferred
    Stock have been, or contemporaneously are, declared and paid, or
    provision for the payment thereof has been made.

We make contributions to our pension and postretirement benefit
    plans throughout the year, as determined using actuarial methods
    and assumptions. For the years ended December 31, 2006 and
    2005, we made contributions of $42.7 and $34.1, respectively, to
    our domestic and foreign pension plans. For 2007, we do not
    anticipate making additional contributions to our domestic
    pension plans. We expect to contribute an additional $20.6 to
    our foreign pension plans.

Our capital requirements are affected by purchases and sales of
    agencies. From time to time we contemplate acquisitions that may
    require payment in cash or stock. In past years, deferred
    payments related to past acquisitions were a significant funding
    requirement for us, although these payments have decreased
    significantly in recent years as we have made fewer
    acquisitions. Under the contractual terms of certain of our past
    acquisitions we have long-term obligations to pay additional
    consideration or to purchase additional equity interests in
    certain consolidated or unconsolidated subsidiaries if specified
    conditions, mostly relating to operating performance, are met.
    Some of the consideration under these arrangements is in shares
    of our common stock, but most is in cash. For the years ended
    December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, we made cash payments
    related to past acquisitions of $22.9, $97.0 and $161.7,
    respectively. In relation to our contingent acquisition
    obligations, $7.8, $5.3 and $20.1 were recorded as compensation
    expense for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and
    2004, respectively.

We have various tax years under examination in various countries
    in which we have significant business operations. We do not know
    whether these examinations will, in the aggregate, result in our
    paying additional income taxes, which we believe are adequately
    reserved for.

FINANCING
    AND SOURCES OF FUNDS

Substantially all of our operating cash flow is generated by our
    agencies. Our liquid assets are held primarily at the holding
    company level, and to a lesser extent at our largest
    subsidiaries.

In recent years, we have obtained long-term financing in the
    capital markets by issuing debt securities, convertible debt
    securities and convertible preferred stock. We have also used
    bank borrowing facilities to provide us with liquidity for
    working capital needs. Our outstanding long-term debt, including
    convertible debt, is detailed in Note 10 to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements, and our convertible preferred
    stock is detailed in Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements. We also have two series of equity warrants
    outstanding. We have entered into call spread transactions in
    connection with one of the series of equity warrants. See
    Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

In 2006, we engaged in several transactions to improve our
    liquidity and debt maturity profile:

•

In June 2006, we replaced our existing $500.0 Three-Year
    Revolving Credit Facility, which would have expired in May 2007,
    with a new $750.0 Three-Year Credit Agreement (the “Credit
    Agreement”) as part of a capital markets transaction that
    we refer to as the “ELF Financing.”

•

In November 2006, we exchanged $400.0 of our
    4.50% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023 for the same
    aggregate principal amount of our 4.25% Convertible Senior Notes
    due 2023. This transaction extended the first date on which
    holders can require us to repurchase this portion of our debt
    for cash from 2008 to 2012. It also extended the second date on
    which holders can require us to repurchase this portion of our
    debt for cash, stock or a combination at our option from 2013 to
    2015.

•

In December 2006, we exchanged all of our $250.0 Floating Rate
    Notes due 2008 for the same aggregate principal amount of
    Floating Rate Notes due 2010. The new Floating Rate Notes bear
    interest at a per annum rate equal to three-month LIBOR plus
    200 basis points, 125 basis points less than the
    interest rate on the old Floating Rate Notes.

Also in December 2006, each share of our Series A Preferred
    Stock converted into 3.7037 shares of our common stock. We
    issued a total of 27.7 shares of common stock to holders of
    the Series A Preferred Stock. As a result of this
    conversion, future preferred stock dividend requirements will be
    lower.

ELF
    Financing

Under the Credit Agreement, a special-purpose entity called ELF
    Special Financing Ltd. (“ELF”) acts as the lender and
    letter of credit issuer. ELF is obligated at our request to make
    cash advances to us and to issue letters of credit for our
    account, in an aggregate amount not to exceed $750.0 outstanding
    at any time. The aggregate face amount of letters of credit may
    not exceed $600.0 at any time. The Credit Agreement is a
    revolving facility, under which amounts borrowed may be repaid
    and borrowed again, and the aggregate available amount of
    letters of credit may decrease or increase, subject to the
    overall limit of $750.0 and the $600.0 limit on letters of
    credit. We have not drawn on the Credit Agreement or our
    previous committed credit agreements since late 2003. We are not
    subject to any financial or other material restrictive covenants
    under the Credit Agreement. For additional information, see
    Notes 10 and 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Other
    Credit Facilities

In addition to the Credit Agreement, we have uncommitted credit
    facilities with various banks that permit borrowings at variable
    interest rates. We use our uncommitted credit lines for working
    capital needs at some of our operations outside the United
    States. There were borrowings under the uncommitted facilities
    made by several of our subsidiaries outside the United States
    totaling $80.3 and $53.7 as of December 31, 2006 and 2005,
    respectively. We have guaranteed the repayment of some of these
    borrowings by our subsidiaries. If we lose access to these
    credit lines, we would have to provide funding directly to some
    overseas operations. The weighted-average interest rate on
    outstanding balances under the uncommitted short-term facilities
    as of December 31, 2006 and 2005 was approximately 5% in
    each year.

Letters
    of Credit

We are required from time to time to post letters of credit,
    primarily to support our commitments, or those of our
    subsidiaries, to purchase media placements, mostly in locations
    outside the United States, or to satisfy other obligations.
    These letters of credit are generally backed by letters of
    credit issued under the Credit Agreement. The aggregate amount
    of outstanding letters of credit issued for our account under
    the Credit Agreement and our previous committed credit agreement
    was $219.9 and $162.4 as of December 31, 2006 and 2005,
    respectively. These letters of credit have historically not been
    drawn upon.

Cash
    Pooling

We aggregate our net domestic cash position on a daily basis.
    Outside the United States, we use cash pooling arrangements with
    banks to help manage our liquidity requirements. In these
    pooling arrangements, several Interpublic agencies agree with a
    single bank that the cash balances of any of the agencies with
    the bank will be subject to a full right of setoff against
    amounts the other agencies owe the bank, and the bank provides
    overdrafts as long as the net balance for all the agencies does
    not exceed an

agreed-upon

level. Typically each agency pays interest on outstanding
    overdrafts and receives interest on cash balances. Our
    Consolidated Balance Sheets reflect cash net of overdrafts for
    each pooling arrangement. As of December 31, 2006 and 2005
    a gross amount of $1,052.5 and $842.6, respectively, in cash was
    netted against an equal gross amount of overdrafts under pooling
    arrangements.

CREDIT
    AGENCY RATINGS

Our long-term debt credit ratings as of February 16, 2007
    were Ba3 with negative outlook, B CreditWatch negative and B
    with negative outlook, as reported by Moody’s Investors
    Service, Standard & Poor’s and Fitch Ratings,
    respectively. A downgrade in our credit ratings could adversely
    affect our ability to access capital and could result in more
    stringent covenants and higher interest rates under the terms of
    any new indebtedness.

Holders of our $400.0 4.50% Notes may require us to
    repurchase their Notes for cash at par in March 2008. These
    Notes will mature in 2023 if not converted or repurchased.


We have structured certain acquisitions with additional
    contingent purchase price obligations in order to reduce the
    potential risk associated with negative future performance of
    the acquired entity. All payments are contingent upon achieving
    projected operating performance targets and satisfying other
    conditions specified in the related agreements and are subject
    to revisions as the earn-out periods progress. See Note 18
    to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

We have not included obligations under our pension and
    postretirement benefit plans in the contractual obligations
    table. Our funding policy regarding our funded pension plan is
    to contribute amounts necessary to satisfy minimum pension
    funding requirements plus such additional amounts from time to
    time as are determined to be appropriate to improve the
    plans’ funded status. The funded status of our pension
    plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on
    invested assets, level of market interest rates and levels of
    voluntary contributions to the plans. Declines in long-term
    interest rates have had a negative impact on the funded status
    of the plans. For 2007, we do not expect to contribute to our
    domestic pension plans, and expect to contribute $20.6 to our
    foreign pension plans.

We have not included our deferred tax obligations in the
    contractual obligations table as the timing of any future
    payments in relation to these obligations is uncertain.

DERIVATIVES
    AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES

We periodically enter into interest rate swap agreements and
    forward contracts to manage exposure to interest rate
    fluctuations and to mitigate foreign exchange volatility. In May
    of 2005, we terminated all of our long-term interest rate swap
    agreements covering the $350.0 6.25% Senior Unsecured Notes
    and $150.0 of the $500.0 7.25% Senior Unsecured Notes. In
    connection with the interest rate swap termination, our net cash
    receipts were $1.1, which is recorded as an offset to interest
    expense over the remaining life of the related debt.

We have entered into foreign currency transactions in which
    various foreign currencies are bought or sold forward. These
    contracts were entered into to meet currency requirements
    arising from specific transactions. The changes in value of
    these forward contracts have been recorded in other income or
    expense. As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, we had contracts
    covering $0.2 and $6.2, respectively, of notional amount of
    currency and the fair value of the forward contracts was
    negligible.

The terms of the 4.50% Notes include two embedded
    derivative instruments and the terms of our 4.25% Notes and
    our Series B Preferred Stock each include one embedded
    derivative instrument. The fair value of these derivatives on
    December 31, 2006 was negligible.

OUT-OF-PERIOD

AMOUNTS

Year
    Ended December 31, 2006

During 2006, we recorded adjustments to certain vendor discounts
    and credits, contractual liabilities, foreign exchange, tax and
    other miscellaneous items which related to prior periods. For
    the year ended December 31, 2006, these adjustments
    resulted in a net favorable impact to revenue of $9.1, a net
    favorable impact to salaries and related expenses of $5.1, a net
    unfavorable impact to office and general expenses of $6.6 and a
    net favorable impact to net loss of $6.9. The operating income
    impact of these adjustments primarily affected our IAN segment.
    Because these changes are not material to our financial
    statements for the periods prior to 2006, for the quarters of
    2006 or for 2006 as a whole, we recorded these

out-of-period

amounts in their respective quarters of 2006. See also
    Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
    additional information.

Three
    Months Ended December 31, 2005

In the fourth quarter of 2005, we recorded adjustments to
    certain vendor discounts and credits, tax, and other
    miscellaneous items which related to prior periods. Because
    these adjustments were not material to our financial statements
    for the periods prior to 2005 or for 2005 as a whole, we have
    recorded them in the fourth quarter of 2005.

INTERNAL
    CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

We have identified numerous material weaknesses in our internal
    control over financial reporting, as set forth in greater detail
    in Item 8, Management’s Assessment of Internal Control
    Over Financial Reporting and Item 9A, Controls and
    Procedures, in this report. Each of our material weaknesses
    results in more than a remote likelihood that a material
    misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will
    not be prevented or detected. As a result, we have determined
    that our internal control over financial reporting was not
    effective as of December 31, 2006.

We are in the process of implementing remedial measures to
    address the material weaknesses in our internal control over
    financial reporting. We continue to have extensive work
    remaining to remediate our remaining material weaknesses. The
    magnitude of the work is attributable partly to our
    decentralized structure and the number of disparate accounting
    systems of varying quality and sophistication. We have developed
    a work plan with the goal of remediating all of the identified
    material weaknesses by the time we file our Annual Report on

Form 10-K

for the year ending December 31, 2007. There can be no
    assurance, however, as to when the remediation plan will be
    fully implemented and all the material weaknesses remediated.
    There also can be no assurance that new problems will not

    INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF

    OPERATIONS — (Continued)

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)

be found in the future. Until our remediation is completed, we
    will continue to incur the expenses and management burdens
    associated with the manual procedures and additional resources
    required to prepare our Consolidated Financial Statements.

OTHER
    MATTERS

SEC
    Investigation

The SEC opened a formal investigation in response to the
    restatement we first announced in August 2002 and the
    investigation expanded to encompass the 2005 Restatement set
    forth in our 2004 Annual Report on

Form 10-K

filed in September 2005. In particular, since we filed our 2004
    Annual Report on

Form 10-K,

we have received subpoenas from the SEC relating to matters
    addressed in our 2005 Restatement. We have also responded to
    inquiries from the SEC staff concerning the restatement of the
    first three quarters of 2005 that we made in our 2005 Annual
    Report on

Form 10-K.

We continue to cooperate with the investigation. We expect that
    the investigation will result in monetary liability, but because
    the investigation is ongoing, in particular with respect to the
    2005 Restatement, we cannot reasonably estimate the amount,
    range of amounts or timing of a resolution. Accordingly, we have
    not yet established any provision relating to these matters.

Review
    of Stock Option Practices

During the third quarter of 2006, at our recommendation, our
    Audit Committee retained independent counsel to review our stock
    option practices related to our current and prior senior
    officers for a

10-year

period beginning in 1996. We also performed a comprehensive
    accounting review that supplemented the review done by
    independent counsel. These reviews were completed during the
    fourth quarter of 2006. Based on these reviews, in the third
    quarter of 2006 we recorded a charge of $26.4 to accumulated
    deficit, a $23.3 credit to additional paid-in capital and a $3.1
    credit to other non-current liabilities. See Note 20 to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.

RECENT
    ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

See Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a
    complete description of recent accounting pronouncements that
    have affected us or may affect us.

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)

Item 7A.

Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

In the normal course of business, we are exposed to market risks
    related to interest rates and foreign currency rates. From time
    to time, we use derivatives, pursuant to established guidelines
    and policies, to manage some portion of these risks. Derivative
    instruments utilized in our hedging activities are viewed as
    risk management tools, involve little complexity and are not
    used for trading or speculative purposes.

Interest
    Rates

Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates
    relates primarily to our debt obligations. As of
    December 31, 2006 and 2005, 85.1% and 86.0% of our debt
    obligations bore interest at fixed interest rates. Accordingly,
    assuming the fixed-rate debt is not refinanced, there would be
    no impact on interest expense or cash flow from either a 10%
    increase or decrease in market rates of interest. However, there
    would be an impact on the fair market value of the debt, as the
    fair market value of debt is sensitive to changes in interest
    rates. For 2006, the fair market value of the debt obligations
    would decrease by $28.8 if market rates were to increase by 10%
    and would increase by $29.5 if market rates were to decrease by
    10%. For 2005, the fair market value of the debt obligations
    would have decreased by $27.7 if market rates increased by 10%
    and would have increased by $28.0 if market rates decreased by
    10%. For that portion of the debt that bore interest at variable
    rates, based on outstanding amounts and rates at
    December 31, 2006, interest expense and cash out-flow would
    increase or decrease by $2.3 if market rates were to increase or
    decrease by 10%, respectively. For that portion of the debt that
    bore interest at variable rates, based on outstanding amounts
    and rates at December 31, 2005, interest expense and cash
    out-flow would have increased or decreased by $2.1 if market
    rates increased or decreased by 10%, respectively. Interest rate
    swaps have been used to manage the mix of our fixed and floating
    rate debt obligations. In May 2005, we terminated all our
    existing long-term interest rate swap agreements, and currently
    have none outstanding.

Foreign
    Currencies

We face translation and transaction risks related to changes in
    foreign currency exchange rates. Amounts invested in our foreign
    operations are translated into U.S. Dollars at the exchange
    rates in effect at the balance sheet date. The resulting
    translation adjustments are recorded as a component of
    accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the
    stockholders’ equity section of our Consolidated Balance
    Sheet. Our foreign subsidiaries generally collect revenues and
    pay expenses in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar,
    mitigating transaction risk. Since the functional currency of
    our foreign operations is generally the local currency, foreign
    currency translation of the balance sheet is reflected as a
    component of stockholders’ equity and does not impact
    operating results. Since we report revenues and expenses in
    U.S. Dollars changes in exchange rates may either
    positively or negatively affect our consolidated revenues and
    expenses (as expressed in U.S. Dollars) from foreign
    operations. Currency transaction gains or losses arising from
    transactions in currencies other than the functional currency
    are included in results of operations and were not significant
    in the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005. We have not
    entered into a material amount of foreign currency forward
    exchange contracts or other derivative financial instruments to
    hedge the effects of adverse fluctuations in foreign currency
    exchange rates.

MANAGEMENT’S
    ASSESSMENT OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL
    REPORTING

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
    adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in

Rules 13a-15(f)

and

15d-15(f)

under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Internal
    control over financial reporting is designed to provide
    reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
    reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
    external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles in the United States of America
    (“GAAP”). We recognize that because of its inherent
    limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not
    prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any
    evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the
    risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in
    conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies
    and procedures may deteriorate.

To evaluate the effectiveness of our internal control over
    financial reporting, management used the criteria described in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission (“COSO”).

A material weakness in internal control over financial reporting
    is a control deficiency, or combination of control deficiencies,
    that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material
    misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will
    not be prevented or detected. In connection with
    management’s assessment of our internal control over
    financial reporting, we identified the following material
    weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting as
    of December 31, 2006.

1.

The Company did not maintain an effective control environment.
    Specifically, the Company did not maintain a sufficient
    complement of personnel throughout its worldwide offices with an
    appropriate level of accounting knowledge, experience and
    training in the application of GAAP commensurate with the
    Company’s financial reporting requirements. In addition,
    the Company did not maintain effective controls over the
    monitoring of its existing internal control activities over
    financial reporting and, instead, placed heavy reliance on
    manual procedures without sufficient review. Further, controls
    were not effective at ensuring employees’ acknowledgement
    of the Company’s Code of Conduct.

The material weakness described above has had a pervasive impact
    on the Company’s control environment and has contributed to
    the material weaknesses described below.

2.

The Company did not maintain effective controls over accuracy,
    presentation and disclosure in recording revenue. Specifically,
    controls were not designed and in place to ensure that customer
    contracts were authorized, that customer contracts were analyzed
    to select the appropriate method of revenue recognition and to
    identify contracts with client or vendor incentives and rebates,
    that amounts recorded were compared to amounts billed to
    clients, and that billable job costs were compared to client
    cost estimates to ensure that no amounts were owed to clients.
    In addition, controls were not designed and in place to ensure
    that revenue transactions were analyzed for appropriate
    presentation and disclosure of billable client pass-through
    expenses or for recognition of revenue on a gross or net basis.

3.

The Company did not maintain effective controls to ensure that
    certain financial statement transactions and journal entries,
    both recurring and non-recurring, were appropriately initiated,
    authorized, processed, documented, accurately recorded, and
    reviewed. This was evident in the following specific areas:

i.    accounts receivable transactions,
    expenditures and fees billable to clients;

ii.   fixed asset purchases, disposals and
    depreciable lives;

iii.  accounts payable and accrued liabilities;

iv.   employee and executive compensation and
    benefits;

v.    derivative instruments;

vi.   cash and cash equivalents, wire transfers,
    and foreign currency transactions;

vii.  equity investments in unconsolidated
    entities; and

viii. debt and equity transactions.

4.

The Company did not maintain effective controls over
    (1) the accounting for income taxes to ensure amounts are
    accurately recorded in accordance with GAAP, and (2) the
    reporting of income tax in the



statutory accounts or income tax returns for operations outside
    of the United States. Specifically, the Company did not have
    controls designed and in place to:

i.

analyze the income tax provision on the statement of operations,
    and deferred taxes on the balance sheet, to determine
    appropriate account balances for GAAP reporting;

ii.

reconcile income tax returns to the appropriate period income
    tax calculations;

iii.

identify income tax exposures and contingencies, including
    interest and penalties, in a timely manner; and

iv.

for non-U.S. operations only, maintain an accurate and current
    legal entity listing, and adhere to policy and procedures
    regarding compliance with local laws and regulations.

This deficiency resulted in audit adjustments to the 2006 annual
    consolidated financial statements, which impacted deferred
    income taxes, the provision for income taxes and other
    comprehensive loss.

5.

The Company did not maintain effective controls relating to the
    completeness and accuracy of local payroll and
    compensation-related liabilities in certain operations.
    Specifically, the Company did not have controls designed and in
    place to:

i.

identify instances where local reporting regulations and payroll
    tax withholding requirements were not met, or to identify
    compensation practices which were either not supportable under
    local law or were not fully in accordance with the
    Company’s policies and procedures; and

ii.

ensure that the underlying records support liabilities related
    to employee compensation, including an inventory of employee
    benefit plans, the calculation of pension liabilities and
    changes made to benefit plans which impact the Company’s
    compliance with certain employment and tax regulations.

6.

The Company did not maintain effective controls over the
    safeguarding of assets. Controls were not designed and in place
    to segregate responsibility and authority between initiating,
    processing and recording of transactions.

7.

The Company did not maintain effective controls over access and
    changes to the Company’s financial applications and data,
    and controls over spreadsheets used in the Company’s
    financial reporting process. Specifically, controls were not
    designed and in place to ensure that access to certain financial
    applications, data and spreadsheets at certain locations was
    adequately restricted to authorized personnel, and that changes
    to financial applications were documented and tested. Also,
    controls were not designed and in place to ensure that
    unauthorized modification of the data or formulas within
    spreadsheets would be prevented.

The control deficiencies described above could result in
    misstatements of account balances or disclosures that would be
    material to the annual or interim consolidated financial
    statements that would not be prevented or detected. Accordingly,
    management has concluded that each of the control deficiencies
    noted above constitutes a material weakness and that our
    internal control over financial reporting was not effective as
    of December 31, 2006.

Management’s assessment of the effectiveness of the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2006 has been audited by
    PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (“PwC”), our independent
    registered public accounting firm. PwC’s report is included
    in this Item 8.

REMEDIATION
    OF CERTAIN MATERIAL WEAKNESSES IN

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING DISCLOSED IN OUR

2005 ANNUAL REPORT ON

FORM 10-K

During the fourth quarter of 2006, there were changes in
    internal control that have materially affected, or are
    reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control
    over financial reporting.

Also, in relation to these changes in internal controls, during
    the fourth quarter of 2006, management completed its testing to
    validate the effectiveness of its remedial measures, and
    concluded that controls related to the remediation of certain of
    the material weaknesses previously disclosed in the 2005 Annual
    Report on

Form 10-K

were designed, in place and operating effectively for a
    sufficient period of time for management to determine that



the material weaknesses were remediated as of December 31,
    2006. Material weaknesses in the following areas were remediated:

•

the accounting for purchase business combinations and the
    completeness, accuracy and valuation of assets and liabilities
    recorded for compensatory earn-out and put arrangements and
    derivatives embedded within acquisition transactions;

•

the complete and accurate recording of leases in accordance with
    GAAP;

•

the accuracy and completeness of the processing and monitoring
    of intercompany transactions;

•

the reconciliation of financial statement accounts;

•

the analysis of certain financial statement accounts to value
    and record them in a timely, accurate and complete manner;

•

the period-end financial reporting process;

•

the documentation, testing and evaluation of controls at
    independent service providers, including those to which we
    outsource certain payroll processing services in North
    America; and

•

the communication of policies and procedures.

The changes to our internal control over financial reporting for
    each of the remediated material weaknesses were as follows:

•

For purchase business combinations, we have (i) implemented
    controls to ensure that our acquisition database, which is used
    to track all pending and completed acquisitions, properly
    reflects all information relevant to an acquisition, including
    the review sign-offs by appropriate personnel,
    (ii) developed new procedures to ensure the term sheet and
    acquisition agreements are circulated to and reviewed by the
    appropriate personnel in the Controllers, Corporate Development,
    Treasury and Legal departments, and (iii) instituted
    monthly meetings between the Corporate Controllers and Corporate
    Development departments to review the status of current and
    potential acquisitions. For compensatory earn-out and put
    arrangements or derivatives embedded within acquisition
    transactions, we implemented controls to require approval from
    our operating management, as well as members of our Corporate
    Controllers, Corporate Development and Tax departments, prior to
    the execution of the related agreement.

•

For leases, we centralized the review, recording and monitoring
    of lease accounting and reporting at one of our shared service
    centers. Also, we now require that our Accounting Policy group
    review the accounting for significant new or amended leases, the
    early termination of leases, and the exit of facilities under
    lease.

•

For intercompany transactions, we established a standard set of
    accounts, implemented standard processes around intercompany
    settlements and dispute resolution, and rolled out a
    company-wide intercompany matching tool designed to facilitate
    the identification and resolution of intercompany differences.
    Controls have been established to facilitate the timely review,
    resolution and elimination of intercompany balances and activity.

•

For account reconciliations, we implemented a web-based
    reconciliation and monitoring tool for certain accounts based on
    the risk, size and level of activity in accounts. Additionally,
    we performed extensive, mandatory training throughout the
    Company to ensure that personnel understood and adhered to the
    revised policies and procedures related to account
    reconciliations.

•

For account analyses, we implemented ongoing review procedures
    at the local, regional and consolidated reporting levels as part
    of the monthly closing process. We also performed extensive,
    mandatory training throughout the Company to ensure that
    personnel understood and adhered to the policies and procedures
    related to account analyses.

•

For the period-end financial reporting process, we hired
    personnel in the Corporate Controllers department possessing
    GAAP and SEC reporting knowledge and experience, and implemented
    procedures and controls, including closing schedules, checklists
    and revised reporting package schedules, to allow for the timely
    and accurate presentation and review of financial statement
    accounts and disclosures.

•

For independent service providers, we performed an inventory of
    outsourced processes and controls, and developed a standard set
    of user controls, assessment forms, and guidelines for
    determining whether outsourced work requires a service
    auditor’s report in accordance with Statement on Auditing
    Standards No. 70,

Service Organizations.

•

For the communication of and adherence to Company policies and
    procedures, our Chief Risk Officer distributed a summary of new
    or modified policies and procedures that have been posted to the
    Company’s Policy and Procedure website each quarter.
    Updated policies and procedures were prepared and



communicated, and training provided, in relation to all of the
    above material weaknesses remediated in the fourth quarter of
    2006.

ONGOING
    REMEDIATION OF MATERIAL WEAKNESSES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER
    FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006

Management initiated a comprehensive remediation program, aimed
    at remediating the material weaknesses disclosed in our 2005
    Annual Report on

Form 10-K

by December 31, 2007. Cross-functional teams were
    established to focus on the material weaknesses. Each team, led
    by the Corporate Controller, went through a comprehensive
    process to identify and assess the problems relating to the
    material weaknesses, outline and assess potential solutions,
    finalize recommended solutions, and create an implementation
    plan to improve financial controls and remediate the material
    weaknesses. During 2006, we combined multiple agency controller
    organizations by region, except in North America, into a central
    unit. Each region operates using a consistent methods and
    procedures manual, which is intended to provide uniform
    monitoring control of our agencies around the world. We also
    developed tools and documentation to apply uniform monitoring
    control standards throughout the organization. The regional
    teams also conduct site visits to various agencies to review
    results and perform monitoring procedures to ensure that the
    appropriate processes are followed. As discussed in the previous
    section, these actions and specific changes in internal control
    over financial reporting resulted in the remediation of certain
    material weaknesses during the fourth quarter of 2006.

We continue to have extensive work remaining to remediate our
    remaining material weaknesses. The magnitude of the work is
    attributable partly to our decentralized structure and the
    number of disparate accounting systems of varying quality and
    sophistication that we utilize across the Company. We have
    developed a work plan with the goal of remediating all of the
    identified material weaknesses by the time we file our Annual
    Report on

Form 10-K

for the year ending December 31, 2007. There can be no
    assurance, however, as to when the remediation plan will be
    fully implemented and all the material weaknesses remediated.
    There also can be no assurance that new problems will not be
    found in the future.

Common actions we have taken and continue to take, and which
    were instrumental in remediating certain material weaknesses
    during the fourth quarter of 2006, include:

•

new or enhanced policies, and methods and procedure guides;

•

revised work processes;

•

enhanced monitoring and communications;

•

new or enhanced templates and analytic tools;

•

training and skills development;

•

clarified accountabilities and structure; and

•

updated control procedures and test plans to reflect new
    policies, processes and procedures and evidenced implementation.

In addition, the following ongoing remedial actions continue to
    be implemented across our operating units:

•

Meetings with management of our financial and operating units to
    ensure their understanding of the procedures to be followed and
    requirements to be met prior to executing required internal
    management certification letters to accompany the financial
    statements they submit.

•

Continuing to formalize direct Corporate oversight of all
    financial personnel company-wide with accounting and
    control-related responsibilities.

•

Continuing a focused effort to establish controls to deter and
    detect fraud with significant oversight and input by our Board
    of Directors and Audit Committee, including, but not limited to,
    ensuring proper

follow-up

and resolution of whistleblowers’ assertions. We have
    communicated to our locations that an anonymous alert line is in
    place and is there to use if employees do not feel comfortable
    with communicating with their local management.

•

Establishing standard global documentation and testing
    requirements of internal controls over financial reporting to
    ensure consistency in the overall evaluation of internal
    controls within our operating units and to enable focused future
    remediation efforts related to our control deficiencies.

•

Implementing a new enterprise-wide resource-planning software
    system with continuing rollouts through early 2007. This
    implementation will allow for enhanced reporting of our results
    internally across the Company, and will also allow for numerous
    controls to be automated within the system.



•

Continuing the development of a shared services organization to
    consolidate various financial transactional functions to attain
    efficiencies and improve controls surrounding these activities.

•

Continuing to assess the accounting and finance personnel at our
    agencies. In some cases, we have already either replaced
    personnel or hired additional resources.

•

Updating and continuing to enhance accounting and
    finance-related policies and procedures.

•

Establishing revised quarterly reporting for tax accounts,
    updating and enhancing tax-related policies and procedures, and
    increasing tax training at regional and local levels. We also
    hired a team of professionals solely to ensure that the tax
    reporting information is being provided timely and accurately.

•

Engaging outside professional tax advisors to review the local
    income tax returns of each subsidiary outside of the
    U.S. prior to filing in order to ensure they are filed on a
    timely basis and are prepared in accordance with local law and
    regulations.

•

Requiring written approval of a corporate committee consisting
    of senior representatives of the human resources, tax, legal and
    accounting functions for any non-traditional employment
    arrangement or payroll practice. In addition, all existing
    non-traditional employment arrangements must be reviewed by
    senior agency financial executives and a formal plan proposed to
    eliminate those arrangements which are not supportable under
    local law and practice, as well as our policies and procedures.



REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To The Board of Directors and Stockholders of The Interpublic
    Group of Companies, Inc.

We have completed integrated audits of The Interpublic Group of
    Companies, Inc.’s 2006 and 2005 consolidated financial
    statements and of its internal control over financial reporting
    as of December 31, 2006 and an audit of its 2004
    consolidated financial statements in accordance with the
    standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
    (United States). Our opinions, based on our audits, are
    presented below.

Consolidated
    financial statements

In our opinion, the consolidated balance sheets and the related
    consolidated statements of operations, of cash flows, of
    stockholders equity and comprehensive loss present fairly, in
    all material respects, the financial position of The Interpublic
    Group of Companies, Inc. and its subsidiaries at
    December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005, and the
    results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
    three years in the period ended December 31, 2006 in
    conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
    United States of America. These consolidated financial
    statements are the responsibility of the Company’s
    management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
    consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We
    conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with the
    standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
    (United States). Those standards require that we plan and
    perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
    the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
    audit of financial statements includes examining, on a test
    basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
    financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used
    and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the
    overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
    audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

As discussed in Note 13 to the consolidated financial
    statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts
    for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans in
    2006.

Internal
    control over financial reporting

Also, we have audited management’s assessment, included in
    Management’s Assessment of Internal Control Over Financial
    Reporting appearing under Item 8, that the Company did not
    maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as
    of December 31, 2006, because the Company did not maintain:
    (1) an effective control environment; (2) effective
    controls over accuracy, presentation and disclosure in recording
    revenue; (3) effective controls to ensure that certain
    financial statement transactions and journal entries, both
    recurring and non-recurring, were appropriately initiated,
    authorized, processed, documented, accurately recorded, and
    reviewed; (4) effective controls over the accounting for
    income taxes to ensure amounts are accurately recorded in
    accordance with GAAP, and the reporting of income tax in the
    statutory accounts or income tax returns for operations outside
    of the United States; (5) effective controls relating to
    the completeness and accuracy of local payroll and
    compensation-related liabilities in certain operations;
    (6) effective controls over the safeguarding of assets; and
    (7) effective controls over access and changes to the
    Company’s financial applications and data, and controls
    over spreadsheets used in the Company’s financial reporting
    process, based on criteria established in

Internal
    Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
    (COSO). The Company’s management is responsible for
    maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting
    and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control
    over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express
    opinions on management’s assessment and on the
    effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit of internal control over financial
    reporting in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
    Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards
    require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
    assurance about whether effective internal control over
    financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. An
    audit of internal control over financial reporting includes
    obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial
    reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and
    evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal
    control, and performing such other procedures as we consider
    necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit
    provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting



includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to
    the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,
    accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions
    of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable
    assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
    preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally
    accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
    expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance
    with authorizations of management and directors of the company;
    and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention
    or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or
    disposition of the company’s assets that could have a
    material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

A material weakness is a control deficiency, or combination of
    control deficiencies, that results in more than a remote
    likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim
    financial statements will not be prevented or detected. The
    following material weaknesses have been identified and included
    in management’s assessment.

1.

The Company did not maintain an effective control environment.
    Specifically, the Company did not maintain a sufficient
    complement of personnel throughout its worldwide offices with an
    appropriate level of accounting knowledge, experience and
    training in the application of GAAP commensurate with the
    Company’s financial reporting requirements. In addition,
    the Company did not maintain effective controls over the
    monitoring of its existing internal control activities over
    financial reporting and, instead, placed heavy reliance on
    manual procedures without sufficient review. Further, controls
    were not effective at ensuring employees’ acknowledgement
    of the Company’s Code of Conduct.

The material weakness described above has had a pervasive impact
    on the Company’s control environment and has contributed to
    the material weaknesses described below.

2.

The Company did not maintain effective controls over accuracy,
    presentation and disclosure in recording revenue. Specifically,
    controls were not designed and in place to ensure that customer
    contracts were authorized, that customer contracts were analyzed
    to select the appropriate method of revenue recognition and to
    identify contracts with client or vendor incentives and rebates,
    that amounts recorded were compared to amounts billed to
    clients, and that billable job costs were compared to client
    cost estimates to ensure that no amounts were owed to clients.
    In addition, controls were not designed and in place to ensure
    that revenue transactions were analyzed for appropriate
    presentation and disclosure of billable client pass-through
    expenses or for recognition of revenue on a gross or net basis.

3.

The Company did not maintain effective controls to ensure that
    certain financial statement transactions and journal entries,
    both recurring and non-recurring, were appropriately initiated,
    authorized, processed, documented, accurately recorded, and
    reviewed. This was evident in the following specific areas:

i.

accounts receivable transactions, expenditures and fees billable
    to clients;

ii.

fixed asset purchases, disposals and depreciable lives;

iii.

accounts payable and accrued liabilities;

iv.

employee and executive compensation and benefits;

v.

derivative instruments;

vi.

cash and cash equivalents, wire transfers, and foreign currency
    transactions;

vii.

equity investments in unconsolidated entities; and

viii.

debt and equity transactions.

4.

The Company did not maintain effective controls over
    (1) the accounting for income taxes to ensure amounts are
    accurately recorded in accordance with GAAP, and (2) the
    reporting of income tax in the statutory accounts or income tax
    returns for operations outside of the United States.
    Specifically, the Company did not have controls designed and in
    place to:

i.

analyze the income tax provision on the statement of operations,
    and deferred taxes on the balance sheet, to determine
    appropriate account balances for GAAP reporting;

ii.

reconcile income tax returns to the appropriate period income
    tax calculations;

iii.

identify income tax exposures and contingencies, including
    interest and penalties, in a timely manner; and



iv.

for non-U.S. operations only, maintain an accurate and current
    legal entity listing, and adhere to policy and procedures
    regarding compliance with local laws and regulations.

This deficiency resulted in audit adjustments to the 2006 annual
    consolidated financial statements, which impacted deferred
    income taxes, the provision for income taxes and other
    comprehensive loss.

5.

The Company did not maintain effective controls relating to the
    completeness and accuracy of local payroll and
    compensation-related liabilities in certain operations.
    Specifically, the Company did not have controls designed and in
    place to:

i.

identify instances where local reporting regulations and payroll
    tax withholding requirements were not met, or to identify
    compensation practices which were either not supportable under
    local law or were not fully in accordance with the
    Company’s policies and procedures; and

ii.

ensure that the underlying records support liabilities related
    to employee compensation, including an inventory of employee
    benefit plans, the calculation of pension liabilities and
    changes made to benefit plans which impact the Company’s
    compliance with certain employment and tax regulations.

6.

The Company did not maintain effective controls over the
    safeguarding of assets. Controls were not designed and in place
    to segregate responsibility and authority between initiating,
    processing and recording of transactions.

7.

The Company did not maintain effective controls over access and
    changes to the Company’s financial applications and data,
    and controls over spreadsheets used in the Company’s
    financial reporting process. Specifically, controls were not
    designed and in place to ensure that access to certain financial
    applications, data and spreadsheets at certain locations was
    adequately restricted to authorized personnel, and that changes
    to financial applications were documented and tested. Also,
    controls were not designed and in place to ensure that
    unauthorized modification of the data or formulas within
    spreadsheets would be prevented.

The control deficiencies described above could result in
    misstatements of account balances or disclosures that would be
    material to the annual or interim consolidated financial
    statements that would not be prevented or detected.

These material weaknesses were considered in determining the
    nature, timing, and extent of audit tests applied in our audit
    of the 2006 consolidated financial statements, and our opinion
    regarding the effectiveness of the Company’s internal
    control over financial reporting does not affect our opinion on
    those consolidated financial statements.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that the Company
    did not maintain effective internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2006, is fairly stated, in all
    material respects, based on criteria established in

Internal
    Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the COSO.
    Also, in our opinion, because of the effects of the material
    weaknesses described above on the achievement of the objectives
    of the control criteria, the Company has not maintained
    effective internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2006, based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
    by the COSO

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)

Note 1:

Summary
    of Significant Accounting Policies

Business
    Description

The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc. and subsidiaries (the
    “Company”, “Interpublic”, “we”,
    “us” or “our”) is one of the world’s
    largest advertising and marketing services companies, comprised
    of communication agencies around the world that deliver custom
    marketing solutions on behalf of our clients. Our agencies cover
    the spectrum of marketing disciplines and specialties, from
    traditional services such as consumer advertising and direct
    marketing, to emerging services such as mobile and search engine
    marketing. With hundreds of offices in over 100 countries and
    approximately 42,000 employees, our agencies develop marketing
    programs that build brands, influence consumer behavior and sell
    products.

Restatements

In our 2005 Annual Report on

Form 10-K,

we restated our previously reported financial statements for the
    quarters ended March 31, 2005, June 30, 2005 and
    September 30, 2005. In our 2004 Annual Report on

Form 10-K,

we restated our previously reported financial statements for the
    years ended December 31, 2003, 2002, 2001 and 2000, and for
    the first three quarters of 2004 and all four quarters of 2003
    (the “2005 Restatement”).

Principles
    of Consolidation

The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of
    the Company and its subsidiaries, most of which are wholly
    owned. Investments in companies over which we do not have
    control, but the ability to exercise significant influence, are
    accounted for using the equity method of accounting. Investments
    in companies over which we have neither control nor the ability
    to exercise significant influence are accounted for under the
    cost method. All intercompany accounts and transactions have
    been eliminated in consolidation.

In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board
    (“FASB”) Interpretation No. 46,

Consolidation
    of Variable Interest Entities, an Interpretation of ARB
    No. 51

, along with certain revisions, we have
    consolidated certain entities meeting the definition of variable
    interest entities. The inclusion of these entities does not have
    a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Reclassifications

Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior period
    financial statements to conform to the current year presentation.

Use of
    Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
    America (“GAAP”) requires us to make estimates and
    assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
    liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
    at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts
    of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual
    results could differ from those estimates.

Revenue
    Recognition

Our revenues are primarily derived from the planning and
    execution of advertising programs in various media and the
    planning and execution of other marketing and communications
    programs. Most of our client contracts are individually
    negotiated and accordingly, the terms of client engagements and
    the bases on which we earn commissions and fees vary
    significantly. Our client contracts are complex arrangements
    that may include provisions for incentive compensation and
    govern vendor rebates and credits. Our largest clients are
    multinational entities and, as such, we often provide services
    to these clients out of multiple offices and across various
    agencies. In arranging for such services to be provided, it is
    possible for a global, regional and local agreement to be
    initiated. Multiple agreements of this nature are reviewed by
    legal counsel to determine the governing terms to be followed by
    the offices and agencies involved.

Revenue for our services is recognized when all of the following
    criteria are satisfied: (i) persuasive evidence of an
    arrangement exists; (ii) the price is fixed or
    determinable; (iii) collectibility is reasonably assured;
    and



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)

(iv) services have been performed. Depending on the terms
    of a client contract, fees for services performed can be
    primarily recognized in one of three ways: proportional
    performance, straight-line (or monthly basis) or completed
    contract.

•

Fees are generally recognized as earned based on the
    proportional performance method of revenue recognition in
    situations where our fee is reconcilable to the actual hours
    incurred to service the client as detailed in a contractual
    staffing plan or where the fee is earned on a per hour basis,
    with the amount of revenue recognized in both situations limited
    to the amount realizable under the client contract. We believe
    an input based measure (the ’hour’) is appropriate in
    situations where the client arrangement essentially functions as
    a time and

out-of-pocket

expense contract and the client receives the benefit of the
    services provided throughout the contract term.

•

Fees are recognized on a straight-line or monthly basis when
    service is provided essentially on a pro rata basis and the
    terms of the contract support monthly basis accounting.

•

Certain fees (such as for major marketing events) are deferred
    until contract completion as the final act is so significant in
    relation to the service transaction taken as a whole. Fees are
    also recognized on a completed contract basis when the terms of
    the contract call for the delivery of discrete projects
    (’milestone’ arrangements), if any of the criteria of
    Staff Accounting Bulletin (“SAB”) No. 104,

Revenue Recognition,

were not satisfied prior to job
    completion or the terms of the contract do not otherwise qualify
    for proportional performance or monthly basis recognition.

Depending on the terms of the client contract, revenue is
    derived from diverse arrangements involving fees for services
    performed, commissions, performance incentive provisions and
    combinations of the three. Commissions are generally earned on
    the date of the broadcast or publication. Contractual
    arrangements with clients may also include performance incentive
    provisions designed to link a portion of the revenue to our
    performance relative to both qualitative and quantitative goals.
    Performance incentives are recognized as revenue for
    quantitative targets when the target has been achieved and for
    qualitative targets when confirmation of the incentive is
    received from the client. Incremental direct costs incurred
    related to contracts where revenue is accounted for on a
    completed contract basis are generally expensed as incurred.
    There are certain exceptions made for significant contracts or
    for certain agencies where the majority of the contracts are
    project-based and systems are in place to properly capture
    appropriate direct costs.

Substantially all of our revenue is recorded as the net amount
    of our gross billings less pass-through expenses charged to a
    client. In most cases, the amount that is billed to clients
    significantly exceeds the amount of revenue that is earned and
    reflected in our financial statements, because of various
    pass-through expenses such as production and media costs. In
    compliance with Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”)
    Issue

No. 99-19,

Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an
    Agent

, we assess whether our agency or the third-party
    supplier is the primary obligor. We evaluate the terms of our
    client agreements as part of this assessment. In addition, we
    give appropriate consideration to other key indicators such as
    latitude in establishing price, discretion in supplier selection
    and credit risk to the vendor. Because we operate broadly as an
    advertising agency based on our primary lines of business and
    given the industry practice to generally record revenue on a net
    versus gross basis, we believe that there must be strong
    evidence in place to overcome the presumption of net revenue
    accounting. Accordingly, we generally record revenue net of
    pass-through charges as we believe the key indicators of the
    business suggest we generally act as an agent on behalf of our
    clients in our primary lines of business. In those businesses
    (primarily sales promotion, event, sports and entertainment
    marketing and corporate and brand identity services) where the
    key indicators suggest we act as a principal, we record the
    gross amount billed to the client as revenue and the related
    costs incurred as operating expenses. Revenue is reported net of
    taxes assessed by governmental authorities that are directly
    imposed on our revenue-producing transactions.

As we provide services as part of our core operations, we
    generally incur incidental expenses, which, in practice, are
    commonly referred to as

“out-of-pocket”

expenses. These expenses often include expenses related to
    airfare, mileage, hotel stays, out of town meals and
    telecommunication charges. In accordance with EITF Issue

No. 01-14,

Income Statement Characterization of Reimbursements Received
    for

‘Out-of-Pocket’

Expenses Incurred

, we record the reimbursements received for
    incidental expenses as revenue with a corresponding offset to
    expense.



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)

We receive credits from our vendors and media outlets for
    transactions entered into on behalf of our clients that, based
    on the terms of our contracts and local law, are either remitted
    to our clients or retained by us. If amounts are to be passed
    through to clients they are recorded as liabilities until
    settlement or, if retained by us, are recorded as revenue when
    earned.

Negotiations with a client at the close of a current engagement
    could result in either payments to the client in excess of the
    contractual liability or in payments less than the contractual
    liability. These items, referred to as concessions, relate
    directly to the operations of the period and are recorded as
    operating expense or income.

Concession income or expense may also be realized in connection
    with settling vendor discount or credit liabilities that were
    established as part of the 2005 Restatement. In these
    situations, and given the historical nature of these
    liabilities, we have recorded such items as other income or
    expense in order to prevent distortion of current operating
    results.

For certain of these credit liabilities where the statute of
    limitations has lapsed, we release such liabilities unless the
    liabilities are associated with customers with whom we are in
    the process of settling such liabilities. These amounts are
    reported in other income (expense).

Cash
    Equivalents

Cash equivalents are highly liquid investments, including
    certificates of deposit, government securities, commercial paper
    and time deposits with original maturities of three months or
    less at the time of purchase and are stated at estimated fair
    value, which approximates cost. Cash is maintained at
    high-credit quality financial institutions.

As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, we held restricted cash
    of $44.0 and $34.2, respectively, included in prepaid expenses
    and other current assets. Restricted cash primarily represents
    cash equivalents that are maintained on behalf of our clients
    and are legally restricted for a specified business purpose.

Short-Term
    Marketable Securities

We classify short-term marketable debt and equity securities as

available-for-sale.

Available-for sale securities are carried at fair value with the
    corresponding unrealized gains and losses reported as a separate
    component of comprehensive loss. The cost of securities sold is
    determined based upon the average cost of the securities sold.

Allowance
    for Doubtful Accounts

The allowance for doubtful accounts is estimated based on the
    aging of accounts receivable, reviews of client credit reports,
    industry trends and economic indicators, as well as analysis of
    recent payment history for specific customers. The estimate is
    based largely on a formula-driven calculation but is
    supplemented with economic indicators and knowledge of potential
    write-offs of specific client accounts.

Expenditures
    Billable to Clients

Expenditures billable to clients are primarily comprised of
    production and media costs that have been incurred but have not
    yet been billed to clients, as well as internal labor and
    overhead amounts and other accrued receivables which have not
    yet been billed to clients. Unbilled amounts are presented in
    expenditures billable to clients regardless of whether they
    relate to our fees or production and media costs. A provision is
    made for unrecoverable costs as deemed appropriate.

Investments

Publicly traded investments in companies over which we do not
    exert a significant influence are classified as

available-for-sale

and reported at fair value with net unrealized gains and losses
    reported as a component of other comprehensive loss.
    Non-publicly traded investments and all other publicly traded
    investments are accounted for on the equity basis or cost basis,
    including investments to fund certain deferred compensation and
    retirement obligations. We regularly review our equity and cost
    method investments to determine whether a significant event or
    change in circumstances has occurred that may have an adverse
    effect on the fair value of each investment. In the event a
    decline in fair value of an investment occurs, we determine if
    the decline has been other than



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)

temporary. We consider our investments strategic and long-term
    in nature, so we determine if the fair value decline is
    recoverable within a reasonable period. For investments
    accounted for using the equity basis or cost basis, we evaluate
    fair value based on specific information (valuation
    methodologies, estimates of appraisals, financial statements,
    etc.) in addition to quoted market price, if available. In the
    absence of other evidence, cost is presumed to equal fair value
    for our cost and equity method investments. Factors indicative
    of an other than temporary decline include recurring operating
    losses, credit defaults and subsequent rounds of financing with
    pricing that is below the cost basis of the investment. This
    list is not all-inclusive; we consider all known quantitative
    and qualitative factors in determining if an other than
    temporary decline in value of an investment has occurred. Our
    assessments of fair value represent our best estimates at the
    time of impairment review. See Note 4 for further
    information.

Land,
    Buildings and Equipment

Land, buildings and equipment are stated at cost, net of
    accumulated depreciation. Buildings and equipment are
    depreciated generally using the straight-line method over the
    estimated useful lives of the related assets, which range from 3
    to 7 years for furniture, equipment and computer software
    costs, 10 to 35 years for buildings and the shorter of the
    useful life or the remaining lease term for leasehold
    improvements. The total depreciation expense for the years ended
    December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 was $167.4, $167.3 and
    $178.3, respectively.

Goodwill
    and Other Intangible Assets

We perform an annual impairment review of goodwill as of
    October 1st of each year or whenever events or
    significant changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
    value may not be recoverable. We evaluate the recoverability of
    goodwill at a reporting unit level. We identified 14 reporting
    units for the 2006 annual impairment testing that are either the
    entities at the operating segment level or one level below the
    operating segment level. We review intangible assets with
    definite lives subject to amortization whenever events or
    circumstances indicate that a carrying amount of an asset may
    not be recoverable. Events or circumstances that might require
    impairment testing include the loss of a significant client, the
    identification of other impaired assets within a reporting unit,
    loss of key personnel, the disposition of a significant portion
    of a reporting unit, or a significant adverse change in business
    climate or regulations. Statement of Financial Accounting
    Standards (“SFAS”) No. 142,

Goodwill and
    Other Intangible Assets

, specifies a two-step process for
    goodwill impairment testing and measuring the magnitude of any
    impairment. The fair value of a reporting unit is estimated
    using traditional valuation techniques such as the income
    approach, which incorporates the use of the discounted cash flow
    method and the market approach, which incorporates the use of
    earning and revenue multiples. See Note 7 for further
    discussion.

Foreign
    Currencies

The financial statements of our foreign operations, when the
    local currency is the functional currency, are translated into
    U.S. Dollars at the exchange rates in effect at each year
    end for assets and liabilities and average exchange rates during
    each year for the results of operations. The related unrealized
    gains or losses from translation are reported as a separate
    component of comprehensive loss. Transactions denominated in
    currencies other than the functional currency are recorded based
    on exchange rates at the time such transactions arise.
    Subsequent changes in exchange rates result in transaction gains
    or losses, which are reflected within office and general
    expenses.

Credit
    Risk

Financial instruments that potentially subject us to
    concentrations of credit risk are primarily cash and cash
    equivalents, short-term marketable securities, accounts
    receivable, expenditures billable to clients, interest rate
    instruments and foreign exchange contracts. We invest our excess
    cash in investment-grade, short-term securities with financial
    institutions and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one
    counterparty. Concentrations of credit risk with accounts
    receivable are limited due to our large number of clients and
    their dispersion across different industries and geographical
    areas. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our clients and
    maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon the
    expected collectibility of all accounts receivable. We are
    exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the
    counterparties of foreign currency contracts. We limit our
    exposure to any one financial institution and do not anticipate
    nonperformance by these counterparties.

A downgrade in our credit ratings could adversely affect our
    ability to access capital and could result in more stringent
    covenants and higher interest rates under the terms of any new
    indebtedness.

    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)

Income
    Taxes

The provision for income taxes includes federal, state, local
    and foreign taxes. Income taxes are accounted for under the
    liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
    recognized for the estimated future tax consequences of
    temporary differences between the financial statement carrying
    amounts and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and
    liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to
    apply to taxable income in the year in which the temporary
    differences are expected to be reversed. We evaluate the
    realizability of our deferred tax assets and establish a
    valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that all or
    a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. See
    Note 9 for further explanation.

Earnings
    (Loss) Per Share

In periods when we generate income, we calculate basic Earnings
    Per Share (“EPS”) using the two-class method, pursuant
    to EITF Issue

No. 03-6,

Participating Securities and the Two-Class Method under
    SFAS Statement No. 128

(“EITF

03-6”).

The two-class method is required as our 4.50% Convertible
    Senior Notes and Series A Mandatory Convertible Preferred
    Stock (“Series A Preferred Stock”) qualify as
    participating securities, each having the right to receive
    dividends or dividend equivalents should dividends be declared
    on common stock. Under this method, earnings for the period
    (after deduction for contractual preferred stock dividends) are
    allocated on a pro-rata basis to the common shareholders and to
    the holders of participating securities based on their right to
    receive dividends. The weighted-average number of shares
    outstanding is increased to reflect the number of common shares
    into which the participating securities could convert. In
    periods when we generate a loss, basic loss per share is
    computed by dividing the loss attributable to common
    shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares and
    contingently issuable shares outstanding for the period. We do
    not use the two-class method in periods when we generate a loss
    as the 4.50% Convertible Notes and Series A Preferred
    Stock do not participate in losses.

Diluted earnings (loss) per share reflects the potential
    dilution that would occur if certain potentially dilutive
    securities or debt obligations were exercised or converted into
    common stock. The potential issuance of common stock is assumed
    to occur at the beginning of the year (or at the time of
    issuance of the potentially dilutive instrument, if later), and
    the incremental shares are included using the treasury stock or
    “if-converted” methods. The proceeds utilized in
    applying the treasury stock method consist of the amount, if
    any, to be paid upon exercise and, as it relates to stock-based
    compensation, the amount of compensation cost attributed to
    future service not yet recognized and any tax benefits credited
    to additional

paid-in-capital

related to the exercise. These proceeds are then assumed to be
    used by us to purchase common stock at the average market price
    during the period. The incremental shares (difference between
    the shares assumed to be issued and the shares assumed to be
    purchased), to the extent they would have been dilutive, are
    included in the denominator of the diluted EPS calculation.

Pension
    and Postretirement Benefits

We have pension and postretirement benefit plans covering
    certain domestic and international employees. We use various
    actuarial methods and assumptions in determining our pension and
    postretirement benefit costs and obligations, including the
    discount rate used to determine the present value of future
    benefits, expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and
    healthcare cost trend rates. On December 31, 2006 we
    adopted SFAS No. 158,

Employers’ Accounting
    for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans

(“SFAS No. 158”). SFAS No. 158
    requires, among other things, balance sheet recognition of the
    overfunded or underfunded status of pension and postretirement
    benefit plans. See Note 13 for further discussion.

Stock-Based
    Compensation

On January 1, 2006, we adopted SFAS No. 123
    (revised 2004),

Share-Based Payment

(“SFAS No. 123R”).
    SFAS No. 123R requires compensation costs related to
    share-based transactions, including employee stock options, to
    be recognized in the financial statements based on fair value.
    We implemented SFAS No. 123R using the modified
    prospective transition method. Under this transition method, the
    compensation expense recognized beginning January 1, 2006
    includes compensation expense for (i) all stock-based
    payments granted prior to, but not yet vested as of
    January 1, 2006, based on the grant-date fair value
    estimated in accordance with the original provisions of
    SFAS No. 123, and (ii) all stock-based payments
    granted subsequent to December 31, 2005 based on



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)

the grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with the
    provisions of SFAS No. 123R. Stock-based compensation
    expense is generally recognized ratably over the requisite
    service period, net of estimated forfeitures.

Prior to January 1, 2006, we accounted for stock-based
    compensation plans in accordance with the provisions of
    Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25,

Accounting
    for Stock Issued to Employees

(“APB No. 25”),
    as permitted by SFAS No. 123, and accordingly did not
    recognize compensation expense for the issuance of stock options
    with an exercise price equal or greater than the market price at
    the date of grant. However, see Note 20 for detail of our
    review of our stock option practices. In addition, our previous
    Employee Stock Purchase Plan (’ESPP’) was not
    considered compensatory under APB No. 25 and, therefore, no
    expense was required to be recognized. Compensation expense was
    previously recognized for restricted stock, restricted stock
    units, performance-based stock and share appreciation
    performance-based units. The effect of forfeitures on restricted
    stock, restricted stock units and performance-based stock was
    recognized when such forfeitures occurred. See Note 14 for
    further discussion.

Note 2:

Restructuring

Other
    Reorganization-Related Charges

Other reorganization-related charges primarily represent
    severance charges directly associated with two significant
    strategic business decisions: the merger of Draft Worldwide and
    Foote, Cone and Belding Worldwide to create a global integrated
    marketing organization called Draftfcb; and our realignment of
    our media business to meet evolving client needs. In addition,
    we have recorded lease termination charges in relation to the
    exit of certain properties for these strategic business
    decisions. These charges were separated from salaries and
    related expenses and office and general expenses as they did not
    result from charges that occurred in the normal course of
    business.

Restructuring
    Charges (Reversals)

We record charges and (reversals) primarily related to changes
    in assumptions in connection with lease termination and other
    exit costs and severance and termination costs for the 2003 and
    2001 restructuring programs. Included in net charges and
    (reversals) for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and
    2004 are adjustments resulting from changes in management’s
    estimates. Severance amounts incurred outside the parameters of
    our restructuring programs are recorded in the financial
    statements when they become both probable and estimable. With
    the exception of medical and dental benefits paid to employees
    who are on long-term disability, we do not establish liabilities
    associated with ongoing post-employment benefits that may vest
    or accumulate as the employee provides service as we cannot
    reasonably predict what our future experience will be. See
    Note 13 for further discussion.

The 2003 program was initiated in response to softness in demand
    for advertising and marketing services. The 2001 program was
    initiated following the acquisition of True North Communications
    Inc. and was designed to integrate the acquisition and improve
    productivity. Since their inception, total net charges for the
    2003 and 2001 programs were $221.9 and $644.8, respectively.
    Substantially all activities under the 2003 and 2001 programs
    have been completed. In addition to amounts recorded as
    restructuring charges, we recorded charges of $11.1 during 2004
    related to the accelerated amortization of leasehold
    improvements on properties included in the 2003 program. These
    charges were included in office and general expenses.

During the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 net
    lease termination and other exit costs were primarily related to
    adjustments to management’s estimates to decrease the
    restructuring reserves as a result of changes in sublease rental
    income assumptions and utilization of previously vacated
    properties by certain of our agencies due to improved economic
    conditions in certain markets.

During the year ended December 31, 2004 net lease
    termination and other exit costs were recorded for the vacating
    of 43 offices located primarily in the U.S. and Europe. Charges
    were recorded at net present value and were net of estimated
    sublease rental income. These charges were partially offset
    primarily by management’s adjustments to estimates as a
    result of our negotiation of terms upon the exit of leased
    properties and for reasons similar to those mentioned above for
    2006 and 2005. Severance and termination costs were recorded for
    a worldwide workforce reduction of approximately 400 employees.
    The restructuring program affected employee groups across all
    levels and functions, including executive, regional and account
    management and administrative, creative and media production
    personnel. These charges were partially offset by adjustments to
    management’s estimates to reduce the prior restructuring
    reserves primarily as a result of decreases in the number of
    terminated employees, change in amounts paid to terminated
    employees and change in estimates of related restricted stock
    payments and payroll taxes.

Note 3:

Acquisitions
    and Dispositions

Acquisitions

The majority of our acquisitions include an initial payment at
    the time of closing and provide for additional contingent
    purchase price payments over a specified time. The initial
    purchase price of an acquisition is allocated to identifiable
    assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on estimated fair
    values with any excess being recorded as goodwill and other
    intangible assets. These contingent payments, which are also
    known as “earn-outs” and “put options,” are
    calculated based on estimates of the future financial
    performance of the acquired entity, the timing of the exercise
    of these rights, changes in foreign currency exchange rates and
    other factors. Earn-outs and put options are recorded within the
    financial statements as an increase to goodwill and other
    intangible assets once the terms and conditions of the
    contingent acquisition obligations have been met and the
    consideration is determinable and distributable, or expensed as
    compensation in our Consolidated Statements of Operations based
    on the acquisition agreement and the terms and conditions of
    employment for the former owners of the acquired businesses.

Cash paid and stock issued for acquisitions are comprised of:
    (i) contingent payments as described above;
    (ii) further investments in companies in which we already
    have an ownership interest; and (iii) other payments
    related to loan notes and guaranteed deferred payments that have
    been previously recognized on the balance sheet.

We did not complete any acquisitions during 2006 and 2005. We
    completed two acquisitions during 2004, which were not
    significant on an individual basis. The results of operations of
    these acquired companies were included in our consolidated
    results from the date of close of the transaction. Cash paid and
    stock issued in 2006 were primarily recorded as an increase to
    goodwill and other intangible assets and related primarily to
    acquisitions that were completed prior to December 31,
    2000. We made stock payments related to acquisitions initiated
    in prior years of $11.3, $12.9 and $23.8 during 2006, 2005 and
    2004, respectively.

Dispositions

Motorsports

— On January 12, 2004, we
    completed the sale of a business comprising the four Motorsports
    circuits, including Brands Hatch, Oulton Park, Cadwell Park and
    Snetterton (the “four owned circuits”), owned by our
    Brands Hatch subsidiaries, to MotorSport Vision Limited. The
    consideration for the sale was approximately $26.0.

On April 19, 2004, we reached an agreement with the Formula
    One Administration Limited (“FOA”) to terminate and
    release our respective guarantee and promoter obligations
    relating to the British Grand Prix held at the Silverstone
    racetrack in the United Kingdom (“U.K.”). Under this
    agreement, we were released from our obligations following the
    British Grand Prix in July 2004. In exchange for the early
    termination of the obligations and liabilities, we paid a total
    of $93.0 to the FOA in two installments of $46.5 each on
    April 19, 2004 and May 24, 2004. A pre-tax charge of
    $80.0 was recorded in Motorsports contract termination costs
    related to this transaction during the second quarter of 2004.

On July 1, 2004, the British Racing Drivers Club
    (“BRDC”) agreed to vary the terms of the lease
    agreement relating to the Silverstone race track and we entered
    into a series of agreements regarding the potential termination
    of our remaining Motorsports obligations in the U.K. These
    agreements gave us the right to terminate our lease obligations
    at the Silverstone race track and related agreements, which we
    exercised on November 1, 2004. In connection with these
    agreements, we paid the BRDC approximately $49.0 in three
    installments during 2004. As a result of these agreements, we
    recorded a pre-tax charge in the third quarter of 2004 of $33.6
    in Motorsports contract termination costs. The payments also
    include $5.5 in office and general expenses reflecting the
    amount of lease expense associated with our continued use of the
    leased property through the third and fourth quarters of 2004.
    We have exited this business and do not anticipate any
    additional material charges. Total Motorsports charges consist
    of long-lived asset impairment and other charges of $3.0 and
    contract termination costs of $113.6 for the year ended
    December 31, 2004.

NFO

— In July 2004, we received $10.0 from
    Taylor Nelson Sofres plc (“TNS”) as a final payment
    with respect to the sale of NFO, which resulted in a $6.5 gain,
    net of tax. We established reserves for certain income tax
    contingencies with respect to the determination of our tax basis
    in NFO for income tax purposes at the time of the disposition of
    NFO. During the fourth quarter of 2005, $9.0 of these reserves
    were reversed, as the related income tax contingencies were no
    longer considered probable based on our preliminary review of
    our tax basis. The results of NFO are classified as discontinued
    operations in accordance with SFAS No. 144,

Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived
    Assets

, and, accordingly, the results of operations and cash
    flows have been removed from our results of continuing
    operations and cash flows for prior periods.

In connection with the disposition of our NFO World Group Inc.
    (“NFO”) operations in the fourth quarter of 2003, we
    established a reserve for certain income tax contingencies with
    respect to the determination of our tax basis in NFO for income
    tax purposes. During the third quarter of 2006 we received a
    final study of the tax basis of our investment, and we
    determined that the remaining reserve of $5.0 should be reversed
    as the related contingency is no longer considered probable. The
    amount was reversed through income from discontinued operations
    for the year ended December 31, 2006.

    Restatement Liabilities

As part of the 2005 Restatement, we recognized liabilities
    related to vendor discounts and credits where we had a
    contractual or legal obligation to rebate such amounts to our
    clients or vendors. Reductions to these liabilities are
    primarily achieved through settlements with clients and vendors
    but also may occur if a statute of limitations in a jurisdiction
    has lapsed. For the year ended December 31, 2006, we
    satisfied $59.1 of these liabilities through cash payments of
    $53.1 and reductions of certain client receivables of $6.0. The
    remaining decline was primarily through the release of
    liabilities due to the lapse of the respective statutes of
    limitations.

Loss on early extinguishment of debt

— In
    November 2006, we retired $400.0 of our 4.50% Convertible
    Senior Notes due 2023 in connection with the issuance of $400.0
    aggregate principal amount of 4.25% Convertible Senior
    Notes due 2023 and as a result we recorded non-cash charges of
    $80.8. See Note 10 for further discussion.

Gains (losses) on sales of businesses

— In
    connection with the 2005 sale of a European FCB agency, we
    released $11.1 into income in the fourth quarter of 2006. This
    primarily related to certain contingent liabilities that we
    retained subsequent to the sale, which were resolved in the
    fourth quarter of 2006. During the fourth quarter of 2005, we
    had net gains related to the sale of a McCann agency of $18.6,
    offset partially by a loss of $13.0 from the sale of a European
    FCB agency. In 2004, we had net losses related to the sale of 19
    agencies. The losses related primarily to the sale of a

U.S.-based

promotions agency, which resulted in a loss of $8.6, and a $6.2
    loss for the final liquidation of the Motorsports investment.

Vendor discount and credit adjustments

— These
    adjustments reflect the reversal of certain liabilities,
    primarily established during the 2005 Restatement, where the
    statute of limitations has lapsed or where negotiations with
    clients have resulted in concessions. We believe that presenting
    amounts realized due to lapses in the statute of limitations or
    concession settlements as other income or expense prevents the
    trend of operating results from being distorted.

Gains on sales of

available-for-sale

securities and miscellaneous investment income

—
    In the second quarter of 2006, we had net gains of $20.9 related
    to the sale of an investment located in Asia Pacific and the
    sale of our remaining ownership interest in an agency within The
    Lowe Group. In addition, during the third quarter of 2006, we
    sold our interest in a German advertising agency and recognized
    the related remaining cumulative translation adjustment balance,
    which resulted in a non-cash benefit of $17.0. In 2005, we had
    net gains of $8.3 related to the sale of our remaining equity
    ownership interest in an agency within FCB, and net gains on
    sales of

available-for-sale

securities of $7.9, of which $3.8 related to appreciation of
    Rabbi Trust investments restricted for the purpose of paying our
    deferred compensation and deferred benefit arrangement
    liabilities.

Investment Impairments

— We recorded investment
    impairment charges of $12.2 during 2005, primarily related to a
    $7.1 adjustment of the carrying amount of our remaining
    unconsolidated investment in Latin America to



NOTES TO

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)

fair value as a result of our intent to sell and $3.7 related to
    a decline in value of certain

available-for-sale

investments that were determined to be other than temporary.

We recorded investment impairment charges of $63.4 during 2004,
    primarily related to a $50.9 charge for an unconsolidated
    investment in a German advertising agency as a result of a
    decrease in projected operating results. Additionally, we
    recorded impairment charges of $4.7 related to unconsolidated
    affiliates primarily in Israel, Brazil, Japan and India, and
    $7.8 related to several other

available-for-sale

investments.

Litigation Reversals

— During 2004 the
    settlement of thirteen class actions under the federal
    securities laws became final and we agreed to pay $115.0,
    comprised of $20.0 in cash and $95.0 in shares of our common
    stock valued at $14.50 per share. We received insurance
    proceeds of $20.0, which we recorded as a reduction in
    litigation charges. We also recorded a reduction of $12.5
    relating to a decrease in the share price between the tentative
    settlement date and the final settlement date.

These options represent what is outstanding at the end of the
    respective year. At the point that the exercise price is less
    than the average market price, these options have the potential
    to be dilutive and application of the treasury stock method
    would reduce this amount.

The potential dilutive impact of

    exercise prices of the warrants. See Note 11 for further
    discussion.

There were an additional 6.2, 3.3 and 3.0 outstanding options to

Goodwill
    and Other Intangible Assets

Goodwill

Goodwill is the excess purchase price remaining from an
    acquisition after an allocation of purchase price has been made
    to identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on
    estimated fair values. In order to determine the fair value of
    net assets for new agency acquisitions, valuations are performed
    based on several factors, including the type of service offered,
    competitive market position, brand reputation and geographic
    coverage. Considering the characteristics of advertising,
    specialized marketing and communication services companies, our
    acquisitions usually do not have significant amounts of tangible
    assets as the principal asset we typically acquire is creative
    talent. As a result, a substantial portion of the purchase price
    is allocated to goodwill. Subsequent changes to goodwill include
    both current year and deferred payments related to acquisitions.
    We perform an annual impairment review of goodwill as of
    October 1st or whenever events or significant changes
    in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be
    recoverable.

    lists. Intangible assets with definitive lives subject to
    amortization are amortized on a straight-line basis with
    estimated useful lives of up to 15 years. The total
    amortization expense for the years ended December 31, 2006,
    2005 and 2004 was $6.2, $1.5 and $6.8, respectively. The

    amount that the carrying value of the asset exceeds the implied
    fair value.

IAN

— Our long-term projections, which were
    updated in the fourth quarter of 2006, showed previously
    unanticipated declines in discounted future operating cash flows
    due primarily to recent client losses at one of our domestic
    advertising reporting units. These discounted future operating
    cash flow projections indicated that the



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)

implied fair value of the goodwill at this reporting unit was
    less than its book value resulting in a goodwill impairment
    charge of $27.2.


IAN

— A triggering event occurred subsequent to
    our 2005 annual impairment test when a major client was lost by
    Lowe’s London agency and the possibility of losing other
    clients was considered a higher risk due to recent management
    defections and changes in the competitive landscape. This caused
    projected revenue growth to decline. As a result of these
    changes, our long-term projections showed declines in discounted
    future operating cash flows. These revised cash flows indicated
    that the implied fair value of Lowe’s goodwill was less
    than the related book value resulting in a goodwill impairment
    charge of $91.0 at our Lowe reporting unit.

IAN

— During the third quarter of 2005, we
    recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $5.8 at a reporting
    unit within our sports and entertainment marketing business. The
    long-term projections showed previously unanticipated declines
    in discounted future operating cash flows and, as a result,
    these discounted future operating cash flows indicated that the
    implied fair value of goodwill was less than the related book
    value.


IAN

— During the third quarter of 2004, we
    recorded goodwill impairment charges of $220.2 at The
    Partnership reporting unit, which was comprised of Lowe
    Worldwide, Draft Worldwide, Mullen, Dailey & Associates
    and Berenter Greenhouse & Webster (“BGW”).
    Our long-term projections showed previously unanticipated
    declines in discounted future operating cash flows due to recent
    client losses, reduced client spending and declining industry
    valuation metrics. These discounted future operating cash flow
    projections indicated that the implied fair value of goodwill
    was less than the related book value. The Partnership was
    subsequently disbanded in the fourth quarter of 2004 and the
    remaining goodwill was allocated to the agencies within the
    Partnership based on the relative fair value of the agencies at
    the time of disbandment.

CMG

— As a result of the annual impairment
    review, a goodwill impairment charge of $91.7 was recorded at
    our CMG reporting unit, which was comprised of Weber Shandwick,
    GolinHarris, DeVries, MWW Group and FutureBrand. The fair value
    of CMG was adversely affected by declining industry market
    valuation metrics, specifically, a decrease in the EBITDA
    multiples used in the underlying valuation calculations. The
    impact of the lower EBITDA multiples indicated that the implied
    fair value of goodwill was less than the related book value.

Our effective tax rate was negatively impacted by foreign

    foreign locations where we receive no tax benefit due to 100%
    valuation allowances. The difference between the effective tax
    rate and the statutory federal rate of 35% is also due to state
    and local taxes, the write-off of deferred tax assets from
    restricted stock, the release of valuation allowances,
    non-deductible financing costs and the reversal of previously
    claimed foreign tax credits.

Valuation

As required by SFAS No. 109,

Accounting for Income
    Tax

(“SFAS No. 109”)

,

we evaluate
    on a quarterly basis the realizability of our deferred tax
    assets. SFAS No. 109 requires a valuation allowance to
    be established when it is more likely than not that all or a
    portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. In
    circumstances where there is sufficient negative evidence,
    establishment of a valuation allowance must be considered. We
    believe that cumulative losses in the most recent three-year
    period represent sufficient negative evidence under the
    provisions of SFAS No. 109, and as a result, we
    determined that certain of our deferred tax assets required the
    establishment of a valuation allowance. The deferred tax assets
    for which an allowance was recognized relate primarily to tax
    credit carryforwards, foreign tax loss and U.S. capital
    loss carryforwards.

The valuation allowance is $504.0 and $501.0 at
    December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The change during
    2006 in the deferred tax valuation allowance relates to
    uncertainties regarding future utilization of tax loss
    carryforwards, offset primarily by reversals of $45.0 of
    valuation allowances in two European countries where we believe
    that it is now more likely than not that those tax loss
    carryforwards will be utilized. In addition, we believe that it
    is more likely than not that approximately $29.0 of U.S. capital
    loss carryforwards and $17.0 of foreign tax credits will not be
    utilized. We also wrote off previously reserved for deferred tax
    assets that were deemed to be permanently unrealizable due to
    the expiration of tax loss carryforwards and sales of certain
    businesses.

At December 31, 2006, there are $68.6 of tax credit
    carryforwards with expiration periods beginning in 2009 and
    ending in 2013. There are also $1,521.8 of loss carryforwards,
    of which $571.9 are U.S. capital and tax loss carryforwards
    that expire in the years 2007 through 2024. The remaining $949.9
    are

non-U.S. tax

loss carryforwards of which $718.6 have unlimited carry forward
    periods and $231.3 have expiration periods from 2007 through 2022

As of December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005, we had
    approximately $991.8 and $825.9 of undistributed earnings
    attributable to foreign subsidiaries, respectively. It is our
    intention to reinvest undistributed earnings of our



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)

foreign subsidiaries and thereby postpone their remittance. We
    have not provided deferred U.S. income taxes or foreign
    withholding taxes on temporary differences resulting from
    earnings for certain foreign subsidiaries which are permanently
    reinvested outside the United States. It is not practicable to
    determine the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability
    associated with these temporary differences.

In 2006 we finalized the

1994-1996

IRS audit cycle. We agreed to an IRS adjustment to move a tax
    deduction into later years. The deferral of this deduction has
    not impacted our tax provision in 2006.

In addition, in 2006 the IRS completed their field audit of the
    years 1997 through 2002 and has proposed additions to our
    taxable income. We have appealed a number of these proposed
    additions. Further, during the second quarter of 2006, the IRS
    commenced the audit of the 2003 and 2004 income tax returns.

In 2006, we presented the IRS with an adjustment to our taxable
    loss for 2004 to claim a deduction for a worthlessness loss of
    an acquired business which we originally claimed on our 2002 tax
    return but which the IRS disallowed. We had previously received
    a refund of approximately $45.0 from the carryback of the 2002
    loss to a previous year. In 2006, we paid $52.7, including
    interest, as a result of the disallowance of this loss deduction
    for 2002. This loss claim is currently being reviewed by the IRS
    in conjunction with their audit of the

2003-2004

income tax return.

Also in 2006, a decision was reached to carryback our loss
    generated in 2005 to 2003. The taxable income in 2003 would be
    reduced, with the corollary effect of previously claimed foreign
    tax credits being displaced. The  displaced foreign tax credits
    will become part of our foreign tax credit carryforward, on
    which a full valuation allowance has been recorded. Accordingly,
    we have recorded a charge to tax expense in 2006 for this item.

We have various tax years under examination by tax authorities
    in various countries, such as the United Kingdom, and in various
    states, such as New York, in which we have significant business
    operations. It is not yet known whether these examinations will,
    in the aggregate, result in our paying additional taxes. We have
    established tax reserves that we believe to be adequate in
    relation to the potential for additional assessments in each of
    the jurisdictions in which we are subject to taxation. We
    regularly assess the likelihood of additional tax assessments in
    those jurisdictions and adjust our reserves as additional
    information or events require. See Note 19 for further
    information.

In addition, holders of our $400.0 4.50% Notes may require

    2008. These Notes will mature in 2023 if not converted or
    repurchased.

Redemption
    of Long-Term Debt

In August 2005, we redeemed the remainder of our
    7.875% Senior Unsecured Notes with an aggregate principal
    amount of $250.0 at maturity for a total cost of $258.6, which
    included the principal amount of the Notes, accrued interest to
    the redemption date, and a prepayment penalty of $1.4. To redeem
    these Notes we used the proceeds from the sale and issuance in
    July 2005 of $250.0 Floating Rate Senior Unsecured Notes due
    2008.

Floating
    Rate Senior Unsecured Notes

In December 2006, we exchanged all of our $250.0 Floating Rate
    Notes due 2008 for $250.0 aggregate principal amount Floating
    Rate Notes due 2010. The new Floating Rate Notes mature on
    November 15, 2010 and bear interest at a per annum rate
    equal to three-month LIBOR plus 200 basis points,
    125 basis points less than the interest rate on the old
    Floating Rate Notes. In connection with the exchange, we made an
    early participation payment of $41.25 (actual amount) in cash
    per $1,000 (actual amount) principal amount of old Floating Rate
    Notes for a total payment of $10.3.

In accordance with EITF Issue

No. 96-19,

Debtor’s Accounting for a Modification or Exchange of
    Debt Instruments

(“EITF 96-19”),

this transaction is treated as an exchange of debt for
    accounting purposes because the present value of the remaining
    cash flows under the terms of the original instrument are not
    substantially different from those of the new instrument. The
    new Floating Rate Notes are reflected on our Consolidated
    Balance Sheet net of the $10.3 early participation payment,
    which is amortized over the life of the new Floating Rate Notes
    as a discount, using an effective interest method, and recorded
    in interest expense. Direct fees associated with the exchange of
    $3.5 were reflected in interest expense.

4.25%
    and 4.50% Convertible Senior Notes

In November 2006, we exchanged $400.0 of our
    4.50% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023 (the
    “4.50% Notes”) for $400.0 aggregate principal
    amount of 4.25% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023 (the
    “4.25% Notes”). As required by

EITF 96-19,

this exchange is treated as an extinguishment of the
    4.50% Notes and an issuance of 4.25% Notes for
    accounting purposes because the present value of the remaining
    cash flows plus the fair value of the embedded conversion option
    under the terms of the original instrument are substantially
    different from those of the new instrument. As a result, the
    4.25% Notes are reflected on our Consolidated Balance Sheet
    at their fair value at issuance, or $477.0. We recorded a
    non-cash charge in the fourth quarter of 2006 of $77.0
    reflecting the difference between the fair value of the new debt
    and the carrying value of the old debt. The difference between
    fair value and carrying value will be amortized through
    March 15, 2012, which is the first date holders may require
    us to repurchase the 4.25% Notes, resulting in a reduction
    of reported interest expense in future periods. We also recorded
    a non-cash charge of $3.8 for the extinguishment of unamortized
    debt issuance costs related to the exchanged 4.50% Notes.

Our 4.25% Notes are convertible into our common stock at a
    conversion price of $12.42 per share, subject to adjustment
    in specified circumstances including any payment of cash
    dividends on our common stock. The conversion rate of the new
    notes is also subject to adjustment for certain events arising
    from stock splits and combinations, stock dividends, certain
    cash dividends and certain other actions by us that modify our
    capital

structure. The 4.25% Notes are convertible at any time if
    the average price of our common stock for 20 trading days
    immediately preceding the conversion date is greater than or
    equal to a specified percentage of the conversion price,
    beginning at 118.5% in 2006 and declining 0.5% each year until
    it reaches 110% at maturity. They are also convertible,
    regardless of the price of our common stock, if: (i) we
    call the 4.25% Notes for redemption; (ii) we make
    specified distributions to shareholders; (iii) we become a
    party to a consolidation, merger or binding share exchange
    pursuant to which our common stock would be converted into cash
    or property (other than securities); or (iv) the credit
    ratings assigned to the 4.25% Notes by any two of
    Moody’s Investors Service, Standard & Poor’s
    and Fitch Ratings are lower than Ba2, BB and BB, respectively,
    or the 4.25% Notes are no longer rated by at least two of
    these ratings services. Because of our current credit ratings,
    the 4.25% Notes are currently convertible. The 4.25% Notes
    are also convertible, whether or not the above conditions are
    met, from February 15 to March 15, 2023.

Holders of the 4.25% Notes may require us to repurchase the
    4.25% Notes on March 15, 2012 for cash and on
    March 15, 2015 and March 15, 2018, for cash or our
    common stock or a combination of cash and common stock, at our
    election. Additionally, investors may require us to repurchase
    the 4.25% Notes in the event of certain change of control
    events that occur prior to March 15, 2012, for cash or our
    common stock or a combination of cash and common stock, at our
    election. At our option, we may redeem the 4.25% Notes on
    or after March 15, 2012 for cash. The redemption price in
    each of these instances will be 100% of the principal amount of
    the Notes being redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if
    any. The 4.25% Notes also provide for an additional
    “make-whole” adjustment to the conversion rate in the
    event of a change of control meeting specified conditions.

In accordance with EITF

03-6,

the
    4.25% Notes are not considered securities with
    participation rights in earnings available to common
    stockholders as there are no features attached to this security
    that allow holders to participate in our undistributed earnings.

Our 4.50% Notes are convertible into our common stock at a
    conversion price of $12.42 per share, subject to adjustment
    in specified circumstances. They are convertible at any time if
    the average price of our common stock for 20 trading days
    immediately preceding the conversion date is greater than or
    equal to a specified percentage, beginning at 120% in 2003 and
    declining 0.5% each year until it reaches 110% at maturity, of
    the conversion price. They are also convertible, regardless of
    the price of our common stock, if: (i) we call the
    4.50% Notes for redemption; (ii) we make specified
    distributions to shareholders; (iii) we become a party to a
    consolidation, merger or binding share exchange pursuant to
    which our common stock would be converted into cash or property
    (other than securities) or (iv) the credit ratings assigned
    to the 4.50% Notes by any two of Moody’s Investors
    Service, Standard & Poor’s and Fitch Ratings are
    lower than Ba2, BB and BB, respectively, or the 4.50% Notes
    are no longer rated by at least two of these ratings services.
    Because of our current credit ratings, the 4.50% Notes are
    currently convertible.

Holders of the 4.50% Notes may require us to repurchase the
    4.50% Notes on March 15, 2008 for cash and on
    March 15, 2013 and March 15, 2018, for cash or common
    stock or a combination of both, at our election. Additionally,
    investors may require us to repurchase the 4.50% Notes in
    the event of certain change of control events that occur prior
    to March 15, 2008 for cash or common stock or a combination
    of both, at our election. If at any time on or after
    March 13, 2003 we pay cash dividends on our common stock,
    we will pay contingent interest in an amount equal to 100% of
    the per share cash dividend paid on the common stock multiplied
    by the number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion
    of the 4.50% Notes. At our option, we may redeem the
    4.50% Notes on or after September 15, 2009 for cash.
    The redemption price in each of these instances will be 100% of
    the principal amount of the Notes being redeemed, plus accrued
    and unpaid interest, if any. The 4.50% Notes also provide
    for an additional “make-whole” adjustment to the
    conversion rate in the event of a change of control meeting
    specified conditions.

In accordance with EITF

03-6,

the
    4.50% Notes are considered securities with participation
    rights in earnings available to common stockholders due to the
    feature of these securities that allows investors to participate
    in cash dividends paid on our common stock. For periods in which
    we experience net income, the impact of these securities’
    participation rights is included in the calculation of earnings
    per share. For periods in which we experience a net loss, the
    4.50% Notes have no impact on the calculation of earnings
    per share due to the fact that the holders of these securities
    do not participate in our losses.

Consent
    Solicitation

In March 2005, we completed a consent solicitation to amend the
    indentures governing five series of our outstanding public debt
    to provide, among other things, that our failure to file with
    the trustee our SEC reports, including our 2004 Annual Report on

Form 10-K

and Quarterly Reports for the first and second quarters of 2005
    on

Form 10-Q,

would not constitute a default under the indentures until
    October 1, 2005.

Credit
    Arrangements

We have a committed credit agreement and uncommitted credit
    facilities with various banks that permit borrowings at variable
    interest rates. As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, there
    were no borrowings under our committed credit facilities.
    However, there were borrowings under the uncommitted facilities
    made by several of our subsidiaries outside the United States.
    We have guaranteed the repayment of some of these borrowings by
    our subsidiaries. The weighted-average interest rate on
    outstanding balances under the uncommitted short-term facilities
    as of December 31, 2006 and 2005 was approximately 5% in
    each year. A summary of our credit facilities is as follows:

Our primary credit agreement is a $750.0 Three-Year Credit
    Agreement, dated as of June 13, 2006 (the “Credit
    Agreement”). Under the Credit Agreement, a special-purpose
    entity called ELF Special Financing Ltd. (“ELF”) acts
    as the lender and letter of credit issuer. In connection with
    entering into the Credit Agreement, we terminated our previous
    committed credit agreement, the Amended and Restated Three-Year
    Credit Agreement, dated as of May 10, 2004, as amended. ELF
    is obligated at our request to make cash advances to us and to
    issue letters of credit for our account, in an aggregate amount
    not to exceed $750.0 outstanding at any time. The aggregate face
    amount of letters of credit may not exceed $600.0 at any time.
    Our obligations under the Credit Agreement are unsecured. The
    Credit Agreement is a revolving facility, under which amounts
    borrowed may be repaid and borrowed again, and the aggregate
    available amount of letters of credit may decrease or increase,
    subject to the overall limit of $750.0 and the $600.0 limit on
    letters of credit. We are not subject to any financial or other
    material restrictive covenants under the Credit Agreement.

We pay commitment fees on the undrawn amount, less the letters
    of credit, under the Credit Agreement and commissions on the
    amounts available to be drawn under the letters of credit at
    0.78% per annum. In addition, we pay a facility fee equal
    to 0.15% per annum on the undrawn amount, including letters
    of credit, under the facility. If we draw under the facility,
    interest is payable on any outstanding advances under the Credit
    Agreement at

3-month

LIBOR plus 0.78% per annum. The Credit Agreement will
    expire on June 15, 2009.

We entered into the Credit Agreement during the second quarter
    of 2006 as part of a transaction we refer to as the “ELF
    Financing.” ELF is a special-purpose entity incorporated in
    the Cayman Islands, in which we have no equity or other interest
    and which we do not consolidate for financial reporting
    purposes. In the ELF Financing, institutional investors
    purchased from ELF debt securities issued by ELF (the “ELF
    Notes”) and warrants issued by us (refer to Note 11).
    ELF received $750.0 in proceeds from these sales, which it used
    to purchase AAA-rated liquid assets. It will hold the liquid
    assets pending any request for borrowing from us or any drawing
    on any letters of credit issued for our account under the Credit
    Agreement, which ELF will fund by selling liquid assets. We are
    not the issuer of the ELF Notes and are not party to the
    indenture governing the ELF Notes. In conjunction with the ELF
    Financing we paid $41.2 of issuance costs, with the offset
    recorded in other assets. The issuance costs consist of



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)

approximately $25.0 of underwriting commissions, legal and
    accounting fees, printing costs and other fees or expenses, with
    the balance in a fee to one of the initial purchasers for its
    services as structuring agent for the offering. These costs will
    be amortized through the exercise date of the warrants on a
    straight-line basis as a component of interest expense.

Under certain circumstances, including certain events of default
    involving us or occurring under the ELF Notes, the commitment to
    make advances and issue letters of credit under the Credit
    Agreement may be terminated by ELF, acting on instruction of the
    holders of the ELF Notes. We will be entitled, prior to any such
    termination, to make a borrowing of up to the entire available
    amount of the commitment under the Credit Agreement (regardless
    of whether our obligations under the Credit Agreement have been
    accelerated). Upon termination of the commitment, the holders of
    the ELF Notes will automatically receive interests in the
    outstanding loans in exchange for their ELF Notes. Thereafter we
    will not be able to borrow or reborrow additional funds under
    the Credit Agreement, but the advances will remain outstanding
    as term loans maturing on June 15, 2009 (subject to the
    rights of the holders to accelerate the loans upon an event of
    default).

Cash
    Poolings

We aggregate our net domestic cash position on a daily basis.
    Outside the United States, we use cash pooling arrangements with
    banks to help manage our liquidity requirements. In these
    pooling arrangements, several Interpublic agencies agree with a
    single bank that the cash balances of any of the agencies with
    the bank will be subject to a full right of setoff against
    amounts the other agencies owe the bank, and the bank provides
    overdrafts as long as the net balance for all the agencies does
    not exceed an

agreed-upon

level. Typically each agency pays interest on outstanding
    overdrafts and receives interest on cash balances. Our
    Consolidated Balance Sheets reflect cash net of overdrafts for
    each pooling arrangement. As of December 31, 2006 and 2005,
    a gross amount of $1,052.5 and $842.6, respectively, in cash was
    netted against an equal gross amount of overdrafts under pooling
    arrangements.

Note 11:

Warrants

As part of the ELF Financing completed during the second quarter
    of 2006, we issued 67.9 warrants, consisting of 29.1 capped
    warrants (“Capped Warrants”) and 38.8 uncapped
    warrants (“Uncapped Warrants”). In accordance with
    EITF Issue

No. 00-19,

Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments Indexed to,
    and Potentially Settled in, a Company’s Own Stock

(“EITF

00-19”),

we recorded $63.4 of deferred warrant cost in other assets, with
    the offset recorded to additional paid-in capital within
    stockholders’ equity. This amount is a non-cash transaction
    and represents the fair value of the warrants at the transaction
    close date estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing
    model, which requires reliance on variables including the price
    volatility of the underlying stock. The deferred warrant cost
    will be amortized through the exercise date of the warrants as
    issuance costs on a straight-line basis as a non-cash element of
    interest expense. As of December 31, 2006, $11.4 has been
    recognized as interest expense.

The stated exercise date of the warrants is June 15, 2009.
    Following the exercise of the warrants each warrant will entitle
    the warrant holder to receive an amount in cash, shares of our
    common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of our common
    stock, at our option. The amount will be based, subject to
    customary adjustments, on the difference between the market
    price of one share of our common stock (calculated as the
    average share price over 30 trading days following
    expiration) and the stated exercise price of the warrant. For
    the Uncapped Warrants, the exercise price is $11.91 per
    warrant. For the Capped Warrants, the exercise price is
    $9.89 per warrant but the amount deliverable upon exercise
    is capped so a holder will not benefit from appreciation of the
    common stock above $12.36 per share.

Concurrently with the issuance of the warrants described above,
    we entered into call spread transactions with four different
    counterparties to reduce the potential dilution or cash cost
    upon exercise of the Uncapped Warrants. Each transaction gives
    us the right to receive, upon expiration of the options
    thereunder, an amount in cash, shares of our common stock, or a
    combination of cash and shares of our common stock, at our
    option. The amount will be based, subject to customary
    adjustments, on the difference between the market price of one
    share of our common stock (calculated as the average share price
    over 30 trading days following expiration) and $11.91 per
    share, the exercise price of the Uncapped Warrants. The amount
    deliverable to us under the call spread transactions, however,

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)

is capped so we will not receive any amount relating to
    appreciation of our common stock above $14.38 per share,
    and we will incur dilution or cash costs upon exercise of the
    Uncapped Warrants to the extent our share price exceeds
    $14.38 per share at that time. The four transactions cover
    an aggregate notional amount of 38.8 shares, equivalent to
    the full number of the Uncapped Warrants, and had an aggregate
    purchase price of $29.2. In accordance with EITF

00-19

the
    cost of the four transactions has been recorded as a reduction
    to additional paid-in capital within stockholders’ equity.

In accordance with EITF

03-6,

the
    warrants are not considered securities with participation rights
    in earnings available to common stockholders due to the
    contingent nature of the exercise feature of these securities.

Note 12:

Convertible
    Preferred Stock

Series A
    Preferred Stock

On December 15, 2006, each share of our 5.375%
    Series A Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock
    (“Series A Preferred Stock”) converted into
    3.7037 shares of our common stock. We had 7.475 shares
    of Series A Preferred Stock outstanding which resulted in
    an issuance of 27.7 shares of our common stock. We paid
    dividends of $20.1, or $2.6875 per share, on our
    Series A Preferred Stock during 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Series B
    Preferred Stock

On October 24, 2005, we completed a private offering of
    0.525 shares of our 5.25% Series B Cumulative
    Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock (“Series B
    Preferred Stock”) at an aggregate offering price of $525.0.
    The net proceeds from the sale were $507.3 after deducting
    discounts to the initial purchasers and the expenses of the
    offering.

Each share of our Series B Preferred Stock has a
    liquidation preference of $1,000 per share and is
    convertible at the option of the holder at any time into
    73.1904 shares of our common stock, subject to adjustment
    upon the occurrence of certain events, which represents a
    conversion price of $13.66, representing a conversion premium of
    approximately 30% over our closing stock price on
    October 18, 2005 of $10.51 per share. On or after
    October 15, 2010, each share of the Series B Preferred
    Stock may be converted at our option if the closing price of our
    common stock multiplied by the conversion rate then in effect
    equals or exceeds 130% of the liquidation preference of
    $1,000 per share for 20 trading days during any consecutive
    30 trading day period. Holders of the Series B Preferred
    Stock will be entitled to an adjustment to the conversion rate
    if they convert their shares in connection with a fundamental
    change meeting certain specified conditions.

The Series B Preferred Stock is junior to all of our
    existing and future debt obligations and senior to our common
    stock, with respect to payments of dividends and rights upon
    liquidation, winding up or dissolution, to the extent of the
    liquidation preference of $1,000 per share. There are no
    registration rights with respect to the Series B Preferred
    Stock, shares of our common stock issuable upon conversion
    thereof or any shares of our common stock that may be delivered
    in connection with a dividend payment.

In accordance with EITF

03-6,

the
    Series B Preferred Stock is not considered a security with
    participation rights in earnings available to common
    stockholders due to the contingent nature of the conversion
    feature of these securities.

Payment
    of Dividends

The terms of our Series B Preferred Stock do not permit us
    to pay dividends on our common stock unless all accumulated and
    unpaid dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock have been
    or contemporaneously are declared and paid, or provision for the
    payment thereof has been made.

We paid dividends of $26.9, or $51.1875 per share, on our
    Series B Preferred Stock during 2006. The initial dividend
    on our Series B Preferred Stock was $6.2, or
    $11.8125 per share, and was declared on December 19,
    2005 and paid in cash on January 17, 2006. Regular
    quarterly dividends, if declared, are $6.9, or $13.125 per
    share. Dividends on each share of Series B Preferred Stock
    are payable quarterly in cash or, if certain conditions are met,
    in common stock, at our option, on January 15,
    April 15, July 15 and October 15 of each year. The dividend
    rate of the Series B Preferred Stock will be increased by
    1.0% if we do not pay dividends on the Series B Preferred
    Stock for six



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)

quarterly periods (whether consecutive or not). The dividend
    rate will revert back to the original rate once all unpaid
    dividends are paid in full. The dividend rate of the
    Series B Preferred Stock will also be increased by 1.0% if
    we do not file our periodic reports with the SEC within
    15 days after the required filing date during the first
    two-year period following the closing of the offering.

Dividends on our Series B Preferred Stock are cumulative
    from the date of issuance and are payable on each payment date
    to the extent that we have assets that are legally available to
    pay dividends and our Board of Directors or an authorized
    committee of our Board declares a dividend payable. Pursuant to
    the terms of the Series B Preferred Stock, if we do not pay
    dividends on any series of our preferred stock for six quarterly
    periods (whether consecutive or not), then holders of all series
    of our preferred stock then outstanding will have the right to
    elect two additional directors to the Board. These additional
    directors will remain on the Board until all accumulated and
    unpaid dividends on our cumulative preferred stock have been
    paid in full, or to the extent any series of non-cumulative
    preferred stock is outstanding, until non-cumulative dividends
    have been paid regularly for at least one year.

Note 13:

Employee
    Benefits

Pension
    Plans

We have a defined benefit pension plan (“Domestic
    Plan”) which covers substantially all regular domestic
    employees employed through March 31, 1998. This plan
    features a traditional career pay benefit as well as a cash
    balance benefit, which was added in 1992. Post-1992 participants
    are eligible for the cash balance benefit only. For

pre-1992

participants, the benefit is the greater of the cash balance
    benefit or the career pay benefit formula. Participants are
    eligible to receive their benefit in the form of a lump sum
    payment or an annuity. Effective April 1, 1998, plan
    participation and benefit accruals for the Domestic Plan were
    frozen and participants with less than five years of service
    became fully vested. As of December 31, 2006, there were
    approximately 4,700 participants in the Domestic Plan.
    Participants with five or more years of participation in the
    Domestic Plan as of March 31, 1998 retained their vested
    balances in the Domestic Plan and also became eligible for
    payments under a compensation arrangement, the
    “Supplemental Compensation Plan” (described below).
    Some of our agencies have additional domestic plans covering a
    total of approximately 300 employees. These plans are also
    closed to new participants.

We also have numerous plans outside the United States, some of
    which are funded, while others provide payments at the time of
    retirement or termination under applicable labor laws or
    agreements. The Interpublic Pension Plan in the U.K. (“U.K.
    Pension Plan”) is the most material foreign pension plan in
    terms of the benefit obligation and plan assets. This plan is a
    defined benefit plan offering plan participants a final average
    pay benefit. Effective November 1, 2002, the U.K. Pension
    Plan was closed to new entrants, but existing participants
    continue to earn benefits under the plan. New employees after
    November 1, 2002 may be eligible to join the industry wide
    plan that operates on a defined contribution basis. As of
    December 31, 2006, there were approximately 1,700
    participants in the U.K. Pension Plan.

We included certain additional foreign pension plans’
    information in our 2006 disclosure that was not included in our
    2005 disclosure. We have included the net periodic cost, as well
    as the benefit obligations and assets related to these plans as
    of and for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005. The
    benefit obligations and assets for these plans are classified as
    “other” adjustments within the Pension and
    Postretirement Benefit Obligation table below. These plans do
    not have a material impact on our Consolidated Balance Sheets or
    Statements of Operations in 2006 or 2005.

Postretirement
    Benefit Plans

Some of our subsidiaries provide postretirement health benefits
    to eligible employees and their dependents and postretirement
    life insurance to eligible employees. For domestic employees to
    be eligible for postretirement health benefits, an employee had
    to be hired prior to January 1, 1988 (June 22, 2001
    for domestic employees of the former True North Communications
    companies). To be eligible for life insurance, an employee had
    to be hired prior to December 1, 1961 (June 22, 2001
    for domestic employees of the former True North Communications
    companies). Benefits are provided to retirees before and after
    eligibility for Medicare, and our cost is based on each
    participant’s retirement date and pre- and post-Medicare
    eligibility. As of December 31, 2006, there were
    approximately 3,500 participants in these plans.



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)

Our postretirement health benefits plans are unfunded, and we
    pay claims as presented by the plans’ administrator. The
    postretirement life insurance plan is insured and we pay
    premiums to the plan administrator.

In December 2003, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement
    and Modernization Act of 2003 (the “Act”) was enacted.
    The Act established a prescription drug benefit under Medicare,
    known as “Medicare Part D,” and a federal subsidy
    to sponsors of postretirement health benefits plans that provide
    a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to the
    Medicare Part D benefit. The prescription drug benefit
    provided to certain participants in the postretirement medical
    plan is at least actuarially equivalent to the Medicare
    Part D benefit, and, accordingly, we are entitled to a
    subsidy. Our application for the subsidy for our retirees was
    accepted by the Department of Health and Human Services, with
    the exception of certain participants of the True North
    postretirement benefit plan, whose benefits we believe are not
    actuarially equivalent to the Medicare Part D benefit and
    therefore not eligible for the Medicare Part D subsidy. We
    elected to prospectively recognize the effect of the Act during
    the third quarter of 2004. The expected subsidy reduced the
    accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by $5.0 at
    adoption, and the net periodic cost by $1.0, $1.0 and $0.3 for
    2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, compared to the amount
    calculated without considering the effects of the subsidy.

Adoption
    of SFAS No. 158

On September 29, 2006, the FASB issued
    SFAS No. 158. SFAS No. 158 requires an
    employer to recognize an asset or liability for the overfunded
    or underfunded status of their pension and other postretirement
    benefit plans. For a pension plan, the asset or liability is the
    difference between the fair value of the plan’s assets and
    the projected benefit obligation. For any other postretirement
    benefit plan, the asset or liability is the difference between
    the fair value of the plan’s assets and the accumulated
    postretirement benefit obligation. SFAS No. 158
    requires employers to recognize all unrecognized transition
    obligations and assets, prior service costs and credits and
    actuarial gains and losses in accumulated other comprehensive
    income (loss), net of tax. Such amounts are adjusted as they
    subsequently recognize the components of net periodic benefit
    cost or income pursuant to the current recognition and
    amortization provisions. The following table summarizes the
    effect of required changes in the additional minimum liability
    (AML) as of December 31, 2006 prior to the adoption of
    SFAS No. 158 as well as the impact of the initial
    adoption of SFAS No. 158 for domestic plans, the
    principal foreign pension plans and the postretirement benefit
    plan.

Determination
    of Discount Rates

For the domestic pension and postretirement benefit plans, we
    determine our discount rate based on the estimated rate at which
    annuity contracts could be purchased to effectively settle the
    respective benefit obligations. In determining the discount
    rate, we utilize a yield curve based on Moody Aa-rated corporate
    non-callable bonds. Each plan’s projected cash flow is
    matched to this yield curve and a present value is developed,
    which is then used to develop a single equivalent discount rate.
    The average duration of our domestic pension and postretirement
    health care obligations was 10 years as of
    December 31, 2006.

For the foreign pension plans, we determine a discount rate by
    referencing market yields on high quality corporate bonds in the
    local markets with the appropriate term at December 31,
    2006.

Determination
    of the Expected Return on Assets

For the Domestic Plan, we develop the long-term expected rate of
    return assumptions which we use to model and determine overall
    asset allocations. Our rate of return analyses factor in
    historical trends, current market conditions, risk premiums
    associated with asset classes, and long-term inflation rates. We
    determine both a short-term (5-7 year) and long-term
    (30 year) view and then attempt to select a long-term rate
    of return assumption that matches the duration of our
    liabilities. Factors included in the analysis of returns include
    historical trends of asset class index returns over various
    market cycles and economic conditions.

Approximately 90% of the foreign plan assets are part of the
    U.K. Pension Plan. The U.K. Pension Plan’s statement of
    investment principles specifies benchmark allocations by asset
    category for each investment manager employed, with specified
    ranges around the central benchmark allocation. For the U.K.
    Pension Plan, we determine the expected rate of return by
    utilizing a weighted average approach based on the current
    long-term expected rates of return for each asset category. The
    long-term expected rate of return for the equity category is
    based on the current long-term rates of return available on
    government bonds and applying suitable risk premiums that
    consider historical market returns and current market
    expectations.

Asset
    Allocation

The primary investment goal for our plans’ assets is to
    maximize total asset returns while ensuring the plans’
    assets are available to fund the plans’ liabilities as they
    become due. The plans’ assets in aggregate and at the
    individual portfolio level are invested so that total portfolio
    risk exposure and risk-adjusted returns best meet this objective.

Healthcare
    Cost Trend

Assumed healthcare cost trend rates have a moderate effect on
    the amounts reported for the postretirement benefit plans. We
    develop our healthcare cost trend rate assumptions based on data
    collected on recent trends and forecasts. A one percentage point
    change in assumed healthcare cost trend rates would have the

    for the period

2012-2016.

Supplemental
    Compensation Plan

As discussed above, participants with five or more years of
    participation in the Domestic Plan as of March 31, 1998
    became eligible for payments under the Supplemental Compensation
    Plan. Under this plan, each participant is eligible for an
    annual allocation, which approximates the projected discontinued
    pension benefit accrual (formerly made under the cash balance
    formula in the Domestic Plan) plus interest, while they continue
    to work for us. Payments began in 2003 and are scheduled to end
    in 2008. As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, the Supplemental
    Compensation Plan liability recorded was $5.4 and $7.3,
    respectively. Amounts expensed for the Supplemental Compensation
    Plan in 2006, 2005 and 2004 were $0.6, $1.0 and $5.4,
    respectively.

Savings
    Plans

We sponsor a defined contribution plan (“Savings
    Plan”) that covers substantially all domestic employees.
    The Savings Plan permits participants to make contributions on a
    pre-tax

and/or

after-tax basis. The Savings Plan allows participants to choose
    among various investment alternatives. We match a portion of
    participant contributions based upon their years of service. We
    contributed $31.2, $29.9 and $28.0 to the Savings Plan in 2006,
    2005 and 2004, respectively. We also expect to contribute $8.9
    to the Savings Plan for the performance-based discretionary
    match for 2006. In addition, we maintain defined contribution
    plans in various countries and contributed $11.8, $5.3 and $3.9
    to these plans in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Deferred
    Compensation and Benefit Arrangements

We have deferred compensation arrangements which (i) permit
    certain of our key officers and employees to defer a portion of
    their salary or incentive compensation, or (ii) result in
    us contributing an amount to the participant’s account. The
    arrangements typically provide that the participant will receive
    the amounts deferred plus interest upon attaining certain
    conditions, such as completing a certain number of years of
    service or upon retirement or termination. As of
    December 31, 2006 and 2005, the deferred compensation
    liability balance recorded was $143.9 and $141.3, respectively.
    Amounts expensed for deferred compensation arrangements in 2006,
    2005 and 2004 were $10.3, $10.2 and $8.8, respectively.

We have deferred benefit arrangements with certain key officers
    and employees which provide participants with an annual payment,
    payable when the participant attains a certain age and after the
    participant’s employment has terminated. The deferred
    benefit liability recorded on as of December 31, 2006 and
    2005 was $157.9 and $151.5, respectively. Amounts expensed for
    deferred benefit arrangements in 2006, 2005 and 2004 were $13.7,
    $30.9 and $17.1, respectively.

A significant assumption used to estimate certain deferred
    benefit liabilities is a participant’s retirement age. For
    one of our more significant deferred benefit arrangements,
    during the fourth quarter of 2005, based on an analysis of
    recent trends, we determined most eligible participants were
    retiring and beginning to collect their deferred benefits at
    age 60. This compares to previous periods which used an
    assumed retirement of age 65 within the related deferred
    benefit liability calculation. This change in estimate, recorded
    during the fourth quarter of 2005, resulted in a $14.8 charge to
    salaries and related expenses, with a corresponding increase to
    the deferred benefit liability.

We have purchased life insurance policies on participants’
    lives to assist in the funding of the related deferred
    compensation and deferred benefit liabilities. As of
    December 31, 2006 and 2005, the cash surrender value of
    these policies was $117.0 and $132.8, respectively. In addition
    to the life insurance policies, certain investments are held for
    the purpose of paying the deferred compensation and deferred
    benefit liabilities. These investments, along with the life
    insurance policies, are held in a separate trust and are
    restricted for the purpose of paying the deferred compensation
    and the deferred benefit arrangement liabilities. As of
    December 31, 2006 and 2005, the value of such investments
    in the trust was $88.5 and $86.1, respectively. The short-term
    investments, long-term investments and cash surrender value of
    the policies in the trust are included in cash and cash
    equivalents, investments and other assets, respectively.

Long-term
    Disability Plan

We have a Long-term Disability (“LTD”) plan which
    provides income replacement benefits to eligible participants
    who are unable to perform their job duties during the first
    24 months of disability. Benefits are continued thereafter
    if the participant is unable to perform any job related to his
    or her education, training or experience, provided the
    participants receive disability benefits from Social Security.
    As all income replacement benefits are fully insured, no related
    obligation is required at December 31, 2006 and 2005. In
    addition to income replacement benefits, all LTD participants
    continue to receive medical, dental and life insurance benefits
    up to age 65 (subject to minimum periods depending on the
    participants’ age at time of disability). We have recorded
    an obligation of $6.9 and $9.3 as of December 31, 2006 and
    2005, respectively, related to medical, dental benefits and life
    insurance benefits for LTD participants.

Stock-Based
    Compensation

    Performance Incentive Plan

We issue stock and cash based incentive awards to our employees
    under a plan established by the Compensation Committee of the
    Board of Directors and approved by our shareholders. In May
    2006, our shareholders approved the 2006 Performance Incentive
    Plan (the “2006 PIP”). Under the 2006 PIP, up to
    6.0 shares of common stock may be used for granting stock
    options and stock appreciation rights and up to 33.0 shares
    of common stock may be used for granting performance-based
    awards and other stock-based awards. Subject to the terms of the
    2006 PIP, additional awards may be granted from shares available
    for issuance under previous plans and in other limited
    circumstances. Only a certain number of shares are available for
    each type of award under the 2006 PIP, and there are similar
    limits on the number of shares that may be awarded to any one
    participant. The vesting period of awards granted is generally
    commensurate with the requisite service period. We generally
    issue new shares to satisfy the exercise of stock options or the
    distribution of other stock-based awards. During the second
    quarter of 2006 the Compensation Committee began to grant new
    awards under the 2006 PIP.

Employee
    Stock Purchase Plans

In November 2005, our stockholders approved the establishment of
    an Interpublic Group of Companies Employee Stock Purchase Plan
    (2006) (the “2006 Plan”) to replace the previously
    existing ESPP. Under the 2006 Plan, employees may purchase our
    common stock through payroll deductions not exceeding 10% of
    their compensation. The price an employee pays for a share of
    stock under the 2006 Plan is 90% of the lesser of the average
    market price of a share on the first business day of the
    offering period or the average market price of a share on the
    last business day of the offering period of three months. An
    aggregate of 15.0 shares are reserved for issuance under
    the 2006 Plan. During the second quarter of 2006, we filed a
    registration statement with the SEC to register the shares that
    may be purchased under the 2006 Plan. This plan is not yet
    active.

Under the former ESPP, employees could purchase our common stock
    through payroll deductions not exceeding 10% of their
    compensation. The price an employee paid for a share of stock
    under the ESPP was 85% of the average market price on the last
    business day of each month. The 15% discount received by
    employees on the date that common stock was purchased under our
    former ESPP had a weighted-average fair value of $1.97 and
    $2.03 per share for 2005 and 2004, respectively, and is
    included in the total fair value of stock-based employee
    compensation expense in the pro forma table above. In 2005 and
    2004, we issued 0.1 shares and 0.7 shares,
    respectively, purchased by employees under the ESPP. Shares
    issued to employees under the former ESPP had no impact on our
    Consolidated Statements of Operations. The ESPP expired
    effective June 30, 2005.

Stock
    Options

Stock options are granted at the fair market value of our common
    stock on the grant date and are generally exercisable between
    two and five years from the grant date and expire ten years from
    the grant date.

There were 0.1, 0.2 and 0.7 stock options exercised during 2006,

    options exercised during 2006, 2005 and 2004 was $0.2, $0.4, and
    $2.3, respectively. Accordingly, the related excess tax benefit
    classified as a financing inflow for 2006 was $0.1. The cash
    received from the stock options exercised in 2006 was $0.9. As
    of December 31, 2006 there was $18.9 of total unrecognized
    compensation expense related to non-vested stock options
    granted, which is expected to be recognized over a
    weighted-average period of 3.0 years.

We use the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to estimate the
    fair value of options granted, which requires the input of
    subjective assumptions including the option’s expected term
    and the price volatility of the underlying stock. Changes in the
    assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value and
    our results of operations could be materially impacted.

The fair value of each option grant has been estimated with the
    following weighted-average assumptions:

The expected volatility for the second half of 2005 and the
    twelve months ended December 31, 2006 used to estimate the
    fair value of stock options awarded is based on a blend of:
    (i) historical volatility of our common stock for periods
    equal to the expected term of our stock options and
    (ii) implied volatility of tradable forward put and call
    options to purchase and sell shares of our common stock. For the
    twelve months ended December 31, 2004 and the first half of
    2005, the expected volatility factor was based on historical
    volatility of our common stock over the most recent period
    commensurate with the estimated expected term of our stock
    options.


The estimate of our expected term for the second half of 2005
    and the twelve months ended December 31, 2006 is based on
    the average of (i) an assumption that all outstanding
    options are exercised upon achieving their full vesting date and
    (ii) an assumption that all outstanding options will be
    exercised at the midpoint between the current date, (i.e., the
    date awards have ratably vested through), and their full
    contractual term. In determining the estimate, we considered
    several factors, including the historical option exercise
    behavior of our employees and the terms and



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)

vesting periods of the options. For
    the twelve months ended December 31, 2004 and the first
    half of 2005, our estimate of expected term was based on the
    historical patterns of exercises.


The risk free rate is determined using the implied yield
    currently available for zero-coupon U.S. government issuers
    with a remaining term equal to the expected term of the options.


No dividend yield was assumed because we currently do not pay
    cash dividends on our common stock and have no current plans to
    reinstate a dividend.

On December 20, 2005, the Compensation Committee approved
    the immediate acceleration of vesting of all of our

“out-of-the-money”

outstanding and unvested stock options previously awarded to our
    employees under equity compensation plans, excluding unvested
    options (1) granted during the 2005 calendar year,
    (2) held by our CEO or CFO or (3) held by
    non-management directors. The number of shares, exercise prices
    and other terms of the options subject to the acceleration
    remain unchanged. The accelerated vesting of these stock options
    reduced the non-cash compensation expense recorded in our
    Consolidated Statements of Operations when we adopted
    SFAS No. 123R.

Restricted
    Stock

Restricted stock is granted to certain key employees and is
    subject to certain restrictions and vesting requirements as
    determined by the Compensation Committee. The vesting period is
    generally three years. No monetary consideration is paid by a
    recipient for a restricted stock award, and the fair value of
    the shares on the grant date is amortized over the vesting
    period.

During 2006, 2005 and 2004, we awarded 5.3, 4.6 and
    4.1 shares of restricted stock with a weighted-average
    grant-date fair value of $8.77, $11.98 and $13.72 per
    award, respectively. The total fair value of vested restricted
    stock that was distributed to participants during 2006, 2005 and
    2004 was $11.0, $19.8 and $23.7, respectively.

Restricted
    Stock Units

Restricted stock units are granted to certain key employees and
    generally vest over three years. Upon completion of the vesting
    period, the grantee is entitled, at the Compensation
    Committee’s discretion, to receive a payment in cash or in
    shares of common stock based on the fair market value of the
    corresponding number of shares of common stock. The holder of
    restricted stock units has no ownership interest in the
    underlying shares of common stock until the restricted stock
    units vest and the shares of common stock are issued. No
    monetary consideration is paid by a recipient for a restricted
    stock unit award. The fair value of restricted stock unit awards
    is adjusted at the end of each quarter based on our share price.
    We amortize stock-based compensation expense related to these
    awards over the vesting period based upon the quarterly-adjusted
    fair value.

During 2006, 2005 and 2004, we awarded 2.2, 1.6 and 1.0
    restricted stock units with a weighted-average grant-date fair
    value of $8.88, $12.09 and $13.41 per award, respectively. The
    total fair value of cash in respect of restricted stock units
    distributed to participants during 2006 and 2005 was $0.2 and
    $0.1, respectively. No restricted stock units vested during 2004.

Performance-Based
    Stock

Performance-based stock awards have been granted to certain key
    employees subject to certain restrictions and vesting
    requirements as determined by the Compensation Committee.
    Performance-based stock awards are a form of stock award in
    which the number of shares ultimately received by the
    participant depends on performance against specific performance
    targets. The awards generally vest over a three-year period
    related to the employees’ continuing employment and the
    achievement of certain performance objectives. The final number
    of shares that could ultimately be received by a participant
    ranges from 0% to 200% of the target amount of shares originally
    granted. The holder of an award of performance-based stock has
    no ownership interest in the underlying shares of common stock
    until the award vests and the shares of common stock are issued.
    We amortize stock-based compensation expense for the estimated
    number of performance-based stock awards that we expect to vest
    over the vesting period generally using the grant-date fair
    value of the shares. No monetary consideration is paid by a
    participant for a performance-based stock award.



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)

During 2006 and 2005 we awarded 9.9 and 2.9 shares of
    performance-based stock, at target, with a weighted-average
    grant-date fair value of $9.68 and $12.35 per award,
    respectively. No performance-based stock was granted during
    2004. The total fair value of performance-based stock
    distributed to participants during 2006 was $0.1. No
    performance-based stock awards were distributed during 2005.

Certain stock-based compensation awards expected to be settled
    in cash have been classified as liabilities in the Consolidated
    Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2006 and 2005.

A summary of the activity of our non-vested restricted stock,
    restricted stock units, and performance-based stock during 2006

Share
    Appreciation Performance-Based Units

In August 2005, we granted Michael Roth, Chairman of the Board
    and Chief Executive Officer, 0.3 share appreciation
    performance-based units (“SAPUs”) based on a
    weighted-average grant-date stock price of $12.17. At the
    Compensation Committee’s discretion, Mr. Roth is
    entitled to receive a payment in cash or shares of common stock
    upon completion of a four-year vesting period. Mr. Roth has
    no ownership interest in the underlying shares of common stock
    until the SAPUs vest and the shares of common stock are issued.
    The fair value of the SAPUs is estimated using the Black-Scholes
    valuation model, using assumptions similar to those used for
    stock options. For 2006, we recorded stock-based compensation
    expense for SAPUs of $0.6. There was no compensation expense
    recorded in 2005 for SAPUs, as the exercise price exceeded the
    market price. As of December 31, 2006, there was $0.9 of
    total unrecognized compensation expense related to non-vested
    SAPUs that is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average
    period of 2.6 years. We amortize stock-based compensation
    expense related to these awards over the vesting period based
    upon the quarterly-adjusted fair value.

Note 15:

Segment
    Information

As of December 31, 2006, we are organized into five global
    operating divisions and a group of leading stand-alone agencies
    that are grouped into two reportable segments, IAN and CMG. We
    also report results for the Corporate group. As of
    December 31, 2005, we had an additional segment,
    Motorsports operations (“Motorsports”), which was sold
    during 2004 and had immaterial residual operating results in
    2005. Future changes to our organizational structure may result
    in changes to the reportable segment disclosure.

Within the IAN segment, McCann Worldgroup, Draftfcb, Lowe
    Worldwide, Initiative and our stand-alone agencies provide a
    comprehensive array of global communications and marketing
    services, each offering a distinctive range of solutions for our
    clients. Our stand-alone agencies, including Campbell-Ewald,
    Hill Holliday, Deutsch and Mullen, provide a full range of
    advertising, marketing communications services

and/or

marketing services and partner with our global operating
    divisions as needed. Each of IAN’s operating divisions
    share similar economic characteristics and are similar in other
    areas, specifically related to the nature of their respective
    services, the manner in which the services are provided and the
    similarity of their respective customers.



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)

CMG, which includes Weber Shandwick, MWW Group, FutureBrand,
    DeVries, GolinHarris, Jack Morton, and Octagon Worldwide,
    provides clients with diversified services, including public
    relations, meeting and event production, sports and
    entertainment marketing, corporate and brand identity and
    strategic marketing consulting. CMG shares some similarities to
    other service lines offered by IAN, however, CMG’s
    businesses, on an aggregate basis, have a higher proportion of
    arrangements for which it acts as principal, a different
    distribution model than IAN and different margins.

During 2004, we exited our Motorsports business, which owned and
    operated venue-based motorsports businesses. Other than the
    recording of long-lived asset impairment and contract
    termination costs during 2004, the operating results of
    Motorsports during 2005 and 2004 were not material, and are
    therefore not discussed in detail.

The profitability measure employed by our chief operating
    decision makers for allocating resources to operating divisions
    and assessing operating division performance is operating income
    (loss), excluding the impact of restructuring and other
    reorganization-related charges (reversals), long-lived asset
    impairment charges and Motorsports contract termination costs.
    With the exception of excluding these amounts from reportable
    segment operating income (loss), all segments follow the same
    accounting policies as those described in Note 1.

Investment
    Securities

Short-term marketable securities consist primarily of

available-for-sale

debt and equity securities that are publicly traded. Long-term
    investments consisted primarily of public and non-public

available-for-sale

equity securities. These are mostly equity interests of less
    than 20% that we have in various agencies and are accounted for
    under the cost method. Equity method investments consisted
    primarily of investments in unconsolidated affiliated companies
    accounted for under the equity method and have been carried at
    cost, which approximates fair value.



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)

Dividends received from our investments in unconsolidated
    affiliated companies were $4.4, $5.9 and $9.3 in 2006, 2005 and
    2004, respectively, and reduced the carrying values of the
    related investments.

Gross unrealized gains on our investments, which are reported as
    a component of other comprehensive loss, were $7.2, $22.6 and
    $3.6 for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004,
    respectively. Gross unrealized losses on our investments, were
    ($13.5), ($0.2) and ($0.1) for the years ended December 31,
    2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Gross realized gains on our investments, which are reported in
    other income (expense), were $19.2, $0.6 and $0.0 for the years
    ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Gross
    realized losses on our investments, were $0.0, ($0.2) and ($3.2)
    for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004,
    respectively.

Long-Term
    Debt

Long-term debt includes variable and fixed rate debt. The fair
    value of our long-term debt instruments is based on market
    prices for debt instruments with similar terms and maturities.

Financial
    Commitments

Financial commitments include other forward contracts relating
    primarily to an obligation to repurchase 49% of the
    minority-owned equity shares of a consolidated subsidiary,
    valued pursuant to SFAS No. 150,

Accounting for
    Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristic of Both
    Liabilities and Equity.

Fair value measurement of the
    obligation was based upon the amount payable as if the forward
    contract was settled at December 31, 2006 and 2005. Changes
    in the fair value of the obligation have been recorded as
    interest expense or income in the Consolidated Statement of
    Operations.

Note 17:

Derivative
    and Hedging Instruments

We periodically enter into interest rate swap agreements and
    forward contracts to manage exposure to interest rate
    fluctuations and to mitigate foreign exchange volatility.
    Derivative instruments, including those that are embedded in
    other contracts, are recorded at fair value in the balance sheet
    as either an asset or a liability. Changes in the fair value of
    the derivatives are recorded each period in our Consolidated
    Statement of Operations unless specific hedge accounting
    criteria are met. We do not enter into derivative financial
    instruments for speculative purposes and do not have a material
    portfolio of derivative financial instruments.

Interest
    Rate Swaps

In January 2005, we executed an interest rate swap which
    synthetically converted $150.0 of fixed rate debt to floating
    rate debt. The interest rate swap effectively converted $150.0
    of the $500.0 7.25% Senior Unsecured Notes due August 2011
    to floating rate debt and matures on the same day the debt is
    due. Under the terms of the interest rate swap agreement we paid
    a floating interest rate, based on one-month LIBOR plus a spread
    of 297.0 basis points, and received the fixed interest rate
    of the underlying bond being hedged.

In May 2005, we terminated all of our long-term interest rate
    swap agreements covering the $350.0 6.25% Notes due
    November 2014 and $150.0 of the $500.0 7.25% Notes due
    August 2011. In connection with the interest rate swap
    termination, our net cash receipts were $1.1, which will be
    recorded as an offset to interest expense over the remaining
    life of the related debt.

We accounted for interest rate swaps related to our existing
    long-term debt as fair value hedges. As a result, the
    incremental interest payments or receipts from the swaps were
    recorded as adjustments to interest expense in the Consolidated
    Statement of Operations. The interest rate swaps settled on the
    underlying bond interest payment dates until maturity. There was
    no assumed hedge ineffectiveness as the interest rate swap terms
    matched the terms of the hedged bond.

Forward
    Contracts

We have entered into foreign currency transactions in which
    various foreign currencies are bought or sold forward. These
    contracts were entered into to meet currency requirements
    arising from specific transactions. The



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)

changes in value of these forward contracts have been recorded
    as other income or expense in our Consolidated Statement of
    Operations. As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, we had
    contracts covering $0.2 and $6.2, respectively, of notional
    amount of currency and the fair value of the forward contracts
    was negligible.

Other

The terms of the 4.50% Notes include two embedded
    derivative instruments and the terms of our 4.25% Notes and
    our Series B Preferred Stock each include one embedded
    derivative instrument. The fair value of these derivatives on
    December 31, 2006 was negligible.

Note 18:

Commitments
    and Contingencies

Leases

We lease office premises and equipment. Where leases contain
    escalation clauses or concessions, such as rent holidays and
    landlord/tenant incentives or allowances, the impact of such
    adjustments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the
    minimum lease period. Certain leases provide for renewal options
    and require the payment of real estate taxes or other occupancy
    costs, which are also subject to escalation clauses. Rent
    expense was as follows:

Guarantees

We have contingent obligations under guarantees of certain
    obligations of our subsidiaries (“parent company
    guarantees”) relating principally to credit facilities,
    guarantees of certain media payables and operating leases of
    certain subsidiaries. The amount of such parent company
    guarantees was $327.9 and $306.8 at December 31, 2006 and
    2005, respectively. In the event of non-payment by the
    applicable subsidiary of the obligations covered by a guarantee,
    we would be obligated to pay the amounts covered by that
    guarantee. As of December 31, 2006, there are no material
    assets pledged as security for such parent company guarantees.

Contingent
    Acquisition Obligations

We have structured certain acquisitions with additional
    contingent purchase price obligations in order to reduce the
    potential risk associated with negative future performance of
    the acquired entity. In addition, we have entered into
    agreements that may require us to purchase additional equity
    interests in certain consolidated and unconsolidated
    subsidiaries. The amounts relating to these transactions are
    based on estimates of the future financial performance of the
    acquired entity, the timing of the exercise of these rights,
    changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other factors. We
    have not recorded a liability for these items since the
    definitive amounts payable are not determinable or
    distributable. When the contingent acquisition obligations have
    been met and



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)

consideration is determinable and distributable, we record the
    fair value of this consideration as an additional cost of the
    acquired entity. However, we recognize deferred payments and
    purchases of additional interests after the effective date of
    purchase that are contingent upon the future employment of
    owners as compensation expense. Compensation expense is
    determined based on the terms and conditions of the respective
    acquisition agreements and employment terms of the former owners
    of the acquired businesses. This future expense will not be
    allocated to the assets and liabilities acquired and is
    amortized over the required employment terms of the former
    owners.

The following table details the estimated liability with respect
    to our contingent acquisition obligations and the estimated
    amount that would be paid under the options, in the event of
    exercise at the earliest exercise date. All payments are
    contingent upon achieving projected operating performance
    targets and satisfying other conditions specified in the related
    agreements and are subject to revisions as the earn-out periods
    progress. The following contingent acquisition obligations
    include compensation expense, except as noted below. As of
    December 31, 2006, our estimated future contingent
    acquisition obligations are as follows:

We have entered into certain acquisitions that contain both put
    and call options with similar terms and conditions. In such
    instances, we have included the related estimated contingent
    acquisition obligations with put options.

We maintain certain put options with consolidated affiliates
    that are exercisable at the discretion of the minority owners as
    of December 31, 2006. These put options are assumed to be
    exercised in the earliest possible period subsequent to
    December 31, 2006. Therefore, the related estimated
    acquisition payments of $33.8 have been included within the
    total payments expected to be made in 2007 in the table above.
    These payments, if not made in 2007, will continue to
    carry-forward into 2008 or beyond until they are exercised or
    expire.

Legal
    Matters

SEC Investigation

— The SEC opened a formal
    investigation in response to the restatement we first announced
    in August 2002 and the investigation expanded to encompass our
    2005 Restatement. In particular, since we filed our 2004 Annual
    Report on

Form 10-K,

we have received subpoenas from the SEC relating to matters
    addressed in our 2005 Restatement. We have also responded to
    inquiries from the SEC staff concerning the restatement of the
    first three quarters of 2005 that we made in our 2005 Annual
    Report on

Form 10-K.

We continue to cooperate with the investigation. We expect that
    the investigation will result in monetary liability, but because
    the investigation is



NOTES TO

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)

ongoing, in particular with respect to the 2005 Restatement, we
    cannot reasonably estimate the amount, range of amounts or
    timing of a resolution. Accordingly, we have not yet established
    any provision relating to these matters.

Other Legal Matters —

We are involved in other
    legal and administrative proceedings of various types. While any
    litigation contains an element of uncertainty, we have no reason
    to believe that the outcome of such proceedings or claims will
    have a material adverse effect on our financial condition,
    results of operations or our cash flows.

Note 19:

Recent
    Accounting Standards

In September 2006, the Securities and Exchange Commission
    (“SEC”) issued SAB No. 108, which provides
    interpretive guidance on how registrants should quantify
    financial-statement misstatements. Currently, the two methods
    most commonly used by preparers and auditors to quantify
    misstatements are the “rollover” method (which focuses
    primarily on the income statement impact of misstatements) and
    the “iron curtain” method (which focuses primarily on
    the balance sheet impact of misstatements). In connection with
    our review of the Company’s stock option practices we
    initially applied the provisions of SAB No. 108 as a
    cumulative effect adjustment effective January 1, 2006. See
    also Note 20. Under SAB No. 108, we are required
    to consider both the rollover and iron curtain methods (i.e., a
    dual approach) when evaluating the materiality of financial
    statement errors. Prior to the adoption of SAB No. 108
    we used the “iron curtain” method for quantifying
    identified financial statement misstatements.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157,

Fair Value Measurements

, which defines fair value,
    establishes a framework for measuring fair value in GAAP, and
    expands disclosures about fair value measurements. Under the
    standard, fair value refers to the price that would be received
    to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly
    transaction between market participants in the market in which
    the reporting entity transacts. The standard clarifies the
    principle that fair value should be based on the assumptions
    market participants would use when pricing the asset or
    liability. In support of this principle, the standard
    establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the
    information used to develop those assumptions. The fair value
    hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active
    markets and the lowest priority to unobservable data, for
    example, the reporting entity’s own data. Under the
    standard, fair value measurements would be separately disclosed
    by level within the fair value hierarchy. SFAS No. 157
    is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years
    beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods
    within those fiscal years. We are currently evaluating the
    impact of SFAS No. 157 on our Consolidated Financial
    Statements.

In July 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation
    (“FIN”) No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in
    Income Taxes — an interpretation of FASB Statement
    No. 109

, which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty
    in tax positions. FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold
    and a measurement attribute for the financial statement
    recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected
    to be taken in a tax return. For those benefits to be
    recognized, a tax position must be more-likely-than-not to be
    sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. The amount
    recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is
    greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon
    ultimate settlement. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years
    beginning after December 15, 2006, with any cumulative
    effect of the change in accounting principle recorded as an
    adjustment to opening retained earnings effective
    January 1, 2007. We are currently assessing the potential
    impact on retained earnings upon adoption. We do not expect the
    increase to accumulated deficit as of January 1, 2007 to be
    material.

In June 2006, the FASB ratified the consensus reached in EITF
    Issue No.

06-3,

How
    Taxes Collected from Customers and Remitted to Governmental
    Authorities Should Be Presented in the Income Statement (That
    is, Gross versus Net Presentation).

The scope of EITF Issue

No. 06-3

includes any tax assessed by a governmental authority that is
    directly imposed on a revenue-producing transaction between a
    seller and a customer. This issue provides that a company may
    adopt a policy of presenting taxes either gross within revenue
    or net. If taxes subject to this issue are significant, a
    company is required to disclose its accounting policy for
    presenting taxes and the amount of such taxes that are
    recognized on a gross basis. EITF Issue

No. 06-3

is effective for periods beginning after December 15, 2006.
    Taxes subject to this issue are reported net in our Consolidated
    Statements of Operations. We do not expect the adoption of EITF

No. 06-3

to have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial
    Statements.

In February 2006, SFAS No. 155,

Accounting for
    Certain Hybrid Financial Instruments

, was issued, which
    amends SFAS No. 133 and SFAS No. 140.
    SFAS No. 155 permits fair value remeasurement for any

    SFAS No. 155 is effective for fiscal years beginning

Note 20:

Review of
    Stock Option Practices

As a result of the significant number of companies identifying
    issues with their stock option practices, during the third
    quarter of 2006 we decided to conduct a review of our practices
    for stock option grants. At our recommendation, on
    September 8, 2006, our Audit Committee retained independent
    counsel to review our stock option practices related to the
    Company’s current and prior senior officers for a

10-year

period beginning in 1996. We also performed a comprehensive
    accounting review that supplemented the review done by
    independent counsel. Preliminary findings of these reviews were
    presented to the Audit Committee on October 26, 2006 and
    November 7, 2006. These reviews are both complete and did
    not result in any changes to the preliminary findings.

The reviews determined, among other things, the following:

•

There was no systematic pattern of selecting an exercise price
    based on the lowest stock price over the period preceding the
    grant.

•

All grants made after 2002 were accounted for correctly.

•

There were certain deficiencies in the process of granting,
    documenting and accounting for stock options.

•

The date used to determine the exercise price for certain stock
    option grants made between 1996 and 2002 preceded the
    finalization of the approval process of those grants for
    accounting purposes. (Discussed in more detail below.)

•

Certain stock options were granted at prices inconsistent with
    the related stock option plans.

The most significant deficiencies the reviews identified were as
    follows:

•

In certain situations from 1996 through 2002, in connection with
    our broad based annual option grants, an exercise price for such
    options was set as of a specified date in the future. This date,
    however, preceded the final determination of the number of
    shares individual employees were to receive, which resulted in
    some grants being issued

in-the-money,

and some grants being issued

out-of-the-money,

as of the measurement date.



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)

•

For certain annual grants, as well as numerous individual grants
    from 1996 through 2002, the date used for the exercise price was
    a date from an earlier period. In many cases, that earlier date
    was at or about the date of a prior meeting of the compensation
    committee or a management committee authorized by the
    compensation committee.

•

In addition, the review identified many grants from 1996 through
    2005 for which not all of the relevant documentation could be
    located and, in some cases, no authorizing documentation could
    be located. However, in most of these instances, there was no
    indication, using all available relevant information, that the
    grants were not appropriately accounted for.

Under applicable accounting standards prior to January 1,
    2006 (APB No. 25), compensation expense should reflect the
    difference, if any, between an option’s exercise price and
    the market price of the Company’s stock at the measurement
    date, the point at which the terms and the recipients of the
    option grant are determined with finality. In some instances, we
    incorrectly determined the measurement date for accounting
    purposes to be the date as of which the exercise price was set
    rather than the date the grants were finalized. As a result,
    compensation expense in the pretax amount of $40.6 should have
    been recorded over the years 1996 through 2003.

In accordance with SAB No. 108, the materiality of
    these newly-identified errors was assessed against prior periods
    using the Company’s pre-SAB No. 108 policy
    (“iron-curtain” method) for quantifying materiality.
    After considering all of the quantitative and qualitative
    factors these errors were not considered to be material to prior
    periods. Given that the effect of correcting these errors during
    2006 would cause our 2006 financial statements to be materially
    misstated, the Company concluded that the cumulative effect
    adjustment method of initially applying the guidance in
    SAB No. 108 was appropriate. The impact of the
    cumulative effect adjustment was a $26.4 charge to accumulated
    deficit, a $23.3 credit to additional paid-in capital and a $3.1
    credit to other non-current liabilities to reflect certain taxes
    payable effective January 1, 2006. The following table
    shows the impact on the previously reported accounts as of
    December 31, 2005 adjusted effective January 1, 2006:

Out-of-Period
    Adjustments

During 2006, we recorded adjustments to certain vendor discounts
    and credits, contractual liabilities, foreign exchange, tax and
    other miscellaneous items which related to prior periods.
    Because these changes are not material to our financial
    statements for the periods prior to 2006, for the quarters of

Out-of-Period

Adjustments:

Vendor Discounts and Credits

— In connection
    with our 2005 Restatement certain liabilities were recorded that
    were determined at that time to be a contractual obligation to
    clients. The revenue adjustment primarily relates to obtaining
    certain evidence in the fourth quarter of 2006 indicating that
    no actual contractual obligation existed in regard to those
    clients. The loss from continuing operations adjustment also
    includes a concession payment to a certain client.

Contractual Liabilities

— As part of our
    remediation efforts for accounting for purchase business
    combinations we mandated a procedure whereby compensatory
    earn-out liabilities should be evaluated quarterly to ensure
    that the amount being accrued is still appropriate. As a result,
    we identified an instance where the earn-out liability was
    overstated and should have been adjusted in prior periods based
    on the future financial performance projections for that
    respective acquired entity.

Foreign Exchange Adjustments

— We recorded
    adjustments related to the cumulative translation adjustment
    balances that remained on our books and records subsequent to
    the sale of certain agencies. In accordance with
    SFAS No. 52,

Foreign Currency Translation

,
    these amounts should have been reported as part of the gain or
    loss on sale or liquidation of the respective agency during the
    period in which that transaction occurred.

Other Adjustments

— Primarily relates to an
    adjustment to one of our cost investments of $4.1 which had been
    inappropriately marked to market.

Tax Adjustments

— Includes the tax effect of
    the adjustments noted above and the correction of certain
    deferred tax assets and liabilities.

As discussed in Note 2, as a result of two strategic

    of this change for the three months ended June 30, 2006.


As discussed in Note 21, we recorded adjustments to certain
    vendor discounts and credits, contractual liabilities, foreign
    exchange, tax and other miscellaneous items which related to
    prior periods. For the fourth quarter of 2006, these adjustments
    resulted in a net favorable impact to revenue of $8.3, net
    favorable impact to salaries and related expenses of $4.2, net
    unfavorable impact to office and general expenses of $2.8 and a
    net favorable impact to net income of $11.9. For the fourth
    quarter of 2005, these adjustments resulted in a net unfavorable
    impact to revenue, salaries and related expenses and office and
    general expenses of $17.3, $3.2 and $6.1, respectively, and a
    net favorable impact to provision for income taxes and net loss

Management’s Assessment of Internal Control over Financial
    Reporting and the Report of Independent Registered Public
    Accounting Firm located in Item 8 are incorporated by
    reference herein.

Disclosure
    controls and procedures

We have carried out an evaluation under the supervision of, and
    with the participation of, our management, including the Chief
    Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the
    effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure
    controls and procedures as of December 31, 2006. Our
    evaluation has disclosed numerous material weaknesses in our
    internal control over financial reporting as noted in
    Management’s Assessment of Internal Control over Financial
    Reporting located in Item 8. Based on an evaluation of
    these material weaknesses, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
    Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls
    and procedures are not effective as of December 31, 2006,
    to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be
    disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the
    Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded,
    processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods
    specified in the applicable rules and forms, and that it is
    accumulated and communicated to our management, including our
    Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, as
    appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
    disclosure.

There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any
    system of disclosure controls and procedures, including the
    possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding
    of the controls and procedures. Accordingly, even effective
    disclosure controls and procedures can only provide reasonable
    assurance of achieving their control objectives.

Changes

As described in “Remediation of Certain Material Weaknesses
    in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Disclosed in our
    2005 Annual Report on

which is located in Item 8 and is incorporated by reference
    herein, there were changes in internal control during the fourth
