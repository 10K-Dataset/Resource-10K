						PART I


Item 1.	Business

The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc. was incorporated in 
Delaware in September 1930 under the name of McCann-Erickson 
Incorporated as the successor to the advertising agency 
businesses founded in 1902 by A.W. Erickson and in 1911 by 
Harrison K. McCann.  It has operated under the Interpublic name 
since January 1961.  As used in this Annual Report, the 
"Registrant" or "Interpublic" refers to The Interpublic Group of 
Companies, Inc. while the "Company" refers to Interpublic and its 
subsidiaries.

The advertising agency business is the primary business of 
the Company.  This business is conducted throughout the world 
through three advertising agency systems, McCann-Erickson 
WorldGroup, Ammirati Puris Lintas and The Lowe Group, plus a 
number of stand alone local agencies.  Interpublic also carries 
on a media buying business through its ownership of Western 
Initiative Media Worldwide and its affiliates, as well as a 
separate direct and promotional marketing business through its 
ownership of DraftWorldwide Inc., a global public relations 
capability through International Public Relations, and a multi-
national sports and event marketing organization, Octagon.  The 
Company also offers advertising agency services through 
association arrangements with local agencies in various parts of 
the world.  Other activities conducted by the Company within the 
area of "marketing communications" include brand equity and 
corporate identity services, graphic design, management 
consulting, market research, sales promotion, interactive 
services, sales meetings and events, and other related 
specialized marketing and communications services.

The principal functions of an advertising agency are to plan 
and create advertising programs for its clients and to place 
advertising in various media such as television, cinema, radio, 
magazines, newspapers, direct mail, outdoor and interactive 
electronic media.  The planning function involves analysis of the 
market for the particular product or service, evaluation of 
alternative methods of distribution and choice of the appropriate 
media to reach the desired market most efficiently.  The 
advertising agency develops a communications strategy and then 
creates an advertising program, within the limits imposed by the 
client's advertising budget, and places orders for space or time 
with the media that have been selected.


The principal advertising agency subsidiaries of Interpublic 
operating within the United States directly or through 
subsidiaries and the locations of their respective corporate 
headquarters are:

Ammirati Puris Lintas Inc.........		New York, New York

three years, reference is made to Note 12: Geographic Areas of 
the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the 
Company's Annual Report to Stockholders for the year ended 
December 31, 1998, which Note is hereby incorporated by 
reference.

Developments in 1998

The Company completed a number of acquisitions within the 
United States and abroad in 1998. 


See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
incorporated by reference in this Report on Form 10-K for a 
discussion of acquisitions.

Income from Commissions and Fees

The Company generates income from planning, creating and 
placing advertising in various media and from planning and 
executing other communications or marketing programs.  
Historically, the commission customary in the industry was 15% of 
the gross charge ("billings") for advertising space or time; more 
recently lower commissions have been negotiated, but often with 
additional incentives for better performance.  For example, an 
incentive component is frequently included in arrangements with 
clients based on improvements in an advertised brand's awareness 
or image, or increases in a client's sales of the products or 
services being advertised.  Under commission arrangements, media 
bill the Company at their gross rates.  The Company bills these 
amounts to its clients, remits the net charges to the media and 
retains the balance as its commission.  Some clients, however, 
prefer to compensate the Company on a fee basis, under which the 
Company bills its client for the net charges billed by the media 
plus an agreed-upon fee.  These fees usually are calculated to 
reflect the Company's salary costs and out-of-pocket expenses 
incurred on the client's behalf, plus proportional overhead and a 
profit mark-up.

Normally, the Company, like other agencies, is primarily 
responsible for paying the media with respect to firm contracts 
for advertising time or space.  This is a problem only if the 
client is unable to pay the Company because of insolvency or 
bankruptcy.  The Company makes serious efforts to reduce the risk 
from a client's insolvency, including (1) carrying out credit 
clearances, (2) requiring in some cases payment of media in 
advance, or (3) agreeing with the media that the Company will be 
solely liable to pay the media only after the client has paid the 
Company for the media charges.

The Company also receives commissions from clients for 
planning and supervising work done by outside contractors in the
physical preparation of finished print advertisements and the 
production of television and radio commercials and other forms of 
advertising.  This commission is customarily 17.65% of the 
outside contractor's net charge, which is the same as 15% of the 
outside contractor's total charges including commission.  With 
the spread of negotiated fees, the terms on which outstanding 
contractors' charges are billed are subject to wide variations 
and even include in some instances the elimination of commissions 
entirely provided that there are adequate negotiated fees.
The Company derives income in many other ways, including the 
planning and placement in media of advertising produced by 
unrelated advertising agencies; the maintenance of specialized 
media placement facilities; the creation and publication of 
brochures, billboards, point of sale materials and direct 
marketing pieces for clients; the planning and carrying out of 
specialized marketing research; managing special events at which 
clients' products are featured; and designing and carrying out 
interactive programs for special uses.

The five clients of the Company that made the largest 
contribution in 1998 to income from commissions and fees 
accounted individually for 1.7% to 7.4% of such income and in the 
aggregate accounted for over 18% of such income.  Twenty clients 
of the Company accounted for approximately 30% of such income.  
Based on income from commissions and fees, the three largest 
clients of the Company are General Motors Corporation, Nestle and 
Unilever.  General Motors Corporation first became a client of 
one of the Company's agencies in 1916 in the United States.  
Predecessors of several of the Lintas agencies have supplied 
advertising services to Unilever since 1893.  The client 
relationship with Nestle began in 1940 in Argentina.  While the 
loss of the entire business of one of the Company's three largest 
clients might have a material adverse effect upon the business of 
the Company, the Company believes that it is very unlikely that 
the entire business of any of these clients would be lost at the 
same time, because it represents several different brands or 
divisions of each of these clients in a number of geographical 
markets - in each case through more than one of the Company's 
agency systems. 

Representation of a client rarely means that the Company 
handles advertising for all brands or product lines of the client 
in all geographical locations.  Any client may transfer its 
business from an advertising agency within the Company to a 
competing agency, and a client may reduce its advertising budget 
at any time.

The Company's agencies in many instances have written 
contracts with their clients.  As is customary in the industry, 
these contracts provide for termination by either party on 
relatively short notice, usually 90 days but sometimes shorter or 
longer.  In 1998, however, 23% of income from commissions and 
fees was derived from clients that had been associated with one 
or more of the Company's agencies or their predecessors for 20 or 
more years.


Personnel

As of January 1, 1999, the Company employed more than 34,000 
persons, of whom nearly 14,000 were employed in the United 
States.  Because of the personal service character of the 
marketing communications business, the quality of personnel is of 
crucial importance to continuing success.  There is keen 
competition for qualified employees.  Interpublic considers its 
employee relations to be satisfactory.

The Company has an active program for training personnel.  
The program includes meetings and seminars throughout the world. 
It also involves training personnel in its offices in New York 
and in its larger offices worldwide.

Competition and Other Factors

The advertising agency and other marketing communications 
businesses are highly competitive.  The Company's agencies and 
media services must compete with other agencies and with other 
providers of creative or media services which are not themselves 
advertising agencies, in order to maintain existing client 
relationships and to obtain new clients.  Competition in the 
advertising agency business depends to a large extent on the 
client's perception of the quality of an agency's "creative 
product".  An agency's ability to serve clients, particularly 
large international clients, on a broad geographic basis is also 
an important competitive consideration. On the other hand, 
because an agency's principal asset is its people, freedom of 
entry into the business is almost unlimited and quite small 
agencies are, on occasion, able to take all or some portion of a 
client's account from a much larger competitor.

Moreover, increasing size brings limitations to an agency's 
potential for securing new business, because many clients prefer 
not to be represented by an agency that represents a competitor. 
Also, clients frequently wish to have different products 
represented by different agencies.  The fact that the Company 
owns three separate worldwide agency systems and interests in 
other advertising agencies gives it additional competitive 
opportunities.

The advertising business is subject to government 
regulation, both domestic and foreign.  There has been an 
increasing tendency in the United States on the part of 
advertisers to resort to the courts, industry and self-regulatory


bodies to challenge comparative advertising on the grounds that 
the advertising is false and deceptive.  Through the years, there 
has been a continuing expansion of specific rules, prohibitions, 
media restrictions, labeling disclosures and warning requirements 
with respect to the advertising for certain products.  
Representatives within state governments and the federal 
government as well as foreign governments continue to initiate 
proposals to ban the advertising of specific products and to 
impose taxes on or deny deductions for advertising which, if 
successful, may have an adverse effect on advertising 
expenditures.

Some countries are relaxing commercial restrictions as part 
of their efforts to attract foreign investment.  However, with 
respect to other nations, the international operations of the 
Company still remain exposed to certain risks which affect 
foreign operations of all kinds, such as local legislation, 
monetary devaluation, exchange control restrictions and unstable 
political conditions.  In addition, international advertising 
agencies are still subject to ownership restrictions in certain 
countries because they are considered an integral factor in the 
communications process.

Statement Regarding Forward Looking Disclosure

Certain sections of this report, including "Business", 
"Competition and Other Factors" and "Management's Discussion and 
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" 
contain forward looking statements concerning future events and 
developments that involve risks and uncertainties, including 
those associated with the effect of national and regional 
economic conditions, the ability of the Company to attract new 
clients and retain existing clients, the financial success of 
clients of the Company, other developments of clients of the 
Company, and developments from changes in the regulatory and 
legal environment for advertising agencies around the world.

Year 2000 Compliance

Many currently installed computer systems and software 
products are coded to accept only two-digit entries in the date 
code field.  Beginning in the year 2000, these date code fields 
will need to accept four-digit entries to distinguish 21st 
century dates from 20th century dates.  As a result, computer 
systems and/or software used by the Company will need to be 
upgraded to comply with such "Year 2000" requirements. Further 
discussion of this issue is contained in the section of this 
Report entitled "Management's Discussion and Analysis of 
Financial Condition and Results of Operations."
Item 2.	Properties

Most of the operations of the Company are conducted in 
leased premises, and its physical property consists primarily of 
leasehold improvements, furniture, fixtures and equipment.  These 
facilities are located in various cities in which the Company 
does business throughout the world.  However, subsidiaries of the 
Company own office buildings in Louisville, Kentucky; Garden 
City, New York; Blair, Nebraska; Warren, Michigan; Frankfurt, 
Germany; Sao Paulo, Brazil; Lima, Peru; Mexico City, Mexico; 
Santiago, Chile ; and Brussels, Belgium and own office 
condominiums in Buenos Aires, Argentina; Bogota, Colombia; 
Manila, the Philippines; in England, subsidiaries of the Company 
own office buildings in London, Manchester, Birmingham and Stoke-
on-Trent.

The Company's ownership of the office building in Frankfurt 
is subject to three mortgages which became effective on or about 
February 1993.  These mortgages terminate at different dates, 
with the last to expire in February 2003.  Reference is made to 
Note 10: Long-Term Debt, of the Notes to the Consolidated 
Financial Statements in the Company's Annual Report to 
Stockholders for the year ended December 31, 1998, which Note is 
hereby incorporated by reference.
