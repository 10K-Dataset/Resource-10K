PART I

Item 1.

Business

The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc. was incorporated in
Delaware in September 1930 under the name of McCann-Erickson
Incorporated as the successor to the advertising agency
businesses founded in 1902 by A.W. Erickson and in 1911 by
Harrison K. McCann. The Company has operated under the
Interpublic name since January 1961.

Our Client Offerings

The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc., together with its
subsidiaries (the “Company”, “Interpublic”,
“we”, “us” or “our”), is one of
the world’s largest advertising and marketing services
companies, comprised of hundreds of communication agencies
around the world that deliver custom marketing solutions on
behalf of our clients. Our agencies cover the spectrum of
marketing disciplines and specialties, from traditional services
such as consumer advertising and direct marketing, to services
such as experiential marketing and branded entertainment. With
offices in over 100 countries and approximately 43,000
employees, our agencies work with our clients to create global
and local marketing campaigns. These marketing programs seek to
build brands, influence consumer behavior and sell products.

To meet the challenge of an increasingly complex consumer
culture, we create customized marketing solutions for each of
our clients. Engagements between clients and agencies fall into
five basic categories, or models. In the

single-discipline
model

, clients work directly with one agency in one
discipline. The

project collaboration model

is employed
when sister agencies are brought in on a project basis as a
client’s needs expand. In the

integrated

agency-of

-record
model

, a multi-disciplinary agency provides a fuller range
of marketing services for a client. The

lead company model

is applied when a lead agency manages the work at several of
our agencies. Finally, in the

virtual network model

,
clients have a representative at the holding company level to
oversee the fullest range of our marketing spectrum.

While our agencies work on behalf of our clients using one of
these models, we provide resources and support to ensure that
our agencies can best meet our clients’ needs. Based in New
York City, the holding company sets company-wide financial
objectives, directs collaborative inter-agency programs,
establishes fiscal management and operational controls, guides
personnel policy, conducts investor relations and initiates,
manages and approves mergers and acquisitions. In addition, it
provides limited centralized functional services that offer our
companies some operational efficiencies, including accounting
and finance, marketing information retrieval and analysis, legal
services, real estate expertise, recruitment aid, employee
benefits and executive compensation management.

Our Disciplines and Agencies

We have hundreds of specialized agencies. The following is a
sample of some of our brands.

Our

global networks

offer our largest clients a full
range of marketing and communications services. Combined, their
footprint spans over 100 countries:

•

McCann Erickson Worldwide

•

Foote Cone & Belding Worldwide

•

Lowe Worldwide

We have many

full-service marketing agencies

whose
distinctive resources provide clients with multi-disciplinary
communication services:

•

Campbell-Ewald

•

Carmichael Lynch

•

Deutsch



•

Hill Holliday

•

Mullen

We also have many

domestic advertising agencies

that
provide North American clients with traditional services in
print and broadcast media:

Our

one-to

-one
marketing companies

specialize in using a full range of
digital, interactive and traditional media services to
communicate directly with consumers in relevant and innovative
ways:

The worldwide leader in

experiential marketing,

Jack
Morton Worldwide, is part of our group. Jack Morton creates
interactive experiences whose goal is to improve performance,
increase sales and build brand recognition. The agency produces
meetings and events, environmental design, exhibits, digital
media and learning programs.

Our

media offering

addresses changes in today’s
fragmented media landscape, with capabilities in planning,
research, negotiating and buying, as well as media research,
product placement and programming. Our major media agencies are:

•

Initiative

•

MAGNA Global

•

Universal McCann

To help activate consumer demand, our

promotion agencies

offer clients a range of options, including sweepstakes,
incentive programs, sampling opportunities and trade programming:



Our

public relations

agencies offer such worldwide
services as consumer PR, corporate communications, crisis
management, web relations and investor relations:

We also have

special marketing services agencies

that we
believe are

best-in

-class for their
niche markets:

Our

sports and entertainment marketing

firms manage top
athletes and sporting events and represent some of the
world’s most-recognized celebrities:

Our affiliated

multicultural agency partners,

in which we
own a minority interest, target specific demographic segments:

Interpublic maintains separate agency brands to manage the
broadest range of clients, even ones that operate in similar
business areas. Having distinct agencies allows us to avoid
potential conflicts of interest among our clients in the same
industry. To help manage these companies effectively, however,
we have organized our agencies into five global operating
divisions. Four of these divisions, McCann WorldGroup
(“McCann”), The FCB Group (“FCB”), Lowe
Worldwide (“Lowe”) and Draft Worldwide
(“Draft”), provide a distinct comprehensive array of
global communications and marketing services. The fifth global
operating division, The Constituency Management Group
(“CMG”), which includes Weber Shandwick, MWW Group,
FutureBrand, DeVries, Golin Harris, Jack Morton and Octagon
Worldwide (“Octagon”), provides clients with
diversified services, including public relations, meeting and
event production, sports and entertainment marketing, corporate
and brand identity and strategic marketing consulting.



A group of leading stand-alone agencies provide clients with a
full range of advertising and marketing services. These agencies
partner with our global operating groups as needed, and include
Campbell-Ewald, Hill Holliday, Deutsch and Mullen.

We believe this organizational structure allows us to provide
comprehensive solutions for clients and enables stronger
financial and operational growth opportunities. We practice a
decentralized management style, providing agency management with
a great deal of operational autonomy.

Our Financial Reporting Segments

As of December 31, 2005, for financial reporting purposes
we have three reportable segments. The largest segment,
Integrated Agency Networks (“IAN”), is comprised of
McCann, FCB, Lowe, Draft, our media agencies, and our leading
stand-alone agencies. CMG comprises our second reportable
segment. Our third reportable segment is comprised of our
Motorsports operations (“Motorsports”), which were
sold during 2004 and had immaterial residual operating results
in 2005. See Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements for further discussion.

Principal Markets

Our agencies are located in over 100 countries and in every
significant world market. We provide services for clients whose
businesses are broadly international in scope, as well as for
clients whose businesses are limited to a single country or a
small number of countries. The United States (“U.S.”),
Europe (excluding the United Kingdom (“UK”)), the UK,
Asia Pacific and Latin America represented 55.2%, 18.1%, 9.9%,
7.5% and 4.1% of our total revenue, respectively, in 2005. For
further discussion concerning revenues and long-lived assets on
a geographical basis for each of the last three years, see
Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Sources of Revenue

Our revenues are primarily derived from the planning and
execution of advertising programs in various media and the
planning and execution of other marketing and communications
programs. Most of our client contracts are individually
negotiated. Accordingly, the terms of client engagements and the
basis on which we earn commissions and fees vary significantly.
Our client contracts are becoming increasingly complex
arrangements that frequently include provisions for incentive
compensation and govern vendor rebates and credits. Our largest
clients are multinational entities and we often provide services
to these clients out of multiple offices and across various
agencies. In arranging for such services to be provided, we may
enter into global, regional and local agreements. Multiple
agreements of this nature are reviewed by legal counsel to
determine the governing terms to be followed by the offices and
agencies involved.

Revenues for creation, planning and placement of advertising are
primarily determined on a negotiated fee basis and, to a lesser
extent, on a commission basis. Fees are usually calculated to
reflect hourly rates plus proportional overhead and a mark-up.
Many clients include an incentive compensation component in
their total compensation package. This provides added revenue
based on achieving mutually agreed-upon qualitative and/or
quantitative metrics within specified time periods. Commissions
are earned based on services provided, and are usually derived
from a percentage or fee over the total cost to complete the
assignment. Commissions can also be derived when clients pay us
the gross rate billed by media and we pay for media at a lower
net rate; the difference is the commission that we earn, which
is either retained in total or shared with the client depending
on the nature of the services agreement.

We pay media charges with respect to contracts for advertising
time or space that we place on behalf of our clients. To reduce
our risk from a client’s non-payment, we typically pay
media charges only after we receive funds from our clients.
Generally, we act as the client’s agent rather than the
primary obligor. In some instances we agree with the media
provider that we will only be liable to pay the media after the
client has paid us for the media charges.



We also generate revenue in negotiated fees from our public
relations, sales promotion, event marketing, sports and
entertainment marketing and corporate and brand identity
services.

Our revenue is directly dependent upon the advertising,
marketing and corporate communications requirements of our
clients and tends to be higher in the second half of the
calendar year as a result of the holiday season and lower in the
first half as a result of the post-holiday slow-down in client
activity. Depending on the terms of the client contract, fees
for services performed can be primarily recognized three ways:
proportional performance, straight-line (or monthly basis) or
completed contract. Fee revenue recognized on a completed
contract basis also contributes to the higher seasonal revenues
experienced in the fourth quarter due to the majority of our
contracts ending at December 31. As is customary in the
industry, these contracts provide for termination by either
party on relatively short notice, usually 90 days. See
Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further
discussion of our revenue recognition accounting policies.

Clients

In the aggregate, our top ten clients based on revenue accounted
for approximately 24.7% and 23.5% of revenue in 2005 and 2004,
respectively. Based on revenue for the year ended
December 31, 2005, our largest clients were General Motors
Corporation, Microsoft, Unilever, Johnson & Johnson,
and Verizon. While the loss of the entire business of any one of
our largest clients might have a material adverse effect upon
our business, we believe that it is unlikely that the entire
business of any of these clients would be lost at the same time.
This is because we represent several different brands or
divisions of each of these clients in a number of geographic
markets, as well as provide services across multiple advertising
and marketing disciplines, in each case through more than one of
our agency systems. Representation of a client rarely means that
we handle advertising for all brands or product lines of the
client in all geographical locations. Any client may transfer
its business from one of our agencies to a competing agency, and
a client may reduce its marketing budget at any time.

Personnel

As of December 31, 2005, we employed approximately 43,000
persons, of whom approximately 18,000 were employed in the
U.S. Because of the personal service character of the
advertising and marketing communications business, the quality
of personnel is of crucial importance to our continuing success.
There is keen competition for qualified employees.

Item 1A.

Risk Factors

We are subject to a variety of possible risks that could
adversely impact our revenues, results of operations or
financial condition. Some of these risks relate to the industry
in which we operate, while others are more specific to us. The
following factors set out potential risks we have identified
that could adversely affect us. See also Statement Regarding
Forward-Looking Disclosure.

•

We have numerous material weaknesses in our internal
    control over financial reporting.

We have identified numerous material weaknesses in our internal
control over financial reporting, and our internal control over
financial reporting was not effective as of December 31,
2005. For a detailed description of these material weaknesses,
see Item 8, Management’s Assessment on Internal
Control Over Financial Reporting, of our
Form

10-K.

Each of
our material weaknesses results in more than a remote likelihood
that a material misstatement will not be prevented or detected.
As a result, we must perform extensive additional work to obtain
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial
statements. Given the extensive material weaknesses identified,
even with this additional work there is a risk of errors not
being prevented or detected, which could result in further
restatements.



•

We have extensive work remaining to remedy the material
    weaknesses in our internal control over financial
    reporting.

Because of our decentralized structure and our many disparate
accounting systems of varying quality and sophistication, we
have extensive work remaining to remedy our material weaknesses
in internal control over financial reporting. We are in the
process of developing a work plan for remedying all of the
identified material weaknesses, and this work will extend beyond
2006. There can be no assurance as to when the remediation plan
will be completed or when the material weaknesses will be
remedied. There will also continue to be a serious risk that we
will be unable to file future periodic reports with the SEC in a
timely manner, that a default could result under the indentures
governing our debt securities or under our three-year revolving
credit agreement (the “Three-Year Revolving Credit
Facility”) or credit facilities of our subsidiaries and
that our future financial statements could contain errors that
will be undetected.

•

We face substantial ongoing costs associated with
    complying with the requirements of Section 404 of the
    Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

As a result of the extent of the deficiencies in our internal
control over financial reporting, we incurred significant
professional fees and other expenses in 2005 to prepare our
consolidated financial statements and to comply with the
requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.
Until our remediation is completed, we will continue to incur
the expenses and management burdens associated with the manual
procedures and additional resources required to prepare our
consolidated financial statements. The cost of this work will
continue to be significant in 2006 and beyond.

•

We have restated our financial statements.

We may continue to suffer adverse effects from the restatement
of previously issued financial statements that we presented in
our annual report on
Form

10-K

for the
year ended December 31, 2004, as amended (the “2004
Form

10-K”).

In the 2004
Form

10-K,

we
restated our previously reported financial statements for the
years ended December 31, 2003, 2002, 2001 and 2000, and for
the first three quarters of 2004 and all four quarters of 2003
(the “Prior Restatement”). In this report, we have
restated the financial data for the first three quarters of 2005.

As a result of these matters, we have recorded liabilities for
vendor discounts and other obligations that will necessitate
cash settlement that may negatively impact our cash flow in
future years. We may also become subject to fines or other
penalties or damages in our ongoing SEC investigation or new
regulatory actions or civil litigation. Any of these matters may
also contribute to further ratings downgrades, negative
publicity and difficulties in attracting and retaining key
clients, employees and management personnel.

•

Ongoing SEC investigations regarding our accounting
    restatements could adversely affect us.

The SEC opened a formal investigation in response to the
restatement we first announced in August 2002 and, as previously
disclosed, the SEC staff’s investigation has expanded to
encompass our Prior Restatement. In particular, since we filed
our 2004
Form

10-K,

we have
received subpoenas from the SEC relating to matters addressed in
our Prior Restatement. We continue to cooperate with the
investigation. We expect that the investigation will result in
monetary liability, but because the investigation is ongoing, in
particular with respect to the Prior Restatement, we cannot
reasonably estimate either the timing of a resolution or the
amount. Accordingly, we have not yet established any accounting
provision relating to these matters. Potential adverse
developments in connection with the investigation, including any
expansion of the scope of the investigation, could also
negatively impact us and could divert the efforts and attention
of our management team from our ordinary business operations.

•

We operate in a highly competitive industry.

The marketing communications business is highly competitive. Our
agencies and media services must compete with other agencies,
and with other providers of creative or media services, in order
to maintain existing client relationships and to win new
clients. The client’s perception of the quality of an
agency’s creative work, our reputation and the
agencies’ reputations are important factors in determining
our



competitive position. An agency’s ability to serve clients,
particularly large international clients, on a broad geographic
basis is also an important competitive consideration. On the
other hand, because an agency’s principal asset is its
people, freedom of entry into the business is almost unlimited
and a small agency is, on occasion, able to take all or some
portion of a client’s account from a much larger competitor.

Many companies put their advertising and marketing
communications business up for competitive review from time to
time. We have won and lost client accounts in the past as a
result of such periodic competitions. Our ability to attract new
clients and to retain existing clients may also, in some cases,
be limited by clients’ policies or perceptions about
conflicts of interest. These policies can, in some cases,
prevent one agency, or even different agencies under our
ownership, from performing similar services for competing
products or companies.

In addition, issues arising from our deficiencies in our
internal control over financial reporting could divert the
efforts and attention of our management from our ordinary
business operations or have an adverse impact on clients’
perceptions of us and adversely affect our overall ability to
compete for new and existing business.

•

We may lose or fail to attract and retain key employees
    and management personnel.

Employees, including creative, research, media, account and
practice group specialists, and their skills and relationships
with clients, are among our most important assets. An important
aspect of our competitiveness is our ability to attract and
retain key employees and management personnel. Our ability to do
so is influenced by a variety of factors, including the
compensation we award, and could be adversely affected by our
recent financial performance and financial reporting
difficulties.

•

As a marketing services company, our revenues are highly
    susceptible to declines as a result of unfavorable economic
    conditions.

Economic downturns often more severely affect the marketing
services industry than other industries. In the past, some
clients have responded to weak economic performance in any
region where we operate by reducing their marketing budgets,
which are generally discretionary in nature and easier to reduce
in the short-term than other expenses related to operations.
This pattern may recur in the future.

•

Our liquidity profile has recently been adversely
    affected.

In recent periods we have experienced operating losses that have
adversely affected our cash flows from operations. We have
recorded liabilities and incurred substantial professional fees
in connection with the Prior Restatement. It is also possible
that we will be required to pay fines or other penalties or
damages in connection with the ongoing SEC investigation or
future regulatory actions or civil litigation. These items have
impacted and will impact our liquidity in future years
negatively and could require us to seek new or additional
sources of liquidity to fund our working capital needs. There
can be no guarantee that we would be able to access any such new
sources of new liquidity on commercially reasonable terms or at
all. If we are unable to do so, our liquidity position could be
adversely affected.

•

Downgrades of our credit ratings could adversely affect
    us.

Our long-term debt is currently rated B+ with negative outlook
by Standard and Poor’s, Ba1 with negative outlook by
Moody’s, and B+ with stable outlook by Fitch. It is
possible that our credit ratings will be reduced further.
Ratings downgrades or comparatively weak ratings can adversely
affect us, because ratings are an important factor influencing
our ability to access capital. Our clients and vendors may also
consider our credit profile when negotiating contract terms, and
if they were to change the terms on which they deal with us, it
could have a significant adverse affect on our liquidity.

•

If some of our clients experience financial distress,
    their weakened financial position could negatively affect our
    own financial position and results.

We have a large and diverse client base and at any given time,
one or more of our clients may experience financial distress,
file for bankruptcy protection or go out of business. If any
client with whom we have a substantial amount of business
experiences financial difficulty, it could delay or jeopardize
the



collection of accounts receivable, may result in significant
reductions in services provided by us and may have a material
adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations
and liquidity. For a description of our client base, see
Item 1, Business- Clients.

•

International business risks could adversely affect our
    operations.

International revenues represent a significant portion of our
revenues, approximately 45% in 2005. Our international
operations are exposed to risks that affect foreign operations
of all kinds, including local legislation, monetary devaluation,
exchange control restrictions and unstable political conditions.
These risks may limit our ability to grow our business and
effectively manage our operations in those countries. In
addition, because a high level of our revenues and expenses is
denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar,
primarily the Euro and Pound Sterling, fluctuations in exchange
rates between the U.S. dollar and such currencies may
materially affect our financial results.

•

In 2005 and prior years, we recognized impairment charges
    and increased our deferred tax valuation allowances, and we may
    be required to record additional charges in the future related
    to these matters.

We evaluate all of our long-lived assets (including goodwill,
other intangible assets and fixed assets), investments and
deferred tax assets for possible impairment or realizability at
least annually and whenever there is an indication of impairment
or lack of realizability. If certain criteria are met, we are
required to record an impairment charge or valuation allowance.
In the past, we have recorded substantial amounts of goodwill,
investment and other impairment charges, and have been required
to establish substantial valuation allowances with respect to
deferred tax assets and loss carry-forwards.

As of December 31, 2005, we have substantial amounts of
intangibles, investments and deferred tax assets on our
Consolidated Balance Sheet. Future events, including our
financial performance and strategic decisions, could cause us to
conclude that further impairment indicators exist and that the
asset values associated with intangibles, investments and
deferred tax assets may have become impaired. Any resulting
impairment loss would have an adverse impact on our reported
earnings in the period in which the charge is recognized. In
connection with the U.S. deferred tax assets, management
believes that it is more likely than not that a substantial
amount of the deferred tax assets will be realized; a valuation
allowance has been established for the remainder. The amount of
the deferred tax assets considered realizable, however, could be
reduced in the near term if estimates of future
U.S. taxable income are lower than anticipated.

•

We are subject to certain restrictions and must meet
    certain minimum financial covenants under our Three-Year
    Revolving Credit Facility.

Our Three-Year Revolving Credit Facility contains covenants that
limit our operational flexibility and require us to meet
specified financial ratios. The Three-Year Revolving Credit
Facility does not permit us (i) to make cash acquisitions
in excess of $50.0 million until October 2006, or
thereafter in excess of $50.0 million until expiration of
the agreement in May 2007, subject to increases equal to the net
cash proceeds received in the applicable period from any
disposition of assets; (ii) to make capital expenditures in
excess of $210.0 million annually; (iii) to repurchase
or to declare or pay dividends on our capital stock (except for
any convertible preferred stock, convertible trust preferred
instrument or similar security, which includes our outstanding
5.375% Series A Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock and
our 5.25% Series B Cumulative Convertible Perpetual
Preferred Stock), except that we may repurchase our capital
stock in connection with the exercise of options by our
employees or with proceeds contemporaneously received from an
issue of new shares of our capital stock; and (iv) to incur
new debt at our subsidiaries, other than unsecured debt incurred
in the ordinary course of business of our subsidiaries outside
the U.S. and unsecured debt, which may not exceed
$10.0 million in the aggregate, incurred in the ordinary
course of business of our U.S. subsidiaries. Under the
Three-Year Revolving Credit Facility, we are also subject to
financial covenants with respect to our interest coverage ratio,
debt to EBITDA ratio and minimum EBITDA.

We have in the past been required to seek and successfully have
obtained amendments and waivers of the financial covenants under
our committed bank facility. There can be no assurance that we
will be in compliance with these covenants in future periods. If
we do not comply and are unable to obtain the necessary
amendments or waivers at that time, we would be unable to borrow
or obtain additional letters



of credit under the Three-Year Revolving Credit Facility and
could choose to terminate the facility and provide a cash
deposit in connection with any outstanding letters of credit.
The lenders under the Three-Year Revolving Credit Facility would
also have the right to terminate the facility, accelerate any
outstanding principal and require us to provide a cash deposit
in an amount equal to the total amount of outstanding letters of
credit. The outstanding amount of letters of credit was
$162.4 million as of December 31, 2005. We have not
drawn under the Three-Year Revolving Credit Facility over the
past two years, and we do not currently expect to draw under it.
So long as there are no amounts to be accelerated under the
Three-Year Revolving Credit Facility, termination of the
facility would not trigger the cross-acceleration provisions of
our public debt.

Any future impairment charge (excluding valuation allowance
charges) could result in a violation of the financial covenants
of our Three-Year Revolving Credit Facility, which requires us
to maintain minimum levels of consolidated EBITDA (as defined in
that facility) and established ratios of debt to consolidated
EBITDA and interest coverage ratios. A violation of any of these
financial covenants could trigger a default under this facility
and adversely affect our liquidity.

•

We may not be able to meet our performance targets and
    milestones.

From time to time, we communicate to the market certain targets
and milestones for our financial and operating performance
including, but not limited to, the areas of revenue growth,
operating expense reduction and operating margin growth. These
targets and milestones are intended to provide metrics against
which to evaluate our performance, but they should not be
understood as predictions or guidance about our expected
performance. Our ability to meet any target or milestone is
subject to inherent risks and uncertainties, and we caution
investors against placing undue reliance on them. See
“Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Disclosure.”

•

We are subject to regulations and other governmental
    scrutiny that could restrict our activities or negatively impact
    our revenues.

Our industry is subject to government regulation and other
governmental action, both domestic and foreign. There has been
an increasing tendency on the part of advertisers and consumer
groups to challenge advertising through legislation, regulation,
the courts or otherwise, for example on the grounds that the
advertising is false and deceptive or injurious to public
welfare. Through the years, there has been a continuing
expansion of specific rules, prohibitions, media restrictions,
labeling disclosures and warning requirements with respect to
the advertising for certain products. Representatives within
government bodies, both domestic and foreign, continue to
initiate proposals to ban the advertising of specific products
and to impose taxes on or deny deductions for advertising,
which, if successful, may have an adverse effect on advertising
expenditures and consequently our revenues.

Item 1B.

Unresolved Staff Comments

None.

Item 2.

Properties

Substantially all of our office space is leased from third
parties. Several of our leases will be expiring within the next
few months, while the remainder will be expiring within the next
19 years. Certain leases are subject to rent reviews or
contain escalation clauses, and certain of our leases require
the payment of various operating expenses, which may also be
subject to escalation. Physical properties include leasehold
improvements, furniture, fixtures and equipment located in our
offices. We believe that facilities leased or owned by us are
adequate for the purposes for which they are currently used and
are well maintained. See Note 21 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements for a discussion of our lease commitments.



Item 3.

Legal Proceedings

We are or have been involved in legal and administrative
proceedings of various types. While any litigation contains an
element of uncertainty, we have no reason to believe that the
outcome of such proceedings or claims will have a material
adverse effect on our financial condition except as described
below.

SEC Investigation

The SEC opened a formal investigation in response to the
restatement we first announced in August 2002 and, as previously
disclosed, the SEC staff’s investigation has expanded to
encompass our Prior Restatement. In particular, since we filed
our 2004
Form

10-K,

we have
received subpoenas from the SEC relating to matters addressed in
our Prior Restatement. We continue to cooperate with the
investigation. We expect that the investigation will result in
monetary liability, but because the investigation is ongoing, in
particular with respect to the Prior Restatement, we cannot
reasonably estimate either the timing of a resolution or the
amount. Accordingly, we have not yet established any accounting
provision relating to these matters.

terms of our Three-Year Revolving Credit Facility limit our
ability to declare and pay dividends. For a discussion of the
restrictions under our Three-Year Revolving Credit Facility, see
Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations —
Liquidity and Capital Resources. In addition, the terms of our
outstanding series of preferred stock do not permit us to pay
dividends on our common stock unless all accumulated and unpaid
dividends have been or contemporaneously are declared and paid
or provision for the payment thereof has been made. Our future
dividend policy may also be influenced by the impact of our

Sales of Unregistered Securities

In the fourth quarter of 2005, we issued securities without
registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
“Securities Act”) in payment of deferred compensation
for acquisitions we made in earlier periods and for raising
capital. The specific transactions were as follows:

•

On November 21, 2005, we issued 77,006 shares of our
    common stock to two shareholders of a company in connection with
    the purchase of 31% of the shares of the company. The shares of
    our common stock were valued at $800,000 as of the date of
    issuance and were issued without registration in reliance on
    Regulation S under the Securities Act.

•

On October 24, 2005, we issued 525,000 shares of our
    5.25% Series B Cumulative Convertible Perpetual Preferred
    Stock (the “Series B Preferred Stock”) at an
    aggregate offering price of $525,000,000. The shares of our
    Series B Preferred Stock were sold on October 18, 2005
    in a private placement to a syndicate of initial purchasers at
    an aggregate discount of $15,750,000 and may be resold to
    qualified institutional buyers in reliance on the exemption from
    registration provided by Rule 144A under the Securities Act.

Each share of our Series B Preferred Stock may be converted
at any time, at the option of the holder, into
73.1904 shares of our common stock, which is equivalent to
an initial conversion price of approximately $13.66, plus cash
in lieu of fractional shares. The conversion rate is subject to
adjustment upon the occurrence of certain events. On or after
October 15, 2010, we may cause shares of our Series B
Preferred Stock to be automatically converted into shares of our
common stock at the then prevailing conversion rate if the
closing price of our common stock multiplied by the conversion
rate then in effect equals or exceeds 130% of the liquidation
preference for 20 trading days during any consecutive 30 trading
day period.

OVERVIEW

Our Business

We are one of the world’s largest advertising and marketing
services companies, comprised of hundreds of communication
agencies around the world that deliver custom marketing
solutions on behalf of our clients. Our agencies cover the
spectrum of marketing disciplines and specialties, from
traditional services such as consumer advertising and direct
marketing, to newer disciplines such as experiential marketing
and branded entertainment. With offices in over 100 countries
and approximately 43,000 employees, our agencies work with our
clients to create global and local marketing campaigns that
cross borders and media. These marketing programs seek to build
brands, influence consumer behavior and sell products.



THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS — (Continued)

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)

Interpublic maintains separate agency brands to manage the
broadest range of clients, even ones that operate in similar
business areas. Having distinct agencies allows us to avoid
potential conflicts of interest among our clients in the same
industry. To help manage these companies effectively, however,
we have organized our agencies into five global operating
divisions. Four of these divisions, McCann WorldGroup
(“McCann”), The FCB Group (“FCB”), Lowe
Worldwide (“Lowe”) and Draft Worldwide
(“Draft”), provide a distinct, comprehensive array of
global communications and marketing services. The fifth global
operating division, The Constituency Management Group
(“CMG”), which includes Weber Shandwick, MWW Group,
FutureBrand, DeVries, Golin Harris, Jack Morton and Octagon
Worldwide (“Octagon”), provides clients with
diversified services, including public relations, meeting and
event production, sports and entertainment marketing, corporate
and brand identity and strategic marketing consulting.

A group of leading stand-alone agencies provide clients with a
full range of advertising and marketing services. These agencies
partner with our global operating groups as needed, and include
Campbell-Ewald, Hill Holiday, Deutsch and Mullen.

We believe this organizational structure allows us to provide
comprehensive solutions for clients, enables stronger financial
and operational growth opportunities and allows us to improve
operating efficiencies within our organization. We practice a
decentralized management style, providing agency management with
a great deal of operational autonomy, while holding them broadly
responsible for their agencies’ financial and operational
performance.

As of December 31, 2005, for financial reporting purposes
we have three reportable segments. The largest segment,
Integrated Agency Networks (“IAN”), is comprised of
McCann, FCB, Lowe, Draft, our media agencies, and our leading
stand-alone agencies. CMG comprises our second reportable
segment. Our third reportable segment is comprised of our
Motorsports operations (“Motorsports”), which were
sold during 2004 and had immaterial residual operating results
in 2005.

Business Drivers

Our revenues are primarily derived from the planning and
execution of advertising programs in various media and the
planning and execution of other marketing and communications
programs. Most of our client contracts are individually
negotiated and accordingly, the terms of client engagements and
the basis on which we earn commissions and fees vary
significantly. Our client contracts are also becoming
increasingly complex arrangements that frequently include
provisions for incentive compensation and govern vendor rebates
and credits.

Revenues for creation, planning and placement of advertising are
primarily determined on a negotiated fee basis and, to a lesser
extent, on a commission basis. Fees are usually calculated to
reflect hourly rates plus proportional overhead and a mark-up.
Many clients include an incentive compensation component in
their total compensation package. This provides added revenue
based on achieving mutually agreed-upon qualitative and/or
quantitative metrics within specified time periods. Commissions
are earned based on services provided, and are usually derived
from a percentage or fee over the total cost to complete the
assignment. Commissions can also be derived when clients pay us
the gross rate billed by media and we pay for media at a lower
net rate; the difference is the commission that we earn, which
is either retained in total or shared with the client depending
on the nature of the services agreement.

We pay media charges with respect to contracts for advertising
time or space that we place on behalf of our clients. To reduce
our risk from a client’s non-payment, we typically pay
media charges only after we receive funds from our clients.
Generally, we act as the client’s agent rather than the
primary obligor. In some instances we agree with the media
provider that we will only be liable to pay the media after the
client has paid us for the media charges.



THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS — (Continued)

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)

We also generate revenue in negotiated fees from our public
relations, sales promotion, event marketing, sports and
entertainment marketing and corporate and brand identity
services.

Our revenue is directly dependent upon the advertising,
marketing and corporate communications requirements of our
clients and tends to be higher in the second half of the
calendar year as a result of the holiday season and lower in the
first half as a result of the post-holiday slow-down in client
activity. Depending on the terms of the client contract, fees
for services performed can be primarily recognized three ways:
proportional performance, straight-line (or monthly basis) or
completed contract. Fee revenue recognized on a completed
contract basis also contributes to the higher seasonal revenues
experienced in the fourth quarter due to the majority of our
contracts ending at December 31. As is customary in the
industry, these contracts provide for termination by either
party on relatively short notice, usually 90 days. See
Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further
discussion of our revenue recognition accounting policies.

Our revenue is driven by our ability to maintain and grow
existing business, as well as generate new business. Our
business is directly affected by economic conditions in the
industries and regions we serve and by the marketing and
advertising requirements and practices of our clients and
potential clients. When economic conditions decline, companies
generally decrease advertising and marketing budgets, and it
becomes more difficult to achieve profitability. Our business is
highly competitive, which tends to mitigate our pricing power
and that of our competition.

We believe that expanding the range of services we provide to
our key clients is critical to our continued growth. We are
focused on strengthening our collaboration across agencies,
which we believe will increase our ability to better service
existing clients and win new clients.

2005 Performance

The primary focus of our business analysis is on operating
performance, specifically, changes in revenues and operating
expenses.

We analyze the increase or decrease in revenue by reviewing the
components of the change, including: the impact of foreign
currency exchange rate changes, the impact of net acquisitions
and divestitures, and the balance, which we refer to as organic
revenue change. As economic conditions and demand for our
services can vary between geographic regions, we also analyze
revenues by domestic and international sources.

Our operating expenses are in two primary categories: salaries
and related expenses, and office and general expenses. As with
revenue, we analyze the increase or decrease in operating
expenses by reviewing the following components of the change:
the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes, the impact
of net acquisitions and divestitures, and the organic component
of the change. Salaries and related expenses tend to fluctuate
with changes in revenues and are measured as a percentage of
revenues. Office and general expenses, which have both a fixed
and variable component, tend not to vary as much with revenue.

Our financial performance over the past several years has lagged
behind that of our industry peers, due to lower revenue growth,
as well as impairment, restructuring and other charges. 2005
performance was impacted by higher salaries and related and
office and general expenses and lower revenues as discussed in
more detail below. However, both impairment and restructuring
charges have decreased and we are no longer burdened with
Motorsports related costs.

Strategic Initiatives

Organic revenue growth and improving operating margin are our
key corporate metrics. Our performance priorities are to:

•

Achieve organic revenue growth

by strengthening
    collaboration among our agencies, increasing the number of
    marketing services provided to existing clients and winning new
    clients. We have established a supplemental incentive plan,
    expanded internal tools and resources, and heightened internal
    communications aimed at encouraging collaboration. We have also
    focused our efforts on attracting and retaining the highest
    quality industry talent and further improving client retention.
    We analyze our performance by calculating the percentage
    increase in revenue related to organic growth between comparable
    periods.

•

Improve operating margin

by increasing revenue and by
    controlling salaries and related expenses, as well as office and
    general expenses. In addition, we are working to improve our
    back office efficiency through our shared services initiatives
    as well as improve our real estate utilization. We analyze our
    performance by comparing revenue to prior periods and measuring
    salaries and related expenses, as well as office and general
    expenses, as a percentage of revenue. We define operating margin
    as operating income divided by reported revenue.

Our revenue is directly dependent upon the advertising,
marketing and corporate communications requirements of our
clients. Historically, we typically experience increased revenue
and profitability in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year as a
result of increased holiday-related client spending activity.
The increase in fourth quarter revenue and profitability is also
attributable to higher seasonal revenues due to the timing of
revenue recognition for contracts that are accounted for on the
completed contract method. For the three years ended
December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, our fourth quarter
revenue as a percentage of the respective full year revenue was
approximately 30% for all years.

The organic decrease in revenue for the year ended and three
months ended December 31, 2005 was $45.7 and $34.1,
respectively when compared to the comparative period in 2004.
Operating margin declined for the year ended and three months
ended December 31, 2005 due to a significant organic
increase in salaries and related expenses for the year ended and
three months ended December 31, 2005 of $293.4 and $116.7,
respectively when compared to the prior year, and an organic
increase in office and general expenses for year ended and three
months ended December 31, 2005 of $112.4 and $26.3,
respectively when compared to the prior year. See below for
discussion of the drivers of these changes.

Included in our results of operations for the three months ended
December 31, 2005 were certain out of period adjustments
that resulted in decreased revenue and operating income of $17.3
and $21.6, respectively. When compared to the slight organic
decrease in revenue and significant organic increase in salaries
and related expenses and office and general expenses for the
three months ended December 31, 2005, these out of period
adjustments were immaterial to our quarterly results of
operations. These adjustments were immaterial to the annual
period ended December 31, 2005 and to any other prior
annual period.

Organic revenue growth.

In 2005, we experienced a small
organic revenue decrease, compared to small organic revenue
growth in 2004. The decrease resulted from client losses and a
reduction in revenue from existing clients at IAN, offset
partially by an increase at CMG due to client wins and
additional business from existing clients in the U.S. and
Europe. As a result, there were domestic and international
organic revenue decreases of 0.5% and 0.9%, respectively. We
experienced a small organic revenue decrease for the three
months ended December 31, 2005 when compared to the
comparative periods in 2004.

Operating margin.

Our operating margin was negative in
2005 and 2004. The decline in 2005 resulted from organic revenue
decreases and increases in salaries and related as well as
office and general expenses. Salaries and related expenses
increased, both in absolute terms and as a percentage of
revenues, due to increased severance expense as international
headcount reductions occurred across several agencies. In
addition, the increase was attributable to hiring additional
creative talent to enable future revenue growth and additional
staff to address weaknesses in our accounting and control
environment and to develop shared services, which almost offset
the number of employees severed. Office and general expenses
increased, both in absolute terms and as a percentage of
revenues, primarily due to higher professional fees associated
with the Prior Restatement and our ongoing efforts in internal
control compliance. Salary expense attributable to the
additional headcount and the costs of remedying our internal
control weaknesses will continue to be significant in 2006.

These negative impacts to operating margin were partially offset
by a decrease in the amount of charges related to impairment,
restructuring and contract termination costs. If not for the
reduction in these charges, our operating margin would have
deteriorated significantly from 2004 to 2005 as described above.
During 2005, we recorded asset impairments of $98.6,
restructuring reversals of $7.3 and had no contract termination
charges related to the Motorsports business, which is a $406.7
decrease when compared to these charges in 2004. Operating
margin in 2004 was impacted by approximately $322.2 of asset
impairment charges, $62.2 of restructuring charges and $113.6 of
contract termination costs related to the Motorsports business.

For the three months ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, our
operating margin decreased significantly, to 3.0% from 15.9%.
The decline in 2005 resulted from significant increases in
salaries and related expenses and impairment charges, as well an
increase in office and general expenses and an organic revenue
decrease. Salaries and related expenses significantly increased,
both in absolute terms and as a percentage of revenues,
primarily due to an increase in severance expense as
international headcount reductions occurred across several
agencies as a result of client losses. In addition, the increase
was attributable to hiring additional creative talent to enable
future revenue growth and staff to address weaknesses in our
accounting and control environment. During the three months
ended December 31, 2005, impairment charges of $92.1 were
recorded primarily related to our Lowe reporting unit following
a major client loss and recent management defections. Office and
general expenses increased, both in absolute terms and as a
percentage of revenues, primarily due to higher production and
media expenses

due to an increase in arrangements where we act as principal,

Significant 2005 Activity and Subsequent Events

Income Statement

Operating Cash Flow

•

Our operating activities utilized cash of approximately $20.2,
    compared to cash provided by operating activities of $464.8 in
    2004. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities in
    2005 was primarily attributable to significant increases in our
    operating costs. Additional cash was used during 2005 for
    severance costs primarily related to international headcount
    reductions, salary costs primarily attributable to our hiring
    additional creative talent to enable future revenue growth and
    additional staff to address weaknesses in our accounting and
    control environment, and professional fees primarily related to
    our Prior Restatement and our ongoing efforts in internal
    control compliance. The decrease in cash provided by operating
    activities in 2005 was also attributable to year-over-year
    changes in working capital accounts.

Financing Activities

•

Throughout 2005, we entered into waivers and amendments to our

364-Day

and Three-Year
    Revolving Credit Facilities related to our reporting
    requirements, financial covenants and the Prior Restatement.

    March 31, 2006 and June 30, 2006, added a new minimum
    cash balance covenant and amended the provisions governing
    letters of credit to permit the issuance of letters of credit
    with expiration dates beyond the termination date of the
    facility, subject to certain conditions. We also obtained a
    waiver from the lenders under the Three-Year Revolving Credit

For the year ended December 31, 2005, consolidated revenues
decreased $112.7, or 1.8%, as compared to 2004, which was
attributable to the effect of net acquisitions and divestitures
of $107.4 and an organic revenue decrease of $45.7, partially
offset by favorable foreign currency exchange rate changes of
$40.4.

The increase due to foreign currency changes was primarily
attributable to the strengthening of the Brazilian Real and the
Canadian Dollar in relation to the U.S. Dollar, which
primarily affected our IAN segment. The net effect of
acquisitions and divestitures is comprised of $46.0 at IAN,
largely from dispositions at McCann during 2005, $12.1 at CMG
and $49.3 from the sale of the Motorsports business during 2004.



THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS — (Continued)

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)

During 2005, the organic revenue decrease of $45.7, or 0.7%, was
driven by a decrease at IAN, partially offset by an increase at
CMG. The decrease at IAN was a result of client losses and a
reduction in revenue from existing clients primarily in our
European offices. The increase at CMG was primarily driven by
growth in public relations and sports marketing business both
domestically and internationally as a result of increased
revenue from existing clients and new client wins.

For 2006, we expect the organic change in revenue to be flat or
to decline due to the continuing impact of client losses that we
experienced during 2005.

Our revenue recognition policies are in accordance with Staff
Accounting Bulletin (“SAB”) No. 104,

Revenue
Recognition.

This accounting guidance governs the timing of
when revenue is recognized. Accordingly, if work is being
performed in a given quarter but there is insufficient evidence
of an arrangement, the related revenue is deferred to a future
quarter when the evidence is obtained. However, our costs of
services are primarily expensed as incurred, except that
incremental direct costs may be deferred under a significant
long term contract until complete. With revenue being deferred
until completion of the contract and costs primarily expensed as
incurred, this will have a negative impact on our operating
margin until the revenue can be recognized and in the period of
revenue recognition. While this will not affect cash flow and
did not have a significant impact on revenue recognition in 2005
as compared to 2004, it may affect organic revenue growth and
margins in future periods. This effect is likely to be greater
in comparing quarters than in comparing full years.

In addition, we fulfill the role of an agent in most of our
customer contracts however, in certain arrangements we act as
principal. In accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force
(“EITF”) Issue
No.

99-19,

when we
act as principal, we recognize gross revenue and expenses
inclusive of external media or production costs; when we act as
an agent, we recognize revenue net of such costs. The mix of
where we act as agent and where we act as principal is
contract-dependent and varies from agency to agency, and from
period to period. Accordingly, while our cash flows and
profitability are not impacted, and while this effect did not
have a significant impact on revenue in 2005 compared to 2004,
it may affect organic revenue growth patterns in future periods.

Salaries and related expenses are the largest component of
operating expenses and consist primarily of salaries and related
benefits, and performance incentives. During 2005, salaries and
related expenses increased to 63.7% of revenues, compared to
58.4% in 2004. In 2005, salaries and related expenses increased
$293.4, excluding the increase related to foreign currency
exchange rate changes of $19.3 and a decrease related to net
acquisitions and divestitures of $46.6.

Salaries and related expenses were impacted by changes in
foreign currency rates, primarily attributable to the
strengthening of the Brazilian Real and the Canadian Dollar in
relation to the U.S. Dollar. The increase due to foreign
currency rate changes was partially offset by the impact of net
acquisitions and divestitures activity, which resulted largely
from dispositions at McCann during 2005 and the sale of the
Motorsports business during 2004.

The increase in salaries and related expenses, both in absolute
terms and as a percentage of revenue, excluding the impact of
foreign currency and net acquisitions and divestitures, was
primarily the result of higher severance expense, largely
recorded in the fourth quarter for international headcount
reductions within IAN as a result of client losses. In addition,
the increase was attributable to our hiring additional creative
talent to enable future revenue growth and additional staff to
address weaknesses in our accounting and control environment and
develop shared services at certain locations, which almost
offset the number of employees severed. The increase in salaries
and related expense as a percentage of revenue was also due, in
part, to the fact that revenue decreased at the same time that
salaries and related expenses increased for the reasons
explained above.

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)

Office and general expenses primarily consists of rent, office
and equipment, depreciation, professional fees, other overhead
expenses and certain

out-of

-pocket expenses
related to our revenue. During 2005, office and general expenses
increased to 36.5% of revenues, compared to 35.2% in 2004,
largely due to the decrease in revenue year on year. In 2005,
office and general expenses increased $112.4, excluding the
increase related to foreign currency exchange rate changes of
$13.9 and a decrease related to net acquisitions and
divestitures of $88.6.

Office and general expenses were impacted by changes in foreign
currency rates, primarily attributable to the strengthening of
the Brazilian Real and Canadian Dollar in relation to the
U.S. Dollar. The increase due to foreign currency rate
changes was offset by the impact of net acquisitions and
divestitures activity, which resulted largely from dispositions
at McCann during 2005 and the sale of the Motorsports business
and McCann’s Transworld Marketing during 2004.

The increase in office and general expenses, excluding the
impact of foreign currency and net acquisition and divestitures
activity, was primarily the result of higher professional fees
at both IAN and our Corporate group driven by our ongoing
efforts in internal control compliance, the Prior Restatement
process and the preliminary application development and
maintenance of information technology systems and processes
related to our shared services initiatives. Except for the costs
associated with the Prior Restatement process, these costs will
continue to significantly impact financial results in 2006.

Restructuring (Reversals) Charges

During 2005 and 2004, we recorded net (reversals) and
charges related to lease termination and other exit costs and
severance and termination costs for the 2003 and 2001
restructuring programs of ($7.3) and $62.2, respectively.
Included in the net (reversals) and charges were
adjustments resulting from changes in management’s
estimates for the 2003 and 2001 restructuring programs which
decreased the restructuring reserves by $9.3 and $32.0 in 2005
and 2004, respectively. 2005 net reversals primarily
consisted of changes to management’s estimates for the 2003
and 2001 restructuring programs primarily relating to our lease
termination costs. 2004 net charges primarily related to
the vacating of 43 offices and workforce reduction of
approximately 400 employees related to the 2003 restructuring
program and adjustments to management’s estimates for the
2001 restructuring program. A summary of the net
(reversals) and charges by segment is as follows:



THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)

In addition to amounts recorded as restructuring charges, we
recorded charges of $11.1 during 2004 related to the accelerated
amortization of leasehold improvements on properties included in
the 2003 program. These charges were included in office and
general expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
For additional information, see Note 6 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements.

Long-Lived Asset Impairment and Other Charges

Long-lived assets include land, buildings, equipment, goodwill
and other intangible assets. Buildings, equipment and other
intangible assets with finite lives are depreciated or amortized
on a straight-line basis over their respective estimated useful
lives. When necessary, we record an impairment charge for the
amount that the carrying value of the asset exceeds the implied
fair value. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements for fair value determination and impairment testing
methodologies.

The long-lived asset impairment charges recorded in 2005 and
2004 are due to the following:

2005 Impairments

IAN

— During the fourth quarter of 2005, we
recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $91.0 at our Lowe
reporting unit. A triggering event occurred subsequent to our
2005 annual impairment test that led us to believe that
Lowe’s goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible
assets may no longer be recoverable. As a result, we were
required to assess whether our goodwill balance at Lowe was
impaired. Specifically, in the fourth quarter, a major client
was lost by Lowe’s London agency and the possibility of
losing other clients is now considered a higher risk due to
recent management defections and changes in the competitive
landscape. This caused projected revenue growth to decline. As a
result of these changes our long-term projections showed
declines in discounted future operating cash flows. These
revised cash flows caused the implied fair value of Lowe’s
goodwill to be less than the book value.

During the third quarter of 2005 as restated, we recorded a
goodwill impairment charge of $5.8 at a reporting unit within
our sports and entertainment marketing business. The long-term
projections showed previously unanticipated declines in
discounted future operating cash flows and, as a result, these
discounted future operating cash flows caused the implied fair
value of goodwill to be less than the related book value.

2004 Impairments

IAN

— During the third quarter of 2004, we
recorded goodwill impairment charges of $220.2 at The
Partnership reporting unit, which was comprised of Lowe
Worldwide, Draft Worldwide, Mullen, Dailey & Associates
and Berenter Greenhouse & Webster (“BGW”).
Our long-term projections showed previously unanticipated
declines in discounted future operating cash flows due to recent
client losses, reduced client spending, and declining industry
valuation metrics. These discounted future operating cash flow
projections



THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS — (Continued)

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)

caused the estimated fair value of The Partnership to be less
than the book value. The Partnership was subsequently disbanded
in the fourth quarter of 2004 and the remaining goodwill was
allocated based on the relative fair value of the agencies at
the time of disbandment.

CMG

— As a result of the annual impairment
review, a goodwill impairment charge of $91.7 was recorded at
our CMG reporting unit, which was comprised of Weber Shandwick,
GolinHarris, DeVries, MWW Group and FutureBrand. The fair value
of CMG was adversely affected by declining industry market
valuation metrics, specifically, a decrease in the EBITDA
multiples used in the underlying valuation calculations. The
impact of the lower EBITDA multiples caused the calculated fair
value of CMG goodwill to be less than the related book value.

For additional information, see Note 9 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements.

Motorsports Contract Termination Costs

As discussed in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements, during 2004, we recorded a pretax charge of $113.6
related to a series of agreements with the British Racing
Drivers Club and Formula One Administration Limited which
released us from certain guarantees and lease obligations in the
United Kingdom. We have exited this business and do not
anticipate any additional material charges.

Interest Expense

The increase in interest expense of $9.9 during 2005 was
primarily due to waiver and consent fees incurred for the
amendment of our existing debt agreements in 2005 and higher
average interest rates on newly issued debt when compared to
extinguished debt. Our interest income and interest expense
reflect daily balances which may vary from period-end balances.
They also reflect the gross amounts of debt and cash under
certain of our cash pooling arrangements that are reflected on a
net basis on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Debt Prepayment Penalty

During the third quarter of 2005, a prepayment penalty of $1.4
was recorded related to the early redemption of the remaining
$250.0 of the 7.875% Senior Unsecured Notes due in 2005.
During the fourth quarter of 2004, a prepayment penalty of $9.8
was recorded related to the early redemption of $250.0 of our
7.875% Senior Unsecured Notes due in 2005, which
represented one half of the then $500.0 outstanding.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS — (Continued)

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)

Interest Income

The increase in interest income of $29.2 during 2005 was
primarily due to an increase in average interest rates as well
an increase in cash and cash equivalents primarily resulting
from our Series B Cumulative Convertible Perpetual
Preferred Stock offering.

Our interest income and interest expense reflect daily balances
which may vary from period-end balances. They also reflect the
gross amounts of debt and cash under certain of our cash pooling
arrangements that are reflected on a net basis on our
Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Investment Impairments

During 2005, we recorded investment impairment charges of $12.2,
primarily related to a $7.1 charge for our remaining
unconsolidated investment in Koch Tavares in Latin America to
adjust the carrying amount of the investment to fair value as a
result of our intent to sell and a $3.7 charge related to a
decline in value of certain available-for-sale investments that
were determined to be other than temporary.

During 2004, we recorded investment impairment charges of $63.4,
primarily related to a $50.9 charge for an unconsolidated
investment in German advertising agency Springer &
Jacoby as a result of a decrease in projected operating results.
Additionally, we recorded impairment charges of $4.7 related to
unconsolidated affiliates primarily in Israel, Brazil, Japan and
India, and $7.8 related to several other available-for-sale
investments.

Litigation Charges

During 2004, with court approval of the settlement of the class
action shareholder suits discussed in Note 21 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements, we received $20.0 from
insurance proceeds which we recorded as a reduction in
litigation charges because we had not previously established a
receivable. We also recorded a reduction of $12.5 relating to a
decrease in the share price between the tentative settlement
date and the final settlement date.

Other Income (Expense)

In 2005, other income (expense) included net gains from the
sales of businesses of $10.1, net gains on sales of
available-for-sale securities and miscellaneous investment
income of $20.3 and $2.6 related to credits adjustments. The
principal components of net gains from the sales of businesses
relate to the sale of Target Research, a McCann agency, during
the fourth quarter of 2005, which resulted in a gain of $18.6,
offset partially by a sale of a significant component of FCB
Spain during the fourth quarter of 2005 which resulted in a loss
of approximately $13.0. The principal components of net gains on
sales of available-for-sale securities and miscellaneous
investment income relate to the sale of our remaining ownership
interest in Delaney Lund Knox Warren & Partners, an agency
within FCB, for a gain of approximately $8.3, and net gains on
sales of available-for-sale securities of $7.9, of which
approximately $3.8 relates to appreciation of Rabbi Trust
investments restricted for the purpose of paying our deferred
compensation and deferred benefit arrangement liabilities.

In 2005, we also recorded $2.6 for the settlement of our
contractual liabilities for vendor credits and discounts. This
amount represents a negotiated client settlement below the
amount originally recorded. It is recorded as Other Income
because we do not view negotiating a favorable outcome as a
revenue generating activity.

In 2004, other income (expense) included $18.2 of net losses on
the sale of 19 agencies. The losses related primarily to the
sale of McCann’s Transworld Marketing, a

U.S.-based

promotions
agency, which



THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

OPERATIONS — (Continued)

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)

resulted in a loss of $8.6, and a $6.2 loss for the final
liquidation of the Motorsports investment. See Note 5 to
the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of
the Motorsports disposition.

Our effective tax rate was negatively impacted in both 2005 and
2004 by the establishment of valuation allowances, as described
below, and non-deductible long-lived asset impairment charges.
In 2004, our effective tax rate was also impacted by pretax
charges and related tax benefits resulting from the Motorsports
contract termination costs. The difference between the effective
tax rate and the statutory federal rate of 35% is also due to
state and local taxes and the effect of non-U.S. operations.

Valuation Allowance

Under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
(“SFAS”) No. 109,

Accounting for Income Taxes,

we are required, on a quarterly basis, to evaluate the
realizability of our deferred tax assets. SFAS No. 109
requires that a valuation allowance be established when it is
more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax
assets will not be realized. In circumstances where there is
sufficient negative evidence, establishment of valuation
allowance must be considered. We believe that cumulative losses
in the most recent three-year period represent sufficient
negative evidence under the provisions of SFAS No. 109
and, as a result, we determined that certain of our deferred tax
assets required the establishment of a valuation allowance. The
deferred tax assets for which an allowance was established
relate primarily to foreign net operating and U.S. capital
loss carryforwards, and foreign tax credits.

During 2005, a net valuation allowance of $69.9 was established
in continuing operations on existing deferred tax assets and
current year losses with no benefit. The total valuation
allowance as of December 31, 2005 was $501.0. Our income
tax expense recorded in the future will be reduced to the extent
of decreases in our valuation allowance. The establishment or
reversal of valuation allowances could have a significant
negative or positive impact on future earnings.

During 2004, a valuation allowance of $236.0 was established in
continuing operations on existing deferred tax assets and 2004
losses with no benefit. The total valuation allowance as of
December 31, 2004 was $488.6. Our income tax expense
recorded in the future will be reduced to the extent of
decreases in our valuation allowance. The establishment or
reversal of valuation allowances could have a significant
negative or positive impact on future earnings.

In connection with the U.S. deferred tax assets, management
believes that it is more likely than not that a substantial
amount of the deferred tax assets will be realized; a valuation
allowance has been established for the remainder. The amount of
the deferred tax assets considered realizable, however, could be
reduced in the near term if estimates of future
U.S. taxable income are lower than anticipated.

For additional information, see Note 11 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements.

The decrease in income applicable to minority interests of $4.8
was primarily due to lower earnings of majority-owned
international businesses offset by increases in minority
interests at several businesses.

The increase in equity in net income of unconsolidated
affiliates of $7.5 was primarily due to the impact of prior year
losses at an African unconsolidated affiliate within McCann,
which was fully consolidated due to the purchase of an
additional interest in 2005, and the impact of positive results
at unconsolidated investments at FCB and McCann.

Loss from Continuing Operations

In 2005, our loss from continuing operations decreased by $273.0
or 50.1% as a result of a decrease reduced long-lived asset
impairment charges and Motorsports contract termination costs in
2004, partially offset by a decrease in operating income which
was driven by decreases in revenue and increases in expenses as
previously discussed.

Income from Discontinued operations (net of tax)

In conjunction with the disposition of our NFO operations in the
fourth quarter of 2003, we established reserves for certain
income tax contingencies with respect to the determination of
our investment in NFO for income tax purposes. During the fourth
quarter of 2005, these reserves of $9.0 were reversed as the
related income tax contingencies are no longer considered
probable.

For the three months ended December 31, 2005, consolidated
revenues decreased $70.0, or 3.6%, as compared to 2004, which
was attributable to an organic revenue decrease of $34.1, a
decrease in net acquisitions and divestitures of $23.0 and a
decrease related to foreign currency exchange rate changes of
$12.9. We recorded certain out of period adjustments in the
three months ended December 31, 2005. See Note 3 to
the Consolidated Financial Statements. Excluding out of period
adjustments of $17.3 recorded in the three months ended
December 31, 2005, the consolidated revenue decrease would
have been $52.7.

During 2005, the organic decrease in revenue excluding the
impact to out of period adjustments was primarily driven by a
decrease at IAN, partially offset by an increase at CMG. The
decrease at IAN was primarily a result of a reduction in revenue
from existing clients primarily due to client losses at our
international agencies. In the fourth quarter of 2005, we
recorded approximately $10.0 for certain client negotiations at
IAN. The increase at CMG was primarily driven by worldwide
growth in sports marketing business and events marketing
business as a result of increased revenue from existing clients
and new client wins.

Salaries and related expenses is the largest component of
operating expenses and consist primarily of salaries, related
benefits and performance incentives. During the three months
ended December 31, 2005, salaries and related expenses
increased to 58.4% of revenue, compared to 52.0% in the prior
year. During the three months ended December 31, 2005,
salaries and related expenses increased by approximately $85.6
including the impact of out of period adjustments, to $1,107.5
when compared to the comparative

period in 2004. Excluding the impact of out of period
adjustments of $3.2, the increase of $82.4 was primarily
attributable to an increase in severance expense of $59.7 to
$97.2. In addition, the increase was attributable to our hiring
additional creative talent to enable future revenue growth and
staff to address weaknesses in our accounting and control
environment. The components of the change were as follows:

decrease related to foreign currency exchange rate changes of
$10.3.

The increase in salaries and related expenses, excluding the
impact of out of period adjustments and foreign currency and net
acquisition and divestiture activity, was primarily the result
of higher severance expense for international headcount
reductions within IAN as a result of client losses. In addition,
the increase was attributable to our hiring additional creative
talent to enable future revenue growth and staff to address
weaknesses in our accounting and control environment.

Office and General Expenses

Office and general expenses primarily consist of rent, office
and equipment, depreciation, professional fees, other overhead
expenses and certain

out-of

-pocket expenses
related to our revenue. During the three months ended
December 31, 2005, office and general expenses increased to
33.6% of revenue, compared to 32.1% in the prior year. During
the three months ended December 31, 2005, office and
general expenses increased by approximately $6.8 including the
impact of out of period adjustments, to $637.1 when compared to
the comparative period in 2004. Excluding the impact of out of
period adjustments of $6.1, the increase of $0.7 was primarily
attributable to higher production and media expenses due to an
increase in arrangements entered into where we act as a
principal, which requires us to record expenses on a gross
basis. The increase was partially offset by acquisitions and
divestitures. The components of the change were as follows:

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)

For the three months ended December 31, 2005, office and
general expenses increased $26.3, excluding a decrease related
to net acquisitions and divestitures of $13.2 and a decrease
related to foreign currency exchange rate changes of $6.3.

The increase in office and general expenses, excluding the
impact of out of period adjustments and foreign currency and net
acquisition and divestitures activity, was primarily the result
of higher production and media expenses at IAN due to an
increase in arrangements entered into where we act as a
principal, which requires us to record expenses on a gross basis
and higher professional fees at both IAN and CMG. The higher
professional fees were driven by our ongoing efforts in internal
control compliance, the Prior Restatement process and the
preliminary application development and maintenance of
information technology systems and processes related to our
shared services initiatives.

Restructuring Charges (Reversals)

During the three months ended December 31, 2005 and 2004,
we recorded net charges and (reversals) related to lease
termination and other exit costs and severance and termination
costs for the 2003 and 2001 restructuring programs of $1.4 and
($4.4), respectively. 2005 net charges and 2004 net
reversals primarily consisted of changes to management’s
estimates for the 2003 and 2001 restructuring programs primarily
relating to our lease termination costs.

Long-Lived Asset Impairment and Other Charges

During the three months ended December 31, 2005 and 2004,
we recorded charges of $92.1 and $5.8, respectively. 2005
charges primarily related to a goodwill impairment charge of
$91.0 at our Lowe reporting unit.

EXPENSE AND OTHER INCOME

Interest Expense & Interest Income

During the three months ended December 31, 2005 and 2004,
we recorded interest expense of $46.1 and $44.3, respectively.
During the three months ended December 31, 2005 and 2004,
we recorded interest income of $26.8 and $19.5, respectively.
The increase in interest income of $7.3 primarily relates to an
increase in average interest rates and higher cash balances when
compared to the prior year.

Investment Impairments

During the three months ended December 31, 2005 and 2004,
we recorded investment impairments of $7.1 and $26.4,
respectively. For the three months ended December 31, 2005,
we recorded a $7.1 charge for our remaining unconsolidated
investment in Koch Tavares in Latin America. For the three
months ended December 31, 2004, the primary component of
the balance related to a $19.9 charge for our unconsolidated
investment in German advertising agency Springer &
Jacoby.

Other Income (Expense)

During the three months ended December 31, 2005 and 2004,
we recorded other income (expense) amounts of $13.4 and $(13.5),
respectively. The primary components of our income amount for
the three months ended December 31, 2005 are a gain on the
sale of Target Research, a McCann agency, of $18.6, offset by
the sale of a significant component of FCB Spain, which resulted
in a loss of approximately $13.0. The remainder of the amount
relates to miscellaneous income and expense amounts. The primary
components of our expense amount for the three months ended
December 31, 2004 are an $8.6 loss on the

sale of McCann’s Transworld Marketing, a

U.S.-based

promotions
agency, as well as a $6.2 loss for the final liquidation of the
Motorsports investment.

OTHER ITEMS

Income Taxes

For the three months ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, we
recorded an income tax provision of $77.4 and $130.6,
respectively. Excluding out of period adjustments of $19.5, the
income tax provision would have been $96.9 for the three months
ended December 31, 2005.

We recorded income tax provisions of $81.9 and $262.2 for the
twelve months ended December 31, 2005 and 2004,
respectively, although we had a pretax loss in each period. The
difference between the effective tax rate and statutory rate of
35% is due to state and local taxes and the effect of non-US
operations. Several discrete items also impacted the effective
tax rate in 2005. The most significant item negatively impacting
the effective tax rate was the establishment of approximately
$69.9 of valuation allowances on certain deferred tax assets, as
well as on losses incurred in

non-U.S.

jurisdictions
which receive no benefit. Other discrete items impacting the
effective tax rates for 2005 and 2004 were restructuring
charges, long-lived asset and investment impairment charges.

Minority Interest and Unconsolidated Affiliates

During the three months ended December 31, 2005 and 2004,
we recorded $7.2 and $10.3 of income applicable to minority
interests, respectively. This decrease was primarily due to
lower earnings of majority-owned international businesses.

During the three months ended December 31, 2005 and 2004,
we recorded $8.1 and $1.1 of equity in net income of
unconsolidated affiliates, respectively. The increase is
primarily due to the impact of prior year losses at an African
unconsolidated affiliate within McCann, which was fully
consolidated in the second quarter of 2005, as well as positive
results at unconsolidated investments at FCB and Lowe.

NET INCOME (LOSS)

Loss from Continuing Operations

For the three months ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, we
recorded a loss from continuing operations of $31.9 and income
from continuing operations of $130.3, respectively. The decrease
in income from continuing operations of $162.1 largely resulted
from a decrease in revenue of $70.0, and an increase in
operating expenses of $184.5, which was driven by goodwill
impairment charges of $92.1 and increased severance and
temporary staffing changes of $59.7 and $20.3, respectively.
This change was offset by a decrease in taxes of $53.2 and an
increase in total expenses and other income of $28.9, which was
driven by decreased litigation charges and gains from the sales
of businesses. Excluding out of period adjustments of $2.7, the
loss from continuing operations would have been $34.6 for the
three months ended December 31, 2005.

Income from Discontinued Operations (net of tax)

In conjunction with the disposition of our NFO operations in the
fourth quarter of 2003, we established reserves for certain
income tax contingencies with respect to the determination of
our investment in NFO for income tax purposes. During the fourth
quarter of 2005, these reserves of $9.0 were reversed as the
related income tax contingencies are no longer considered
probable.

Segment Results of Operations — 2005 Compared to

As discussed in Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements, we have three reportable segments as of
December 31, 2005: our operating divisions IAN, CMG and
Motorsports. Our Motorsports operations were sold during 2004
and had immaterial residual operating results in 2005. We also
report results for the Corporate group. The profitability
measure employed by our chief operating decision makers for
allocating resources to operating divisions and assessing
operating division performance is segment operating income
(loss), which is calculated by subtracting segment salaries and
related expenses and office and general expenses from segment
revenue. Amounts reported as segment operating income (loss)
exclude the impact of restructuring and impairment charges, as
we do not typically consider these charges when assessing
operating division performance. The impact of restructuring and
impairment charges to each reporting segment are reported
separately in Notes 6 and 9 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements, respectively. Segment income (loss) excludes
interest income and expense, debt prepayment penalties,
investment impairments, litigation charges and other
non-operating income. Other than the recording of long-lived
asset impairment and contract termination costs during 2004, the
operating results of Motorsports during 2005 and 2004 were not
material to consolidated results, and therefore are not
discussed in detail below. The following table summarizes
revenue and operating income (loss) by segment:

For the year ended December 31, 2005, IAN experienced a net
decrease in revenue as compared to 2004 by $71.4, or 1.3%, which
was comprised of an organic decrease in revenue of $64.9 and a
decrease attributable to net acquisitions and divestitures of
$46.0, partially offset by an increase in foreign currency
exchange rate changes of $39.5. The decrease due to the net
effect of divestitures and acquisitions, primarily related to
the sale of small businesses at McCann and Draft. This decrease
was partially offset by foreign currency exchange rate changes
primarily attributable to the strengthening of the Brazilian
Real and the Canadian Dollar in relation to the
U.S. Dollar, which mainly affected the results of McCann
and FCB.

The organic revenue decrease was primarily driven by decreases
at Deutsch and Lowe, partially offset by an increase at Draft.
Deutsch experienced a decline in revenues primarily due to lost
clients and a reduction in revenue from existing clients in the
U.S., partially offset by new business wins. Lowe’s decline
in revenue was primarily driven by lost clients and a reduction
in revenue from existing clients in their European offices, as
well as a reduction in client spending in the U.S. Draft
experienced growth mainly in the U.S. due to client wins
and additional revenue from existing clients. Although McCann
and FCB are a significant part of the business, they did not
contribute significantly to the organic change in revenue year
on year.

For the year ended December 31, 2005, IAN operating income
decreased by $327.4, or 56.7%, which was a result of a decrease
in revenue of $71.4, an increase in salaries and related
expenses of $202.3 and increased office and general expenses of
$53.7.

The decrease in IAN’s operating income, excluding the
impact of foreign currency and net effects of acquisitions and
divestitures, was primarily driven by decreased operating income
at McCann and FCB, increased losses at Lowe and decreased
operating income at Deutsch. The operating income decrease at
McCann was primarily caused by increased severance, temporary
staffing costs, salary and related benefits and professional
fees. Higher severance expense was the result of international
headcount reductions. Temporary staffing and salary and related
benefits were impacted by additional staffing necessary to
address weaknesses in our accounting and control environment.
Professional fees increased as a result of costs associated with
the Prior Restatement process and internal control compliance.
Operating income decreases at FCB were due to higher salaries
and freelance costs as additional staff were hired to service
new clients and additional business from existing clients, whose
revenue will impact 2006 more than 2005, as well as increased
severance costs reflecting headcount reductions at our
international agencies. Operating income was further impacted by
increases in professional fees to assist in the restatement
process and internal control compliance. Declines at Lowe were
primarily due to organic revenue decreases as compared to the
prior year. Deutsch experienced decreases as a result of organic
revenue decreases as compared to the prior year, partially
offset by lower salaries, related benefits and freelance costs
due to lost clients and reduced incentive compensation expense
as a result of a reduction in operating performance.

The organic revenue increase was primarily driven by growth in
public relations and sports marketing business both domestically
and internationally as a result of increased revenue from
existing clients and new client wins. Domestically, the increase
in the sports marketing business was offset by a decline in the
events marketing business. Although the events marketing
business declined domestically it had an overall positive impact
to our organic revenue increase due to international client wins.

For the year ended December 31, 2005, CMG operating income
decreased by $30.7, or 36.7%, which was the result of a $23.3
increase in salary and related expenses and a $15.8 increase in
office and general expenses, offset by a $8.4 increase in
revenue.

The decrease in operating income, excluding the impact of
foreign currency and net effects of acquisition and
divestitures, was primarily driven by increases in salary
expense across all businesses due to increased headcount to
further address weaknesses in our accounting and control
environment. In addition, the decrease in operating income was
attributable to increases in salary expenses in public relations
to support ongoing revenue growth.

CORPORATE AND OTHER

Certain corporate and other charges are reported as a separate
line within total segment operating income and include corporate
office expenses and shared service center expenses, as well as
certain other centrally managed expenses that are not fully
allocated to operating divisions. The following significant
expenses are included in corporate and other:

Salaries, benefits and related expenses include salaries,
pension, bonus and medical and dental insurance expenses for
corporate office employees, as well as the cost of temporary
employees at the corporate office. Professional fees include
costs related to the internal control compliance, cost of Prior
Restatement efforts, financial statement audits, legal,
information technology and other consulting fees, which are
engaged and managed through the corporate office. Professional
fees also include the cost of

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)

temporary financial professionals associated with work on our
Prior Restatement activities. Rent and depreciation includes
rental expense and depreciation of leasehold improvements for
properties occupied by corporate office employees. Corporate
insurance expense includes the cost for fire, liability and
automobile premiums. Bank fees relate to cash management
activity administered by the corporate office. The amounts
allocated to operating divisions are calculated monthly based on
a formula that uses the revenues of the operating unit. Amounts
allocated also include specific charges for information
technology related projects which are allocated based on
utilization.

The increase in corporate and other expense of $73.1 or 30.1% is
primarily related to the increase in salaries and related
expenses and professional fees. The increase in salary expenses
was the result of additional staffing to address weaknesses in
our accounting and control environment, and develop shared
services. The increase in professional fees are the result of
costs associated with internal control compliance, costs
associated with the Prior Restatement process, and related audit
costs. Amounts allocated to operating divisions primarily
increased due to the implementation of new information
technology related projects and the consolidation of information
technology support staff, the costs of which are now being
allocated back to operating divisions.

IAN experienced a net decrease in revenue as compared to 2004 of
$85.2, or 5.0%, which was comprised of an organic decrease in
revenue of $58.2, a decrease attributable to net acquisitions
and divestitures of $17.1 and a decrease in foreign currency
exchange rate changes of $9.9. Excluding out of period
adjustments of $17.8 recorded in the three months ended
December 31, 2005, the net revenue decrease would have been
$67.4.

The organic decrease in revenue excluding the impact of out of
period adjustments was primarily driven by decreases at McCann,
Lowe and Deutsch. McCann experienced a decline in revenues
primarily due to a reduction in revenue from existing
international clients, particularly in Europe and Asia Pacific.
This reduction was partially offset by new client wins,
particularly in Europe. Lowe’s decline in revenue was
primarily driven by a change in the structure of certain client
contracts which resulted in a deferral of revenue and a
reduction in revenue from existing international clients,
particularly in Europe. Deutsch experienced a decline in
revenues primarily due to lost clients and a reduction in
revenue from existing clients in the U.S. partially offset by
new client wins.

For the three months ended December 31, 2005, IAN operating
income decreased by $138.0, or 38.4%, which was the result of a
decrease in revenue of $85.2, an increase in salaries and
related expenses of $41.1 and increased office and general
expenses of $11.7. Excluding out of period adjustments of $22.1,
the total operating income decrease would have been $115.9.

The decrease in IAN’s operating income, excluding the
impact of out of period adjustments and foreign currency and net
effects of acquisitions and divestitures, was primarily driven
by decreased operating income at McCann and Lowe. The operating
income decrease at McCann was primarily due to increased
severance, production and media expenses, occupancy costs and
temporary staffing costs. Higher severance expense was the
result of domestic and international headcount reductions. The
increase in production and media expenses was due to an increase
in arrangements entered into where we act as a principal, which
requires us to record expenses on a gross basis. The increase in
occupancy costs was primarily due to the termination of several
operating leases. Temporary staffing was impacted by additional
staffing necessary to address weaknesses in our accounting and
control environment. In the fourth quarter of 2005, we recorded
approximately $10.0 for certain client negotiations. The
operating income decrease at Lowe was primarily due to the
organic decrease in revenue as compared to the prior year.

For the three months ended December 31, 2005, CMG
experienced a net increase in revenue as compared to 2004 of
$19.6, or 7.5%, which was comprised of an organic revenue
increase of $24.1, partially offset by a decrease in foreign
currency exchange rate changes of $2.5 and decreases
attributable to net acquisitions and divestitures of $2.0.
Excluding out of period adjustments of $0.5, the net revenue
increase would have been $19.1.

The organic revenue increase excluding the impact of out of
period adjustments was primarily driven by worldwide growth in
sports marketing business, events marketing business and public
relations business as a result of increased revenue from
existing clients and new client wins.

For the three months ended December 31, 2005, CMG operating
income increased by $1.0, or 3.4%, which was the result of an
increase in revenue of $19.6, offset by increased salaries and
related expenses of $10.4 and office and general expenses of
$8.2. Excluding out of period adjustments of $3.5, the total
operating income increase would have been $4.5.

The increase in CMG’s operating income, excluding the
impact of out of period adjustments and foreign currency and net
effects of acquisitions and divestitures, was due to an organic
revenue increase primarily driven by worldwide growth in sports
marketing business as a result of increased revenue from
existing clients and new client wins. This increase was
partially offset by an increase in professional fees as a result
of costs associated with the Prior Restatement process and
internal control compliance and an increase in salary expenses
across all businesses due to increased headcount to further
address weaknesses in our accounting and control environment.

CORPORATE AND OTHER

Certain corporate and other charges are reported as a separate
line within total segment operating income and include corporate
office expenses and shared service center expenses, as well as
certain other centrally managed expenses that are not fully
allocated to operating divisions. The following significant
expenses are included in corporate and other:

Salaries, benefits and related expenses include salaries,
pension, bonus and medical and dental insurance expenses for
corporate office employees, as well as the cost of temporary
employees at the corporate office. Professional fees include
costs related to the internal control compliance, cost of Prior
Restatement efforts, financial statement audits, legal,
information technology and other consulting fees, which are
engaged and managed through the corporate office. Professional
fees also include the cost of temporary financial professionals
associated with work on our Prior Restatement activities. Rent
and depreciation includes rental expense and depreciation of
leasehold improvements for properties occupied by corporate
office employees. Corporate insurance expense includes the cost
for fire, liability and automobile

premiums. Bank fees relate to cash management activity
administered by the corporate office. The amounts allocated to
operating divisions are calculated monthly based on a formula
that uses the revenues of the operating unit. Amounts allocated
also include specific charges for information technology related
projects which are allocated based on utilization.

The increase in corporate and other expense of $27.1 or 36.9%
for the three months ended December 31, 2005 is primarily
related to the increase in salaries and related expenses,
partially offset by a decrease in professional fees. The
increase in salary expenses was the result of additional
staffing to address weaknesses in our accounting and control
environment, and develop shared services. The decrease in
professional fees is the result of a reduction in temporary
employees as compared to prior year in conjunction with the
additional staffing.

For the year ended December 31, 2004, consolidated revenues
increased $225.3, or 3.7%, as compared to 2003, which was
attributable to foreign currency exchange rate changes of $237.7
and organic revenue growth of $75.6, partially offset by the
effect of net acquisitions and divestitures of $88.0.

The increase due to foreign currency changes was attributable to
the strengthening of the Euro and Pound Sterling in relation to
the U.S. Dollar. The net effect of acquisitions and
divestitures resulted largely from the sale of the Motorsports
business during 2004.

During 2004, organic revenue change of $75.6, or 1.2%, was
driven by an increase at IAN, partially offset by decrease at
CMG. The increase at IAN was a result of client wins, additional
business from existing clients, and overall growth in domestic
markets. The decrease at CMG was as a result of weakness in
demand for branding and sports marketing services, partially
offset by growth in the public relations business.

For the three months ended December 31, 2004, consolidated
revenues increased $109.0, or 5.9%, as compared to the
comparable period in 2003, which was attributable to an increase
related to foreign currency exchange rate changes of $87.4 and
an organic increase in revenue of $44.5, partially offset by a
decrease in net acquisitions and divestitures of $22.9.

Salaries and related expenses are the largest component of
operating expenses and consist primarily of salaries and related
benefits, and performance incentives. During 2004, salaries and
related expenses increased to 58.4% of revenues, compared to
56.8% in 2003. In 2004, salaries and related expenses increased
$142.6, excluding the increase related to foreign currency
exchange rate changes of $129.5 and a decrease related to net
acquisitions and divestitures of $40.5.

Salaries and related expenses were impacted by changes in
foreign currency rates, attributable to the strengthening of the
Euro and Pound Sterling in relation to the U.S. Dollar. The
increase due to foreign currency rate changes was partially
offset by the impact of net acquisitions and divestitures
activity, which resulted largely from the sale of the
Motorsports business during 2004.

The increase in salaries and related expenses, excluding the
impact of foreign currency and net acquisitions and
divestitures, was primarily the result of increases in employee
headcount at certain locations and increased utilization of
temporary and freelance staffing and higher performance
incentive expense at a number of agencies that experienced an
increase in operating results. Furthermore, during the year, we
hired additional personnel within our operating units and in the
corporate group to support our back office processes, including
accounting and shared services initiatives, as well as our
ongoing efforts in achieving Sarbanes-Oxley compliance. We
reduced staff at certain operations after client accounts were
lost. Cost savings associated with headcount reductions were
partially offset by increased severance costs associate with the
headcount reductions.

Office and general expenses primarily consist of rent, office
and equipment, depreciation, professional fees, other overhead
expenses and certain

out-of

-pocket expenses
related to our revenue. During 2004, office and general expenses
decreased to 35.2% of revenues, compared to 36.1% in 2003. In
2004, office and general expenses decreased $13.9, excluding the
increase related to foreign currency exchange rate changes of
$102.8 and a decrease related to net acquisitions and
divestitures of $63.8.

Office and general expenses were impacted by changes in foreign
currency rates, attributable to the strengthening of the Euro
and Pound Sterling in relation to the U.S. Dollar. The
increase due to foreign currency rate changes was offset by the
impact of net acquisitions and divestitures activity, which
resulted largely from the sale of the Motorsports business in
2004.

The decrease in office and general expenses, excluding the
impact of foreign currency and net acquisition and divestitures
activity, was primarily the result of lower occupancy and
overhead costs, and a decrease related to charges recorded by
CMG in 2003 to secure certain sports television rights. These
decreases, however, were partially offset by increases driven by
a rise in professional fees as part of our ongoing efforts in
achieving Sarbanes-Oxley compliance, and the preliminary
application development and maintenance of information
technology systems and processes related to our shared services
initiatives.

For the three months ended December 31, 2004, office and
general expenses increased $47.1, excluding an increase related
to foreign currency exchange rate changes of $27.2 and a
decrease related to net acquisitions and divestitures of $20.0
when compared to 2003.

Restructuring (Reversals) Charges

During 2004 and 2003, we recorded net (reversals) and
charges related to lease termination and other exit costs and
severance and termination costs for the 2003 and 2001
restructuring programs of $62.2 and $172.9, respectively.
Included in the net (reversals) and charges were
adjustments resulting from changes in management’s
estimates for the 2003 and 2001 restructuring programs which
decreased the restructuring reserves by $32.0 and $2.4 in 2004
and 2003, respectively. 2004 net charges primarily related
to the vacating of 43 offices and workforce reduction of
approximately 400 employees related to the 2003 restructuring
program and adjustments to management’s estimates for the
2001 restructuring program. 2003 net charges primarily
related to the vacating of 55 offices and workforce reduction of
approximately



THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)

2,900 employees related to the 2003 restructuring program and
adjustments to management’s estimates for the 2001
restructuring program. A summary of the net (reversals) and
charges by segment is as follows:

In addition to amounts recorded as restructuring charges, we
recorded charges of $11.1 and $16.5 during 2004 and 2003,
respectively, related to the accelerated amortization of
leasehold improvements on properties included in the 2003
program. These charges were included in office and general
expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. For
additional information, see Note 6 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements.

During the three months ended December 31, 2004 and 2003,
we recorded net (reversals) and charges related to lease
termination and other exit costs and severance and termination
costs for the 2003 and 2001 restructuring programs of $(4.4) and
$30.2, respectively. 2004 net reversals primarily consisted
of changes to management’s estimates for the 2003 and 2001
restructuring programs primarily relating to our lease
termination costs. 2003 net charges related primarily to
the vacating of offices and workforce reduction related to the
2003 restructuring program and adjustments to management’s
estimates for the 2001 restructuring program.

2004 Impairments

IAN

— During the third quarter of 2004, we
recorded goodwill impairment charges of approximately $220.2 at
The Partnership reporting unit, which was comprised of Lowe
Worldwide, Draft Worldwide, Mullen, Dailey & Associates
and BGW. Our long-term projections showed previously
unanticipated declines in discounted future operating cash flows
due to recent client losses, reduced client spending, and
declining industry valuation metrics. These discounted future
operating cash flow projections caused the estimated fair value
of The Partnership to be less than their book values. The
Partnership was subsequently disbanded in the fourth quarter of
2004 and the remaining goodwill was allocated based on the
relative fair value of the agencies at the time of disbandment.

CMG

— As a result of the annual impairment
review, a goodwill impairment charge of $91.7 was recorded at
our CMG reporting unit, which was comprised of Weber Shandwick,
GolinHarris, DeVries, MWW Group and FutureBrand. The fair value
of CMG was adversely affected by declining industry market
valuation metrics, specifically, a decrease in the EBITDA
multiples used in the underlying valuation calculations. The
impact of the lower EBITDA multiples caused the calculated fair
value of CMG goodwill to be less than the related book value.

2003 Impairments

CMG

— We recorded an impairment charge of
$218.0 to reduce the carrying value of goodwill at Octagon. The
Octagon impairment charge reflects the reduction of the
unit’s fair value due principally to poor financial
performance in 2003 and lower than expected future financial
performance. Specifically, there was significant pricing
pressure in both overseas and domestic TV rights distribution,
declining fees from athlete representation, and lower than
anticipated proceeds from committed future events, including
ticket revenue and sponsorship.

Motorsports

— We recorded fixed asset
impairment charges of $63.8, consisting of $38.0 in connection
with the sale of a business comprised of the four owned auto
racing circuits, $9.6 related to the sales of other Motorsports
entities and a fixed asset impairment of $16.2 for outlays that
Motorsports was contractually required to spend to improve the
racing facilities.

During the three months ended December 31, 2003, we
recorded charges of $44.9. This primarily related to a
Motorsports’ fixed asset impairment charge of $38.0 in
conjunction with the sale of a business comprised of Motorsports
four owned auto racing circuits.

For additional information, see Note 9 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements.

Motorsports Contract Termination Costs

As discussed in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements, during the year ended December 31, 2004, we
recorded a pretax charge of $113.6 related to a series of
agreements with the British Racing Drivers Club and Formula One
Administration Limited which released us from certain guarantees
and lease obligations in the United Kingdom. We have exited this
business and do not anticipate any additional material charges.

Interest Expense

The decrease in interest expense was primarily due to the
redemption of our $250.0 1.80% Convertible Subordinate
Notes in January 2004 and the early redemption of our borrowings
under the Prudential Agreements during the third quarter of
2003. During the three months ended December 31, 2003, we
recorded interest expense of $51.6.

Debt Prepayment Penalty

During the fourth quarter of 2004, a prepayment penalty of $9.8
was recorded related to the early redemption of $250.0 of our
7.875% Senior Unsecured Notes due in 2005, which
represented one half of the $500.0 outstanding. During the third
quarter of 2003, we repaid our borrowings under the Prudential
Agreements, repaying $142.5 principal amount and incurring a
prepayment penalty of $24.8.

Interest Income

The increase in interest income in 2004 was primarily due to an
increase in our average balance of short-term investments held
during the year, as well as an increase in interest rates when
compared to 2003. During the three months ended
December 31, 2003, we recorded interest income of $11.5.

Investment Impairments

During 2004, we recorded investment impairment charges of $63.4,
primarily related to a $50.9 charge for our unconsolidated
investment in German advertising agency Springer &
Jacoby as a result of a decrease in projected operating results.
Additionally, we recorded impairment charges of $4.7 related to
unconsolidated affiliates primarily in Israel, Brazil, Japan and
India, and $7.8 related to several other available-for-sale
investments.

During 2003, we recorded $71.5 of investment impairment charges
related to 20 investments. The charge related principally to
investments in Fortune Promo 7 of $9.5 in the Middle East, Koch
Tavares of $7.7 in Latin America, Daiko of $10.0 in Japan, Roche
Macaulay Partners of $7.9 in Canada,
Springer & Jacoby of $6.5 in Germany and GlobalHue
of $6.9 in the U.S. The majority of the impairment charges
resulted from deteriorating economic conditions in the countries
in which the agencies operate or the loss of one or several key
clients.

During the three months ended December 31, 2004, investment
impairments decreased $15.6 as compared to the comparable period
in the prior year.

Litigation Charges

During 2004, with the court approval of the settlement of the
class action shareholder suits discussed in Note 21 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements, we received $20.0 from
insurance proceeds which we recorded as a reduction in
litigation charges because we had not previously established a
receivable. We also recorded a reduction of $12.5 relating to a
decrease in the share price between the tentative settlement
date and the final settlement date.

During 2003, we recorded litigation charges of $127.6 for
various legal matters, of which $115.0 related to a
then-tentative settlement of the class action shareholder suits
discussed above. Under the terms of the settlement, we were
required to pay $20.0 in cash and issue 6.6 shares of our
common stock. The ultimate amount of the litigation charge
related to the settlement was dependent upon our stock price at
the time of the final settlement (as the number of shares was
fixed in the agreement), which took place in December 2004.

Other Income (Expense)

In 2004, other income (expense) included $18.2 of net losses on
the sale of 19 agencies. The losses related primarily to the
sale of Transworld Marketing, a

U.S.-based

promotions
agency, which resulted in a loss of $8.6, and a $6.2 loss for
the final liquidation of the Motorsports investment. See
Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further
discussion of the Motorsports disposition.

In December 2003, we sold approximately 11.0 shares of
Modem Media for net proceeds of approximately $57.0 in December,
resulting in a pre-tax gain of $30.3. Also in December, we sold
all of the approximately 11.7 shares of TNS we had acquired
through the sale of NFO, for approximately $42.0 of net
proceeds. A pre-tax gain of $13.3 was recorded.

During the three months ended December 31, 2004, other
income (expense) decreased by $8.7, primarily due to the losses
described above for the sale of Transworld Marketing and the
Motorsports liquidation.

resulting from the Motorsports contract termination costs. The
difference between the effective tax rate and the statutory

Valuation Allowance

During 2004, the valuation allowance of $236.0 was established
in continuing operations on existing deferred tax assets and
current year losses with no benefit. The total valuation
allowance as of December 31, 2004 was $488.6. Our income
tax expense recorded in the future will be reduced to the extent
of offsetting decreases in our valuation allowance. The
establishment or reversal of valuation allowances could have a
significant negative or positive impact on future earnings.

During 2003, the valuation allowance of $111.4 was established
in continuing operations on existing deferred tax assets and
losses in 2003 with no benefit. In addition, $3.7 of valuation
allowances were established for certain U.S. capital and
other loss carryforwards. The total valuation allowance as of
December 31, 2003 was $252.6.

Loss from Continuing Operations

In 2004, our loss from continuing operations decreased by $95.2
or 14.9% as a result of an increase in revenue of $225.3 and a
decrease in expense and other income primarily driven by higher
litigation costs in 2003, as a result of the shareholder suit
settlement. These changes were partially offset by an increase
in operating expenses of $287.8, which includes Motorsports
contract termination costs of $113.6.

For the three months ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, we
recorded income from continuing operations of $130.3 and a loss
from continuing operations of $3.6, respectively.

Income from Discontinued Operations

Recorded within income from discontinued operations is the
impact of our sale of NFO, our research unit, to TNS in 2003.
NFO is classified in discontinued operations and the results of
operations and cash flows of NFO have been removed from our
results of continuing operations and cash flows for all periods.
During 2003, we completed the sale of NFO for $415.6 in cash
($376.7, net of cash sold and expenses) and approximately
11.7 shares of TNS stock. We sold the TNS stock in December
2003 for net proceeds of approximately $42.0. As a result of the
sale of NFO, we recognized a pre-tax gain of $99.1 ($89.1, net
of tax) in the third quarter of 2003 after certain post closing
adjustments. The TNS shares sold resulted in a pre-tax gain of
$13.3. In July 2004, we received an additional $10.0 ($6.5, net
of tax) from TNS as a final payment. For additional information,
see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Segment Results of Operations — 2004 Compared to

The following table summarizes revenue and operating income
(loss) by segment in 2004 and 2003. As previously discussed, in
2004 and 2003 we had a third reportable segment, comprised of
our Motorsports operations, which were sold during 2004. Other
than long-lived asset impairment and contract termination costs,
the operating results of Motorsports are not material to our
consolidated results, and are therefore not discussed below:

For the year ended December 31, 2004, IAN experienced net
increases in revenue as compared to 2003 by $258.7, or 5.0%,
which was comprised of organic revenue growth of $104.6 and an
increase in foreign currency exchange rate changes of $194.1,
partially offset by a decrease attributable to net acquisitions
and divestitures of $40.0. The increase due to foreign currency
was primarily attributable to the strengthening of the Euro and
Pound Sterling in relation to the U.S. Dollar. This
increase was partially offset by the net effect of divestitures
and acquisitions, primarily related to the sale of some small
businesses at McCann, Lowe, and Draft, and increased equity
ownership in two businesses at Lowe.

The organic revenue increase was primarily driven by increases
at McCann, Draft, FCB, and Deutsch, partially offset by
decreases at Lowe. McCann experienced an organic revenue
increase as a result of new client wins and increased business
from existing clients, primarily in our U.S. and European
agencies. Draft experienced an organic revenue increase mainly
in the U.S. due to client wins and increased business by
existing clients, partially offset by poor economic conditions
in Europe and the closing of its field marketing business in
2003. FCB experienced an organic revenue increase due to
increased spending by existing clients and client wins,
partially offset by a decrease in revenues as a result of
clients lost during the year, mainly in the U.S. and Germany.
Deutsch experienced organic revenue growth stemming from

new client wins and increased business from existing clients.
Lowe experienced an organic revenue decline, primarily the
result of client losses and reduced business from major
multinational clients.

For the three months ended December 31, 2004 IAN
experienced a net increase in revenue as compared to 2003 of
$119.7, or 7.6%, which was comprised of an increase in foreign
currency exchange rate changes of $76.0 and an organic increase
in revenue of $53.2, partially offset by a decrease attributable
to net acquisitions and divestitures of $9.5.

For the year ended December 31, 2004, IAN operating income
increased by $25.5, or 4.6%, which was a result of an increase
in revenue of $258.7, offset by an increase in salaries and
related expenses of $201.4 and increased office and general
expenses of $31.8.

Segment operating income growth, excluding the impact of foreign
currency and net effects of acquisitions and divestitures, was
primarily driven by increases at McCann, and to a lesser extent,
Deutsch and FCB, partially offset by a decrease at Lowe. McCann
experienced an organic revenue increase with essentially flat
operating expenses. Operating expenses at McCann reflect higher
compensation costs to support new client business and an
increase in contractual compensation payments made to
individuals for the achievement of specific operational targets
as part of certain prior year acquisition agreements. These
increases were offset by lower depreciation expense incurred as
a result of limited capital purchases, as well as a decrease in
bad debt expense due to improved collection of accounts
receivable. Deutsch and FCB experienced increases as a result of
organic revenue increases, partially offset by an increase in
operating expense related to increased employee incentives and
additional salaries and freelance costs to support the increase
in business activity. The decrease in operating income at Lowe
was the result of a significant organic revenue decrease
partially offset by moderate decreases in operating expenses.
The decrease in operating expenses at Lowe was the result of
lower headcount and reduced office space requirements.

For the three months ended December 31, 2004, IAN operating
income decreased by $27.4, or 7.1%, which was the result of an
increase in salaries and related expenses of $130.6 and
increased office and general expenses of $16.5, offset by an
increase in revenue of $119.7.

was comprised of an organic revenue decrease of $30.0 and the
impact of acquisitions and divestitures of $11.0, partially
offset by an increase in foreign currency exchange rate changes
of $34.4. The increase due to foreign currency exchange rate was
primarily attributable to the strengthening of the Euro and
Pound Sterling in relation to the U.S. Dollar. Net effects
of acquisitions and divestitures primarily related to the
disposition of three businesses in 2004 and two businesses in
2003.

The organic revenue decline was primarily driven by a decrease
in the branding and sports marketing businesses, offset slightly
by growth in our public relations business.

For the three months ended December 31, 2004, CMG
experienced a net decrease in revenue as compared to 2004 of
$6.5, or 2.4%, which was comprised of an organic revenue
decrease of $11.0 and decreases attributable to net acquisitions

Segment operating income growth, excluding the impact of foreign
currency and net effects of acquisition and divestitures, was
primarily driven by an increase at sports marketing business,
partially offset by an increase in CMG corporate office expense.
While there was an organic revenue decrease sports marketing
business operating expenses decreased at a higher rate than the
organic revenue decrease, due to a decrease related to charges
recorded by CMG in 2003 to secure certain sports television
rights. Increased corporate office expenses was driven by higher
expenses recorded for performance incentive awards as a result
of improved revenue performance and additional accruals for post
employment and other benefits for management personnel.

For the three months ended December 31, 2004, CMG operating
income decreased by $18.8, or 38.8%, which was the result of a
decrease in revenue of $6.5 and increased salaries and related
expenses of $15.0, partially offset by a decrease in office and
general expenses of $2.7.

CORPORATE AND OTHER

Certain corporate and other charges are reported as a separate
line within total segment operating income and include corporate
office expenses and shared service center expenses, as well as
certain other centrally managed expenses which are not fully
allocated to operating divisions. The following significant
expenses are included in corporate and other:

Salaries, benefits and related expenses include salaries,
pension, the cost of medical, dental and other insurance
coverage and other compensation-related expenses for corporate
office employees, as well as the cost of temporary employees at
the corporate office. Professional fees include costs related to
the preparation for Sarbanes-Oxley Act compliance, the financial
statement audit, legal counsel, information technology and other
consulting fees. Rent and depreciation includes rental expense
and depreciation of leasehold improvements for properties
occupied by corporate office employees. Corporate insurance
expense includes the cost for fire, liability and automobile
premiums. Bank fees relates to our debt and credit facilities.
The amounts of expenses allocated to operating segments are
calculated monthly based on a formula that uses the revenues of
the operating unit.

The increase in corporate and other expense of $114.4 or 88.8%
is primarily related to the increase in professional fees and
salaries and related expenses. The increase in professional fees
primarily resulted from costs associated with complying with the
requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We also incurred
increased expenses for the preliminary application development
and maintenance of systems and processes related to our shared
services initiatives. The increase in payroll related expenses
is due mainly to an increase in the use of temporary employees
in order to enhance monitoring controls at the corporate office
as well as to support our significant ongoing efforts to achieve
Sarbanes-Oxley compliance. Increased headcount and expanded
office space at the corporate office also contributed to this
increase. Also, certain contractual bonuses for management
increased as compared to prior year.

The increase in corporate and other expense of $7.0 or 10.5% for
the three months ended December 31, 2004 is primarily
related to the increase in professional fees offset by the
decrease in salaries and related expenses. The increase in
professional fees are the result of costs associated with
internal control compliance, costs associated with the Prior
Restatement process, and related audit costs. Amounts allocated
to operating divisions primarily increased due to the
implementation of new information

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

CASH FLOW OVERVIEW

Operating cash flow

Our operating activities utilized cash of approximately $20.2,
compared to cash provided by operating activities of $464.8 in
2004 and $502.6 in 2003. The decrease in cash provided by
operating activities in 2005 was primarily attributable to
significant increases in our operating costs as well as a
decline in revenues. Additional cash was used during 2005 for
severance costs primarily related to international headcount
reductions, salary costs primarily attributable to our hiring
additional creative talent to enable future revenue growth and
additional staff to address weaknesses in our accounting and
control environment, and professional fees primarily related to
the Prior Restatement and our ongoing efforts in internal
control compliance. The decrease in cash provided by operating
activities in 2005 was also attributable in part to
year-over-year changes in accounts payable and other changes in
working capital accounts.

We conduct media buying on behalf of clients, which affects our
working capital and operating cash flow. In most of our
businesses, we collect funds from our clients which we use, on
their behalf, to pay production costs and media costs. The
amounts involved substantially exceed our revenues, and the
current assets and current liabilities on our balance sheet
reflect these pass-through arrangements. Our assets include both
cash received and accounts receivable from customers for these
pass-through arrangements, while our liabilities include amounts
owed on behalf of customers to media and production suppliers.
Generally, we pay production and media charges after we have
received funds from our clients, and our risk from client
nonpayment has historically not been significant.

We manage substantially all our domestic cash and liquidity
centrally through the corporate treasury department. Each day,
domestic agencies with excess funds invest these funds with
corporate treasury and domestic agencies that require funding
will borrow funds from corporate treasury. The corporate
treasury department aggregates the net domestic cash position on
a daily basis. The net position is either invested or borrowed.
Given the amount of cash on hand, we have not had short-term
domestic borrowings over the past two years.

The amount of our cash held by the banks under our International
pooling arrangements is subject to a full right of offset
against the amounts advanced to us, and the cash and advances
are recorded net on our balance sheet. The gross amounts vary
depending on how much funding is provided to agencies through
the pooling arrangements. At December 31, 2005 and 2004,
cash of $842.6 and $939.9, respectively, was netted against an
equal amount of advances under pooling arrangements. We
typically pay interest on our larger arrangements based on the
gross amounts of the advances and receive interest income on the
gross amount of cash deposited, albeit at a lower rate.

Funding requirements

Our most significant funding requirements include:
non-cancelable operating lease obligations, capital
expenditures, payments related to vendor discounts and credits,
payments related to past acquisitions, interest payments,
preferred stock dividends and taxes.



THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS — (Continued)

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)

Our non-cancelable lease commitments primarily relate to office
premises and equipment. These commitments are partially offset
by sublease rental income we receive under non-cancelable
subleases. Our projected obligations for 2005 and beyond are set
forth below under Contractual Obligations.

Our capital expenditures are primarily to upgrade computer and
telecommunications systems and to modernize offices. Our
principal bank credit facility currently limits spending on
capital expenditures in any calendar year to $210.0. Our capital
expenditures were $140.7 in 2005, $194.0 in 2004 and $159.6 in
2003.

We acquired a large number of agencies through 2001, but in
recent years the number and value of acquisitions have been
significantly less. There were no acquisitions in 2005 and cash
paid for acquisitions was approximately $14.6 in 2004 and $4.0
in 2003. Under the contractual terms of certain of our past
acquisitions we have long-term obligations to pay additional
consideration or to purchase additional equity interests in
certain consolidated or unconsolidated subsidiaries if specified
conditions, mostly operating performance, are met. Some of the
consideration under these arrangements is in shares of our
common stock, but most is in cash. We made cash payments for
past acquisitions of $97.0 in 2005, $161.7 in 2004 and $221.2 in
2003. Our projected obligations for 2006 and beyond are set
forth below under Contractual Obligations.

We are required to post letters of credit primarily to support
commitments to purchase media placements, predominantly in
locations outside the U.S., or to satisfy other obligations. We
generally obtain these letters of credit from our principal bank
syndicate under the Three-Year Revolving Credit Facility
described under Credit Arrangements below. The outstanding
amount of letters of credit was $162.4 and $165.4 as of
December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. These letters of
credit have not been drawn upon in recent years.

Sources of funds

At December 31, 2005 our total of cash and cash equivalents
plus short-term marketable securities was $2,191.5 compared to
$1,970.4 at December 31, 2004.

We have obtained financing through the capital markets by
issuing debt securities, convertible preferred stock and common
stock. Our outstanding debt securities and convertible preferred
stock are described under Long-Term Debt, 4.50% Convertible
Senior Notes (“4.50% Notes”) and Convertible
Preferred Stock below.

In July 2005, we issued $250.0 of Floating Rate Notes due 2008
in a private placement to refinance maturing debt, as described
below. In October 2005, we issued 0.525 shares of
Series B Cumulative Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock
at gross proceeds of $525.0 with the proceeds to be used for
general corporate purposes as described below under Convertible
Preferred Stock.

We have committed and uncommitted credit facilities, the terms
of which are described below. We maintain our committed credit
facility primarily as stand-by short-term liquidity and for the
issuance of letters of credit. We have not drawn on our
committed facility over the past two years, although letters of
credit have been and continue to be issued under this facility,
as described above. Our outstanding borrowings under uncommitted
credit facilities were $53.7 and $67.8 as of December 31,
2005 and 2004, respectively. We use uncommitted credit lines for
working capital needs at some of our operations outside the
United States. If we lose access to these credit lines, we may
be required to provide funding directly to some overseas
operations.

Liquidity outlook

We expect our operating cash flow and cash on hand to be
sufficient to meet our anticipated operating requirements at a
minimum for the next twelve months. We have no significant
scheduled amounts of long-term debt due until 2008 when $250.0
of our Floating Rate Senior Unsecured Notes are due. In
addition, holders of our $800.0 4.50% Notes may require us
to repurchase the 4.50% Notes for cash at par in March
2008. We continue to have a level of cash and cash equivalents
that we consider to be conservative, particularly after
receiving net proceeds of approximately $507.3 from our offering
of Series B Preferred Stock in October 2005. We consider
this approach to be important in view of the cash requirements
resulting, among other things, from the higher professional
fees, from our liabilities to our customers for vendor discounts
and credits and from any potential penalties or fines that may
have to be paid in connection with our SEC investigation. In
2006, we will be required to pay to the IRS and state and local
taxing authorities approximately $93.4 (including interest),
related to tax audit matters. This amount has been reclassified
from non-current liabilities to current liabilities on the
balance sheet. As a result of our Prior Restatement review, we
estimate that we will pay approximately $250.0 related to Vendor
Discounts or Credits, Internal Investigations and International
Compensation Agreements over the next 18 months. We regularly
evaluate market conditions for opportunities to raise additional
financing on favorable terms, in order to enhance our financial
flexibility.

Substantially all of our operating cash flow is generated by the
agencies. Our liquid assets are held primarily at the holding
company level, but also at our larger subsidiaries. The legal or
contractual restrictions on our ability to transfer funds within
the group, whether in the form of dividends, loans or advances,
do not significantly reduce our financial flexibility.

    $1,056.7 will be payable in 2008 in respect of long-term debt.
    These Notes will mature in 2023 if not converted or repurchased.

Redemption and Repurchase of Long-Term Debt

In August 2005, we redeemed the remainder of the outstanding
7.875% Senior Unsecured Notes with an aggregate principal
amount of $250.0 at maturity at gross proceeds of approximately
$258.6, which included the principal amount of the Notes,
accrued interest to the redemption date and a prepayment
penalty. To redeem these Notes we used the proceeds from the
sale and issuance in July 2005 of $250.0 Floating Rate Senior
Unsecured Notes due in July 2008.

Consent Solicitation

In March 2005, we completed a consent solicitation to amend the
indentures governing five series of our outstanding public debt
to provide, among other things, that our failure to file with
the trustee our

would
not constitute a default under the indentures until
October 1, 2005.

The indenture governing our 4.50% Notes was also amended in
March 2005 to provide for: (i) an extension from
March 15, 2008 to September 15, 2009 of the date on or
after which we may redeem the 4.50% Notes and (ii) an
additional “make-whole” adjustment to the conversion
rate in the event of a change of control meeting specified
conditions.

4.50% Convertible Senior Notes

Our 4.50% Notes are convertible to common stock at a
conversion price of $12.42 per share, subject to adjustment
in specified circumstances. They are convertible at any time if
the average price of our common stock for 20 trading days
immediately preceding the conversion date is greater than or
equal to a specified percentage, beginning at 120% in 2003 and
declining 0.5% each year until it reaches 110% at maturity, of
the conversion price. They are also convertible, regardless of
the price of our common stock, if: (i) we call the
4.50% Notes for redemption; (ii) we make specified
distributions to shareholders; (iii) we become a party to a
consolidation, merger or binding share exchange pursuant to
which our common stock would be converted into cash or property
(other than securities) or (iv) the credit ratings assigned
to the 4.50% Notes by any two of Moody’s Investors
Service, Standard & Poor’s and Fitch Ratings are
lower than Ba2, BB and BB, respectively, or the 4.50% Notes
are no longer rated by at least two of these ratings services.
Because of our current credit ratings, the 4.50% Notes are
currently convertible into approximately 64.4 shares of our
common stock.

Holders of the 4.50% Notes may require us to repurchase the
4.50% Notes on March 15, 2008 for cash and on
March 15, 2013 and March 15, 2018, for cash or common
stock or a combination of both, at our election. Additionally,
investors may require us to repurchase the 4.50% Notes in
the event of certain change of control events that occur prior
to March 15, 2008 for cash or common stock or a combination
of both, at our election. If at any time on or after
March 13, 2003 we pay cash dividends on our common stock,
we will pay contingent interest in an amount equal to 100% of
the per share cash dividend paid on the common stock multiplied
by the number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion
of the 4.50% Notes. At our option, we may redeem the
4.50% Notes on or after September 15, 2009 for cash.
The redemption price in each of these instances will be 100% of
the principal amount of the Notes being redeemed, plus accrued
and unpaid interest, if any. The 4.50% Notes also provide
for an additional “make-whole” adjustment to the
conversion rate in the event of a change of control meeting
specified conditions.

In accordance with EITF Issue No. 03-6,

Participating
Securities and the Two — Class Method under FASB
Statement No. 128, Earnings Per Share

, the
4.50% Notes are considered securities with participation
rights in earnings available to common stockholders due to the
feature of these securities that allows investors to participate
in cash dividends paid on our common stock. For periods in which
we experience net income, the impact of these securities’
participation rights is included in the calculation of earnings
per share. For periods in which we experience a net loss, the
4.50% Notes have no impact on the calculation of earnings
per share due to the fact that the holders of these securities
do not participate in our losses.

Convertible Preferred Stock

We currently have two series of convertible preferred stock
outstanding: our 5.375% Series A Mandatory Convertible
Preferred Stock (“Series A Preferred Stock”) and
our 5.25% Series B Cumulative Convertible Perpetual
Preferred Stock (“Series B Preferred Stock”).



THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)

Series B Preferred Stock

— On
October 24, 2005, we completed a private offering of
0.525 shares of our Series B Preferred Stock at an
aggregate offering price of $525.0. The net proceeds from the
sale were approximately $507.3 after deducting discounts to the
initial purchasers and the estimated expenses of the offering.

Each share of the Series B Preferred Stock has a
liquidation preference of $1,000.00 per share and is
convertible at the option of the holder at any time into
73.1904 shares of our common stock, subject to adjustment
upon the occurrence of certain events, which represents a
conversion price of approximately $13.66, representing a
conversion premium of approximately 30% over our closing stock
price on October 18, 2005 of $10.51 per share. On or
after October 15, 2010, each share of the Series B
Preferred Stock may be converted at our option if the closing
price of our common stock multiplied by the conversion rate then
in effect equals or exceeds 130% of the liquidation preference
of $1,000.00 per share for 20 trading days during any
consecutive 30 trading day period. Holders of the Series B
Preferred Stock will be entitled to an adjustment to the
conversion rate if they convert their shares in connection with
a fundamental change meeting certain specified conditions.

The Series B Preferred Stock is junior to all of our
existing and future debt obligations, on parity with our
Series A Preferred Stock and senior to our common stock,
with respect to payments of dividends and rights upon
liquidation, winding up or dissolution, to the extent of the
liquidation preference of $1,000.00 per share. There are no
registration rights with respect to the Series B Preferred
Stock, shares of our common stock issuable upon conversion
thereof or any shares of our common stock that may be delivered
in connection with a dividend payment.

In accordance with EITF Issue No. 03-6, the Series B
Preferred Stock is not considered a security with participation
rights in earnings available to common stockholders due to the
contingent nature of the conversion feature of these securities.

Series A Preferred Stock

— We currently
have outstanding 7.475 shares of our Series A
Preferred Stock with a liquidation preference of $50.00 per
share. On the automatic conversion date of December 15,
2006, each share of the Series A Preferred Stock will
convert, subject to certain adjustments, into between 3.0358 and
3.7037 shares of common stock, depending on the
then-current market price of our common stock.

At any time prior to December 15, 2006, holders may elect
to convert each share of their Series A Preferred Stock,
subject to certain adjustments, into 3.0358 shares of our
common stock. If the closing price per share of our common stock
exceeds $24.71 for at least 20 trading days within a period of
30 consecutive trading days, we may elect, subject to certain
limitations, to cause the conversion of all of the shares of
Series A Preferred Stock then outstanding into shares of
our common stock at a conversion rate of 3.0358 shares of
our common stock for each share of our Series A Preferred
Stock.

The Series A Preferred Stock is junior to all of our
existing and future debt obligations, on parity with our
Series B Preferred Stock and senior to our common stock,
with respect to payments of dividends and rights upon
liquidation, winding up or dissolution, to the extent of the
liquidation preference of $50.00 per share.

In accordance with EITF Issue No. 03-6, the Series A
Preferred Stock is considered a security with participation
rights in earnings available to common stockholders due to the
conversion feature of these securities. For periods in which we
experience net income, the impact of these securities’
participation rights is included in the calculation of earnings
per share. For periods in which we experience a net loss, the
Series A Preferred Stock has no impact on the calculation
of earnings per share due to the fact that the holders of these
securities do not participate in our losses.

Credit Arrangements

We have committed and uncommitted credit facilities with various
banks that permit borrowings at variable interest rates. At
December 31, 2005 and 2004, there were no borrowings under
our committed facilities. However, there were borrowings under
the uncommitted facilities made by several of our subsidiaries
outside the U.S. totaling $53.7 and $67.8, respectively. We
have guaranteed the repayment of some of these borrowings by our
subsidiaries. The weighted-average interest rate on outstanding
balances under the uncommitted short-term facilities at
December 31, 2005 and 2004 was approximately 5% in each
year. A summary of our credit facilities is as follows:

Our primary bank credit agreement is a three-year revolving
credit facility (as amended, the “Three-Year Revolving
Credit Facility”). The Three-Year Revolving Credit Facility
expires on May 9, 2007 and provides for borrowings of up to
$500.0, of which $200.0 is available for the issuance of letters
of credit. This facility was amended as of October 17, 2005
to increase the amount that we may borrow under the facility by
$50.0 to $500.0. Our $250.0

364-Day

Revolving
Credit Facility expired on September 30, 2005.

The terms of our Three-Year Revolving Credit Facility at
December 31, 2005 do not permit us: (i) to make cash
acquisitions in excess of $50.0 until October 2006, or
thereafter in excess of $50.0 until expiration of the agreement
in May 2007, subject to increases equal to the net cash proceeds
received during the applicable period from any disposition of
assets or any business; (ii) to make capital expenditures
in excess of $210.0 annually; (iii) to repurchase our
common stock or to declare or pay dividends on our capital
stock, except that we may declare or pay dividends in shares of
our common stock, declare or pay cash dividends on our preferred
stock, and repurchase our capital stock in connection with the
exercise of options by our employees or with proceeds
contemporaneously received from an issue of new shares of our
capital stock; or (iv) to incur new debt at our
subsidiaries, other than unsecured debt incurred in the ordinary
course of business of our subsidiaries outside the U.S. and
unsecured debt, which may not exceed $10.0 in the aggregate,
incurred in the ordinary course of business of our
U.S. subsidiaries. The terms also permit the issuance of
letters of credit with expiration dates beyond the termination
date of the facility, subject to certain conditions. Such
conditions include the requirement for us, on the 105th day
prior to the termination date of the facility, to provide a cash
deposit in an amount equal to the total amount of outstanding
letters of credit with expiration dates beyond the termination
date of the facility. These terms were previously modified by
three amendments on March 31, June 22 and
September 27, 2005, respectively. The March 21, 2006
amendment effective as of December 31, 2005 added one new
financial covenant so that we are required to maintain, based on
a five business day testing period, in cash and securities, an
average daily ending balance of $300.0 plus the aggregate
principal amount of

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF

borrowings under the credit facility in domestic accounts with
our lenders. For further explanation of these and other
amendments see Note 13 of the Consolidated Financial
Statements. We also obtained a waiver from the lenders under the
Three-Year Revolving Credit Facility on March 21, 2006, to
waive any default arising from the restatement of our financial
data presented in this report.

Our Three-Year Revolving Credit Facility now contains certain
financial covenants. These covenants have been modified by
amendments and waivers on March 31, 2005, June 22,
2005, September 27, 2005, November 7, 2005 (effective
as of September 30, 2005) and March 21, 2006 (effective as
of December 31, 2005). We have been in compliance with all
covenants under the Three-Year Revolving Credit Facility, as
amended or waived from time to time. For further detail of these
changes to the financial covenants see Note 13 of the
Consolidated Financial Statements. Our financial covenants,
effective as of December 31, 2005, require us to maintain
with respect to each fiscal quarter set forth below:

(i) an interest coverage ratio for the four fiscal quarters
then ended of not less than that set forth opposite the
corresponding quarter in the table below:

quarters then ended of not less than that set forth opposite the
corresponding quarter in the table below:

The terms used in these ratios, including EBITDA, interest
coverage and debt, are subject to specific definitions set forth
in the agreement. Under the definition set forth in the
Three-Year Revolving Credit Facility, EBITDA is determined by
adding to net income or loss the following items: interest
expense, income tax expense, depreciation expense, amortization
expense, and certain specified cash payments and non-cash
charges subject to limitations on time and amount set forth in
the agreement. Interest coverage is defined as a ratio of EBITDA
of the period of four fiscal quarters then ended to interest
expense during such period.

We have in the past been required to seek and have obtained
amendments and waivers of the financial covenants under our
committed bank facility. There can be no assurance that we will
be in compliance with these covenants in future periods. If we
do not comply and are unable to obtain the necessary amendments
or waivers at that time, we would be unable to borrow or obtain
additional letters of credit under the Three-Year Revolving
Credit Facility and could choose to terminate the facility and
provide a cash deposit in connection with any amount under the
outstanding letters of credit. The lenders under the Three-Year
Revolving Credit Facility would also have the right to terminate
the facility, accelerate any outstanding principal and require
us to provide a cash deposit in an amount equal to the aggregate
amount of outstanding letters of credit. The outstanding amount
of letters of credit was $162.4 as of December 31, 2005. We
have not drawn under the Three-Year Credit Facility over the
past two years, and we do not currently expect to do so. So long
as there are no amounts to be accelerated under the Three-Year
Revolving Credit Facility, termination of the facility would not
trigger the cross-acceleration provisions of our public debt.

Credit Agency Ratings

Although a ratings downgrade by any of the ratings agencies will

current long-term debt credit ratings as of March 15, 2006
are Ba1 with negative outlook, B+ with negative

Investors Service, Standard & Poor’s and Fitch
Ratings, respectively.

Payment of Dividends

We have not paid any dividends on our common stock since
December of 2002. As previously discussed, our ability to
declare or pay dividends on common stock is currently restricted
by the terms of our Three-Year Revolving Credit Facility. In
addition, the terms of our outstanding series of preferred stock
do not permit us to pay dividends on our common stock unless all
accumulated and unpaid dividends have been or contemporaneously
are declared and paid, or provision for the payment thereof has
been made.

We pay annual dividends on each share of Series A Preferred
Stock in the amount of $2.6875. Annual dividends on each share
of Series A Preferred Stock are payable quarterly in cash
or, if certain conditions are met, in common stock, at our
option, on March 15, June 15, September 15 and
December 15 of each year. In addition to the stated annual
dividend, if at any time on or before December 15, 2006, we
pay a cash dividend on our common stock, the holders of
Series A Preferred Stock participate in such distributions
via adjustments to the conversion ratio, thereby increasing the
number of common shares into which the Preferred Stock will
ultimately convert. In March 2006, the Board of Directors
declared a dividend of $0.671875 per share on our
Series A Preferred Stock, resulting in a maximum possible
aggregate dividend of $5.0.

We pay annual dividends on each share of Series B Preferred
Stock in the amount of $52.50 per share. The initial dividend on
our Series B Preferred Stock is $11.8125 per share and
was declared on December 19, 2005 and paid in cash on
January 17, 2006. Annual dividends on each share of
Series B Preferred Stock are payable quarterly in cash or,
if certain conditions are met, in common stock, at our option,
on January 15, April 15, July 15 and October 15 of
each year. The dividend rate of the Series B Preferred
Stock will be increased by 1.0% if we do not pay dividends on
the Series B Preferred Stock for six quarterly periods
(whether consecutive or not). The dividend rate will revert back
to the original rate once all unpaid dividends are paid in full.
The dividend rate of the Series B Preferred Stock will also
be increased by 1.0% if we do not file our periodic reports with
the SEC within 15 days after the required filing date
during the first two-year period following the closing of the
offering. In March 2006, the Board of Directors declared a
dividend of $13.125 per share on our Series B
Preferred Stock, resulting in a maximum possible aggregate
dividend of $6.9.

Dividends on each series of our preferred stock are cumulative
from the date of issuance and are payable on each payment date
to the extent that we are in compliance with our Three-Year
Revolving Credit Facility, assets are legally available to pay
dividends and our Board of Directors or an authorized committee
of our Board declares a dividend payable. If we do not pay
dividends on any series of our preferred stock for six quarterly
periods (whether consecutive or not), then holders of all series
of our preferred stock then outstanding will have the right to
elect two additional directors to the Board. These additional
directors will remain on the Board until all accumulated and
unpaid dividends on our cumulative preferred stock have been
paid in full, or to the extent our series of non-cumulative
preferred stock is outstanding, until non-cumulative dividends
have been paid regularly for at least one year.

Holders of our $800.0 4.50% Notes may require us to

    If all holders require us to repurchase these Notes, a total of
    $1,056.7 will be payable in 2008 in respect of long-term debt.
    These Notes will mature in 2023 if not converted or repurchased.

We have contingent obligations under guarantees of certain
obligations of our subsidiaries (“parent company
guarantees”) relating principally to credit facilities,
guarantees of certain media payables and operating leases of
certain subsidiaries. The amount of such parent company
guarantees was approximately $306.8 and $601.8 at
December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. In the event of
non-payment by the applicable subsidiary of the obligations
covered by a guarantee, we would be obliged to pay the amounts
covered by that guarantee. As of December 31, 2005, there
are no material assets pledged as security for such parent
company guarantees.

We have not included obligations under our pension and
postretirement benefit plans in the contractual obligations
table. Our funding policy regarding our funded pension plan is
to contribute amounts necessary to satisfy minimum pension
funding requirements plus such additional amounts from time to
time as are determined to be appropriate to improve the
plans’ funded status. The funded status of our pension
plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on
invested assets, level of market interest rates and levels of
voluntary contributions to the plans. Declines in long-term
interest rates have had a negative impact on the funded status
of the plans. For 2006, we expect to contribute $17.8 to fund
our domestic pension plans, and expect to contribute $22.1 to
our foreign pension plans.

We have structured certain acquisitions with additional
contingent purchase price obligations in order to reduce the
potential risk associated with negative future performance of
the acquired entity. In addition, we have entered into
agreements that may require us to purchase additional equity
interests in certain consolidated and unconsolidated
subsidiaries. The amounts relating to these transactions are
based on estimates of the future financial performance of the
acquired entity, the timing of the exercise of these rights,
changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other factors. We
have not recorded a liability for these items on the balance
sheet since the definitive amounts payable are not determinable
or distributable. When the contingent acquisition obligations
have been met and the consideration is distributable, we will
record the fair value of this consideration as an additional
cost of the acquired entity. The following table details the
estimated liability and the estimated amount that would be paid
under such options, in the event of exercise at the earliest
exercise date. All payments are contingent upon achieving
projected operating performance targets and satisfying other
conditions specified in the related agreements and are subject
to revisions as the earn-out periods progress.

The following contingent acquisition obligations are net of
compensation expense, except as noted below, as defined by the
terms and conditions of the respective acquisition agreements
and employment terms of the former owners of the acquired
businesses. This future expense will not be allocated to the
assets and liabilities acquired. As of December 31, 2005,
our estimated contingent acquisition obligations are as follows:

In accounting for acquisitions, we recognize deferred payments
and purchases of additional interests after the effective date
of purchase that are contingent upon the future employment of
owners as compensation expense in our Consolidated Statement of
Operations. As of December 31, 2005, our estimated
contingent acquisition payments with associated compensation
expense impacts are as follows:

We have entered into certain acquisitions that contain both put
    and call options with similar terms and conditions. In such
    instances, we have included the related estimated contingent
    acquisition obligations with Put Options.

We maintain certain put options with consolidated affiliates
that are exercisable at the discretion of the minority owners as
of December 31, 2005. These put options are assumed to be
exercised in the earliest possible period subsequent to
December 31, 2005. Therefore, the related estimated
acquisition payments of $33.5 have been included within the
total payments expected to be made in 2006 in the table above.
These payments, if not made in 2006, will continue to
carry-forward into 2007 or beyond until they are exercised or
expire.

The 2006 obligations relate primarily to acquisitions that were
completed prior to December 31, 2001.

DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES

We periodically enter into interest rate swap agreements and
forward contracts to manage exposure to interest rate
fluctuations and to mitigate foreign exchange volatility. In
January 2005, we executed an interest rate swap which
synthetically converted $150.0 of the $500.0, 7.25% Senior
Unsecured Notes due August 2011, of fixed rate debt to floating
rates. We entered into the swap to hedge a portion of our
floating interest rate exposure on our cash investments. In May
of 2005, we terminated all of our long-term interest rate swap
agreements covering the $350.0 6.25% Senior Unsecured Notes
and $150.0 of the $500.0 7.25% Senior Unsecured Notes. In
connection with the interest rate swap termination, our net cash
receipts were approximately $1.1, which will be recorded as an
offset to interest expense over the remaining life of the
related debt.

We have entered into foreign currency transactions in which
various foreign currencies are bought or sold forward. These
contracts were entered into to meet currency requirements
arising from specific transactions. The changes in value of
these forward contracts have been recorded as other income or
expense in our Consolidated Statement of Operations. As of
December 31, 2005 and 2004, we had contracts covering
approximately $6.2 and $1.8, respectively, of notional amount of
currency and the fair value of the forward contracts was
negligible.

The terms of the 4.50% Notes include two embedded
derivative instruments and the terms of our Series B
Preferred Stock include one embedded derivative. The fair value
of the three derivatives on December 31, 2005 was
negligible.

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

We have identified numerous material weaknesses in our internal
control over financial reporting, as set forth in greater detail
in Item 8, Management’s Assessment on Internal Control
Over Financial Reporting and Item 9A, Controls and
Procedures, of this report. Each of our material weaknesses
results in more than a remote likelihood that a material
misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will
not be prevented or detected. As a result, we have assessed that
our internal control over financial reporting was not effective
as of December 31, 2005.

We are in the process of developing and implementing remedial
measures to address the material weaknesses in our internal
control over financial reporting. However, because of our
decentralized structure and our many disparate accounting
systems of varying quality and sophistication, we have extensive
work remaining to remedy these material weaknesses. We are in
the process of developing a work plan for remedying all of the
identified material weaknesses and this work will extend beyond
the 2006 fiscal year. At present, there can be no assurance as
to when these material weaknesses will be remedied. Until our
remediation is completed, we will continue to incur the expenses
and management burdens associated with the manual procedures and
additional resources required to prepare our Consolidated
Financial Statements. There will also continue to be a
substantial risk that we will be unable to file our periodic
reports with the SEC in a timely manner. We discuss these risks
in Item 1A, Risk Factors, of this Annual Report.

LIABILITIES RELATING TO OUR PRIOR RESTATEMENT

Restatement Related Matters

As described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements, in our 2004 Annual Report on
Form

10-K

filed in
September 2005, we restated previously reported financial
statements for 2003, 2002, 2001, 2000 and for the first three
quarters of 2004 and all four quarters of 2003. We refer to that
restatement as the “Prior Restatement”. During our
Prior Restatement, we conducted an extensive

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF

OPERATIONS — (Continued)

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)

examination of financial information and significant
transactions and recorded expense and liabilities related to
Vendor Discounts or Credits, Internal Investigations, and
International Compensation Arrangements.

$37.5 of vendor credits disclosed within Internal Investigations
    as of December 31, 2004 has been reclassified to Vendor
    Discounts or Credits for current year presentation.

Vendor Discounts or Credits

We receive credits from our vendors and media outlets for the
acquisition of goods and services that are entered into on
behalf of our clients. The expenses include the purchase of
various forms of media, including television, radio, and print
advertising space, or production costs, such as the creation of
advertising campaigns, commercials, and print advertisements.
Revenues in the advertising and communicative services business
are frequently recorded net of third party costs as the business
is primarily an agent for its clients. Since these costs are
billed to clients, there are times when vendor credits or price
differences can affect the net revenue recorded by the agency.
These third party discounts, rebates, or price differences are
frequently referred to as credits.

Our contracts are typically “fixed-fee” arrangements
or “cost-based” arrangements. In “fixed-fee”
arrangements, the amount we charge our clients is comprised of a
fee for our services. The fee we earn, however, is not affected
by the level of expenses incurred. Therefore, any rebates or
credits received in servicing these accounts do not create a
liability to the client. In “cost-based” arrangements,
we earn a percentage commission or flat fee based on or
incremental to the expenses incurred. In these cases, rebates or
credits received may accrue to the benefit of our clients and
create a liability payable to the client. The interpretation of
cost language included in our contracts can vary across
international and domestic markets in which we operate and can
affect whether or not we have a liability to the client.

The terms of agreements with our clients are significantly
impacted by the following: 1) the types of vendor credits
obtained (rebates, discounts, media and production credits);
2) differing contract types with clients (fixed fee vs.
cost-based arrangements); 3) varying industry practices and
laws in the regions of the world in which we operate;
4) determining which contract (global, regional or local)
governs our relationships with clients; and 5) unique
contract provisions in specific contracts.

Prior to filing our 2004 Annual Report, we performed an
extensive examination of our client contracts and arrangements
and considered local law in the international jurisdictions
where we conduct business to determine the impact of improperly
recognizing these vendor credits as additional revenue instead
of recognizing a liability to our clients. We identified areas
where there were differences in prices billed to customers and
prices received from vendors. All differences associated with
cost-based contracts not already passed back to customers were
established as liabilities.

Following the filing of the

10-K

in
September of 2005, we began contacting clients to notify them of
these liabilities and to negotiate an appropriate settlement.
During this process the additional following information came to
our attention.

We have included a table that depicts the beginning balance, the
additional liabilities recorded and the adjustment reducing
these liabilities. While we had changes to our original reserve
positions, the net impact of adjustments, excluding fluctuations
related to payments and foreign currency and other was an
increase to the liability balance of $22.9, and that was
primarily attributable to the out of period vendor discounts or
credits adjustments.

Internal Investigations

In our Prior Restatement review, we noted instances of possible
employee misconduct. As a result, through December 31,
2004, we recorded adjustments with a cumulative impact on income
of $114.8. Of this amount, $61.7 related to liabilities and
asset reserves, $15.6 to asset write-offs, and $37.5 related to
Vendor Discounts or Credits as of December 31, 2004. These
adjustments were recorded to correct certain unintentional
errors in our accounting that were discovered as a result of
investigations and primarily related to agencies outside the
United States. However, certain of these investigations revealed
deliberate



THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS — (Continued)

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)

falsification of accounting records, evasion of taxes in
jurisdictions outside the United States, inappropriate charges
to clients, diversion of corporate assets, non-compliance with
local laws and regulations, and other improprieties. These
errors were not prevented or detected earlier because of
material weaknesses in our control environment and decentralized
operating structure. We recorded liabilities related to these
matters, for business locations under investigation in our Prior
Restatement review, which represented management’s best
estimate of probable exposure based on the facts available at
that time.

The law firm of Dewey Ballantine LLP was retained to advise the
Audit Committee of the Board of Directors regarding the
discharge of its obligations. Through the filing of this
document, Dewey Ballantine has reviewed all internal
investigations cases that were included in our Prior Restatement
and continues to oversee our related remediation plans. Dewey
Ballantine retained a forensic accounting firm to assist with
its review.

During 2005, we recorded a net decrease in our liabilities for
Internal Investigations of $37.0. The decrease is primarily due
to write-off of assets reserves, the recognition of deferred
revenue, and payment of taxes, penalties and interest. We also
divested certain agencies in Greece, Spain, Azerbaijan, Ukraine,
Uzbekistan, Bulgaria and Kazakhstan. We have increased our
reserves related to additional VAT and payroll related taxes.

Below is an update of our significant cases.

At our McCann and FCB agencies in Turkey we recorded adjustments
related to the retention of vendor discounts that should have
been remitted to clients, the improper valuation of a previously
acquired business over-billing clients for payments to vendors
and evasion of local taxes. In 2005, the investigation has
concluded and we have taken the appropriate personnel actions,
including the termination of local senior management. As of
December 31, 2005 and 2004, the remaining liabilities were
$12.6 and $19.8, respectively.

At Media First in New York City we recorded adjustments related
primarily to inadequate recordkeeping and the payment of certain
employee salaries through accounts payable, without appropriate
tax withholdings, resulting in increased earn-out payments. In
2005, we recorded asset write-offs and have taken the
appropriate personnel actions, including the termination of
local senior management. As of December 31, 2005 and 2004,
the remaining liabilities and asset reserves were $1.2 and
$10.8, respectively.

At our FCB agency in Spain we recorded adjustments related to
the use of companies that were formed to account for the
production and media volume discounts received from production
suppliers on a separate set of books and records, to prevent the
detection of discounts and rebates in the event of a client
audit. In addition compensation was paid to an agency
executive’s personal service company out of these companies
without proper withholding for income taxes. In 2005, we have
divested our interest in a component of FCB Spain and signed an
affiliation agreement with the management, with an appropriate
control structure to assure future business is properly
conducted. As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, the remaining
liabilities and asset reserves were $0 and $9.8, respectively.

At five McCann agencies in Azerbaijan, Ukraine, Uzbekistan,
Bulgaria and Kazakhstan we recorded adjustments related to the
failure to record and pay compensation-related taxes, value
added taxes and corporate income taxes, and inadequate record
keeping. In 2005, we have sold these entities and signed
affiliation agreements with Azerbaijan, Uzbekistan Bulgaria and
Kazakhstan and intend to sign an affiliation agreement with
Ukraine agency management. There will be an appropriate control
structure to assure business is properly conducted. As of
December 31, 2005 and 2004, the remaining liabilities and
asset reserves were $6.2 and $8.7, respectively.



THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS — (Continued)

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)

In addition, we also conducted other investigations in our Prior
Restatement review for errors found that were similar in nature
to those described above. In the aggregate, for these other
investigations, we recorded $4.7 and $12.6 in liabilities as of
December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

International Compensation Arrangements

In our Prior Restatement review, we performed an extensive
examination of employee compensation practices across our
organization. While most practices were found to be acceptable,
we identified some practices in certain jurisdictions that
required additional review. In certain jurisdictions in which we
operate, particularly in Europe and Latin America, it is common
for individuals to establish a personal service company
(“PSC”), in which case the hiring company will
normally contract directly with the PSC for the services of the
individual. We reviewed every situation where one of our
agencies had contracted with a PSC and determined that in a
number of instances, the use of a PSC was determined not to be
supportable. We also identified other arrangements or practices
in certain jurisdictions, such as payment of personal expenses
outside the normal payroll mechanism, split salary payments,
equity grants and retirement payments, and independent
contractors/employees that led to an avoidance of paying certain
taxes as well as not reporting compensation to local authorities.

For these issues, liabilities represented our best estimate of
expected payments to various governmental organizations in the
jurisdictions involved. These amounts were estimates as of such
date of our liabilities that we believed were sufficient to
cover the obligations that we may have had to various
authorities. As a result of the disclosures that were made in
our 2004 Annual Report, we anticipate that the authorities in
certain jurisdictions may undertake reviews to determine whether
any of the activities disclosed violated local laws and
regulations. This may lead to further investigations and the
levy of additional assessments including possible fines and
penalties. While we intend to defend against any assessment that
we determine to be unfounded, nevertheless we could receive
assessments which may be substantial. However, it cannot be
determined at this time whether such investigations would be
commenced or, if they are, what the outcome will be with any
reasonable certainty.

During 2005, we recorded a net decrease in our liabilities for
International Compensation Arrangements of $4.1. The decrease is
comprised of reductions in our liabilities due to the expiration
of one year under the statutes of limitations, changes in
management’s estimates and the favorable outcome of audits
in certain jurisdictions. The decrease is net of increases to
our accruals due to additional liabilities incurred in 2005
through the continued use of a PSC or other such arrangements
which we are in the process of terminating, as well as interest
on amounts not yet settled.

OUT OF PERIOD ADJUSTMENTS

In the fourth quarter, we identified certain vendor discounts
and credits, tax, and other miscellaneous adjustments in which
our previously reported financial statements were in error or
did not conform to GAAP. Because these changes are not material
to our financial statements for the periods prior to 2005, or to
2005 as a whole, we have recorded them in the fourth quarter of
2005.

The errors in our previously reported financial information, and
the failure to prevent them or detect them in our financial
reporting process, were largely attributable to weak internal
controls. We concluded that our control environment has not
progressed sufficiently to serve as an effective foundation for
all other components of internal control. See Management’s
Assessment on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)

The impact to 2004, 2003 and prior periods related to out of
period amounts recorded in the fourth quarter of 2005 was
immaterial.

Description of Out of Period Adjustments:

Vendor Discounts or Credits:

We performed extensive procedures as a result of the initiation
of settlement discussions with clients. The procedures broadly
considered global or regional contracts, review of key changes
in legal interpretations, review of statutes of limitations,
estimated exposures and vendor price differences related to
cost-based contracts. As a result of these additional
procedures, adjustments were recorded to our previously
established liabilities.

Other Adjustments

We have identified other items which do not conform to GAAP and
recorded adjustments to our 2005 Consolidated Financial
Statements which relate to previously reported periods. The most
significant include accounting related to the capitalization of
software costs, acquisition related costs and international
compensation arrangements.

Tax Adjustments

We recorded adjustments to correct the Accrued and Deferred
income taxes for items primarily related to the computation of
income tax benefits on the 2004 Long-lived Asset Impairment
Charges, the establishment of certain valuation allowances, the
accounting for certain international tax structures and



THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS — (Continued)

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)

the computation of interest accruals on certain non-US income
tax contingencies. The impact of amounts recorded in the fourth
quarter of 2005 was $8.7 of tax benefit.

We also record the tax impact of the out of period adjustments
described above, where applicable, based on the local statutory
tax rate in the jurisdiction of the entity recording the
adjustment. The impact of amounts recorded in the fourth quarter
of 2005 was $10.8 of tax benefit.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

Our Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles in the United
States of America. Preparation of the Consolidated Financial
Statements and related disclosures requires us to make
judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts
reported and disclosed in the accompanying notes. We believe
that of our significant accounting policies, the following
critical accounting estimates involve management’s most
difficult, subjective or complex judgments. We consider these
accounting estimates to be critical because changes in the
underlying assumptions or estimates have the potential to
materially impact our financial statements. Management has
discussed with our Audit Committee the development, selection,
application and disclosure of these critical accounting
estimates. We regularly evaluate our judgments, assumptions and
estimates based on historical experience and various other
factors that we believe to be relevant under the circumstances.
Actual results may differ from these estimates under different
assumptions or conditions.

Revenue Recognition

Our revenues are primarily derived from the planning and
execution of advertising programs in various media and the
planning and execution of other marketing and communications
programs. Most of our client contracts are individually
negotiated and accordingly, the terms of client engagements and
the bases on which we earn commissions and fees vary
significantly. Our client contracts are also becoming
increasingly complex arrangements that frequently include
provisions for incentive compensation and govern vendor rebates
and credits. Our largest clients are multinational entities and,
as such, we often provide services to these clients out of
multiple offices and across various agencies. In arranging for
such services to be provided, it is possible for both a global
and local agreement to be initiated. Multiple agreements of this
nature are reviewed by legal counsel to determine the governing
terms to be followed by the offices and agencies involved.
Critical judgments and estimates are involved in determining
both the amount and timing of revenue recognition under these
arrangements.

Revenue for our services is recognized when all of the following
criteria are satisfied: (i) persuasive evidence of an
arrangement exists; (ii) the price is fixed or
determinable; (iii) collectibility is reasonably assured;
and (iv) services have been performed. Depending on the
terms of the client contract, fees for services performed can be
primarily recognized three ways: proportional performance,
straight-line (or monthly basis) or completed contract.

•

Fees are generally recognized as earned based on the
    proportional performance method of revenue recognition in
    situations where our fee is reconcilable to the actual hours
    incurred to service the client as detailed in a contractual
    staffing plan or where the fee is earned on a per hour basis,
    with the amount of revenue recognized in both situations limited
    to the amount realizable under the client contract. We believe
    an input based measure (the “hour’) is appropriate in
    situations where the client arrangement essentially functions as
    a time and

out-of

-pocket expense
    contract and the client receives the benefit of the services
    provided throughout the contract term.

•

Fees are recognized on a straight-line or monthly basis when
    service is provided essentially on a pro rata basis and the
    terms of the contract support monthly basis accounting.

•

Certain fees (such as for major marketing events) are deferred
    until contract completion as the final act is so significant in
    relation to the service transaction taken as a whole. Fees are
    also recognized on a completed contract basis when the terms of
    the contract call for the delivery of discrete projects
    (“milestone’ arrangements), if any of the criteria of
    SAB No. 104 were not satisfied prior to job completion
    or the terms of the contract do not otherwise qualify for
    proportional performance or monthly basis recognition.

Incremental direct costs incurred related to contracts where
revenue is accounted for on a completed contract basis are
generally expensed as incurred. There are certain exceptions
made for significant contracts or for certain agencies where the
majority of the contracts are project-based and systems are in
place to properly capture appropriate direct costs. Commissions
are generally earned on the date of the broadcast or
publication. Contractual arrangements with clients may also
include performance incentive provisions designed to link a
portion of the revenue to our performance relative to both
qualitative and quantitative goals. Performance incentives are
recognized as revenue for quantitative targets when the target
has been achieved and for qualitative targets when confirmation
of the incentive is received from the client. Therefore,
depending on the terms of the client contract, revenue is
derived from diverse arrangements involving fees for services
performed, commissions, performance incentive provisions and
combinations of the three. The classification of client
arrangements to determine the appropriate revenue recognition
involves judgments. If the judgments change there can be a
material impact on our financial statements, and particularly on
the allocation of revenues between periods.

Substantially all of our revenue is recorded as the net amount
of our gross billings less pass-through expenses charged to a
client. In most cases, the amount that is billed to clients
significantly exceeds the amount of revenue that is earned and
reflected in our financial statements, because of various
pass-through expenses such as production and media costs. In
compliance with EITF Issue No. 99-19,

Reporting Revenue
Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent

, we assess
whether the agency or the third-party supplier is the primary
obligor. We evaluate the terms of our client agreements as part
of this assessment. In addition, we give appropriate
consideration to other key indicators such as latitude in
establishing price, discretion in supplier selection and credit
risk to the vendor. Because we operate broadly as an advertising
agency based on our primary lines of business and given the
industry practice to generally record revenue on a net versus
gross basis, we believe that there must be strong evidence in
place to overcome the presumption of net revenue accounting.
Accordingly, we generally record revenue net of pass-through
charges as we believe the key indicators of the business suggest
we generally act as an agent on behalf of our clients in our
primary lines of business. In those businesses (primarily sales
promotion, event, sports and entertainment marketing and
corporate and brand identity services) where the key indicators
suggest we act as a principal, we record the gross amount billed
to the client as revenue and the related costs incurred as
operating expenses.

The determination whether revenue in a particular line of
business should be recognized net or gross involves difficult
judgments. If we make these judgments differently, it could
significantly affect our financial performance. If it were
determined that we must recognize a significant portion of
revenues on a gross basis rather than a net basis, it would
positively impact revenues, but have no impact on our operating
income. Conversely, if it were determined that we must recognize
a significant portion of revenues on a net basis rather than a
gross basis, it would negatively impact revenues, but have no
impact on our operating income.

As we provide services as part of our core operations, we
generally incur incidental expenses, which, in practice, are
commonly referred to as “out of pocket” expenses.
These expenses often include expenses related to airfare,
mileage, hotel stays, out of town meals and telecommunication
charges. In accordance

with EITF Issue No. 01-14,

Income Statement
Characterization of Reimbursements Received for

“Out-of

-Pocket’
Expenses Incurred

, we record the reimbursements received for
incidental expenses as revenue.

We receive credits from our vendors and media outlets for
transactions entered into on behalf of our clients, which are
passed through to our clients in accordance with contractual
provisions and local law. If a pass-through is not required,
then these credits are a reduction of vendor cost, and are
generally recorded as additions to revenue. In connection with
our Prior Restatement, where it was impractical to review client
contracts, we used statistical methods to estimate our exposure
that could arise from credits, discounts and other rebates owed
to clients. If our estimate is insufficient, we may be required
to recognize additional liabilities. If the initial estimate of
the liability recorded is subsequently determined to be over or
under provided for, the difference is recorded as an adjustment
to revenue. If we are able to negotiate a favorable settlement
of a recorded liability, however, the reversal of this amount is
recorded in a non-operating income account since negotiating a
favorable outcome with a client is not considered a revenue
generating activity. See Note 2 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements for further information.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

The allowance for doubtful accounts is estimated based on the
aging of accounts receivable, reviews of client credit reports,
industry trends and economic indicators, as well as analysis of
recent payment history for specific customers. The estimate is
based largely on a formula-driven calculation but is
supplemented with economic indicators and knowledge of potential
write-offs of specific client accounts. Though we consider the
balance to be adequate, changes in general domestic and
international economic conditions in specific markets could have
a material impact on the required reserve balance. A 10%
increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts would result in
a $10.6 increase in bad debt expense for 2005.

Income Taxes

The provision for income taxes includes federal, state, local
and foreign taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
recognized for the estimated future tax consequences of
temporary differences between the financial statement carrying
amounts and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to
apply to taxable income in the year in which the temporary
differences are expected to be recovered or settled. We evaluate
the realizability of our deferred tax assets and establish a
valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that all or
a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized.

The realization of our deferred tax assets is primarily
dependent on future earnings. Any reduction in estimated
forecasted results may require that we record additional
valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets. In
connection with the U.S. deferred tax assets, management
believes that it is more likely than not that a substantial
amount of the deferred tax assets will be realized; a valuation
allowance has been established for the remainder. The amount of
the deferred tax assets considered realizable, however, could be
reduced in the near term if estimates of future
U.S. taxable income are lower than anticipated. Once a
valuation allowance has been established, it will be maintained
until there is sufficient positive evidence to conclude that it
is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be
realized. A pattern of sustained profitability will generally be
considered as sufficient positive evidence to reverse a
valuation allowance. If the allowance is reversed in a future
period, our income tax provision will be correspondingly
reduced. Accordingly, the establishment and reversal of
valuation allowances has had and could have a significant
negative or positive impact on our future earnings. See
Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
further information.



THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)

We measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax
rates that, if changed, would result in either an increase or
decrease in the provision for income taxes in the period of
change.

Undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries are
permanently reinvested. While the American Jobs Creation Act of
2004 (the “Jobs Act”) creates a temporary incentive
for U.S. corporations to repatriate undistributed
international earnings by providing an 85% dividends received
deduction, we have reviewed the provisions and determined not to
take advantage of this provision to repatriate undistributed
earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to the U.S.

Land, Buildings and Equipment

The assignment of useful lives to buildings and equipment
involves judgments and the use of estimates. Buildings and
equipment are depreciated generally using the straight-line
method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets,
which range from 3 to 7 years for furniture, equipment and
computer software costs, 10 to 35 years for buildings and
the shorter of the useful life of the asset (which ranges from 3
to 10 years) or the remaining lease term for leasehold
improvements. A one-year decrease in the useful lives of these
assets would result in an $19.1 increase in annual depreciation
expense for 2005.

Certain events or changes in circumstances could cause us to
conclude that the carrying value of our buildings and equipment
may not be recoverable. Events or circumstances that might
require impairment testing include, but are not limited to,
decrease in market price, negative forecasted cash flow, or a
significant adverse change in business climate of the asset
grouping. If the total estimate of the expected future
undiscounted cash flows of an asset grouping over its useful
life is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss is
recognized in the financial statements equal to the difference
between the estimated fair value and carrying value of the asset
grouping. If our estimates change, it may have a material impact
on our financial statements.

Investments

We regularly review our cost and equity method investments to
determine whether a significant event or change in circumstances
has occurred that may have an adverse effect on the fair value
of each investment. In the event a decline in fair value of an
investment occurs, we must determine if the decline has been
other than temporary. We consider our investments strategic and
long-term in nature, so we must determine if the fair value
decline is recoverable within a reasonable period. For
investments accounted for using the cost or equity basis, we
evaluate fair value based on specific information (valuation
methodologies, estimates of appraisals, financial statements,
etc.) in addition to quoted market price, if available. Factors
indicative of an other than temporary decline also include
recurring operating losses, credit defaults and subsequent
rounds of financing with pricing that is below the cost basis of
the investment. This list is not all-inclusive; we consider all
known quantitative and qualitative factors in determining if an
other than temporary decline in value of an investment has
occurred. Our assessments of fair value represent our best
estimates at the time of impairment review. If different fair
values are later estimated, it could have a material impact on
our financial statements. See Note 10 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements for further information.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

We account for our business combinations using the purchase
accounting method. The total costs of the acquisitions are
allocated to the underlying net assets, based on their
respective estimated fair market values and the remainder
allocated to goodwill and other intangible assets. Considering
the characteristics



THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS — (Continued)

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)

of advertising, specialized marketing and communication services
companies, our acquisitions usually do not have significant
amounts of tangible assets as the principal asset we typically
acquire is creative talent. As a result, a substantial portion
of the purchase price is allocated to goodwill. Determining the
fair market value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed
requires management’s judgment and involves the use of
significant estimates, including future cash inflows and
outflows, discount rates, asset lives and market multiples.

We review goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite
lives not subject to amortization (e.g., customer lists, trade
names and customer relationships) annually or whenever events or
significant changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
value may not be recoverable. We evaluate the recoverability of
goodwill at a reporting unit level. We have 16 reporting units
that are either the entities at the operating segment level or
one level below the operating segment level. For 2005, in
accordance with SFAS No. 142,

Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets

, we did not test certain reporting units
whose 2004 fair value determination exceeded their carrying
amount by a substantial margin, where no significant event
occurred since the last fair value determination that would
significantly change this margin and where the reporting units
did not have a triggering event during 2005. The remaining
reporting units were tested either as part of the 2005 annual
impairment testing as their 2004 fair value did not
significantly exceed their carrying value by a substantial
margin or as a result of a triggering event. We review
intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization
whenever events or circumstances indicate that a carrying amount
of an asset may not be recoverable. Intangible assets with
definite lives subject to amortization are amortized on a
straight-line basis with estimated useful lives generally
ranging from 1 to 15 years. Events or circumstances that
might require impairment testing include the loss of a
significant client, the identification of other impaired assets
within a reporting unit, loss of key personnel, the disposition
of a significant portion of a reporting unit, or a significant
adverse change in business climate or regulations.

SFAS No. 142 specifies a two-step process for testing
for goodwill impairment and measuring the magnitude of any
impairment. The first step of the impairment test is a
comparison of the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying
value, including goodwill. Goodwill allocated to a reporting
unit whose fair value is equal to or greater than its carrying
value is not impaired and no further testing is required. Should
the carrying amount for a reporting unit exceed its fair value,
then the first step of the impairment test is failed and the
magnitude of any goodwill impairment is determined under the
second step. The second step is a comparison of the implied fair
value of a reporting unit’s goodwill to its carrying value.
Goodwill of a reporting unit is impaired when its carrying value
exceeds its implied fair value. Impaired goodwill is written
down to its implied fair value with a charge to expense in the
period the impairment is identified.

The fair value of a reporting unit is estimated using our
projections of discounted future operating cash flows (without
interest) of the unit. Such projections require the use of
significant estimates and assumptions as to matters such as
future revenue growth, profit margins, capital expenditures,
assumed tax rates and discount rates. We believe that the
estimates and assumptions made are reasonable but they are
susceptible to change from period to period. For example, our
strategic decisions or changes in market valuation multiples
could lead to impairment charges. Actual results of operations,
cash flows and other factors used in a discounted cash flow
valuation will likely differ from the estimates used and it is
possible that differences and changes could be material.

For the year ended December 31, 2005, we changed the date
of our annual impairment test for goodwill and other intangible
assets with indefinite lives from September 30th to
October 1st. During 2005 we performed this annual
impairment test on September 30th and then again on
October 1st to ensure that multiples used in the
reporting units tested were consistent. By moving the date into
the fourth

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)

quarter we will be able to utilize the most current and accurate
plan and forecast information. The new date also provides us
additional time to meet future accelerated public reporting
requirements. This change did not delay, accelerate or avoid an
impairment charge. This change in accounting principle also did
not have an effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements.
Accordingly, we believe that the accounting change described
above is an alternative accounting principle that is preferable.

Our annual impairment reviews as of September 30th and
October 1st, 2005 resulted in an impairment charge at a
reporting unit within our sports and entertainment marketing
business. In addition, during the fourth quarter of 2005, there
was a loss of a significant client at one of our reporting units
that caused us to perform additional impairment testing. As a
result, we recorded $97.0 of impairments during 2005. See
Notes 8 and 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
further information. The excess of the low range of the fair
value over the carrying value for each of the non-impaired
reporting units ranged from approximately $2.4 to $1,501.9 and
$6.4 to $1,501.9 in 2005 and 2004, respectively. In order to
evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the
goodwill impairment test, we applied a hypothetical 10% decrease
to the fair values of each reporting unit. The hypothetical 10%
decrease applied to 2005 fair values for each of the
non-impaired reporting units would result in a range of an
impairment charge of approximately $38.2 to excess fair value
over carrying value of approximately $871.9. This hypothetical
10% decrease would result in excess fair value over carrying
value for each of the non-impaired reporting units ranging from
approximately $3.4 to $871.9 in 2004.

Acquisitions

The majority of our acquisitions involve an initial payment at
the time of closing and provide for additional contingent
purchase price payments over a specified time. The initial
purchase price of an acquisition is allocated to identifiable
assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on estimated fair
values with any excess being recorded as goodwill and other
intangible assets. These contingent payments, which are also
known as “earn-outs” and “put options,” are
calculated based on estimates of the future financial
performance of the acquired entity, the timing of the exercise
of these rights, changes in foreign currency exchange rates and
other factors. Earn-outs and put options are recorded within the
financial statements as an increase to goodwill and other
intangible assets once the terms and conditions of the
contingent acquisition obligations have been met and the
consideration is distributable or expensed as compensation based
on the acquisition agreement and the terms and conditions of
employment for the former owners of the acquired businesses. See
the Liquidity and Capital Resources section of this report and
Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
further information regarding future contingent acquisition
obligations.

Restructuring Reserves

When appropriate, we establish restructuring reserves for
severance and termination costs and lease termination and other
exit costs related to our restructuring programs. We have
established reserves for restructuring programs initiated in
2001 and 2003. The reserves reflect our best estimates for the
costs of the plans. However, actual results may differ from the
estimated amounts based on, but not limited to, changes in
demand for advertising services and unexpected usage of leased
properties. Comparison of actual results to estimates may
materially impact the amount of the restructuring charges or
reversals. We will continue to monitor our restructuring
reserves and may adjust the current balances based on future
events. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements
for further information.



THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)

Pension and Postretirement Benefits

We use various actuarial methods and assumptions in determining
our pension and postretirement benefit costs and obligations,
including the discount rate used to determine the present value
of future benefits, expected long-term rate of return on plan
assets and healthcare cost trend rates. The discount rate
determination is one of the significant assumptions that impacts
our benefit cost and recorded obligations for pension and
postretirement plans. Discount rates used for our benefit plans
attempt to match the duration of the underlying liability with
highly rated securities that could be used to effectively settle
the obligation. For example, in 2005, a 25 basis point
decrease in the discount rate would have increased our net
benefit cost by approximately $2.0. See Note 16 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

OTHER MATTERS

SEC Investigation

The SEC opened a formal investigation in response to the
restatement we first announced in August 2002 and, as previously
disclosed, the SEC staff’s investigation has expanded to
encompass our Prior Restatement. In particular, since we filed
our 2004
Form

10-K,

we have
received subpoenas from the SEC relating to matters addressed in
our Prior Restatement. We continue to cooperate with the
investigation. We expect that the investigation will result in
monetary liability, but because the investigation is ongoing, in
particular with respect to the Prior Restatement, we cannot
reasonably estimate either the timing of a resolution or the
amount. Accordingly, we have not yet established any accounting
provision relating to these matters.

RECENT ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

See Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a
complete description of recent accounting pronouncements that
have affected us or may affect us.

Item 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market
    Risk

In the normal course of business, we are exposed to market risks
related to interest rates and foreign currency rates. From time
to time, we use derivatives, pursuant to established guidelines
and policies, to manage some portion of these risks. Derivative
instruments utilized in our hedging activities are viewed as
risk management tools, involve little complexity and are not
used for trading or speculative purposes. See Note 18 to
the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Interest Rates

Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates
relates primarily to our debt obligations. As further described
in Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, our
principal debt obligations at December 31, 2005 consisted
of our 4.50% Notes and Senior Unsecured Notes, with
expiration dates ranging from 2009 to 2014.

At December 31, 2005 and 2004, 86.0% and 81.1% of our debt
obligations bore interest at fixed interest rates. Accordingly,
assuming the fixed-rate debt is not refinanced, there would be
no impact on interest expense or cash flow from either a 10%
increase or decrease in market rates of interest. However, there
would be an impact on the fair market value of the debt, as the
fair market value of debt is sensitive to changes in interest
rates. For 2005, the fair market value of the debt obligations
would decrease by approximately $27.7 if market rates were to
increase by 10% and would increase by approximately $28.0 if
market rates were to decrease by 10%. For 2004, the fair market
value of the debt obligations would have decreased by
approximately $16.3 if market rates increased by 10% and would
have increased by approximately $19.5 if market rates decreased
by 10%. For that portion of the debt that bore interest at
variable rates, based on outstanding amounts and rates at
December 31, 2005, interest expense and cash out-flow would
increase or decrease by approximately $2.1 if market rates were
to increase or decrease by 10%, respectively. For that portion
of the debt that bore interest at variable rates, based on
outstanding amounts and rates at December 31, 2004,
interest expense and cash out-flow would have increased or
decreased by approximately $1.8 if market rates increased or
decreased by 10%, respectively. From time to time we have used
interest rate swaps to manage the mix of our fixed and floating
rate debt obligations. In May 2005, we terminated all our
existing long-term interest rate swap agreements, and currently
have none outstanding.

Foreign Currencies

We face translation and transaction risks related to changes in
foreign currency exchange rates. Amounts invested in our foreign
operations are translated into U.S. Dollars at the exchange
rates in effect at the balance sheet date. The resulting
translation adjustments are recorded as a component of
accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the
stockholders’ equity section of our Consolidated Balance
Sheet. Our foreign subsidiaries generally collect revenues and
pay expenses in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar,
mitigating transaction risk. Since the functional currency of
our foreign operations is generally the local currency, foreign
currency translation of the balance sheet is reflected as a
component of stockholders’ equity and does not impact
operating results. Revenues and expenses in foreign currencies
translate into varying amounts of U.S. Dollars depending
upon whether the U.S. Dollar weakens or strengthens against
other currencies. Therefore, changes in exchange rates may
either positively or negatively affect our consolidated revenues
and expenses (as expressed in U.S. Dollars) from foreign
operations. Currency transaction gains or losses arising from
transactions in currencies other than the functional currency
are included in results of operations and were not significant
in the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004. We have not
entered into a material amount of foreign currency forward
exchange contracts or other derivative financial instruments to
hedge the effects of adverse fluctuations in foreign currency
exchange rates.



Item 8.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

INDEX



MANAGEMENT’S ASSESSMENT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER
FINANCIAL REPORTING

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in
Rules

13a-15(f)

and

15d-15(f)

under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Internal control over financial
reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of
America (“GAAP”). We recognize that because of its
inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting
may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of
any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to
the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes
in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the
policies and procedures may deteriorate.

To evaluate the effectiveness of our internal control over
financial reporting, management used the criteria described in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission (“COSO”).

A material weakness (within the meaning of PCAOB Auditing
Standard No. 2) in internal control over financial
reporting is a control deficiency, or combination of control
deficiencies, that results in more than a remote likelihood that
a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial
statements will not be prevented or detected.

Management’s assessment is that our internal control over
financial reporting was not effective as of December 31,
2005 because of the material weaknesses identified and described
below. The material weaknesses identified by us at
December 31, 2005 are grouped according to the components
of the COSO framework to which they relate. These material
weaknesses resulted in restatements, misstatements and audit
adjustments as described below, and could result in
misstatements that would be material to the annual or interim
consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or
detected.

Control Environment

1. The Company did not maintain an effective control
environment. Specifically, controls were not designed and in
place to ensure compliance with the Company’s policies and
procedures, including those contained in the Company’s Code
of Conduct. Further, the Company did not maintain a sufficient
complement of personnel with an appropriate level of accounting
knowledge, experience and training in the application of
GAAP commensurate with the Company’s financial
reporting requirements. The Company also failed to implement
processes to ensure periodic monitoring of its existing internal
control activities over financial reporting by placing heavy
reliance on manual procedures without quality control review and
other monitoring controls in place to adequately identify and
assess significant risks that may impact financial statements
and related disclosures. This deficiency results in a control
environment that allowed instances of falsified books and
records, violations of laws, regulations and the Company’s
policies, misappropriation of assets and improper customer
charges and dealings with vendors. This deficiency resulted in a
restatement of the first three interim periods of 2005 and
misstatements and audit adjustments, including the out of period
adjustments, to the 2005 annual and interim consolidated
financial statements. Additionally, this control deficiency
could result in a misstatement of account balances or disclosure
that would result in a material misstatement to annual or
interim consolidated financial statements that would not be
prevented or detected. This deficiency has had a pervasive
impact on the Company’s control environment and has
contributed to the material weaknesses described below.

Control Activities

2. The Company did not maintain effective controls over the
accounting for purchase business combinations. Specifically, the
Company did not have controls designed and in place to ensure
the completeness, accuracy and valuation of revenue and expenses
of acquired companies related to periods after the closing date
of the transactions. In addition, the Company did not maintain
effective controls to ensure the completeness, accuracy and
valuation of assets and liabilities recorded for compensatory
earn-out and put arrangements or derivatives embedded within
acquisition transactions. This deficiency resulted in a
restatement of the first three interim periods of 2005 and
misstatements and audit adjustments, including out of period
adjustments, to the 2005 annual and interim consolidated
financial statements,



which primarily impacted accounts receivable, net, accounts
payable, minority interests in consolidated subsidiaries,
goodwill, and other income. Additionally, this control
deficiency could result in a misstatement of account balances or
disclosure, including, but not limited to, the aforementioned
accounts above that would result in a material misstatement to
the annual or interim consolidated financial statements that
would not be prevented or detected.

3. The Company did not maintain effective controls over the
accuracy and presentation and disclosure of recording of
revenue. Specifically, controls were not designed and in place
to ensure that customer contracts were authorized, that customer
contracts were analyzed to select the appropriate method of
revenue recognition, and billable job costs were compared to
client cost estimates to ensure that no amounts were owed to
clients. In addition, controls were not designed and in place to
ensure that revenue transactions were analyzed for appropriate
presentation and disclosure of billable client pass-through
expenses or for recognition of revenue on a gross or net basis.
This deficiency resulted in a restatement of the first three
interim periods of 2005, and misstatements and audit
adjustments, including out of period adjustments, to the 2005
annual and interim consolidated financial statements, which
impacted revenue, office and general expenses, accounts
receivable, net, expenditures billable to clients, accounts
payable, and accrued liabilities. Additionally, this control
deficiency could result in a misstatement of account balances or
disclosure, including the aforementioned accounts above, that
would result in a material misstatement to the annual or interim
consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or
detected.

4. The Company did not maintain effective controls to
ensure that certain financial statement transactions were
appropriately initiated, authorized, processed, documented and
accurately recorded. This was primarily evident in the following
specific areas:

This deficiency resulted in a restatement of the first three
interim periods of 2005, and misstatements and audit
adjustments, including out of period adjustments, to the 2005
annual and interim consolidated financial statements, which
impacted substantially all accounts in the consolidated
financial statements. Additionally, this control deficiency
could result in a misstatement of account balances or
disclosure, including the aforementioned accounts above, that
would result in a material misstatement to the annual or interim
consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or
detected.

5. The Company did not maintain effective controls over the
complete and accurate recording of leases in accordance with
GAAP. Specifically, the Company did not completely evaluate and
accurately account for leases with rent holidays, rent
escalation clauses, leasehold improvements or asset retirement
obligations associated with real estate leases. This deficiency
resulted in audit adjustments to the 2005 annual and interim
consolidated financial statements, which primarily impacted
office and general expenses, restructuring charges, land,
buildings and equipment, net, accrued liabilities and other
non-current liabilities. Additionally, this control deficiency
could result in a misstatement of account balances or
disclosure, including the aforementioned accounts above, that
would result in a material misstatement to the annual or interim
consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or
detected.



6. The Company did not maintain effective controls over the
accounting for income taxes in domestic operations and
operations outside of the United States to ensure amounts are
accurately accounted for in accordance with GAAP. Specifically,
the Company did not have controls designed and in place to
ensure that accounting personnel performed the following:
recorded income tax provision between current and deferred tax
accounts in the balance sheet; reconciled prior years’
income tax returns to the appropriate period income tax
provision computations; timely identified income tax exposures
and contingencies, including interest and penalties; and
reconciled tax accounts to tax filings. This deficiency resulted
in misstatements and audit adjustments, including out of period
adjustments, to the 2005 annual consolidated financial
statements, which impacted accrued liabilities, deferred income
taxes, other non-current liabilities and the provision for
income taxes. Additionally, this control deficiency could result
in a misstatement of account balances or disclosure, including
the aforementioned accounts above, that would result in a
material misstatement to the annual or interim consolidated
financial statements that would not be prevented or detected.

7. The Company did not maintain effective controls over
reporting local income tax in the local statutory accounts or
local income tax returns in operations outside of the United
States. Specifically, the Company did not have controls designed
and in place to ensure that accounting personnel adhere to
policy and procedures regarding compliance with local laws and
regulations, and reconcile its accounts between GAAP and local
income tax reporting. This allowed in prior periods the
violation of local tax regulations and incomplete and inaccurate
recording of income taxes in the Company’s consolidated
financial statements. This deficiency did not result in an audit
adjustment to the consolidated financial statements. However,
this deficiency could result in a misstatement of account
balances or disclosure, including, but not limited to, accrued
liabilities, deferred income taxes, other non-current
liabilities and the provision for income taxes, that would
result in a material misstatement to the annual or interim
consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or
detected.

8. The Company did not maintain effective controls relating
to the completeness and accuracy of local payroll and
compensation related liabilities in certain operations outside
of the United States. Specifically the Company did not have
controls designed and in place to identify instances where local
reporting regulations and payroll tax withholding requirements
were not met or identification of compensation practices which
were either not supportable under local law or were not fully in
accordance with the Company’s policies and procedures. This
allowed in prior periods improperly omitting, or instances of
purposefully omitting, certain liabilities in the consolidated
financial statements. This deficiency resulted in a restatement
of the first three interim periods of 2005, and misstatements
and audit adjustments, including out of period adjustments, to
the 2005 annual and interim consolidated financial statements,
which impacted salaries and related expenses and accrued
liabilities. Additionally, this deficiency could result in a
misstatement of account balances or disclosure, including the
aforementioned accounts above, that would result in a material
misstatement to the annual or interim consolidated financial
statements that would not be prevented or detected.

9. The Company did not maintain effective controls over the
accuracy and completeness of the processing and monitoring of
intercompany transactions, including appropriate authorization
for intercompany charges. Specifically, controls were not
designed and in place to ensure that intercompany balances were
accurately classified and completely reported in the
Company’s consolidated financial statements, and
intercompany confirmations were not completed timely or
accurately between the Company’s agencies to ensure proper
elimination as part of the consolidation process. This
deficiency resulted in immaterial audit adjustments to the 2005
annual and interim consolidated financial statements.
Additionally, this control deficiency could result in a
misstatement of account balances or disclosure that would result
in a material misstatement to the annual or interim consolidated
financial statements that would not be prevented or detected.

10. The Company did not maintain effective controls over
the reconciliation of certain financial statement accounts.
Specifically, controls were not designed and in place to ensure
that the Company’s accounts were accurate and agreed to
detailed support. This deficiency resulted in a restatement of
the first three interim periods of 2005, and misstatements and
audit adjustments, including the out of period



adjustments, to the 2005 annual and interim consolidated
financial statements, which impacted substantially all accounts
in the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
Additionally, this control deficiency could result in a
misstatement of account balances or disclosure that would result
in a material misstatement to the annual or interim consolidated
financial statements that would not be prevented or detected.

11. The Company did not maintain effective control over the
monitoring of financial statement accounts to value and record
them in a timely, accurate and complete manner. Specifically,
controls were not designed and in place to:

This deficiency resulted in a restatement of the first three
interim periods of 2005, and misstatements and audit
adjustments, including out of period adjustments, to the 2005
annual and interim consolidated financial statements, which
impacted substantially all accounts in the Company’s
consolidated financial statements. Additionally, this control
deficiency could result in a misstatement of account balances or
disclosure, including the aforementioned accounts above, that
would result in a material misstatement to the annual or interim
consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or
detected.

12. The Company did not maintain effective controls over
the period end financial reporting process. Specifically,
controls were not designed and in place to ensure that
(i) journal entries, both recurring and non-recurring, were
reviewed and approved, (ii) timely and complete review
procedures were properly performed over the accounts and
disclosures in our financial statements by personnel with
knowledge sufficient to reach appropriate accounting
conclusions, and (iii) a reconciliation of its legal entity
financial results to the financial results recorded in the
consolidated financial statements was performed. This deficiency
resulted in a restatement of the first three interim periods of
2005, and misstatements and audit adjustments, including the out
of period adjustments, to the 2005 annual and interim
consolidated financial statements, which impacted substantially
all accounts in the Company’s consolidated financial
statements. Additionally, this control deficiency could result
in a misstatement of account balances or disclosure that would
result in a material misstatement to the annual or interim
consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or
detected.

13. The Company did not maintain effective controls over
the safeguarding of assets. Controls were not designed and in
place to segregate responsibility and authority between
initiating, processing and recording of transactions which has
impacted many accounts in the Company’s consolidated
financial statements. This deficiency has resulted in certain
improper transactions being entered into and those transactions
being recorded or not recorded in the Company’s financial
statements. This deficiency resulted



in a restatement of the first three interim periods of 2005, and
misstatements and audit adjustments, including the out of period
adjustments, to the 2005 annual and interim consolidated
financial statements, which impacted substantially all accounts
in the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
Additionally, this control deficiency could result in a
misstatement of account balances or disclosure that would result
in a material misstatement to the annual or interim consolidated
financial statements that would not be prevented or detected.

14. The Company did not maintain effective controls over
certain independent service providers. Specifically, the Company
was unable to document, test, and evaluate controls at third
party vendors to which the Company outsources certain payroll
processing services in North America. This deficiency did not
result in an adjustment to the consolidated financial
statements. However, this deficiency could result in a
misstatement of account balances or disclosure, including
salaries and related expenses and accrued liabilities that would
result in a material misstatement to the annual or interim
consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or
detected.

15. The Company did not maintain effective controls over
access to the Company’s financial applications and data as
well as controls over changes to financial applications.
Specifically, controls were not designed and in place to ensure
that access to certain financial applications and data at
certain locations were adequately restricted or changes to
financial applications were documented or tested. In addition,
the Company did not adequately monitor the access to financial
applications and data. This deficiency has had a pervasive
impact on the Company’s information technology control
environment. Additionally, this deficiency could result in a
misstatement of account balances or disclosure to substantially
all accounts that would result in a material misstatement to the
annual or interim consolidated financial statements that would
not be prevented or detected.

16. The Company did not maintain effective controls over
spreadsheets used in the Company’s financial reporting
process. Specifically, controls were not designed and in place
to ensure that access was restricted to appropriate personnel,
and that unauthorized modification of the data or formulas
within spreadsheets was prevented. This deficiency did not
result in material adjustments to the consolidated financial
statements. However, this deficiency could result in a
misstatement of account balances or disclosure to substantially
all accounts that would result in a material misstatement to the
annual or interim consolidated financial statements that would
not be prevented or detected.

Information and Communication

17. The Company did not maintain effective controls over
the communication of policies and procedures. Specifically,
controls were not designed and in place to ensure corporate
communications, including the Company’s code of conduct,
were received by personnel across the Company. This deficiency
has had a pervasive impact on the Company’s control
environment and has contributed to the material weaknesses
described above. Additionally, this deficiency could result in a
misstatement of account balances or disclosure to substantially
all accounts that would result in a material misstatement to the
annual or interim consolidated financial statements that would
not be prevented or detected.

Monitoring

18. The Company did not maintain effective controls over
monitoring the performance of proper application of the
Company’s internal controls over financial reporting and
related policies and procedures. Specifically, controls were not
designed and in place to ensure that the Company identifies and
remediates control deficiencies timely. This deficiency has had
a pervasive impact on the Company’s control environment and
has contributed to the material weaknesses described above.
Additionally, this deficiency could result in a misstatement of
account balances or disclosure to substantially all accounts
that would result in a material misstatement to the annual or
interim consolidated financial statements that would not be
prevented or detected.



Management’s assessment of the effectiveness of the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2005 has been audited by
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC), our independent registered
public accounting firm. Refer to PwC’s report within
Item 8.

REMEDIATION OF MATERIAL WEAKNESSES IN

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

We continue to have extensive work remaining to remedy the
material weaknesses described above. The magnitude of the work
is attributable partly to our significantly decentralized
structure and the number of our disparate accounting systems of
varying quality and sophistication. We continue the process of
developing and implementing a remediation plan to address our
deficiencies and expect that this plan will extend into the 2006
fiscal year and beyond. The following list describes remedial
actions that have been implemented to date or continue to be
implemented across the Company’s operating units.



Given the presence of material weaknesses in our internal
control over financial reporting, there is more than a remote
likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim
financial statements will not be prevented or detected. Our
financial reporting process includes extensive procedures we
undertake so that our published financial statements are
presented in accordance with GAAP, notwithstanding the material
weaknesses in internal control. We have significantly expanded
our year-end closing procedures. We have expanded our review of
customer contracts and agreements to address revenue recognition
issues. In addition, we have other procedures to monitor account
analysis, specifically related to liabilities arising from
vendor discounts or credits, future obligations related to prior
acquisitions, internal investigations and international
compensation arrangements, as well as account reconciliations.
All of the above mentioned procedures have been designed so that
our consolidated financial statements are presented in
accordance with GAAP. As a result, management, to the best of
its knowledge, believes that (i) this report does not
contain any untrue statements of a material fact or omits any
material fact and (ii) the consolidated financial
statements and other financial information included in this
report for the year ended December 31, 2005 have been
prepared in conformity with GAAP and fairly present in all
material respects our financial condition, results of operations
and cash flows.



Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of

The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc.:

We have completed an integrated audit of The Interpublic Group
of Companies, Inc.’s 2005 consolidated financial statements
and of its internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2005 and audits of its 2004 and 2003
consolidated financial statements in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States). Our opinions, based on our audits, are
presented below.

Consolidated financial statements and financial statement
schedule

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and
the related consolidated statements of operations, of
stockholders’ equity and of cash flows present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of The Interpublic
Group of Companies, Inc. and its subsidiaries at
December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December 31, 2005 in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement
schedule listed in the index appearing under Item 8
presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set
forth therein when read in conjunction with the related
consolidated financial statements. These financial statements
and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the
Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements and financial statement
schedule based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these
statements in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit of financial statements
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing
the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable
basis for our opinion.

As described in Note 8 to the consolidated financial
statements the Company has changed the date of its annual
goodwill impairment test from September 30 to
October 1.

Internal control over financial reporting

Also, we have audited management’s assessment, included in
Management’s Assessment on Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting appearing under Item 8, that The Interpublic
Group of Companies, Inc. did not maintain effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005,
because the Company did not maintain: (1) an effective
control environment; (2) effective controls over the
accounting for purchase business combinations;
(3) effective controls over the accuracy and presentation
and disclosure of recording of revenue; (4) effective
controls to ensure that certain financial statement transactions
were appropriately initiated, authorized, processed, documented
and accurately recorded; (5) effective controls over the
complete and accurate recording of leases in accordance with
GAAP; (6) effective controls over the accounting for income
taxes in domestic operations and operations outside of the
United States to ensure amounts are accurately accounted for in
accordance with GAAP; (7) effective controls over reporting
local income tax in the local statutory accounts or local income
tax returns in operations outside of the United States;
(8) effective controls relating to the completeness and
accuracy of local payroll and compensation related liabilities
in certain operations outside of the United States;
(9) effective controls over the accuracy and completeness
of the processing and monitoring of intercompany transactions,
including appropriate authorization for intercompany charges;
(10) effective controls over the reconciliation of certain
financial statement accounts; (11) effective control over
the monitoring of financial statement accounts to value and
record them in a timely, accurate and complete manner;
(12) effective controls over the period end financial
reporting process; (13) effective controls over the
safeguarding of assets; (14) effective controls over
certain independent service providers; (15) effective



controls over access to the Company’s financial
applications and data as well as controls over changes to
financial applications; (16) effective controls over
spreadsheets used in the Company’s financial reporting
process; (17) effective controls over the communication of
policies and procedures; and (18) effective controls over
monitoring the performance of proper application of the
Company’s internal controls over financial reporting and
related policies and procedures, based on criteria established
in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company’s management is
responsible for maintaining effective internal control over
financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness
of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility
is to express opinions on management’s assessment and on
the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit of internal control over financial
reporting in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether effective internal control over
financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. An
audit of internal control over financial reporting includes
obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial
reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal
control, and performing such other procedures as we consider
necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit
provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

A material weakness is a control deficiency, or combination of
control deficiencies, that results in more than a remote
likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim
financial statements will not be prevented or detected. The
following material weaknesses have been identified and included
in management’s assessment.

1. The Company did not maintain an effective control
environment. Specifically, controls were not designed and in
place to ensure compliance with the Company’s policies and
procedures, including those contained in the Company’s Code
of Conduct. Further, the Company did not maintain a sufficient
complement of personnel with an appropriate level of accounting
knowledge, experience and training in the application of GAAP
commensurate with the Company’s financial reporting
requirements. The Company also failed to implement processes to
ensure periodic monitoring of its existing internal control
activities over financial reporting by placing heavy reliance on
manual procedures without quality control review and other
monitoring controls in place to adequately identify and assess
significant risks that may impact financial statements and
related disclosures. This deficiency results in a control
environment that allowed instances of falsified books and
records, violations of laws, regulations and the Company’s
policies, misappropriation of assets and improper customer
charges and dealings with vendors. This deficiency resulted in a
restatement of the first three interim periods of 2005, and
misstatements and audit adjustments, including the out of period
adjustments, to the 2005 annual and interim consolidated
financial



statements. Additionally, this control deficiency could result
in a misstatement of account balances or disclosure that would
result in a material misstatement to annual or interim
consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or
detected. This deficiency has had a pervasive impact on the
Company’s control environment and has contributed to the
material weaknesses described below.

2. The Company did not maintain effective controls over the
accounting for purchase business combinations. Specifically, the
Company did not have controls designed and in place to ensure
the completeness, accuracy and valuation of revenue and expenses
of acquired companies related to periods after the closing date
of the transactions. In addition, the Company did not maintain
effective controls to ensure the completeness, accuracy and
valuation of assets and liabilities recorded for compensatory
earn-out and put arrangements or derivatives embedded within
acquisition transactions. This deficiency resulted in a
restatement of the first three interim periods of 2005, and
misstatements and audit adjustments, including out of period
adjustments, to the 2005 annual and interim consolidated
financial statements, which primarily impacted accounts
receivable, net, accounts payable, minority interests in
consolidated subsidiaries, goodwill, and other income.
Additionally, this control deficiency could result in a
misstatement of account balances or disclosure, including, but
not limited to, the aforementioned accounts above that would
result in a material misstatement to the annual or interim
consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or
detected.

3. The Company did not maintain effective controls over the
accuracy and presentation and disclosure of recording of
revenue. Specifically, controls were not designed and in place
to ensure that customer contracts were authorized, that customer
contracts were analyzed to select the appropriate method of
revenue recognition, and billable job costs were compared to
client cost estimates to ensure that no amounts were owed to
clients. In addition, controls were not designed and in place to
ensure that revenue transactions were analyzed for appropriate
presentation and disclosure of billable client pass-through
expenses or for recognition of revenue on a gross or net basis.
This deficiency resulted in a restatement of the first three
interim periods of 2005, and misstatements and audit
adjustments, including out of period adjustments, to the 2005
annual and interim consolidated financial statements, which
impacted revenue, office and general expenses, accounts
receivable, net, expenditures billable to clients, accounts
payable, and accrued liabilities. Additionally, this control
deficiency could result in a misstatement of account balances or
disclosure, including the aforementioned accounts above, that
would result in a material misstatement to the annual or interim
consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or
detected.

4. The Company did not maintain effective controls to
ensure that certain financial statement transactions were
appropriately initiated, authorized, processed, documented and
accurately recorded. This was primarily evident in the following
specific areas:

This deficiency resulted in a restatement of the first three
interim periods of 2005, and misstatements and audit
adjustments, including out of period adjustments, to the 2005
annual and interim consolidated financial statements, which
impacted substantially all accounts in the consolidated
financial statements. Additionally, this control deficiency
could result in a misstatement of account balances or disclosure,



including the aforementioned accounts above, that would result
in a material misstatement to the annual or interim consolidated
financial statements that would not be prevented or detected.

5. The Company did not maintain effective controls over the
complete and accurate recording of leases in accordance with
GAAP. Specifically, the Company did not completely evaluate and
accurately account for leases with rent holidays, rent
escalation clauses, leasehold improvements or asset retirement
obligations associated with real estate leases. This deficiency
resulted in audit adjustments to the 2005 annual and interim
consolidated financial statements, which primarily impacted
office and general expenses, restructuring charges, land,
buildings and equipment, net, accrued liabilities and other
non-current liabilities. Additionally, this control deficiency
could result in a misstatement of account balances or
disclosure, including the aforementioned accounts above, that
would result in a material misstatement to the annual or interim
consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or
detected.

6. The Company did not maintain effective controls over the
accounting for income taxes in domestic operations and
operations outside of the United States to ensure amounts are
accurately accounted for in accordance with GAAP. Specifically,
the Company did not have controls designed and in place to
ensure that accounting personnel performed the following:
recorded income tax provision between current and deferred tax
accounts in the balance sheet; reconciled prior years’
income tax returns to the appropriate period income tax
provision computations; timely identified income tax exposures
and contingencies, including interest and penalties; and
reconciled tax accounts to tax filings. This deficiency resulted
in misstatements and audit adjustments, including out of period
adjustments, to the 2005 annual consolidated financial
statements, which impacted accrued liabilities, deferred income
taxes, other non-current liabilities and the provision for
income taxes. Additionally, this control deficiency could result
in a misstatement of account balances or disclosure, including
the aforementioned accounts above, that would result in a
material misstatement to the annual or interim consolidated
financial statements that would not be prevented or detected.

7. The Company did not maintain effective controls over
reporting local income tax in the local statutory accounts or
local income tax returns in operations outside of the United
States. Specifically, the Company did not have controls designed
and in place to ensure that accounting personnel adhere to
policy and procedures regarding compliance with local laws and
regulations, and reconcile its accounts between GAAP and local
income tax reporting. This allowed in prior periods the
violation of local tax regulations and incomplete and inaccurate
recording of income taxes in the Company’s consolidated
financial statements. This deficiency did not result in an audit
adjustment to the consolidated financial statements. However,
this deficiency could result in a misstatement of account
balances or disclosure, including, but not limited to, accrued
liabilities, deferred income taxes, other non-current
liabilities and the provision for income taxes, that would
result in a material misstatement to the annual or interim
consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or
detected.

8. The Company did not maintain effective controls relating
to the completeness and accuracy of local payroll and
compensation related liabilities in certain operations outside
of the United States. Specifically the Company did not have
controls designed and in place to identify instances where local
reporting regulations and payroll tax withholding requirements
were not met or identification of compensation practices which
were either not supportable under local law or were not fully in
accordance with the Company’s policies and procedures. This
allowed in prior periods improperly omitting, or instances of
purposefully omitting, certain liabilities in the consolidated
financial statements. This deficiency resulted in a restatement
of the first three interim periods of 2005, and misstatements
and audit adjustments, including out of period adjustments, to
the 2005 annual and interim consolidated financial statements,
which impacted salaries and related expenses and accrued
liabilities. Additionally, this deficiency could result in a
misstatement of account balances or disclosure, including the
aforementioned accounts above, that would result in a material
misstatement to the annual or interim consolidated financial
statements that would not be prevented or detected.

9. The Company did not maintain effective controls over the
accuracy and completeness of the processing and monitoring of
intercompany transactions, including appropriate authorization
for intercompany charges.



Specifically, controls were not designed and in place to ensure
that intercompany balances were accurately classified and
completely reported in the Company’s consolidated financial
statements, and intercompany confirmations were not completed
timely or accurately between the Company’s agencies to
ensure proper elimination as part of the consolidation process.
This deficiency resulted in immaterial audit adjustments to the
2005 annual and interim consolidated financial statements.
Additionally, this control deficiency could result in a
misstatement of account balances or disclosure that would result
in a material misstatement to the annual or interim consolidated
financial statements that would not be prevented or detected.

10. The Company did not maintain effective controls over
the reconciliation of certain financial statement accounts.
Specifically, controls were not designed and in place to ensure
that the Company’s accounts were accurate and agreed to
detailed support. This deficiency resulted in a restatement of
the first three interim periods of 2005, and misstatements and
audit adjustments, including the out of period adjustments, to
the 2005 annual and interim consolidated financial statements,
which impacted substantially all accounts in the Company’s
consolidated financial statements. Additionally, this control
deficiency could result in a misstatement of account balances or
disclosure that would result in a material misstatement to the
annual or interim consolidated financial statements that would
not be prevented or detected.

the period end financial reporting process. Specifically,
controls were not designed and in place to ensure that
(i) journal entries, both recurring and non-recurring, were
reviewed and approved, (ii) timely and complete review
procedures were properly performed over the accounts and
disclosures in our financial statements by personnel with
knowledge sufficient to reach appropriate accounting
conclusions, and (iii) a reconciliation of its legal entity
financial results to the financial results recorded in the
consolidated financial statements was performed. This deficiency
resulted in a restatement of the first three interim periods of
2005, and misstatements and audit



adjustments, including the out of period adjustments, to the
2005 annual and interim consolidated financial statements, which
impacted substantially all accounts in the Company’s
consolidated financial statements. Additionally, this control
deficiency could result in a misstatement of account balances or
disclosure that would result in a material misstatement to the
annual or interim consolidated financial statements that would

financial statements. This deficiency has resulted in certain
improper transactions being entered into and those transactions
being recorded or not recorded in the Company’s financial

deficiency could result in a misstatement of account balances or
disclosure that would result in a material misstatement to the
annual or interim consolidated financial statements that would
not be prevented or detected.

14. The Company did not maintain effective controls over
certain independent service providers. Specifically, the Company
was unable to document, test, and evaluate controls at third
party vendors to which the Company outsources certain payroll
processing services in North America. This deficiency did not
result in an adjustment to the consolidated financial
statements. However, this deficiency could result in a
misstatement of account balances or disclosure, including
salaries and related expenses and accrued liabilities that would
result in a material misstatement to the annual or interim
consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or
detected.

15. The Company did not maintain effective controls over

the communication of policies and procedures. Specifically,
controls were not designed and in place to ensure corporate
communications, including the Company’s code of conduct,
were received by personnel across the Company. This deficiency
has had a pervasive impact on the Company’s control
environment and has contributed to the material weaknesses
described above. Additionally, this deficiency could result in a
misstatement of account balances or disclosure to substantially
all accounts that would result in a material misstatement to the
annual or interim consolidated financial statements that would
not be prevented or detected.

18. The Company did not maintain effective controls over
monitoring the performance of proper application of the
Company’s internal controls over financial reporting and
related policies and procedures. Specifically, controls were not
designed and in place to ensure that the Company identifies and
remediates control deficiencies timely. This deficiency has had
a pervasive impact on the Company’s control



environment and has contributed to the material weaknesses
described above. Additionally, this deficiency could result in a
misstatement of account balances or disclosure to substantially
all accounts that would result in a material misstatement to the
annual or interim consolidated financial statements that would
not be prevented or detected.

These material weaknesses were considered in determining the
nature, timing, and extent of audit tests applied in our audit
of the 2005 consolidated financial statements, and our opinion
regarding the effectiveness of the Company’s internal
control over financial reporting does not affect our opinion on
those consolidated financial statements.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that the Company
did not maintain effective internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2005, is fairly stated, in all
material respects, based on criteria established in

Internal
Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the COSO.
Also, in our opinion, because of the effects of the material
weaknesses described above on the achievement of the objectives
of the control criteria, the Company has not maintained
effective internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2005, based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Business Description

The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc. and subsidiaries (the
“Company”, “Interpublic”, “we”,
“us” or “our”) is one of the world’s
largest advertising and marketing services companies, comprised
of hundreds of communication agencies around the world that
deliver custom marketing solutions on behalf of our clients. Our
agencies cover the spectrum of marketing disciplines and
specialties, from traditional services such as consumer
advertising and direct marketing, to services such as
experiential marketing and branded entertainment. With offices
in over 100 countries and approximately 43,000 employees, our
agencies work with our clients to create global and local
marketing campaigns. These marketing programs seek to build
brands, influence consumer behavior and sell products.

Prior Restatement

In our 2004 Annual Report on
Form

10-K,

we
restated our previously reported financial statements for the
years ended December 31, 2003, 2002, 2001 and 2000, and for
the first three quarters of 2004 and all four quarters of 2003
(the “Prior Restatement”). The Prior Restatement also
affected periods prior to 2000, which was reflected as an
adjustment to opening retained earnings as of January 1,
2000. All of the financial statements and financial information
contained in this
Form

10-K

related
to the prior periods mentioned above reflect the effect of the
Prior Restatement adjustments.

Principles of Consolidation

The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of
the Company, most of which are wholly owned. Investments in
companies in which we exercise significant influence, but not
control, are accounted for using the equity method of
accounting. Investments in companies in which we have less than
a 20% ownership interest and do not exercise significant
influence are accounted for at cost. All intercompany accounts
and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

In accordance with Statements of Financial Accounting Standards
(“SFAS”) Interpretation No. 46,

Consolidation
of Variable Interest Entities, an Interpretation of ARB
No. 51

along with certain revisions, we have
consolidated certain entities meeting the definition of variable
interest entities. The inclusion of these entities does not have
a material impact on our Consolidated Balance Sheets or
Statements of Operations.

Reclassifications and Revisions

Certain classification revisions have been made to the prior
period financial statements to conform to the current year
presentation. These classification revisions included amounts
previously recorded in current assets as accounts receivable of
$537.7 to expenditures billable to clients and amounts
previously recorded in current liabilities as accounts payable
of $1,411.5 to accrued liabilities in the accompanying
Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2004. The
classification of these amounts was revised to more
appropriately reflect the composition of the year end balances
of accounts receivable as amounts billed to clients and accounts
payable as amounts for which we have received invoices from
vendors. These classification revisions had no impact on our
results of operations or changes in our stockholders’
equity.

During 2003, we completed the sale of NFO World Group Inc.
(“NFO”), and its related activity is classified as
discontinued operations for all periods presented. We have
revised our 2004 and 2003 Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows
to separately disclose the operating, investing and financing
portions of the cash flows attributable to our discontinued
operations. We had previously reported these amounts on a
combined basis as a separate caption.

STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Estimates are used when accounting for certain items such as
revenue recognition, allowances for doubtful accounts,
depreciation and amortization, income taxes, restructuring
reserves, valuation of tangible and intangible assets,
recoverability of goodwill, business combinations, contingencies
and pension and postretirement benefit obligations, among others.

Segments

As of December 31, 2005, we have three reportable segments:
Integrated Agency Network (“IAN”), Constituency
Management Group (“CMG”) and Motorsports. We also
report results for the Corporate group. The largest segment,
IAN, is comprised of McCann WorldGroup (“McCann”), The
FCB Group (“FCB”), Lowe Worldwide (“Lowe”),
Draft Worldwide (“Draft”) and our leading stand-alone
agencies. Our stand-alone agencies include Campbell-Ewald, Hill
Holliday, Deutsch and Mullen. The second segment, CMG, is
comprised of Weber Shandwick, GolinHarris, DeVries, Jack Morton,
MWW Group, FutureBrand and Octagon Worldwide
(“Octagon”). Our third reportable segment is comprised
of our Motorsports operations, which were sold during 2004 and
had immaterial residual operating results in 2005.

Revenue Recognition

Our revenues are primarily derived from the planning and
execution of advertising programs in various media and the
planning and execution of other marketing and communications
programs. Most of our client contracts are individually
negotiated and accordingly, the terms of client engagements and
the bases on which we earn commissions and fees vary
significantly. Our client contracts are also becoming
increasingly complex arrangements that frequently include
provisions for incentive compensation and govern vendor rebates
and credits. Our largest clients are multinational entities and,
as such, we often provide services to these clients out of
multiple offices and across various agencies. In arranging for
such services to be provided, it is possible for both a global
and local agreement to be initiated. Multiple agreements of this
nature are reviewed by legal counsel to determine the governing
terms to be followed by the offices and agencies involved.

Revenue for our services is recognized when all of the following
criteria are satisfied: (i) persuasive evidence of an
arrangement exists; (ii) the price is fixed or
determinable; (iii) collectibility is reasonably assured;
and (iv) services have been performed. Depending on the
terms of the client contract, fees for services performed can be
primarily recognized three ways: proportional performance,
straight-line (or monthly basis) or completed contract.

•

Fees are generally recognized as earned based on the
    proportional performance method of revenue recognition in
    situations where our fee is reconcilable to the actual hours
    incurred to service the client as detailed in a contractual
    staffing plan or where the fee is earned on a per hour basis,
    with the amount of revenue recognized in both situations limited
    to the amount realizable under the client contract. We believe
    an input based measure (the ‘hour’) is appropriate in
    situations where the client arrangement essentially functions as
    a time and out-of-pocket expense contract and the client
    receives the benefit of the services provided throughout the
    contract term.

•

Fees are recognized on a straight-line or monthly basis when
    service is provided essentially on a pro rata basis and the
    terms of the contract support monthly basis accounting.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)

•

Certain fees (such as for major marketing events) are deferred
    until contract completion as the final act is so significant in
    relation to the service transaction taken as a whole. Fees are
    also recognized on a completed contract basis when the terms of
    the contract call for the delivery of discrete projects
    (‘milestone’ arrangements), if any of the criteria of
    Staff Accounting Bulletin (“SAB”) No. 104,

Revenue Recognition,

were not satisfied prior to job
    completion or the terms of the contract do not otherwise qualify
    for proportional performance or monthly basis recognition.

Incremental direct costs incurred related to contracts where
revenue is accounted for on a completed contract basis are
generally expensed as incurred. There are certain exceptions
made for significant contracts or for certain agencies where the
majority of the contracts are project-based and systems are in
place to properly capture appropriate direct costs. Commissions
are generally earned on the date of the broadcast or
publication. Contractual arrangements with clients may also
include performance incentive provisions designed to link a
portion of the revenue to our performance relative to both
qualitative and quantitative goals. Performance incentives are
recognized as revenue for quantitative targets when the target
has been achieved and for qualitative targets when confirmation
of the incentive is received from the client. Therefore,
depending on the terms of the client contract, revenue is
derived from diverse arrangements involving fees for services
performed, commissions, performance incentive provisions and
combinations of the three.

Substantially all of our revenue is recorded as the net amount
of our gross billings less pass-through expenses charged to a
client. In most cases, the amount that is billed to clients
significantly exceeds the amount of revenue that is earned and
reflected in our financial statements, because of various
pass-through expenses such as production and media costs. In
compliance with Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”)
Issue No. 99-19,

Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal
versus Net as an Agent,

we assess whether the agency or the
third-party supplier is the primary obligor. We evaluate the
terms of our client agreements as part of this assessment. In
addition, we give appropriate consideration to other key
indicators such as latitude in establishing price, discretion in
supplier selection and credit risk to the vendor. Because we
operate broadly as an advertising agency based on our primary
lines of business and given the industry practice to generally
record revenue on a net versus gross basis, we believe that
there must be strong evidence in place to overcome the
presumption of net revenue accounting. Accordingly, we generally
record revenue net of pass-through charges as we believe the key
indicators of the business suggest we generally act as an agent
on behalf of our clients in our primary lines of business. In
those businesses (primarily sales promotion, event, sports and
entertainment marketing and corporate and brand identity
services) where the key indicators suggest we act as a
principal, we record the gross amount billed to the client as
revenue and the related costs incurred as operating expenses.

As we provide services as part of our core operations, we
generally incur incidental expenses, which, in practice, are
commonly referred to as

“out-of

-pocket”
expenses. These expenses often include expenses related to
airfare, mileage, hotel stays, out of town meals and
telecommunication charges. In accordance with EITF Issue
No. 01-14,

Income Statement Characterization of
Reimbursements Received for

‘Out-of

-Pocket’
Expenses Incurred

, we record the reimbursements received for
incidental expenses as revenue.

We receive credits from our vendors and media outlets for
transactions entered into on behalf of our clients, which are
passed through to our clients in accordance with contractual
provisions and local law. If a pass-through is not required,
then these credits are a reduction of vendor cost, and are
recorded as additions to revenue. In connection with our Prior
Restatement, where it was impractical to review client
contracts, we used statistical methods to estimate our exposure
that could arise from credits, discounts and other rebates owed
to clients. If our estimate is insufficient, we may be required
to recognize additional liabilities. If the initial estimate of
the liability recorded is subsequently determined to be over or
under provided for, the difference is recorded as an adjustment
to revenue. If we are able to negotiate a favorable settlement
of a recorded liability, however, the reversal of this amount is
recorded in a non-operating



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)

income account since negotiating a favorable outcome with a
client is not considered a revenue generating activity. See
Note 2 for further information.

Costs of Services (Salaries and Related Expenses and Office
and General Expenses)

Salaries and related expenses consist of payroll costs and
related benefits associated with client service professional
staff and administrative staff, including severance associated
with reductions in workforce and costs incurred for freelance
contractors who are utilized to support business development.
Office and general expenses include costs directly attributable
to client engagements. These costs include

out-of

-pocket costs
such as travel for client service professional staff, production
costs and other direct costs that are rebilled to our clients.
Office and general expenses also include expenses attributable
to the support of client service professional staff,
depreciation and amortization costs, rent expense, bad debt
expense relating to accounts receivable, professional fees, the
costs associated with the development of a shared services
center and implementation costs associated with upgrading our
information technology infrastructure.

Cash Equivalents and Short-Term Marketable Securities

Cash equivalents are highly liquid investments, including
certificates of deposit, government securities and time deposits
with original maturities of three months or less at the time of
purchase and are stated at estimated fair value, which
approximates cost. Cash is maintained at high-credit quality
financial institutions.

As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, we held restricted cash
of $34.2 and $32.0, respectively, included in prepaid expenses
and other current assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Restricted cash represents cash equivalents that are maintained
on behalf of our clients and are legally restricted for a
specified business purpose.

We classify all of our short-term marketable equity securities
as available-for-sale. These securities are carried at fair
value with the corresponding unrealized gains and losses
reported as a separate component of comprehensive loss. The cost
of securities sold is determined based upon the average cost of
the securities sold.

Certain auction rate securities are classified as short-term
marketable securities based upon our evaluation of the maturity
dates associated with the underlying bonds. Although these
securities are issued and rated as long-term bonds, with
maturities ranging from 20 to 30 years, they are priced and
traded as short-term instruments because of the significant
degree of market liquidity provided through the interest rate
resets.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

The allowance for doubtful accounts is estimated based on the
aging of accounts receivable, reviews of client credit reports,
industry trends and economic indicators, as well as analysis of
recent payment history for specific customers. The estimate is
based largely on a formula-driven calculation but is
supplemented with economic indicators and knowledge of potential
write-offs of specific client accounts.

Expenditures Billable to Clients

As is typical of our normal business operations, it is common
for agencies to incur costs on behalf of clients, including
media and production costs. These costs are applicable when
providing advertising, marketing and other services to clients.
Expenditures billable to clients is primarily comprised of
production and media costs which have been incurred but have not
yet been billed to clients, as well as internal labor and
overhead amounts and other accrued receivables which have not
yet been billed to



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)

clients. Unbilled amounts are presented in expenditures billable
to clients regardless of whether they relate to fee or
production/media. A provision is made for unrecoverable costs as
deemed appropriate.

Investments

Investments are accounted for on the equity basis or cost basis,
including investments to fund certain deferred compensation and
retirement obligations. We regularly review our equity and cost
method investments to determine whether a significant event or
change in circumstances has occurred that may have an adverse
effect on the fair value of each investment. In the event a
decline in fair value of an investment occurs, we must determine
if the decline has been other than temporary. We consider our
investments strategic and long-term in nature, so we must
determine if the fair value decline is recoverable within a
reasonable period. For investments accounted for using the
equity basis or cost basis, we evaluate fair value based on
specific information (valuation methodologies, estimates of
appraisals, financial statements, etc.) in addition to quoted
market price, if available. Factors indicative of an other than
temporary decline include recurring operating losses, credit
defaults and subsequent rounds of financing with pricing that is
below the cost basis of the investment. This list is not
all-inclusive; we consider all known quantitative and
qualitative factors in determining if an other than temporary
decline in value of an investment has occurred. Our assessments
of fair value represent our best estimates at the time of
impairment review. See Note 10 for further information.

Land, Buildings and Equipment

Land, buildings and equipment are stated at cost, net of
accumulated depreciation. Buildings and equipment are
depreciated generally using the straight-line method over the
estimated useful lives of the related assets, which range from 3
to 7 years for furniture, equipment and computer software
costs, 10 to 35 years for buildings and the shorter of the
useful life of the asset (which ranges from 3 to 10 years)
or the remaining lease term for leasehold improvements. The
total depreciation expense for the years ended December 31,
2005, 2004 and 2003 was $167.3, $178.3 and $204.4, respectively.

During 2005, we revised the estimated depreciable lives from 3
to 20 years for furniture, equipment, and computer software
costs, 10 to 45 years for buildings and the shorter of the
useful life of the asset (which ranged from 3 to 12 years)
or the remaining lease term for leasehold improvements to more
accurately reflect the productive lives of these assets. The
change in depreciable lives was accounted for as a change in
accounting estimate on a prospective basis from July 1,
2005 and had an immaterial impact on depreciation expense for
2005.

Certain events or changes in circumstances could cause us to
conclude that the carrying value of our buildings and equipment
may not be recoverable. Events or circumstances that might
require impairment testing include, but are not limited to,
decrease in market price, negative forecasted cash flow, or a
significant adverse change in business climate of the asset. If
the total estimate of the expected future undiscounted cash
flows of an asset grouping over its useful life is less than its
carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized in the
financial statements equal to the difference between the
estimated fair value and carrying value of the asset grouping.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

We account for our business combinations using the purchase
accounting method. The total costs of the acquisitions are
allocated to the underlying net assets, based on their
respective estimated fair market values and the remainder is
allocated to goodwill and other intangible assets. Considering
the characteristics of advertising, specialized marketing and
communication services companies, our acquisitions usually do
not have significant amounts of tangible assets as the principal
assets we acquire are mostly creative talent. As a result, a
substantial portion of the purchase price is allocated to
goodwill.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)

Determining the fair market value of assets acquired and
liabilities assumed requires management’s judgment and
involves the use of significant estimates, including future cash
inflows and outflows, discount rates, asset lives, and market
multiples.

We review goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite
lives not subject to amortization (e.g., customer lists, trade
names and customer relationships) annually or whenever events or
significant changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
value may not be recoverable. We evaluate the recoverability of
goodwill at a reporting unit level. We have 16 reporting units
that are either the entities at the operating segment level or
one level below the operating segment level. For 2005, in
accordance with SFAS No. 142,

Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets

, we did not test certain reporting units
because their 2004 fair value determination exceeded their
carrying amount by a substantial margin, where no significant
event occurred since the last fair value determination that
would significantly change this margin and where the reporting
units did not have a triggering event during 2005. The remaining
reporting units were tested either as part of the 2005 annual
impairment testing as their 2004 fair value did not
significantly exceed their carrying value by a substantial
margin or as a result of a triggering event. We review
intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization
whenever events or circumstances indicate that a carrying amount
of an asset may not be recoverable. Events or circumstances that
might require impairment testing include the loss of a
significant client, the identification of other impaired assets
within a reporting unit, loss of key personnel, the disposition
of a significant portion of a reporting unit, or a significant
adverse change in business climate or regulations.

SFAS No. 142 specifies a two-step process for testing
for goodwill impairment and measuring the magnitude of any
impairment. The first step of the impairment test is a
comparison of the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying
value, including goodwill. Goodwill allocated to a reporting
unit whose fair value is equal to or greater than its carrying
value is not impaired and no further testing is required. Should
the carrying amount for a reporting unit exceed its fair value,
then the first step of the impairment test is failed and the
magnitude of any goodwill impairment is determined under the
second step. The second step is a comparison of the implied fair
value of a reporting unit’s goodwill to its carrying value.
Goodwill of a reporting unit is impaired when its carrying value
exceeds its implied fair value. Impaired goodwill is written
down to its implied fair value with a charge to expense in the
period the impairment is identified.

The fair value of a reporting unit is estimated using our
projections of discounted future operating cash flows (without
interest) of the unit. Such projections require the use of
significant estimates and assumptions as to matters such as
future revenue growth, profit margins, capital expenditures,
assumed tax rates and discount rates. We believe that the
estimates and assumptions made are reasonable but are
susceptible to change from period to period. Additionally, our
strategic decisions or changes in market valuation multiples
could lead to impairment charges. Actual results of operations,
cash flows and other factors used in a discounted cash flow
valuation will likely differ from the estimates used and it is
possible that differences and changes could be material.

For the year ended December 31, 2005, we changed the date
of our annual impairment test for all goodwill and other
intangible assets with indefinite lives from
September 30

th

to
October 1

st

.
During 2005 we performed this annual impairment test on
September 30

th

and then again on
October 1

st

to
ensure that multiples used in the reporting units tested were
consistent. See Note 8 for further explanation.

Foreign Currencies

The financial statements of our foreign operations, when the
local currency is the functional currency, are translated into
U.S. Dollars at the exchange rates in effect at each year
end for assets and liabilities and average exchange rates during
each year for the results of operations. The related unrealized
gains or losses from translation are reported as a separate
component of comprehensive loss. Transactions



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)

denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are
recorded based on exchange rates at the time such transactions
arise. Subsequent changes in exchange rates result in
transaction gains or losses, which are reflected within other
income (expense) in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Concentrations of Credit Risk

Financial instruments that potentially subject us to
concentrations of credit risk are primarily cash and cash
equivalents, short-term marketable securities, accounts
receivable, expenditures billable to clients, interest rate
instruments and foreign exchange contracts. We invest our excess
cash in investment-grade, short-term securities with financial
institutions and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one
counterparty. Concentrations of credit risk with accounts
receivable are limited due to our large number of clients and
their dispersion across different industries and geographical
areas. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our clients and
maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon the
expected collectibility of all accounts receivable. We are
exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the
counterparties of the foreign currency contracts. We limit our
exposure to any one financial institution and do not anticipate
nonperformance by these counterparties.

Income Taxes

The provision for income taxes includes federal, state, local
and foreign taxes. Income taxes are accounted for under the
liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
recognized for the estimated future tax consequences of
temporary differences between the financial statement carrying
amounts and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to
apply to taxable income in the year in which the temporary
differences are expected to be recovered or settled. We evaluate
the realizability of our deferred tax assets and establish a
valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that all or
a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. See
Note 11 for further explanation.

Earnings (Loss) Per Share

In periods when we generate a loss, basic loss per share is
computed by dividing the loss attributable to common
shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares and
contingently issuable shares outstanding for the period. In
periods when we generate income, basic Earnings Per Share
(“EPS”) is calculated using the two-class method,
pursuant to EITF Issue No. 03-6,

Participating
Securities and the Two — Class Method under
SFAS Statement No. 128.

The two-class method is
required as our 4.50% Convertible Senior Notes and
Series A Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock
(“Series A Preferred Stock”) qualify as
participating securities, each having the right to receive
dividends or dividend equivalents should dividends be declared
on common stock. Under this method, earnings for the period
(after deduction for contractual preferred stock dividends) are
allocated on a pro-rata basis to the common shareholders and to
the holders of participating securities based on their right to
receive dividends. The weighted-average number of shares
outstanding is increased to reflect the number of common shares
into which the participating securities could convert.

Diluted earnings (loss) per share reflects the potential
dilution that would occur if certain contingently issuable
shares were issued and if stock-based incentives and option
plans (including stock options, awards of restricted stock and
restricted stock units), the 4.50% Notes as described in
Note 13 and the Series A Preferred Stock as discussed
in Note 14 were exercised or converted into common stock.
The potential issuance of common stock is assumed to occur at
the beginning of the year (or at the time of issuance of the
dilution instrument, if later), and the incremental shares are
included using the treasury stock or “if-converted”
methods. The proceeds utilized in applying the treasury stock
method consist of: (1) the amount, if any, to be paid upon
exercise; (2) the amount of compensation cost attributed to
future



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)

service not yet recognized; and (3) any tax benefits
credited to

paid-in

-capital related
to the exercise. These proceeds are then assumed to be used by
us to purchase common stock at the average market price during
the period. The incremental shares (difference between the
shares assumed to be issued and the shares assumed to be
purchased), to the extent they would have been dilutive, are
included in the denominator of the diluted EPS calculation.

Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

Derivative instruments, including those that are embedded in
other contracts, are recorded at fair value in the balance sheet
as either an asset or a liability. Changes in the fair value of
the derivatives are recorded each period in earnings unless
specific hedge accounting criteria are met. We do not enter into
derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes and do
not have a material portfolio of derivative financial
instruments. See Note 18 for a further discussion.

Pension and Postretirement Benefits

We have pension and postretirement benefit plans covering
certain domestic and international employees. We use various
actuarial methods and assumptions in determining our pension and
postretirement benefit costs and obligations, including the
discount rate used to determine the present value of future
benefits, expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and
healthcare cost trend rates. See Note 16 for a further
discussion.

Stock-Based Compensation

In accordance with SFAS No. 123,

Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation

, we have accounted for our various
stock-based compensation plans under the intrinsic value
recognition and measurement principles of Accounting Principles
Board (“APB”) Opinion No. 25,

Accounting for
Stock Issued to Employees

, and its related interpretations.

Generally, the exercise price of stock options granted equals
the market price of the underlying shares on the date of the
grant and, therefore, no compensation expense is recorded. The
intrinsic value of restricted stock grants and certain other
stock-based compensation issued to employees and Board Members
as of the date of grant is amortized to compensation expense
over the vesting period. Certain stock options and restricted
stock units are subject to variable accounting. See Note 22
for information regarding recent accounting standards and
Note 15 for further discussion of incentive plans.

On December 20, 2005, the Compensation Committee of our
Board of Directors (“Compensation Committee”) approved
the immediate acceleration of vesting of all of our

“out-of

-the-money”
outstanding and unvested stock options previously awarded to our
employees under equity compensation plans, excluding certain
specified unvested options. See Note 15 for further
discussion. On January 1, 2006, we plan to implement
SFAS No. 123R using the modified prospective method,
which requires that compensation expense be recorded for all
unvested stock options and other equity-based awards. We
estimate the impact of applying the provisions of
SFAS No. 123R,

Share-Based Payment

, will result
in an incremental pre-tax expense in our Consolidated Statements
of Operations of approximately $15.5 from 2006 through 2011

, our pro forma net loss
applicable to common stockholders and loss per share would have
been as follows:

*

Diluted loss per share is equal to basic loss per share for the
    years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 due to the
    anti-dilutive impact of our stock options, restricted stock and
    convertible securities as a result of the net loss applicable to
    common stockholders in all related periods.

For purposes of this pro forma information, the weighted-average
fair value of the 15% discount received by employees on the date
that stock was purchased under the ESPP was $1.97, $2.03 and
$1.88 per share in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, and
is included in the total fair value of stock-based employee
compensation expense. No stock was purchased under the ESPP
during the second quarter of 2005. The ESPP expired effective
June 30, 2005 and shares are no longer available for
issuance under the ESPP.

We use the Black-Scholes option-pricing model which requires the
input of subjective assumptions, including the option’s
expected life and the price volatility of the underlying stock.
Changes in the assumptions can materially affect the estimate of
fair value of options granted and our pro forma results of
operations could be materially impacted. In light of recent
guidance in SAB No. 107,

Share-Based Payment

,
we re-evaluated the assumptions used to estimate the value of
stock options granted in the third quarter of 2005. The
following assumptions have been modified:

Expected Volatility:

We determined that implied
volatility of publicly traded options in our common stock is
expected to be more reflective of market conditions and,
therefore, can be a reasonable indicator of expected volatility
of our common stock, rather than based only on historical
volatility of common stock. Therefore, we revised the expected
volatility factor used to estimate the fair value of stock
options awarded during the third quarter of 2005 to be based on
a blend of historical volatility of our common stock and implied
volatility of our tradable forward put and call options to
purchase and sell shares of our common stock. Prior to the third
quarter of 2005, we estimated future volatility based on
historical volatility of our common stock over the most recent
period commensurate with the estimated expected lives of our
stock options.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)

Expected Option Lives:

In the third quarter of 2005, we
revised our estimate of expected lives based on our review of
historical patterns for exercises of stock options. We took the
average of (1) an assumption that all outstanding options
are exercised upon achieving their full vesting date and
(2) an assumption that all outstanding options will be
exercised at the midpoint between the current date (i.e., the
date awards have ratably vested through) and their full
contractual term. In determining the estimate, we considered
several factors, including the historical option exercise
behavior of our employees and the terms and vesting periods of
the options granted.

The fair value of each option grant has been estimated on the
date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with
the following assumptions:

Liabilities Relating to our Prior Restatement

As described in Note 1, during our Prior Restatement, we
conducted an extensive examination of financial information and
significant transactions and recorded expense and liabilities
related to Vendor Discounts or Credits, Internal Investigations,
and International Compensation Arrangements.

A summary of the remaining liabilities related to these matters
is as follows:

$37.5 of vendor credits disclosed within Internal Investigations
    as of December 31, 2004 has been reclassified to Vendor
    Discounts or Credits for current year presentation.

Vendor Discounts or Credits

We receive credits from our vendors and media outlets for the
acquisition of goods and services that are entered into on
behalf of our clients. The expenses include the purchase of
various forms of media, including television, radio, and print
advertising space, or production costs, such as the creation of
advertising campaigns, commercials, and print advertisements.
Revenues in the advertising and communicative services business
are frequently recorded net of third party costs as the business
is primarily an agent for its clients. Since these costs are
billed to clients, there are times when vendor credits or price
differences can affect the net revenue recorded by the agency.
These third party discounts, rebates, or price differences are
frequently referred to as credits.

Our contracts are typically “fixed-fee” arrangements
or “cost-based” arrangements. In “fixed-fee”
arrangements, the amount we charge our clients is comprised of a
fee for our services. The fee we earn, however, is not affected
by the level of expenses incurred. Therefore, any rebates or
credits received in



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)

servicing these accounts do not create a liability to the
client. In “cost-based” arrangements, we earn a
percentage commission or flat fee based on or incremental to the
expenses incurred. In these cases, rebates or credits received
may accrue to the benefit of our clients and create a liability
payable to the client. The interpretation of cost language
included in our contracts can vary across international and
domestic markets in which we operate and can affect whether or
not we have a liability to the client.

The terms of agreements with our clients are significantly
impacted by the following: 1) the types of vendor credits
obtained (rebates, discounts, media and production credits);
2) differing contract types with clients (fixed fee vs.
cost-based arrangements); 3) varying industry practices and
laws in the regions of the world in which we operate;
4) determining which contract (global, regional or local)
governs our relationships with clients; and 5) unique
contract provisions in specific contracts.

Prior to filing our 2004 Annual Report, we performed an
extensive examination of our client contracts and arrangements
and considered local law in the international jurisdictions
where we conduct business to determine the impact of improperly
recognizing these vendor credits as additional revenue instead
of recognizing a liability to our clients. We identified areas
where there were differences in prices billed to customers and
prices received from vendors. All differences associated with
cost-based contracts not already passed back to customers were
established as liabilities.

Following the filing of the

10-K

in
September of 2005, we began contacting clients to notify them of
these liabilities and to negotiate an appropriate settlement.
During this process the additional following information came to
our attention.

We have included a table that depicts the beginning balance, the
additional liabilities recorded and the adjustment reducing
these liabilities. While we had changes to our original reserve
positions,

the net impact of adjustments, excluding fluctuations related to
payments and foreign currency and other was an increase to the
liability balance of $22.9, and that was primarily attributable
to the out of period adjustments discussed below.

Internal Investigations

In our Prior Restatement review, we noted instances of possible
employee misconduct. As a result, through December 31,
2004, we recorded adjustments with a cumulative impact on income
of $114.8. Of this amount, $61.7 related to liabilities and
asset reserves, $15.6 to asset write-offs, and $37.5 related to
Vendor Discounts or Credits as of December 31, 2004. These
adjustments were recorded to correct certain unintentional
errors in our accounting that were discovered as a result of
investigations and primarily related to agencies outside the
United States. However, certain of these investigations revealed
deliberate falsification of accounting records, evasion of taxes
in jurisdictions outside the United States, inappropriate
charges to clients, diversion of corporate assets,
non-compliance with local laws and regulations, and other
improprieties. These errors were not prevented or detected
earlier because of material weaknesses in our control
environment and decentralized operating structure. We recorded
liabilities related to these matters, for business locations
under investigation in our Prior Restatement review, which
represented management’s best estimate of probable exposure
based on the facts available at that time.

The law firm of Dewey Ballantine LLP was retained to advise the
Audit Committee of the Board of Directors regarding the
discharge of its obligations. Through the filing of this
document, Dewey Ballantine has reviewed all internal
investigations cases that were included in our Prior Restatement
and continues to oversee our related remediation plans. Dewey
Ballantine retained a forensic accounting firm to assist with
its review.

During 2005, we recorded a net decrease in our liabilities for
Internal Investigations of $37.0. The decrease is primarily due
to write-off of assets reserves, the recognition of deferred
revenue, and payment of taxes, penalties and interest. We also
divested certain agencies in Greece, Spain, Azerbaijan, Ukraine,
Uzbekistan, Bulgaria and Kazakhstan. We have increased our
reserves related to additional VAT and payroll related taxes.

Below is an update of our significant cases.

At our McCann and FCB agencies in Turkey we recorded adjustments
related to the retention of vendor discounts that should have
been remitted to clients, the improper valuation of a previously
acquired business and over-billing clients for payments to
vendors and evasion of local taxes. In 2005, the investigation
has concluded and we have taken the appropriate personnel
actions, including the termination of local senior management.
As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, the remaining liabilities
were $12.6 and $19.8, respectively.

At Media First in New York City we recorded adjustments related
primarily to inadequate recordkeeping and the payment of certain
employee salaries through accounts payable, without appropriate
tax withholdings, resulting in increased earn-out payments. In
2005, we recorded asset write-offs and have taken the
appropriate personnel actions, including the termination of
local senior management. As of December 31, 2005 and 2004,
the remaining liabilities and asset reserves were $1.2 and
$10.8, respectively.

At our FCB agency in Spain we recorded adjustments related to
the use of companies that were formed to account for the
production and media volume discounts received from production
suppliers on a separate set of books and records, to prevent the
detection of discounts and rebates in the event of a client



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)

audit. In addition, compensation was paid to an agency
executive’s personal service company out of these companies
without proper withholding for income taxes. In 2005, we have
divested our interest in a component of FCB Spain and signed an
affiliation agreement with the management, with an appropriate
control structure to assure future business is properly
conducted. As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, the remaining
liabilities and asset reserves were $0 and $9.8, respectively.

At five McCann agencies in Azerbaijan, Ukraine, Uzbekistan,
Bulgaria and Kazakhstan we recorded adjustments related to the
failure to record and pay compensation-related taxes, value
added taxes and corporate income taxes, and inadequate record
keeping. In 2005, we have sold these entities and signed
affiliation agreements with Azerbaijan, Uzbekistan, Bulgaria and
Kazakhstan and intend to sign an affiliation agreement with
Ukraine agency management. There will be an appropriate control
structure to assure business is properly conducted. As of
December 31, 2005 and 2004, the remaining liabilities and
asset reserves were $6.2 and $8.7, respectively.

In addition, we also conducted other investigations in our Prior
Restatement review for errors found that were similar in nature
to those described above. In the aggregate, for these other
investigations, we recorded $4.7 and $12.6 in liabilities as of
December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

International Compensation Arrangements

In our Prior Restatement review, we performed an extensive
examination of employee compensation practices across our
organization. While most practices were found to be acceptable,
we identified some practices in certain jurisdictions that
required additional review. In certain jurisdictions in which we
operate, particularly in Europe and Latin America, it is common
for individuals to establish a personal service company
(“PSC”), in which case the hiring company will
normally contract directly with the PSC for the services of the
individual. We reviewed every situation where one of our
agencies had contracted with a PSC and determined that in a
number of instances, the use of a PSC was determined not to be
supportable. We also identified other arrangements or practices
in certain jurisdictions, such as payment of personal expenses
outside the normal payroll mechanism, split salary payments,
equity grants and retirement payments, and independent
contractors/employees that led to an avoidance of paying certain
taxes as well as not reporting compensation to local authorities.

For these issues, liabilities represented our best estimate of
expected payments to various governmental organizations in the
jurisdictions involved. These amounts were estimates as of such
date of our liabilities that we believed were sufficient to
cover the obligations that we may have had to various
authorities. As a result of the disclosures that were made in
our 2004 Annual Report, we anticipate that the authorities in
certain jurisdictions may undertake reviews to determine whether
any of the activities disclosed violated local laws and
regulations. This may lead to further investigations and the
levy of additional assessments including possible fines and
penalties. While we intend to defend against any assessment that
we determine to be unfounded, nevertheless we could receive
assessments which may be substantial. However, it cannot be
determined at this time whether such investigations would be
commenced or, if they are, what the outcome will be with any
reasonable certainty.

During 2005, we recorded a net decrease in our liabilities for
International Compensation Arrangements of $4.1. The decrease is
comprised of reductions in our liabilities due to the expiration
of one year under the statutes of limitations, changes in
management’s estimates and the favorable outcome of audits
in certain jurisdictions. The decrease is net of increases to
our accruals due to additional liabilities incurred in 2005
through the continued use of a PSC or other such arrangements
which we are in the process of terminating, as well as interest
on amounts not yet settled.

Note 3:

Out of Period Adjustments

In the fourth quarter, we identified certain vendor discounts
and credits, tax, and other miscellaneous adjustments in which
our previously reported financial statements were in error or
did not conform to GAAP. Because these changes are not material
to our financial statements for the periods prior to 2005, or to
2005 as a whole, we have recorded them in the fourth quarter of
2005.

The errors in our previously reported financial information, and
the failure to prevent them or detect them in our financial
reporting process, were largely attributable to weak internal
controls. We concluded that our control environment has not
progressed sufficiently to serve as an effective foundation for
all other components of internal control. See Management’s
Assessment on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.

The following tables summarize the impact to the fourth quarter
of 2005 of amounts recorded in the fourth quarter of 2005 which
relate to reported revenue, operating income (loss), income
(loss) from continuing operations before provision for income
taxes, loss from continuing operations and loss per share.

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)

Description of Out of Period Adjustments:

Vendor Discounts or Credits:

We performed extensive procedures as a result of the initiation
of settlement discussions with clients. The procedures broadly
considered global or regional contracts, review of key changes
in legal interpretations, review of statutes of limitations,
estimated exposures and vendor price differences related to
cost-based contracts. As a result of these additional
procedures, adjustments were recorded to our previously
established liabilities.

Other Adjustments

We have identified other items which do not conform to GAAP and
recorded adjustments to our 2005 Consolidated Financial
Statements which relate to previously reported periods. The most
significant include accounting related to the capitalization of
software costs, acquisition related costs and international
compensation arrangements.

Tax Adjustments

We recorded adjustments to correct the Accrued and Deferred
income taxes for items primarily related to the computation of
income tax benefits on the 2004 Long-lived Asset Impairment
Charges, the establishment of certain valuation allowances, the
accounting for certain international tax structures and the
computation of interest accruals on certain non-US income tax
contingencies. The impact of amounts recorded in the fourth
quarter of 2005 was $8.7 of tax benefit.

We also recorded the tax impact of the out of period adjustments
described above, where applicable, based on the local statutory
tax rate in the jurisdiction of the entity recording the
adjustment. The impact of amounts recorded in the fourth quarter
of 2005 was $10.8 of tax benefit.

Note 4:

Loss Per Share

The following table sets forth the computation of basic and
diluted loss per common share for net loss available to common
stockholders:



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)

Basic and diluted shares outstanding and loss per share are
equal for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003
due to the anti-dilutive impact of our stock options, restricted
stock and convertible securities as a result of the net loss
applicable to common stockholders in all related periods. The
following table presents the weighted-average number of
incremental anti-dilutive shares excluded from the computations
of diluted loss per share for the years ended December 31,
2005, 2004 and 2003:

Our Series B Cumulative Convertible Perpetual Preferred
Stock was issued on October 24, 2005. Had these convertible
securities been outstanding for the full year, 38.4 of
incremental shares would be excluded from the computation of
diluted loss per share for the year ended December 31, 2005.

In September 2004, the EITF reached a consensus on the guidance
provided by EITF Issue
No.

04-8,

The
Effect of Contingently Convertible Instruments on Diluted
Earnings per Share.

The guidance requires that the share
impact of contingently convertible instruments (including debt
securities) with a market price conversion trigger be included
in diluted EPS computations (if dilutive), regardless of whether
the market price conversion trigger (or other contingent
feature) has been met. We implemented the requirements of EITF
Issue No. 04-8 for the quarter and fiscal year ended
December 31, 2004. The adoption of EITF Issue No. 04-8
requires that we include approximately 64.4 shares in our
calculation of diluted EPS to reflect the assumed conversion of
our 4.50% Notes in periods when dilutive. The adoption of
this pronouncement had no impact on the calculation of earnings
per share for any period presented, due to the anti-dilutive
impact of the convertible instruments.

We adopted EITF Issue No. 03-6,

Participating Securities
and the Two — Class Method Under FASB Statement
No. 128

, during the quarter ended June 30, 2004.
The adoption of this pronouncement had no impact on the
calculation of earnings per share for any period presented, as
the holders of our 4.50% Notes and Series A Preferred
Stock, which are participating securities, do not participate in
our net loss.

Note 5:

Acquisitions and Dispositions

Acquisitions

The majority of our acquisitions include an initial payment at
the time of closing and provide for additional contingent
purchase price payments over a specified time. The initial
purchase price of an acquisition is allocated to identifiable
assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on estimated fair
values with any excess being recorded as goodwill and other
intangible assets. These contingent payments, which are also
known as “earn-outs” and “put options,” are
calculated based on estimates of the future financial
performance of the acquired entity, the timing of the exercise
of these rights, changes in foreign currency exchange rates and
other factors. Earn-outs and put options are recorded within the
financial statements as an increase to goodwill and other
intangible assets once the terms and conditions of the
contingent acquisition obligations have been met and the
consideration is distributable or expensed as compensation



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)

based on the acquisition agreement and the terms and conditions
of employment for the former owners of the acquired businesses.

Cash paid and stock issued for prior acquisitions are comprised
of: (i) contingent payments as described above;
(ii) further investments in companies in which we already
have an ownership interest; and (iii) other payments
related to loan notes and guaranteed deferred payments that have
been previously recognized on the balance sheet.

We did not complete any acquisitions during 2005. We completed
two acquisitions during 2004 and two during 2003, none of which
were significant on an individual basis. The results of
operations of these acquired companies were included in our
consolidated results from the date of close of the transaction.
We did, however, make stock payments related to acquisitions
initiated in prior years of $12.9, $23.8 and $56.2 during 2005,
2004 and 2003, respectively. Details of cash paid for new and

During 2005 we completed the sale of twenty-seven businesses at

comprised approximately $31.0 of revenue. The results of
operations as well as the gain or loss on sale of each of these
agencies were not material to the Consolidated Financial
Statements in any of the periods presented.

Motorsports

— On January 12, 2004, we
completed the sale of a business comprising the four Motorsports
circuits, including Brands Hatch, Oulton Park, Cadwell Park and
Snetterton (the “four owned circuits”), owned by our
Brands Hatch subsidiaries, to MotorSport Vision Limited. The
consideration for the sale was approximately $26.0. An
additional contingent amount of approximately $4.0 may be paid
to us depending upon the future financial results of the
operations sold. We recognized a fixed asset impairment loss
related to the four owned circuits of $38.0 in the fourth
quarter of 2003. Additionally, we recognized a fixed asset
impairment of $9.6 related to the other Motorsports entities and
a capital expenditure impairment of $16.2 for outlays that
Motorsports was contractually required to spend to upgrade and
maintain certain remaining racing facilities.

On April 19, 2004, we reached an agreement with the Formula
One Administration Limited (“FOA”) to terminate and
release our respective guarantee and promoter obligations
relating to the



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)

British Grand Prix held at the Silverstone racetrack in the
United Kingdom (“UK”). Under this agreement, we were
released from our obligations following the British Grand Prix
in July 2004. In exchange for the early termination of the
obligations and liabilities, we paid a total of $93.0 to the FOA
in two installments of $46.5 each on April 19, 2004 and
May 24, 2004. A pre-tax charge of $80.0 was recorded in
Motorsports contract termination costs related to this
transaction during the second quarter of 2004, net of
approximately $13.0 in existing reserves related to the
termination of this agreement.

On July 1, 2004, the British Racing Drivers Club
(“BRDC”) agreed to vary the terms of the lease
agreement relating to the Silverstone race track and we entered
into a series of agreements regarding the potential termination
of our remaining Motorsports obligations in the UK. These
agreements gave us the right to terminate our lease obligations
at the Silverstone race track and related agreements, which we
exercised on November 1, 2004. In connection with these
agreements, we paid the BRDC approximately $49.0 in three
installments. The first installment of approximately $24.5 was
paid on July 1, 2004, the second installment of
approximately $16.0 was paid on September 30, 2004, and the
third installment of approximately $8.5 was paid on
October 7, 2004. As a result of these agreements, we
recorded a pre-tax charge in the third quarter of 2004 of $33.6
in Motorsports contract termination costs. This charge is net of
existing reserves of $9.9. The payments also include $5.5 in
office and general expenses reflecting the amount of lease
expense associated with our continued use of the leased property
through the third and fourth quarters of 2004. We have exited
this business and do not anticipate any additional material
charges. Motorsports charges consist of the following:

NFO

— On July 10, 2003, we completed the
sale of NFO, our research unit, to Taylor Nelson Sofres plc
(“TNS”) for $415.6 in cash ($376.7 net of cash
sold and expenses) and approximately 11.7 shares of TNS
stock that were sold in December 2003 for net proceeds of
approximately $42.0. As a result of this sale, we recognized a
pre-tax gain of $99.1 ($89.1, net of tax) in the third quarter
of 2003 after certain post closing adjustments. The TNS shares
sold resulted in a pre-tax gain of $13.3 recorded in Other
income (expense) in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
In July 2004, we received $10.0 from TNS as a final payment with
respect to the sale of NFO, which resulted in a $6.5 gain, net
of tax. We established reserves for certain income tax
contingencies with respect to the determination of our
investment in NFO for income tax purposes at the time of the
disposition of NFO. During the fourth quarter of 2005, these
reserves of $9.0 were reversed, as the related income tax
contingencies are no longer considered probable. The results of
NFO are classified as discontinued operations in accordance with
SFAS No. 144,

Accounting for the Impairment or
Disposal of Long Lived Assets

, and, accordingly, the results
of operations and cash flows have been removed from our results
of continuing operations and cash flows for prior periods.

Restructuring (Reversals) Charges

During 2005, 2004 and 2003, we recorded net (reversals) and
charges related to lease termination and other exit costs and
severance and termination costs for the 2003 and 2001
restructuring programs of ($7.3), $62.2 and $172.9,
respectively, which included the impact of adjustments resulting
from changes in management’s estimates as described below.
The 2003 program was initiated in response to softness in demand
for advertising and marketing services. The 2001 program was
initiated following the acquisition of True North Communications
Inc. and was designed to integrate the acquisition and improve
productivity. Total inception to date net charges for the 2003
and 2001 programs were $224.2 and $641.0, respectively. The 2003
and 2001 restructuring programs focused on decreasing our
overall cost structure mainly through total reductions in head
count of approximately 10,300 employees and through downsizing
or closing approximately 280 non-strategic or excess office
locations. As of December 31, 2005, substantially all
activities under the 2003 and 2001 programs were completed. A
summary of the net (reversals) and charges by segment is as
follows:

Lease termination and other exit costs

2003 Program

Net (reversals) and charges related to lease termination
and other exit costs of ($5.4), $52.1 and $33.6 recorded for
2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively, were comprised of charges of
$2.0, $67.8 and $41.6 offset by adjustments to management’s
estimates of $7.4, $15.7 and $8.0, respectively. The discount
related to lease terminations is being amortized over the
expected remaining term of the related lease and is the primary
amount included as charges for 2005. Additionally, charges were
recorded for the vacating of 43 and 55 offices in 2004 and 2003,
respectively, located primarily in the U.S. and Europe. Charges
were recorded at net present value and were net of estimated
sublease rental income. Given the remaining life of the vacated
leased properties, cash payments are expected to be made through
2015. In addition to amounts recorded as restructuring charges,
we recorded charges of $11.1 and $16.5 during 2004 and 2003,
respectively, related to the accelerated amortization of
leasehold improvements on properties included in the 2003
program. These charges were included in office and general
expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

2001 Program

Net (reversals) and charges related to lease termination
and other exit costs of ($0.5), ($4.3) and $13.6, recorded for
2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, resulted exclusively from the
impact of adjustments to management’s estimates. The 2001
program resulted in approximately 180 offices being vacated
worldwide. Given the remaining life of the vacated properties,
cash payments are expected to be made through 2024.

Adjustments to Estimates

Lease termination and other exit costs for the 2003 and 2001
restructuring programs included the net impact of adjustments
for changes in management’s estimates to decrease the
restructuring reserves by $7.9 and $20.0 in 2005 and 2004,
respectively, and increase the reserve by $5.6 in 2003. The
significant factors that caused the adjustments to
management’s estimates were our negotiation of terms upon
the exit of leased properties, changes in sublease rental
income, revised valuations and utilization of previously vacated
properties by certain of our agencies due to improved economic
conditions in certain markets, all of which occurred during the
period recorded.

Severance and termination costs

2003 Program

Net reversals related to severance and termination costs of
($1.4) for 2005, resulted from the impact of adjustments to
management’s estimates. Net charges of $19.5 recorded for
2004 were comprised of charges of $26.4, partially offset by
adjustments to management’s estimates of $6.9. For 2003,
net charges of $125.8 were comprised of charges of $133.7
partially offset by adjustments of $7.9. These charges related
to a worldwide workforce reduction of approximately 400
employees in 2004 and 2,900 in 2003. The restructuring program
affected employee groups across all levels and functions,
including executive, regional and account management and
administrative, creative and media production personnel. The
majority of the severance charges related to the U.S. and
Europe, with the remainder in Asia and Latin America.

2001 Program

Net reversals related to severance and termination costs of
($5.1) and ($0.1) recorded for 2004 and 2003, respectively,
resulted from the impact of adjustments to management’s
estimates. The 2001 program related to a worldwide reduction of
approximately 7,000 employees.

Adjustments to Estimates

Severance and termination costs associated with the 2003 and
2001 restructuring programs included the net impact of
adjustments for changes in management’s estimates to
decrease the restructuring reserves by $1.4, $12.0 and $8.0 in
2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The significant factors that
caused the adjustments to management’s estimates were the
decrease in the number of terminated employees, change in
amounts paid to terminated employees and change in estimates of
taxes and restricted stock payments related to terminated
employees, all of which occurred during the period recorded.

A summary of the remaining liability for the 2003 and 2001
restructuring programs is as follows:

Amounts represent adjustments to the liability for changes in
    foreign currency exchange rates as well as liabilities that were

    balance sheet accounts.

Severance amounts incurred outside the parameters of our
restructuring programs are recorded in the financial statements
when they become both probable and estimable. With the exception
of medical and dental benefits paid to employees who are on
long-term disability, we do not establish liabilities associated
with ongoing post-employment benefits that may vest or
accumulate as the employee provides service as we cannot
reasonably predict what our future experience will be. See

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

Goodwill

Goodwill is the excess purchase price remaining from an
acquisition after an allocation of purchase price has been made
to identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on
estimated fair values. In order to determine the fair value of
net assets for new agency acquisitions, valuations are performed
based on several factors, including the type of service offered,
competitive market position, brand reputation and geographic
coverage. Considering the characteristics of advertising,
specialized marketing and communication services companies, our
acquisitions usually do not have significant amounts of tangible
assets as the principle asset we typically acquire is creative
talent. As a result, a substantial portion of the purchase price
is allocated to goodwill. Subsequent changes to goodwill include
both current year and deferred payments related to acquisitions.
We perform an annual impairment review of goodwill as of
October 1st or whenever events or significant changes
in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be
recoverable. See Note 1 for fair value determination and
impairment testing methodologies. For more discussion on
impairment charges, refer to Note 9.

For the year ended December 31, 2005, we changed the date
of our annual impairment test for all goodwill and other
intangible assets with indefinite lives from September 30th
to October 1st. During 2005 we performed this annual
impairment test on September 30th and then again on
October 1st to ensure that multiples used in the
reporting units tested were consistent. By moving the date into
the fourth quarter we will be able to utilize the most current
and accurate plan and forecast information. The new date also
provides us additional time to meet future accelerated public
reporting requirements. This change did not delay, accelerate or
avoid an impairment charge. This change in accounting principle
also did not have an effect on our Consolidated Financial
Statements. Accordingly, we believe that the accounting change
described above is an alternative accounting principle that is
preferable.

Other Intangible Assets

As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, the net carrying value of
other intangible assets was $35.0 and $37.6, respectively.
Included in other intangible assets are assets with indefinite
lives not subject to amortization and assets with definite lives
subject to amortization. Other intangible assets include
non-compete agreements, license costs, trade names and customer
lists. Intangible assets with definitive lives subject to
amortization are amortized on a straight-line basis with
estimated useful lives generally ranging from 1 to
15 years. The total amortization expense for the twelve
months ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 was $1.5,
$6.8 and $12.1, respectively. See Note 1 for fair value

amount that the carrying value of the asset exceeds the implied
fair value. See Note 1 for fair value determination and
impairment testing methodologies.

2005 Impairments

IAN

— During the fourth quarter of 2005, we
recorded a goodwill impairment charge of approximately $91.0 at
our Lowe reporting unit. A triggering event occurred subsequent
to our 2005 annual impairment test that led us to believe that
Lowe’s goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible
assets may no longer be recoverable. As a result, we were
required to assess whether our goodwill balance at Lowe was
impaired. Specifically, a major client was lost by Lowe’s
London agency and the possibility of losing other clients is now
considered a higher risk due to recent management defections and
changes in the competitive landscape. This caused projected
revenue growth to decline. As a result of these changes our
long-term projections showed declines in discounted future
operating cash flows. These revised cash flows caused the
implied fair value of Lowe’s goodwill to be less than the
book value.

During the third quarter of 2005 as restated, we recorded a
goodwill impairment charge of approximately $5.8 at a reporting
unit within our sports and entertainment marketing business. The
long-term projections showed previously unanticipated declines
in discounted future operating cash flows and, as a result,
these discounted future operating cash flows caused the implied
fair value of goodwill to be less than the related book value.

2004 Impairments

IAN

— During the third quarter of 2004, we
recorded goodwill impairment charges of approximately $220.2 at
The Partnership reporting unit, which was comprised of Lowe
Worldwide, Draft Worldwide, Mullen, Dailey & Associates
and Berenter Greenhouse & Webster (“BGW”).
Our long-term projections showed previously unanticipated
declines in discounted future operating cash flows due to recent
client losses, reduced client spending and declining industry
valuation metrics. These discounted future operating cash flow
projections caused the estimated fair values of The Partnership
to be less than their book values. The Partnership was
subsequently disbanded in the fourth quarter of 2004 and the
remaining goodwill was allocated based on the relative fair
value of the agencies at the time of disbandment. We considered
the possibility of impairment at Lowe and Draft, the two largest
agencies previously within The Partnership. However, we
determined that there was no discernible triggering event that
would have led us to believe that goodwill was impaired.

CMG

— As a result of the annual impairment
review, a goodwill impairment charge of $91.7 was recorded at
our CMG reporting unit, which was comprised of Weber Shandwick,
GolinHarris, DeVries, MWW Group and FutureBrand. The fair value
of CMG was adversely affected by declining industry market
valuation metrics, specifically, a decrease in the EBITDA
multiples used in the underlying valuation calculations. The
impact of the lower EBITDA multiples caused the calculated fair
value of CMG goodwill to be less than the related book value.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)

2003 Impairments

CMG

— We recorded an impairment charge of
$218.0 to reduce the carrying value of goodwill at Octagon. The
Octagon impairment charge reflects the reduction of the
unit’s fair value due principally to poor financial
performance in 2003 and lower than expected future financial
performance. Specifically, there was significant pricing
pressure in both overseas and domestic TV rights distribution,
declining fees from athlete representation, and lower than
anticipated proceeds from committed future events, including
ticket revenue and sponsorship.

Motorsports

— We recorded fixed asset
impairment charges of $63.8, consisting of $38.0 in connection
with the sale of a business comprised of the four owned auto
racing circuits, $9.6 related to the sales of other Motorsports
entities and a fixed asset impairment of $16.2 for outlays that
Motorsports was contractually required to spend to improve the
racing facilities.

Note 10:

Expenses and Other Income

Investment Impairment

We monitor our investments to determine whether a significant
event or changes in circumstances have occurred that may have an
adverse effect on the fair value of each investment. When an
other than temporary decline in value is deemed to have
occurred, an impairment charge is recorded to adjust the
carrying value of the investment to the estimated fair value.
See Note 1 for further discussion of fair value
determination and impairment testing methodologies.

During 2005, we recorded investment impairment charges of $12.2,
primarily related to a $7.1 charge for our remaining
unconsolidated investment in Koch Tavares in Latin America to
adjust the carrying amount of the investment to fair value and a
$3.7 charge related to a decline in value of certain
available-for-sale investments that were determined to be other
than temporary.

During 2004, we recorded investment impairment charges of $63.4,
primarily related to a $50.9 charge for an unconsolidated
investment in German advertising agency Springer &
Jacoby as a result of a decrease in projected operating results.
Additionally, we recorded impairment charges of $4.7 related to
unconsolidated affiliates primarily in Israel, Brazil, Japan and
India, and $7.8 related to several other available-for-sale
investments.

During 2003, we recorded $71.5 of investment impairment charges
related to 20 investments. The charges related principally to
investments in Fortune Promo 7 of $9.5 in the Middle East, Koch
Tavares of $7.7 in Latin America, Daiko of $10.0 in Japan, Roche
Macaulay Partners of $7.9 in Canada, Springer & Jacoby
of $6.5 in Germany and Global Hue of $6.9 in the U.S. The
majority of the impairment charges resulted from deteriorating
economic conditions in the countries in which the agencies
operate, due to the loss of one or several key clients.

In 2005, other income (expense) included net gains from the
sales of businesses of $10.1, net gains on sales of
available-for-sale securities and miscellaneous investment
income of $20.3 and $2.6 related to credits adjustments. The
principal components of net gains from the sales of businesses
relate to the sale of Target Research, a McCann agency, during
the fourth quarter of 2005, which resulted in a gain of $18.6,
offset partially by a sale of a significant component of FCB
Spain during the fourth quarter of 2005 which resulted in a loss
of approximately $13.0. The principal components of net gains on
sales of available-for-sale securities and miscellaneous
investment income relate to the sale of our remaining ownership
interest in Delaney Lund Knox Warren & Partners, an
agency within FCB, for a gain of approximately $8.3, and net
gains on sales of available-for-sale securities of $7.9, of
which approximately $3.8 relates to appreciation of Rabbi Trust
investments restricted for the purpose of paying our deferred
compensation and deferred benefit arrangement liabilities.

In 2005, we also recorded $2.6 for the settlement of our
contractual liabilities for vendor credits and discounts. This
amount represents a negotiated client settlement below the
amount originally recorded.

In 2004, other income (expense) included $18.2 of net losses on
the sale of 19 agencies. The losses related primarily to the
sale of Transworld Marketing, a

U.S.-based

promotions
agency, which resulted in a loss of $8.6, and a $6.2 loss for
the final liquidation of the Motorsports investment. See
Note 5 for further discussion of the Motorsports
disposition.

In December 2003, we sold approximately 11.0 shares of
Modem Media for net proceeds of approximately $57.0, resulting
in a pre-tax gain of $30.3. Also in December 2003, we sold all
of the approximately 11.7 shares of TNS we had acquired
through the sale of NFO for approximately $42.0 of net proceeds.
A pre-tax gain of $13.3 was recorded.

The provision for (benefit of) income taxes on continuing
operations consists of:

The components of deferred tax assets consist of the following
items:

The valuation allowance of $501.0 and $488.6 at
December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, applies to
certain deferred tax assets, including U.S. tax credits,
capital loss carryforwards and net operating loss carryforwards
in certain jurisdictions that, in our opinion, are more likely
than not, not to be utilized. The change during 2005 in the
deferred tax valuation allowance primarily relates to
uncertainties regarding the



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)

utilization of capital loss and foreign net operating loss
carryforwards. At December 31, 2005, there are $51.9 of tax
credit carryforwards with expiration periods beginning in 2009
and ending in 2013.

In connection with the U.S. deferred tax assets, management
believes that it is more likely than not that a substantial
amount of the deferred tax assets will be realized; a valuation
allowance has been established for the remainder. The amount of
the deferred tax assets considered realizable, however, could be
reduced in the near term if estimates of future U.S. taxable
income are lower than anticipated. There are $999.1 of tax loss
carryforwards, of which $294.2 are U.S. capital and net
operating loss carryforwards that expire in the years 2006
through 2025. The majority of the remaining $704.9 are

non-U.S.

net
operating loss carryforwards with unlimited carry forward
periods. We have concluded that it is more likely than not that
the net deferred tax asset balance will be realized.

Effective Tax Rate Reconciliation on Continuing Operations

A reconciliation of the effective income tax rate on continuing
operations before equity earnings and minority interest expense
as reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Income to the
U.S. Federal statutory income tax rate is as follows:

Our effective tax rate was negatively impacted by the
establishment of valuation allowances, as described below, and
non-deductible long-lived asset impairment charges. The
difference between the effective tax rate and the statutory
federal rate of 35% is also due to state and local taxes and the
effect of

non-U.S.

operations.

As required by SFAS No. 109, we are required to
evaluate on a quarterly basis the realizability of our deferred
tax assets. SFAS No. 109,

Accounting for Income
Tax,

requires a valuation allowance to be established when
it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax
assets will not be realized. In circumstances where there is
sufficient negative evidence, establishment of a valuation
allowance must be considered. We believe that cumulative losses
in the most recent three-year period represent sufficient
negative evidence under the provisions of
SFAS No. 109,

Accounting for Income Tax,

and,
as a result, we determined that certain of our deferred tax
assets required the establishment of a valuation allowance. The
deferred tax assets for which an allowance was established
relate primarily to foreign net operating and U.S. capital
loss carryforwards. During 2005, a net valuation allowance of
$69.9 was established in



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)

continuing operations on existing deferred tax assets and
current year losses with no tax benefits. The total valuation
allowance as of December 31, 2005 was $501.0.

The total amount of undistributed earnings of foreign
subsidiaries for income tax purposes was $663.2 and $734.6 at
December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The undistributed
earnings of our foreign subsidiaries are permanently reinvested.
After the completion of our evaluation, we have determined that
we will not take advantage of the provisions of the Jobs Act
which grants a temporary incentive to repatriate foreign
earnings.

On April 21, 2003 the Internal Revenue
Service (“IRS”) proposed additions to our taxable
income for the years 1994 through 1996 that would have resulted
in additional income taxes, including conforming state and local
tax adjustments, of $41.5 million plus appropriate
interest. The Company is close to finalizing a settlement
covering all of the adjustments proposed by the IRS, and the IRS
has also tentatively agreed to a refund claim which we filed in
respect of certain business expenses for which we had previously
failed to claim deductions in those years. While we anticipate
finalizing this settlement shortly, any additional payments,
will not have a material effect on our cash flow, financial
position or the results of operations.

The IRS has recently completed the field audit of the years
1997-2002 and has proposed additions to our taxable income. One
of the adjustments proposed by the IRS would disallow the
deduction of a loss claimed in 2002 on the grounds that the
Company had not established that the claimed worthlessness of an
acquired business had yet occurred in 2002. The Company had
previously received a refund of approximately $45 million
of tax on account of this claimed loss. The proposed
disallowance will result in the Company having to repay that
amount, plus appropriate interest. Further, the Company intends
to amend its 2004 tax return to claim this deduction in that
return, which we anticipate will be subject to audit by the IRS
commencing in Q2, 2006. In connection with the remaining
proposed adjustments, subject to our further review, we intend
to file an administrative protest of, and to challenge
vigorously, those adjustments for which we believe the IRS does
not have adequate support. Although the ultimate resolution of
these proposed adjustment may result in final adjustments
against the company, we do not anticipate that there will be
significant cash tax payments in addition to the repayment of
the refund described above, and therefore do not expect a
material effect on our cash flow, financial position or results
of operations.

We have various tax years under examination by tax authorities
in various countries, such as the United Kingdom, and in various
states, such as New York, in which we have significant business
operations. It is not yet known whether these examinations will,
in the aggregate, result in our paying additional taxes. We have
established tax reserves that we believe to be adequate in
relation to the potential for additional assessments in each of
the jurisdictions in which we are subject to taxation. We
regularly assess the likelihood of additional tax assessments in
those jurisdictions and adjust our reserves as additional
information requires.

amount of $250.0 at maturity at gross proceeds of approximately
$258.6, which included the principal amount of the Notes,
accrued interest to the redemption date, and a prepayment
penalty. To redeem these Notes we used the proceeds from the
sale and issuance in July 2005 of $250.0 Floating Rate Senior

In November 2004, we tendered for $250.0 of the $500.0
outstanding face value 7.875% Senior Unsecured Notes at
gross proceeds of approximately $263.1, which included the
principal amount of the Notes plus accrued interest to the
tender date. A prepayment premium of $9.8 was recorded on the
early retirement of $250.0 of these Notes. In December 2004, we
redeemed our outstanding 1.87% Convertible Subordinated
Notes with an aggregate principal amount of approximately $361.0
at maturity at gross proceeds of approximately $346.8, which
included the principal amount of the Notes plus accrued interest
to the redemption date. To tender for the 7.875% Senior
Unsecured Notes and redeem the 1.87% Convertible
Subordinated Notes, we used approximately $250.0 and $350.0,
respectively, of the net proceeds from the sale and issuance in
November 2004 of the 5.40% Senior Unsecured Notes due
November 2009 and 6.25% Senior Unsecured Notes due November
2014.

In January 2004, we redeemed the 1.80% Convertible
Subordinated Notes with an aggregate principal amount of $250.0
at maturity at gross proceeds of approximately $246.0, which
included the principal amount of the Notes plus original issue
discount and accrued interest to the redemption date. To redeem
these Convertible Subordinated Notes, we used approximately
$246.0 of the net proceeds from the 2003 Common and Mandatory
Convertible Preferred Stock offerings as discussed in
Note 14.

Consent Solicitation

In March 2005, we completed a consent solicitation to amend the
indentures governing five series of our outstanding public debt
to provide, among other things, that our failure to file with
the trustee our SEC reports, including our 2004 Annual Report on
Form

10-K

and
Quarterly Reports for the first and second quarters of 2005 on
Form

10-Q,

would
not constitute a default under the indentures until
October 1, 2005.

The indenture governing our 4.50% Notes was also amended in
March 2005 to provide for: (i) an extension from
March 15, 2008 to September 15, 2009 of the date on or
after which we may redeem the 4.50% Notes and (ii) an
additional “make-whole” adjustment to the conversion
rate in the event of a change of control meeting specified
conditions.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)

4.50% Convertible Senior Notes

The 4.50% Notes are convertible to common stock at a
conversion price of $12.42 per share, subject to adjustment
in specified circumstances. They are convertible at any time if
the average price of our common stock for 20 trading days
immediately preceding the conversion date is greater than or
equal to a specified percentage, beginning at 120% in 2003 and
declining 0.5% each year until it reaches 110% at maturity, of
the conversion price. They are also convertible, regardless of
the price of our common stock, if: (i) we call the
4.50% Notes for redemption; (ii) we make specified
distributions to shareholders; (iii) we become a party to a
consolidation, merger or binding share exchange pursuant to
which our common stock would be converted into cash or property
(other than securities) or (iv) the credit ratings assigned
to the 4.50% Notes by any two of Moody’s Investors
Service, Standard & Poor’s and Fitch Ratings are
lower than Ba2, BB and BB, respectively, or the 4.50% Notes
are no longer rated by at least two of these ratings services.
Because of our current credit ratings, the 4.50% Notes are
currently convertible into approximately 64.4 shares of our
common stock.

Holders of the 4.50% Notes may require us to repurchase the
4.50% Notes on March 15, 2008 for cash and on
March 15, 2013 and March 15, 2018 for cash or common
stock or a combination of both, at our election. Additionally,
investors may require us to repurchase the 4.50% Notes in
the event of certain change of control events that occur prior
to March 15, 2008 for cash or common stock or a combination
of both, at our election. If at any time on or after
March 13, 2003 we pay cash dividends on our common stock,
we will pay contingent interest in an amount equal to 100% of
the per share cash dividend paid on the common stock multiplied
by the number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion
of the 4.50% Notes. At our option, we may redeem the
4.50% Notes on or after September 15, 2009 for cash.
The redemption price in each of these instances is 100% of the
principal amount of the Notes being redeemed, plus accrued and
unpaid interest, if any. The 4.50% Notes also provide for
an additional “make-whole” adjustment to the
conversion rate in the event of a change of control meeting
specified conditions.

In accordance with EITF Issue No. 03-6,

Participating
Securities and the Two — Class Method under FASB
Statement No. 128, Earnings Per Share,

the
4.50% Notes are considered securities with participation
rights in earnings available to common stockholders due to the
feature of these securities that allows investors to participate
in cash dividends paid on our common stock. For periods in which
we experience net income, the impact of these securities’
participation rights is included in the calculation of earnings
per share. For periods in which we experience a net loss, the
4.50% Notes have no impact on the calculation of earnings
per share due to the fact that the holders of these securities
do not participate in our losses.

See Note 19 for additional discussion of fair market value
of our long-term debt.

Cash Poolings

The amount of our cash held by the banks under our international
pooling arrangements is subject to a full right of offset
against the amounts advanced to us, and the cash and advances
are recorded net on our balance sheet. The gross amounts vary
depending on how much funding is provided to agencies through
the pooling arrangements. At December 31, 2005 and 2004,
cash of $842.6 and $939.9, respectively, was netted against an
equal amount of advances under pooling arrangements. We
typically pay interest on the gross amounts of the advances and
receive interest income on the cash deposited, albeit at a lower
rate.

Credit Arrangements

We have committed and uncommitted credit facilities with various
banks that permit borrowings at variable interest rates. At
December 31, 2005 and 2004, there were no borrowings under
our committed facilities. However, there were borrowings under
the uncommitted facilities made by several of our subsidiaries
outside the U.S. totaling $53.7 and $67.8, respectively. We have
guaranteed the repayment of some of these borrowings by our
subsidiaries. The weighted-average interest rate on outstanding
balances under the uncommitted short-term facilities at
December 31, 2005 and 2004 was approximately 5% in each
year. A summary of our credit facilities is as follows:

Our primary bank credit agreement is a three-year revolving
credit facility (as amended, “Three-Year Revolving Credit
Facility”). The Three-Year Revolving Credit Facility
expires on May 9, 2007 and provides for borrowings of up to
$500.0, of which $200.0 is available for the issuance of letters
of credit. This facility was amended as of October 17, 2005
to increase the amount that we may borrow under the facility by
$50.0 to $500.0. Our $250.0

364-Day

Revolving
Credit Facility expired on September 30, 2005. The
Three-Year Revolving Credit Facility has been modified multiple
times since inception as noted below. We have been in compliance
with all covenants under the Three-Year Revolving Credit
Facility, as amended or waived from time to time.

Borrowings under the Three-Year Revolving Credit Facility are
unsecured. Outstanding balances bear interest at variable rates
based on either LIBOR or a bank’s base rate, at our option.
The interest rates on LIBOR loans and base rate loans under the
Three-Year Revolving Credit Facility are affected by the
facility’s utilization levels and our credit ratings.

The original terms of the Three-Year Revolving Credit Facility
restricted our ability to declare or pay dividends, repurchase
shares of common stock, make cash acquisitions or investments
and make capital expenditures, as well as the ability of our
subsidiaries to incur additional unsecured debt. The original
terms of the Three-Year Revolving Credit Facility limited annual
cash consideration paid for acquisitions to $100.0 in the
aggregate for any calendar year, provided that amounts unused in
any year could have been rolled over to the following years, but
could not have exceeded $250.0 in any calendar year. Annual
common stock buybacks and dividend payments on our capital stock
were limited to $95.0 in the aggregate for any calendar year, of
which $45.0 could have been used for dividend payments on our
convertible preferred stock and $50.0 could have been used for
dividend payments on our capital stock (including common stock)
and for common stock buybacks. Any unused portion of the
permitted amount of $50.0 could have been rolled over into
successive years; provided that the payments in any calendar
year did not exceed $125.0 in the aggregate. Our permitted level
of annual capital expenditures was limited to $225.0, provided
that amounts unused in any year up to $50.0 could have been
rolled over to the next year. These



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)

terms were subsequently modified with three amendments made to
the Three-Year Revolving Credit Facility on March 31, June
22 and September 27, 2005.

The March 31, 2005 waiver and amendment to the Three-Year
Revolving Credit Facility, among other things, (i) required
us to maintain an ending balance of $225.0 of cash in domestic
accounts with our lenders for the seven days preceding a
borrowing, (ii) restricted cash consideration paid for
acquisitions to less than $5.0 for the period between
March 31, 2005 and July 11, 2005, and
(iii) restricted our ability to make certain restricted
payments such as dividends until July 11, 2005 to paying
dividends on our preferred stock and to repurchase capital stock
in connection with employees’ exercise of options.

The June 22, 2005 waiver and amendment to the Three-Year
Revolving Credit Facility, among other things, (i) required
us to maintain a daily ending balance of $225.0 of cash and
securities in domestic accounts with our lenders,
(ii) restricted our ability to make cash acquisitions in
excess of $7.5 in the aggregate until September 30, 2005,
and (iii) restricted our ability to make certain restricted
payments such as dividends until September 30, 2005 to
paying dividends on our preferred stock and to repurchase
capital stock in connection with employees’ exercise of
options.

The terms of the September 27, 2005 amendment to the
Three-Year Revolving Credit Facility did not permit us:
(i) to make cash acquisitions in excess of $50.0 until
October 2006, or thereafter in excess of $50.0 until expiration
of the agreement in May 2007, subject to increases equal to the
net cash proceeds received during the applicable period from any
disposition of assets; (ii) to make capital expenditures in
excess of $210.0 annually; (iii) to repurchase or to
declare or pay dividends on our capital stock (except for any
convertible preferred stock, convertible trust preferred
instrument or similar security, which includes our outstanding
5.375% Series A Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock),
except that we may repurchase our capital stock in connection
with the exercise of options by our employees or with proceeds
contemporaneously received from an issue of new shares of our
capital stock; or (iv) to incur new debt by our
subsidiaries, other than unsecured debt incurred in the ordinary
course of business of our subsidiaries outside the U.S. and
unsecured debt, which may not exceed $10.0 in the aggregate,
incurred in the ordinary course of business of our
U.S. subsidiaries. In addition the daily ending balance of
cash and securities requirement from the previous amendment was
removed through this amendment.

The October 17, 2005 amendment increased the amount that we
may borrow under the facility by $50.0 to $500.0.

The November 7, 2005 amendment, effective as of
September 30, 2005, amended the financial covenants with
respect to the period ended September 30, 2005 and extended
the period during which long-lived asset and impairment charges
in an aggregate amount not in excess of $500.0 may be recognized
and added back to the calculation of EBITDA.

The March 21, 2006 amendment, effective as of
December 31, 2005, amended the financial covenants with
respect to periods ended December 31, 2005, March 31,
2006 and June 30, 2006 and certain provisions relating to
letters of credit, so that letters of credit issued under the
facility may have expiration dates beyond the termination date
of the facility, subject to certain conditions. Such conditions
include, among others, the requirement for us, on the

th

day
prior to the termination date of the facility, to provide a cash
deposit in an amount equal to the total amount of the
outstanding letters of credit with expiration dates beyond the
termination date of the facility. The amendment also added one
new financial covenant so that we are required to maintain,
based on a five business day testing period, in cash and
securities, an average daily ending balance of $300.0 plus the
aggregate principal amount of borrowings under the credit
facility in domestic accounts with our lenders. We also obtained
a waiver from the lenders under the Three-Year Revolving Credit
Facility on March 21, 2006 to waive any default arising
from the restatement of our financial data presented in this
report.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)

The Three-Year Revolving Credit Facility now contains revised
financial covenants. These covenants have been modified
previously by amendments and waivers on March 31, 2005,
June 22, 2005, September 27, 2005, November 7,
2005 (effective as of September 30, 2005) and
March 21, 2006 (effective as of December 31, 2005).
The revisions in the covenants subsequent to each amendment are
detailed below. These covenants require us to maintain with
respect to each fiscal quarter set forth below:

(i) an interest coverage ratio for the four fiscal quarters
    then ended of not less than that set forth opposite the
    corresponding quarter in the table below:

*

The March 21, 2006 amendment, effective as of
    December 31, 2005, removed the financial covenant
    requirements with respect to the interest coverage ratio for the
    fiscal quarters ending December 31, 2005, March 31,
    2006 and June 30, 2006.

(ii) a debt to EBITDA ratio, where debt is the balance at
    period-end and EBITDA is for the four fiscal quarters then
    ended, of not greater than that set forth opposite the
    corresponding quarter in the table below:



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)

*

The March 21, 2006 amendment, effective as of
    December 31, 2005, removed the financial covenant
    requirements with respect to the debt to EBITDA ratio for the
    fiscal quarters ending December 31, 2005, March 31,
    2006 and June 30, 2006.

(iii) minimum levels of EBITDA for the four fiscal quarters
    then ended of not less than that set forth opposite the
    corresponding quarter in the table below:

The terms used in these financial covenant ratios, including
EBITDA, interest coverage and debt, are subject to specific
definitions set forth in the agreement. Under the definition set
forth in the Three-Year Revolving Credit Facility, EBITDA is
determined by adding to net income or loss the following items:
interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation expense,
amortization expense, and certain specified cash payments and
non-cash charges subject to limitations on time and amount set
forth in the agreement. Interest coverage is defined as a ratio
of EBITDA of the period of four fiscal quarters then ended to
interest expense during such period.

We have in the past been required to seek and have obtained
amendments and waivers of the financial covenants under our
committed bank facility. There can be no assurance that we will
be in compliance with these covenants in future periods. If we
do not comply and are unable to obtain the necessary amendments
or waivers at that time, we would be unable to borrow or obtain
additional letters of credit under the Three-Year Revolving
Credit Facility and could choose to terminate the facility and
provide a cash deposit in connection with any outstanding
letters of credit. The lenders under the Three-Year Revolving
Credit Facility would also have the right to terminate the
facility, accelerate any outstanding principal and require us to
provide a cash deposit in an amount equal to the total amount of
outstanding letters of credit. The outstanding amount of letters
of credit was $162.4 as of December 31, 2005. We have not
drawn under the Three-Year Credit Facility over the past two
years, and we do not currently expect to do so. So long as there
are no amounts to be accelerated under the Three-Year Revolving
Credit Facility, termination of the facility would not trigger
the cross-acceleration provisions of our public debt.

Note 14:

Convertible Preferred Stock

We currently have two series of convertible preferred stock
outstanding: our 5.375% Series A Mandatory Convertible
Preferred Stock (“Series A Preferred Stock”) and
our 5.25% Series B Cumulative Convertible Perpetual
Preferred Stock (“Series B Preferred Stock”).



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)

Series B Preferred Stock

On October 24, 2005, we completed a private offering of
0.525 shares of our Series B Preferred Stock at an
aggregate offering price of $525.0. The net proceeds from the
sale were approximately $507.3 after deducting discounts to the
initial purchasers and the estimated expenses of the offering.

Each share of the Series B Preferred Stock has a
liquidation preference of $1,000.00 per share and is
convertible at the option of the holder at any time into
73.1904 shares of our common stock, subject to adjustment
upon the occurrence of certain events, which represents a
conversion price of approximately $13.66, representing a
conversion premium of approximately 30% over our closing stock
price on October 18, 2005 of $10.51 per share. On or
after October 15, 2010, each share of the Series B
Preferred Stock may be converted at our option if the closing
price of our common stock multiplied by the conversion rate then
in effect equals or exceeds 130% of the liquidation preference
of $1,000.00 per share for 20 trading days during any
consecutive 30 trading day period. Holders of the Series B
Preferred Stock will be entitled to an adjustment to the
conversion rate if they convert their shares in connection with
a fundamental change meeting certain specified conditions.

The Series B Preferred Stock is junior to all of our
existing and future debt obligations, on parity with our
Series A Preferred Stock and senior to our common stock,
with respect to payments of dividends and rights upon
liquidation, winding up or dissolution, to the extent of the
liquidation preference of $1,000.00 per share. There are no
registration rights with respect to the Series B Preferred
Stock, shares of our common stock issuable upon conversion
thereof or any shares of our common stock that may be delivered
in connection with a dividend payment.

In accordance with EITF Issue No. 03-6,

Participating
Securities and the Two — Class Method under FASB
Statement No. 128, Earnings Per Share,

the
Series B Preferred Stock is not considered a security with
participation rights in earnings available to common
stockholders due to the contingent nature of the conversion
feature of these securities.

Series A Preferred Stock

We currently have outstanding 7.475 shares of our
Series A Preferred Stock with a liquidation preference of
$50.00 per share. On the automatic conversion date of
December, 15, 2006, each share of the Series A
Preferred Stock will convert, subject to certain adjustments,
into between 3.0358 and 3.7037 shares of our common stock,
depending on the then-current market price of our common stock.

At any time prior to December 15, 2006, holders may elect
to convert each share of their Series A Preferred Stock,
subject to certain adjustments, into 3.0358 shares of our
common stock. If the closing price per share of our common stock
exceeds $24.71 for at least 20 trading days within a period of
30 consecutive trading days, we may elect, subject to
certain limitations, to cause the conversion of all of the
shares of Series A Preferred Stock then outstanding into
shares of our common stock at a conversion rate of
3.0358 shares of our common stock for each share of our
Series A Preferred Stock.

The Series A Preferred Stock is junior to all of our
existing and future debt obligations, on parity with our
Series B Preferred Stock and senior to our common stock,
with respect to payments of dividends and rights upon
liquidation, winding up or dissolution, to the extent of the
liquidation preference of $50.00 per share.

In accordance with EITF Issue No. 03-6, the Series A
Preferred Stock is considered a security with participation
rights in earnings available to common stockholders due to the
conversion feature of these securities. For periods in which we
experience net income, the impact of these securities’
participation rights is included in the calculation of earnings
per share. For periods in which we experience a net loss,



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)

the Series A Preferred Stock has no impact on the
calculation of earnings per share due to the fact that the
holders of these securities do not participate in our losses.

Payment of Dividends

We have not paid any dividends on our common stock since
December of 2002. Our ability to declare or pay dividends on
common stock is currently restricted by the terms of our
Three-Year Revolving Credit Facility. In addition, the terms of
our outstanding series of preferred stock do not permit us to
pay dividends on our common stock unless all accumulated and
unpaid dividends have been or contemporaneously are declared and
paid, or provision for the payment thereof has been made.

We pay annual dividends on each share of Series A Preferred
Stock in the amount of $2.6875. Annual dividends on each share
of Series A Preferred Stock are payable quarterly in cash
or, if certain conditions are met, in common stock, at our
option, on March 15, June 15, September 15 and
December 15 of each year. In addition to the stated annual
dividend, if at any time on or before December 15, 2006, we
pay a cash dividend on our common stock, the holders of
Series A Preferred Stock participate in such distributions
via adjustments to the conversion ratio, thereby increasing the
number of common shares into which the Preferred Stock will
ultimately convert. In March 2006, the Board of Directors
declared a dividend of $0.671875 per share on our
Series A Preferred Stock, resulting in a maximum possible
aggregate dividend of $5.0.

We pay annual dividends on each share of Series B Preferred
Stock in the amount of $52.50 per share. The initial
dividend on our Series B Preferred Stock is
$11.8125 per share and was declared on December 19,
2005 payable in cash on January 17, 2006. Annual dividends
on each share of Series B Preferred Stock are payable
quarterly in cash or, if certain conditions are met, in common
stock, at our option, on January 15, April 15, July 15
and October 15 of each year. The dividend rate of the
Series B Preferred Stock will be increased by 1.0% if we do
not pay dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock for six
quarterly periods (whether consecutive or not). The dividend
rate will revert back to the original rate once all unpaid
dividends are paid in full. The dividend rate of the
Series B Preferred Stock will also be increased by 1.0% if
we do not file our periodic reports with the SEC within
15 days after the required filing date during the first two
year period following the closing of the offering. In March
2006, the Board of Directors declared a dividend of
$13.125 per share on our Series B Preferred Stock,
resulting in a maximum possible aggregate dividend of $6.9.

Dividends on each share of preferred stock are cumulative from
the date of issuance and are payable on each payment date to the
extent that: we are in compliance with our Three-Year Revolving
Credit Facility, assets are legally available to pay dividends
and our Board of Directors or an authorized committee of our
Board declares a dividend payable. If we do not pay dividends on
any series of our preferred stock for six quarterly periods
(whether consecutive or not), then holders of all series of our
preferred stock then outstanding will have the right to elect
two additional directors to the Board. These additional
directors will remain on the Board until all accumulated and
unpaid dividends on our cumulative preferred stock have been
paid in full, or to the extent our series of non-cumulative
preferred stock is outstanding, until non-cumulative dividends
have been paid regularly for at least one year.

Note 15:

Incentive Plans

We issue stock and cash based incentive awards to our employees
under a plan established by the Compensation Committee and
approved by our shareholders. Common stock may be granted under
the current plan, up to 4.5 shares for stock options and
14.0 shares for awards other than stock options, however
there are limits as to the number of shares available for
certain awards and to any one participant. Additional stock
options and shares for awards other than stock options may be
granted under the current plan if stock options and shares for
awards other than stock options previously awarded under prior
year



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)

compensation plans are forfeited. During the year ended
December 31, 2005, forfeitures of stock options and shares
for awards other than stock options previously granted of 6.2
and 1.9, respectively, resulted in an additional 8.1 shares
available to be issued in future awards. At December 31,
2005, there were 8.2 shares for stock options and
2.3 shares for awards other than stock options that were
available under the plan.

Stock Options

Stock options are granted at the fair market value of our common
stock on the date of grant and are generally exercisable between
two and five years after the date of grant and expire ten years
from the grant date.

Acceleration of Stock Options

On December 20, 2005, the Compensation Committee approved
the immediate acceleration of vesting of all of our

“out-of

-the-money”
outstanding and unvested stock options previously awarded to our
employees under equity compensation plans, excluding unvested
options (1) granted during the 2005 calendar year,
(2) held by our CEO or CFO or (3) held by
non-management directors. All of the outstanding non-excluded
unvested options were considered

“out-of

-the-money”
if on December 20, 2005, the options had per share exercise
prices equal to or in excess of $9.585, the average of the high
and low price per share as quoted on the New York Stock Exchange
on that date. As a result of the accelerated



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)

vesting, options to purchase approximately 7.8 shares of
our common stock became exercisable immediately. The
weighted-average exercise price of the options subject to the
acceleration was $18.40 per share. The number of shares,
exercise prices and other terms of the options subject to the
acceleration remain unchanged. The options are exercisable under
their modified terms; however we were unable to issue securities
upon the exercise of stock options due to the SEC’s
position concerning our ineligibility to use the applicable
registration forms.

The accelerated vesting eliminates the future compensation
expense that we would otherwise recognize in our Consolidated
Statements of Operations with respect to these options upon the
adoption of SFAS No. 123R (revised 2004),

Share-Based Payment,

as of January 1, 2006. The
accelerated vesting of these stock options is expected to reduce
the non-cash compensation expense that would have been recorded
in the Consolidated Statements of Operations by $26.7 over the
course of the original vesting periods through 2009. Upon
adoption of SFAS No. 123R, we will recognize
compensation expense related to any unvested options as of that
date, as well as any options granted on or after that date.
Since most of the accelerated options are considerably

“out-of

-the-money,”
we expect that the accelerated vesting of these stock options
will have a positive effect on employee retention and perception
of stock option value. Because our near-term, share-based
compensation expenses were reduced by the acceleration of
vesting, share-based compensation expenses could grow
significantly in future periods if we continue to grant amounts
of new share-based compensation awards similar to recent periods.

As of January 1, 2006, we plan to implement
SFAS No. 123R using the modified prospective method,
which requires that compensation expense be recorded for all
unvested stock options and other equity-based awards. We
estimate the impact of applying the provisions of
SFAS No. 123R will result in an incremental expense in
our Consolidated Statements of Operations of approximately $15.5
from 2006 through 2011 related to the outstanding options as of
December 31, 2005. See Note 22 for further explanation.

Restricted Stock and Performance-Based Stock

Restricted stock is granted to certain key employees and is
subject to certain restrictions and vesting requirements as
determined by the Compensation Committee. The vesting period is
generally two to five years. No monetary consideration is paid
by a recipient for a restricted stock award and the fair value
of the shares on the grant date is amortized over the vesting
period. There were 10.1 and 7.5 shares of restricted stock
outstanding at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. We
awarded 5.2 shares, 4.1 shares and 0.5 shares of
restricted stock with a weighted-average grant date fair value
of $12.13, $13.72 and $11.51 during 2005, 2004 and 2003,
respectively. The expense recorded for restricted stock awards,
net of forfeitures, was $39.9, $31.1 and $34.9 during 2005, 2004
and 2003, respectively.

Performance-based stock awards are a form of stock-award in
which the number of shares ultimately received by the holder
depends on our performance against specific performance targets.
Performance-based stock awards were granted to certain key
employees and were subject to certain restrictions and vesting
requirements as determined by the Compensation Committee. The
awards generally vest over a three-year period tied to the
employees’ continuing employment and the achievement of
certain performance conditions. No monetary consideration is
paid by a recipient for a performance-based stock award and the
fair value of the shares on the grant date is amortized over the
vesting period. At December 31, 2005, there were
2.1 shares of the performance-based stock outstanding.
During 2005, we awarded 2.3 shares of performance-based
stock with a weighted-average grant date fair value of $12.09.
The expense recorded for the performance-based stock awards, net
of forfeitures, was $3.0 during 2005.

Restricted Stock Units and Share Appreciation
Performance-Based Units

Restricted stock units are granted to employees and generally
vest in three years. The grantee is entitled to receive a
payment in cash or in shares of common stock, at the discretion
of the Company, based on the fair market value of the
corresponding number of shares of common stock upon completion
of the vesting period. The holder of restricted stock units has
no ownership interest in the underlying shares of common stock
until the restricted stock units vest and the shares of common
stock are issued. At December 31, 2005, there were 2.4
restricted stock units outstanding. During 2005 and 2004, we
awarded 1.6 and 1.0 shares of restricted stock units with a
weighted-average grant date fair value of $12.09 and $13.41,
respectively. The expense recorded for the restricted stock
units, net of forfeitures, was $4.3 and $2.2 during 2005 and
2004, respectively.

In 2005, we granted Michael Roth, Chairman of the Board and
Chief Executive Officer, 0.3 share appreciation
performance-based units (“SAPUs”) based on a
weighted-average grant date stock price of $12.17. Based on the
discretion of the Company, the grantee is entitled to receive a
payment in cash or shares of common stock upon completion of the
four-year vesting period. The holder of the SAPUs has no
ownership interest in the underlying shares of common stock
until the SAPUs vest and the shares of common stock are issued.
No expense was recorded for the SAPUs, as the awards were

“out-of

-the-money”
due to the exercise price exceeding the market price during 2005.

Performance Units

Before December 2003, performance units had been awarded to
certain key employees. The payout for these performance units
was contingent upon the annual growth in profits (as defined)
over the performance periods. The awards are generally paid in
cash. The projected value of these units is accrued and charged
to expense over the performance period. The expense recorded for
performance units, net of forfeitures, was $5.3, $12.1 and $19.7
during 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. In December 2003, the
Compensation Committee terminated the existing Performance Units
Plan. Final payments under this plan totaling approximately $9.6
are expected to be made in 2006.

Note 16:

Employee Benefits

Pension Plans

Through March 31, 1998, we had a defined benefit plan
(“Domestic Plan”) which covered substantially all
regular domestic employees. In 1992, the Domestic Plan was
amended to offer new plan participants a cash balance benefit as
opposed to a career pay formula benefit which was the previous
plan formula prior to the amendment. Under the cash balance
benefit, participants were credited with an annual allocation
equal to a percentage of their compensation, ranging from 1.5%
to 5.0%, based on the participant’s age and years of
service. For

pre-1992

participants, the benefit is the greater of the cash balance
account or the career pay formula benefit. Under the career pay
formula benefit, annual accruals were earned based on 1.0% of
compensation up to $15,000 (actual number) plus 1.3% of
compensation above $15,000 (actual number). Participants are
eligible to receive their benefit in the form of a lump sum
payment or as an annuity. Effective April 1, 1998, plan
participation and benefit accruals for this Domestic Plan were
frozen and participants with five or less years of service
became fully vested. As of December 31, 2005, there were
approximately 4,900 participants (actual number) in the Domestic
Plan. Participants with five or more years of participation in
the Domestic Plan as of March 31, 1998 retained their
vested balances in the Domestic Plan and also became eligible
for payments under a new compensation arrangement, the
“Supplemental Compensation Plan” (described below).
One of our agencies has an additional domestic plan covering
approximately 200 employees (actual number). This plan is closed
to new participants.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)

We also have numerous plans outside the United States, some of
which are funded, while others provide payments at the time of
retirement or termination under applicable labor laws or
agreements. The Interpublic Pension Plan in the UK (“UK
Pension Plan”) is the most material foreign pension plan in
terms of the liability and plan assets. The UK Pension Plan is a
defined benefit plan offering plan participants a final average
pay benefit. Under the final average pay benefit formula, the
normal retirement benefit is 1.67% of final average pay per each
year of service, where final average pay is the highest
consecutive 36 months of pay out of the last ten years
prior to retirement. Effective November 1, 2002, the UK
Pension Plan was closed to new entrants, but existing
participants continue to earn benefits under the plan. New
employees after November 1, 2002 may be eligible to join
the industry wide plan that operates on a defined contribution
basis. As of December 31, 2005, there were approximately
1,800 participants (actual number) in the UK Pension Plan.

During 2005, we identified certain additional foreign pension
plans. We have included the net periodic cost, as well as the
benefit obligations and assets related to these plans as of and
for the year ended December 31, 2005. The benefit
obligations and plan assets are classified as “other”
adjustments within the Pension and Postretirement Benefit
Obligation table below. These plans do not have a material
impact on our Consolidated Balance Sheets or Statements of
Operations in 2005 or 2004.

Postretirement Benefit Plans

Some of our subsidiaries provide postretirement health benefits
to eligible employees and their dependents and postretirement
life insurance to eligible employees. For domestic employees to
be eligible for postretirement health benefits, an employee had
to be hired prior to January 1, 1988. Benefits are provided
to retirees before and after eligibility for Medicare, and the
Company’s cost is limited to $7,000 (actual number) per
covered individual pre-Medicare eligibility and $2,000 (actual
number) per covered individual post-Medicare eligibility. For
both pre-Medicare and post-Medicare retirees, prescription drug
coverage is included in the benefits that are subject to the
cap. Employees that retired prior to May 1, 1993 and their
dependents are not subject to the annual cap on company costs.
Retiree contributions are required for pre-Medicare coverage. To
be eligible for life insurance, an employee had to be hired
prior to December 1, 1961. As of December 31, 2005,
there were approximately 1,400 participants (actual number) in
the postretirement health benefits plan and approximately 230
participants (actual number) in the postretirement life
insurance plan.

In addition to the participants in the postretirement health
benefits plan described above, certain domestic employees of the
former True North Communications companies acquired in June 2001
and their dependents are eligible for postretirement health
benefits and life insurance. Generally, only employees hired
prior to June 22, 2001 are eligible for coverage. Certain
cost-sharing features and limitations on Company cost apply to
most of these participants. As of December 31, 2005, there
were approximately 2,300 participants (actual number) in both
the True North postretirement health benefits plan and
postretirement life insurance plan.

Our postretirement health benefits plans are unfunded, and the
Company pays claims as presented by the plans’
administrator. The postretirement life insurance plan is insured
and the Company pays premiums to the plan administrator.

In December 2003, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement
and Modernization Act of 2003 (the “Act”) was enacted.
The Act established a prescription drug benefit under Medicare,
known as “Medicare Part D,” and a federal subsidy
to sponsors of postretirement health benefits plans that provide
a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to the
Medicare Part D benefit. The prescription drug benefit
provided to certain participants in the postretirement medical
plan is at least actuarially equivalent to the Medicare
Part D benefit, and, accordingly, we are entitled to a
subsidy. Our application for the subsidy for our retirees was
accepted by the Department of Health and Human Services, with
the exception of certain



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)

participants of the True North postretirement benefit plan,
whose benefits we believe are not actuarially equivalent to the
Medicare Part D benefit and, therefore, not eligible for
the Medicare Part D subsidy. We have adopted FASB Staff
Position (“FSP”) No. FAS 106-2,

Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the
Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of
2003,

prospectively from July 1, 2004. The expected
subsidy reduced the accumulated postretirement benefit
obligation by $5.0 at adoption, and the net periodic cost by
$1.0 and $0.3 for 2005 and 2004, respectively, as compared with
the amount calculated without considering the effects of the
subsidy.

Pension and Postretirement Net Periodic Cost

We use a measurement date of December 31 for all material
plans. The following table identifies the components of net
periodic cost for the domestic pension plans, the principal
foreign pension plans, and the post retirement benefit plans.

Pension and Postretirement Benefit Obligation

We use a measurement date of December 31 for all material
plans. The change in the benefit obligation, the change in plan
assets, the funded status and amounts recognized for the
domestic pension plans, the principal foreign pension plans, and
the postretirement benefit plans are as follows:

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)

Differences between the aggregate balance sheet amounts listed
above and the totals reported in our Consolidated Balance Sheets
and our Consolidated Statements of Stockholders’ Equity and
Comprehensive Income (Loss) relate to the non-material foreign
plans.

The projected benefit obligation, accumulated benefit obligation
and fair value of plan assets for domestic pension plans with
accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets were
$169.0, $163.7 and $116.3, respectively, at December 31,
2005 and $167.6, $163.1 and $119.2, respectively, at
December 31, 2004.

The projected benefit obligation, accumulated benefit obligation
and fair value of plan assets for foreign pension plans with
accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets were
$493.7, $452.5 and $271.9, respectively, at December 31,
2005 and $445.3, $409.0 and $211.3, respectively, at
December 31, 2004. Our foreign pension plans are largely
under funded due to different funding incentives that exist
outside of the U.S. In certain countries where we have
major operations, there are no legal requirements or financial
incentives provided to companies to pre-fund pension
obligations. In these instances, benefit payments are typically
paid directly from our cash as they become due.

Determination of Discount Rates

For the domestic pension and postretirement benefit plans, we
determine our discount rate based on the estimated rate at which
annuity contracts could be purchased to effectively settle the
respective benefit obligations. In determining the discount
rate, we utilize a yield curve based on high-quality corporate
bonds. Each plan’s projected cash flow is matched to this
yield curve and a present value is developed, which is then used
to develop a single equivalent discount rate. When identifying
the bonds to be used, we exclude bonds with outlier yields as
these bonds are more likely to be mispriced or misgraded.

For the foreign pension plans, we determine a discount rate by
referencing market yields on high quality corporate bonds in the
local markets with the appropriate term at December 31,
2005.

Determination of the Expected Return on Assets

For the Domestic Plan, we develop the long-term expected rate of
return assumptions which we use to model and determine overall
asset allocations. Our rate of return analyses factor in
historical trends, current market conditions, risk premiums
associated with asset classes, and long-term inflation rates. We
determine both a short-term (5-7 year) and long-term
(30 year) view and then attempt to select a long-term rate
of return assumption that matches the duration of our
liabilities. Factors included in the analysis of returns include
historical trends of asset class index returns over various
market cycles and economic conditions.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)

Approximately 84% of the foreign plan assets are part of the UK
Pension Plan. The UK Pension Plan’s statement of investment
principles specifies benchmark allocations by asset category for
each investment manager employed, with specified ranges around
the central benchmark allocation. For the UK Pension Plan, we
determine the expected rate of return by utilizing the current
long-term rates of return available on government bonds and
applying suitable risk premiums that consider historical market
returns and current market expectations.

Asset Allocation

The primary investment goal for our plans’ assets is to
maximize total asset returns while ensuring the plans’
assets are available to fund the plans’ liabilities as they
become due. The plans’ assets in aggregate and at the
individual portfolio level are invested so that total portfolio
risk exposure and risk-adjusted returns best meet this objective.

As of December 31, 2005 our domestic and foreign (primarily
the UK) pension plan target asset allocations for 2006, as well
as the actual asset allocations at December 31, 2005 and
2004, are as follows:

for the period 2011-2015.

Supplemental Compensation Plan

As discussed above, participants with five or more years of
participation in the Domestic Plan as of March 31, 1998
became eligible for payments under the Supplemental Compensation
Plan. Under the Supplemental Compensation Plan, each participant
is eligible for an annual allocation, which approximates the
projected discontinued pension benefit accrual (formerly made
under the cash balance formula in the Domestic Plan) plus
interest, while they continue to work for us. Participants in
active service are eligible to receive up to ten years of
allocations coinciding with the number of years of plan
participation in the Domestic Plan as of March 31, 1998.
After five years of plan participation, a participant starts to
receive an annual cash payment equal to 50% of the accumulated
plan balance. Participants must be employed with us as of the
scheduled payment date to receive a payment. However, a
participant is entitled to 100% of the accumulated plan balance
at termination of employment if certain age and service
requirements are met. Payments began in 2003 and are scheduled
to end in 2008. As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, the
Supplemental Compensation Plan liability recorded on our
Consolidated Balance Sheet was $7.3 and $9.7, respectively.
Amounts expensed for the Supplemental Compensation Plan in 2005,
2004 and 2003 were $1.0, $5.4 and $3.4, respectively.

Savings Plans

We sponsor a defined contribution plan (“Savings
Plan”) that covers substantially all domestic employees.
The Savings Plan permits participants to make contributions on a
pre-tax and/or after-tax basis. The Savings Plan allows
participants to choose among various investment alternatives. We
match a portion of participant contributions based upon their
years of service. We contributed $29.9, $28.0 and $26.9 to the
Savings Plan in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Deferred Compensation and Benefit Arrangements

We have deferred compensation arrangements which (i) permit
certain of our key officers and employees to defer a portion of
their salary or incentive compensation, or (ii) result in
us contributing an amount to the participant’s account. The
arrangements typically provide that the participant will receive
the amounts deferred plus interest upon attaining certain
conditions, such as completing a certain number of years of
service or upon retirement or termination. As of
December 31, 2005 and 2004, the deferred compensation
liability balance recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets
was $141.3 and $154.3,



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)

respectively. Amounts expensed for deferred compensation
arrangements in 2005, 2004 and 2003 were $10.2, $8.8 and $5.0,
respectively.

We have deferred benefit arrangements with certain key officers
and employees which provide participants with an annual payment,
payable when the participant attains a certain age and after the
participant’s employment has terminated. The deferred
benefit liability recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at
December 31, 2005 and 2004 was $151.5 and $128.3,
respectively. Amounts expensed for deferred benefit arrangements
in 2005, 2004 and 2003 were $30.9, $17.1 and $12.7, respectively.

We use various actuarial methods and assumptions in determining
our pension and postretirement benefit costs and obligations,
including the discount rate used to determine the present value
of future benefits, expected long-term rate of return on plan
assets and healthcare cost trend rates. A significant assumption
used to estimate certain deferred benefit liabilities is a
participant’s retirement age. For one of our more
significant deferred benefit arrangements we determined that
participants are eligible to retire and begin collecting their
deferred benefits at age 60. Historically, based upon prior
experience and trending data we assumed that related
participants would retire at age 65. However, more recent
experience indicates that a majority of eligible participants
were retiring and beginning to collect their deferred benefits
at age 60. Therefore, in conjunction with our annual review
of pension and postretirement benefit assumptions in the fourth
quarter of 2005, we revised the assumed retirement age from 65
to 60 within the related deferred benefit liability calculation.
As a result of this change in estimate, during the fourth
quarter of 2005 the deferred benefit expense increased salaries
and related expenses on our Consolidated Statements of
Operations by $14.8, with a corresponding increase to the
deferred benefit liability.

We have purchased life insurance policies on participants’
lives to assist in the funding of the related deferred
compensation and deferred benefit liabilities. As of
December 31, 2005 and 2004, the cash surrender value of
these policies was $132.8 and $141.4, respectively. In addition
to the life insurance policies, certain investments are held for
the purpose of paying the deferred compensation and deferred
benefit liabilities. These investments, along with the life
insurance policies, are held in a separate trust and are
restricted for the purpose of paying the deferred compensation
and the deferred benefit arrangement liabilities. As of
December 31, 2005 and 2004, the value of such restricted
assets was $86.1 and $80.2, respectively. The short-term
investments, long-term investments and cash surrender value of
the policies in the trust are included in Other Current Assets,
Investments and Other Assets, respectively, on our Consolidated
Balance Sheets.

Long-term Disability Plan

We have a Long-term Disability (“LTD”) plan which
provides income replacement benefits to eligible participants
who are unable to perform their job duties during the first
24 months of disability. Benefits are continued thereafter,
provided the participants receive disability benefits from
Social Security. As all income replacement benefits are fully
insured, no related obligation is required at December 31,
2005 and 2004. In addition to income replacement benefits, all
LTD participants continue to receive medical, dental and life
insurance benefits up to age 65 (subject to minimum periods
depending on the participants’ age at time of disability).
We have recorded an obligation of $9.3 and $6.1 as of
December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, related to
medical, dental benefits and life insurance benefits for LTD
participants.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

Under the ESPP, employees could purchase our common stock
through payroll deductions not exceeding 10% of their
compensation. The price an employee paid for a share of stock
under the ESPP was 85% of the average market price on the last
business day of each month. In 2005, 2004 and 2003, we



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)

issued 0.1 shares, 0.7 shares and 0.9 shares,
respectively, purchased by employees under the ESPP. Shares
issued to employees under the ESPP have no impact on our
Consolidated Statements of Operations. No stock was purchased
under the ESPP during the second quarter of 2005. The ESPP
expired effective June 30, 2005 and shares are no longer
available for issuance under the ESPP. See Note 22 for
discussion of the impact of shares issued to employees under the
ESPP upon our adoption of SFAS No. 123R.

In November 2005, the Company’s stockholders approved the
establishment of an Interpublic Group of Companies Employee
Stock Purchase Plan (the “2006 Plan”) to replace the
previously existing ESPP. Under the 2006 Plan, employees may
purchase our common stock through payroll deductions not
exceeding 10% of their compensation. The price an employee pays
for a share of stock under the 2006 Plan is 90% of the lesser of
the market price of a share on the offering date or the market
price of a share on the last business day of the offering period
of three months. An aggregate of 15.0 shares are reserved
for issuance under the 2006 Plan. Beginning on March 17,
2005 and ending on the filing date of this annual report, we
were unable to issue securities pursuant to the ESPP or the 2006
Plan due to the SEC’s position concerning our ineligibility
to use the applicable registration forms.

Derivative and Hedging Instruments

We periodically enter into interest rate swap agreements and
forward contracts to manage exposure to interest rate
fluctuations and to mitigate foreign exchange volatility.

Interest Rate Swaps

During the fourth quarter of 2004, we executed three interest
rate swaps which synthetically converted $350.0 of fixed rate
debt to floating rates, to hedge a portion of our floating rate
exposure on our cash investments. The interest rate swaps
effectively converted the $350.0, 6.25% Senior Unsecured
Notes due November 2014 to floating rate debt and mature on the
same day the debt is due. As of December 31, 2004, the
floating rate was approximately 4.2%. Under the terms of the
interest rate swap agreement, we paid a floating interest rate,
based on one-month LIBOR plus an average spread of
176.6 basis points, and received the fixed interest rate of
the underlying bond being hedged. Fair value adjustments
decreased the carrying amount of our debt outstanding at
December 31, 2004 by approximately $1.7.

In January 2005, we executed an interest rate swap which
synthetically converted an additional $150.0 of fixed rate debt
to floating rates. The interest rate swap effectively converted
$150.0 of the $500.0, 7.25% Senior Unsecured Notes due
August 2011 to floating rate debt and matures on the same day
the debt is due. Under the terms of the interest rate swap
agreement we paid a floating interest rate, based on one-month
LIBOR plus a spread of 297.0 basis points, and received the
fixed interest rate of the underlying bond being hedged.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)

On May 25, 2005, we terminated all of our long-term
interest rate swap agreements covering the $350.0,
6.25% Notes due November 2014 and $150.0 of the $500.0,
7.25% Notes due August 2011. In connection with the
interest rate swap termination, our net cash receipts were
approximately $1.1, which will be recorded as an offset to
interest expense over the remaining life of the related debt.

We accounted for interest rate swaps related to our existing
long-term debt as fair value hedges. As a result, the
incremental interest payments or receipts from the swaps were
recorded as adjustments to interest expense in the Consolidated
Statement of Operations. The interest rate swaps settled on the
underlying bond interest payment dates until maturity. There was
no assumed hedge ineffectiveness as the interest rate swap terms
matched the terms of the hedged bond.

Forward Contracts

We have entered into foreign currency transactions in which
various foreign currencies are bought or sold forward. These
contracts were entered into to meet currency requirements
arising from specific transactions. The changes in value of
these forward contracts have been recorded as other income or
expense in our Consolidated Statement of Operations. As of
December 31, 2005 and 2004, we had contracts covering
approximately $6.2 and $1.8, respectively, of notional amount of
currency and the fair value of the forward contracts was
negligible.

Other

The terms of the 4.50% Notes include two embedded
derivative instruments and our Series B Preferred Stock
include one embedded derivative. The fair value of the three
derivatives on December 31, 2005 was negligible.

Note 19:

Financial Instruments

The following table presents the carrying amounts and fair
values of our financial instruments at December 31, 2005
and 2004. The carrying amounts reflected in our Consolidated
Balance Sheet for cash and cash equivalents, accounts
receivable, accounts payable, accrued expenses and short-term
borrowings approximated their respective fair values at
December 31, 2005 and 2004.

Investment Securities

Marketable securities consisted primarily of available-for-sale
equity securities that are publicly traded and have been
reported at fair value with net unrealized gains and losses
reported as a component of other comprehensive income. Cost
investments consisted primarily of public available-for-sale
equity securities accounted for under the cost method. Other
investments consisted primarily of investments in



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)

unconsolidated affiliated companies accounted for under the
equity method and have been carried at cost, which approximates
fair value. Dividends received from our investments in
unconsolidated affiliated companies were $5.9, $9.3 and $8.8 in
2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, and reduced the carrying
values of the related investments. The estimated fair values of
financial assets have been determined using available market
information and appropriate valuation methodologies. Judgment is
required in interpreting market information to develop the
estimated fair value amounts, and accordingly, changes in
assumptions and valuation methodologies may affect these
amounts. In the absence of other evidence, cost is presumed to
equal fair value for our cost and other investments. Net
unrealized holding gains on our investments were $24.2, $10.0
and $3.4 at December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Long-Term Debt

Long-term debt included variable and fixed rate debt. The fair
value of our long-term debt instruments was based on market
prices for debt instruments with similar terms and maturities.
During 2005 and 2004, we executed four interest rate swaps to
hedge a portion of our floating rate debt exposure. The interest
rate swaps were subsequently terminated in May of 2005. The fair
value of the interest rate swap agreements was estimated based
on quotes from the financial institutions of these instruments
and represents the estimated amounts that we would expect to
receive or pay to terminate the agreements at the reporting
date. Fair value adjustments increased/decreased the carrying
value of our debt outstanding at December 31, 2004 by
approximately $1.7, as discussed in Note 18.

Financial Commitments

Financial commitments include other forward contracts and put
obligations. Other forward contracts related primarily to an
obligation to repurchase 49% of the minority-owned equity
shares of a consolidated subsidiary, valued pursuant to
SFAS No. 150,

Accounting for Certain Financial
Instruments with Characteristic of Both Liabilities and
Equity.

Fair value measurement of the obligation was based
upon the amount payable as if the forward contract was settled
at December 31, 2005 and 2004. Changes in the fair value of
the obligation have been recorded as interest expense or income
in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.

Financial commitments included a written put option representing
an obligation to repurchase 40% of the minority-owned
equity shares of a consolidated subsidiary as of
December 31, 2004. The put option obligation has been

marked-to

-market by
assessing the fair value of the 40% interest as compared to the
amount payable if the put option was exercised at
December 31, 2004. Changes in the fair value of the put
option obligation have been recorded as long-lived asset
impairment and other charges in the Consolidated Statement of
Operations. During the fourth quarter of 2005, the put option
was exercised by the minority owners and the existing put option
obligation of $11.5 was relieved against the purchase price paid
by the Company.

Note 20:

Segment Information

As of December 31, 2005, we are organized into five global
operating divisions and a group of leading stand-alone agencies.
Our operating divisions are grouped into three reportable
segments. The IAN reportable segment is comprised of McCann,
FCB, Lowe, Draft and our stand-alone agencies. CMG comprises our
second reportable segment. Our third reportable segment is
comprised of our Motorsports operations, which were sold during
2004 and had immaterial residual operating results in 2005. We
also report results for the Corporate group. Future changes to
our organizational structure may result in changes to the
reportable segment disclosure.

Within the IAN segment, McCann, FCB, Lowe, Draft and our
stand-alone agencies provide a comprehensive array of global
communications and marketing services, each offering a
distinctive range of



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)

solutions for our clients. Our leading stand-alone agencies,
including Campbell-Ewald, Hill Holliday, Deutsch and Mullen,
provide a full range of advertising, marketing communications
services and/or marketing services and partner with our global
operating divisions as needed. Each of IAN’s operating
divisions share economic characteristics, specifically related
to the nature of their respective services, the manner in which
the services are provided and the similarity of their respective
customers. The annual margins of each of the operating divisions
may vary due to global economic conditions and client spending.
However, based on the respective future prospects of the
operating divisions, we believe that the long-term average gross
margin of each of these divisions will converge over time and,
given the similarity of their operations, they have been
aggregated into a single reportable segment.

CMG, which includes Weber Shandwick, MWW Group, FutureBrand,
DeVries, GolinHarris, Jack Morton, and Octagon Worldwide,
provides clients with diversified services, including public
relations, meeting and event production, sports and
entertainment marketing, corporate and brand identity and
strategic marketing consulting. CMG shares some similarities to
other service lines offered by IAN, however, on a stand-alone
basis, its economic characteristics and expected margin
performance are sufficiently different to support CMG as a
separate reportable segment. Specifically, CMG’s
businesses, on an aggregate basis, have a higher proportion of
arrangements for which it acts as principal, a greater
proportion of non-global clients and different margins.

During 2004, we exited our Motorsports business, which owned and
operated venue-based motorsports businesses. Other than the
recording of long-lived asset impairment and contract
termination costs during 2004, the operating results of
Motorsports during 2005 and 2004 were not material, and
therefore not discussed in detail.

The profitability measure employed by our chief operating
decision makers for allocating resources to operating divisions
and assessing operating division performance is operating income
(loss), which is calculated by subtracting segment salaries and
related expenses and office and general expenses from segment
revenue. Amounts reported as segment operating income (loss)
exclude the impact of restructuring and impairment charges, as
we do not typically consider these charges when assessing
operating division performance. The impact of restructuring and
impairment charges to each reporting segment are reported
separately in Notes 6 and 9, respectively. Segment
income (loss) excludes interest income and expense, debt
prepayment penalties, investment impairments, litigation charges
and other non-operating income. With the exception of excluding
certain amounts for reportable segment operating income (loss),
all segments follow the same accounting policies as those
described in Note 1.

Certain corporate and other charges are reported as a separate
line within total segment operating income and include corporate
office expenses and shared service center expenses, as well as
certain other centrally managed expenses which are not fully
allocated to operating divisions, as shown in the table below.
Salaries, benefits and related expenses include salaries,
pension, bonus and medical and dental insurance expenses for
corporate office employees. Professional fees include costs
related to the internal control compliance, cost of Prior
Restatement efforts, financial statement audits, legal,
information technology and other consulting fees, which are
engaged and managed through the corporate office. Professional
fees also include the cost of temporary financial professionals
associated with work on our Prior Restatement activities. Rent
and depreciation includes rental expense and depreciation of
leasehold improvements for properties occupied by corporate
office employees. Corporate insurance expense includes the cost
for fire, liability and automobile premiums. Bank fees relate to
cash management activity administered by the corporate office.
The amounts allocated to operating divisions are calculated
monthly based on a formula that uses the revenues of the
operating unit. Amounts allocated also include specific



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)

charges for information technology related projects which are
allocated based on utilization. The following expenses are
included in Corporate and Other:



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

Summarized financial information concerning our reportable
segments is shown in the following table:



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)

Revenue and long-lived assets are presented below by major
geographic area:

Revenue is attributed to geographic areas based on where the
services are performed. Property and equipment is allocated
based upon physical location. Intangible assets, other assets
and investments are allocated based on the location of the
related operations.

Our largest client contributed approximately 8% in 2005, 7% in
2004 and 8% in 2003 to revenue. Our second largest client
contributed approximately 3% in 2005, 3% in 2004 and 3% in 2003
to revenue. The IAN segment reported the majority of the revenue
for both clients in all periods.

Note 21:

Commitments and Contingencies

Leases

We lease certain facilities and equipment. Where leases contain
escalation clauses or concessions, such as rent holidays and
landlord/tenant incentives or allowances, the impact of such

Contingent Acquisition Obligations

We have structured certain acquisitions with additional
contingent purchase price obligations in order to reduce the
potential risk associated with negative future performance of
the acquired entity. In addition, we have entered into
agreements that may require us to purchase additional equity
interests in certain consolidated and unconsolidated
subsidiaries. The amounts relating to these transactions are
based on estimates of the future financial performance of the
acquired entity, the timing of the exercise of these rights,
changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other factors. We
have not recorded a liability for these items on the Balance
Sheet since the definitive amounts payable are not determinable
or distributable. When the contingent acquisition obligations
have been met and consideration is distributable, we will record
the fair value of this consideration as an additional cost of
the acquired entity. The following table details the estimated
liability and the estimated amount that would be paid under such
options, in the event of exercise at the earliest exercise date.
All payments are contingent upon achieving projected operating
performance targets and satisfying other conditions specified in
the related agreements and are subject to revisions as the
earn-out periods progress.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)

The following contingent acquisition obligations are net of
compensation expense, except as noted below, as defined by the
terms and conditions of the respective acquisition agreements
and employment terms of the former owners of the acquired
businesses. This future expense will not be allocated to the
assets and liabilities acquired. As of December 31, 2005,
our estimated contingent acquisition obligations are as follows:

In accounting for acquisitions, we recognize deferred payments
and purchases of additional interests after the effective date
of purchase that are contingent upon the future employment of
owners as compensation expense in our Consolidated Statements of
Operations. As of December 31, 2005 our estimated
contingent acquisition payments with associated compensation
expense impacts are as follows:

We have entered into certain acquisitions that contain both put
    and call options with similar terms and conditions. In such
    instances, we have included the related estimated contingent
    acquisition obligations with put options.

We maintain certain put options with consolidated affiliates
that are exercisable at the discretion of the minority owners as
of December 31, 2005. These put options are assumed to be
exercised in the earliest possible period subsequent to
December 31, 2005. Therefore, the related estimated
acquisition payments of $33.5 have been included within the
total payments expected to be made in 2006 in the table above.
These payments, if not made in 2006, will continue to
carry-forward into 2007 or beyond until they are exercised or
expire.

The 2006 obligations relate primarily to acquisitions that were
completed prior to December 31, 2001.

Legal Matters

Shares Deliverable Under Securities Class Actions

In the fourth quarter of 2004, we reached a final settlement of
the consolidated class action shareholders suits against us. The
class actions were filed against the Company and certain of our
present and former directors and officers on behalf of a
purported class of purchasers of our stock shortly after our
August 13, 2002 announcement regarding the restatement of
our previously reported earnings for the periods January 1,
1997 through March 31, 2002. Under the terms of the
settlement, we agreed to issue a total of 6.6 shares of our
common stock. During the fourth quarter of 2004, we issued 0.8
of the shares to the plaintiffs’ counsel as payment for
their fee and will issue the remaining 5.8 shares once the
appropriate allocation of the shares is made by plaintiffs’
counsel. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2004, the
6.6 shares have been included in our shares of common stock
outstanding for purposes of determining earnings (loss) per
share.

SEC Investigation

The SEC opened a formal investigation in response to the
restatement we first announced in August 2002 and, as previously
disclosed, the SEC staff’s investigation has expanded to
encompass our Prior Restatement. In particular, since we filed
our 2004
Form

10-K,

we have
received subpoenas from the SEC relating to matters addressed in
our Prior Restatement. We continue to cooperate with the
investigation. We expect that the investigation will result in
monetary liability, but because the investigation is ongoing, in
particular with respect to the Prior Restatement, we cannot
reasonably estimate either the timing of a resolution or the
amount. Accordingly, we have not yet established any accounting
provision relating to these matters.

Other Legal Matters

We are involved in other legal and administrative proceedings of
various types. While any litigation contains an element of
uncertainty, we have no reason to believe that the outcome of
such proceedings or claims will have a material adverse effect
on our financial condition, results of operations or our cash
flows.

Note 22:

Recent Accounting Standards

In November 2005, the FASB issued FSP No. FAS 115-1
and FAS 124-1,

The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary
Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments.

This
FSP addresses the determination as to when an investment is
considered impaired, whether the impairment is other than
temporary, and the measurement of an impairment loss. This FSP
specifically nullifies the requirements of paragraphs 10-18
of EITF Issue
No.

03-1,

The
Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application
to Certain Investments

and references existing
other-than-temporary impairment guidance. The guidance in this
FSP is effective for reporting periods beginning after
December 15, 2005. We do not expect the adoption of FSP
No. FAS 115-1 & FAS 124-1 to have a
material impact on our Consolidated Balance Sheet or Statement
of Operations.

In May 2005, SFAS No. 154,

Accounting Changes and
Error Corrections,

was issued, which replaces APB Opinion
No. 20,

Accounting Changes,

and
SFAS No. 3,

Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim
Financial Statements.

Among other changes,
SFAS No. 154 requires retrospective application of a
voluntary change in accounting principle to prior period
financial statements presented on the new accounting principle,
unless it is impracticable to determine either the
period-specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change.
Further, the Statement requires that corrections of errors in
previously issued financial statements be termed a
“restatement.” The new standard is effective for
accounting



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)

changes and error corrections made in fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2005. We do not expect the adoption of
SFAS No. 154 to have a material impact on our
Consolidated Balance Sheet or Statement of Operations.

In March 2005, FASB Interpretation (“FIN”)
No. 47,

Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement
Obligations

, was issued, an interpretation of
SFAS No. 143,

Accounting for Asset Retirement
Obligations.

FIN No. 47 clarifies the timing of
liability recognition for legal obligations associated with the
retirement of a tangible long-lived asset when the timing and/or
method of settlement are conditional on a future event. We
adopted the provisions of FIN No. 47 during the
quarter ended December 31, 2005. The adoption of
FIN No. 47 did not have a material impact on our
Consolidated Balance Sheet or Statement of Operations.

In December 2004, SFAS No. 123R (revised 2004),

Share-Based Payment,

was issued, which replaces
SFAS No. 123,

Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation

, and supersedes APB Opinion No. 25,

Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees.

SFAS No. 123R requires all share-based payments to
employees, including grants of employee stock options and the
shares issued under our employee stock purchase plan to be
recognized in the financial statements based on their fair
values, as of the beginning of the first fiscal year that starts
after June 15, 2005. We are required to adopt
SFAS No. 123R effective January 1, 2006. The pro
forma disclosures previously permitted under
SFAS No. 123 will no longer be an alternative to
financial statement recognition. In March 2005,
SAB No. 107,

Share-Based Payment

, was issued
regarding the SEC’s interpretation of
SFAS No. 123R and the valuation of share-based
payments for public companies. At adoption, we plan to use the
modified prospective method which requires expense recognition
for all unvested and outstanding awards and any awards granted
thereafter. The adoption of SFAS No. 123R is expected
to result in an increase in compensation expense for the year
ended December 31, 2006 of approximately $6.3, as compared
with the expense that would have been recognized under our prior
accounting policy.

In November 2005, the FASB issued FSP FAS 123R-3,

Transition Election Related to Accounting for the Tax Effects
of Share-Based Payment Awards

(“FSP 123R-3”). FSP
123R-3 provides an elective alternative simplified method to
calculate the windfall tax pool (the “APIC pool”).
Under this FSP, a company may calculate the beginning balance of
the APIC pool related to employee compensation and a simplified
method to determine the subsequent impact on the APIC pool of
employee awards that are fully vested and outstanding upon the
adoption of SFAS No. 123R. We are currently evaluating
this alternative transition method and have until
December 31, 2006 to make our one-time election. We do not
expect the adoption of FSP 123R-3 to have a material impact on
our Consolidated Balance Sheet or Statement of Operations.

In December 2004, SFAS No. 153,

Exchanges of
Nonmonetary Assets,

was issued, an amendment of APB Opinion
No. 29,

Accounting for Nonmonetary Transactions.

SFAS No. 153 is based on the principle that exchanges
of nonmonetary assets should be recorded and measured at the
fair value of the assets exchanged. APB Opinion No. 29
provided an exception to its basic measurement principle (fair
value) for exchanges of similar productive assets. Under APB
Opinion No. 29, an exchange of a productive asset for a
similar productive asset was based on the recorded amount of the
asset relinquished. SFAS No. 153 eliminates this
exception and replaces it with exceptions for exchanges of
nonmonetary assets that do not have reasonably determinable fair
values or commercial substance. SFAS No. 153 is
effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in reporting
periods beginning after June 15, 2005. The adoption of
SFAS No. 153 did not have a material impact on our
Consolidated Balance Sheet or Statement of Operations.

The adoption of the following accounting pronouncements during
2005 did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Balance
Sheet or Statement of Operations:

Note 23:

Results by Quarter (Unaudited)

The first set of tables below presents unaudited quarterly
financial information for 2005 and 2004. The 2005 amounts
presented have been restated from those previously reported on
Form

10-Q

for the
applicable periods. The tables below also set forth, for each of
the quarters and for each of the interim balance sheet dates
presented the amounts of the restatement adjustments and a
reconciliation from previously reported amounts to restated
amounts.

The quarterly restatement adjustments relate primarily to
accounting for goodwill impairments, revenue recognition and a
number of miscellaneous items including accounting for leases
and international compensation arrangements. The third set of
tables below summarizes, for each of the quarters and for each
of the interim balance sheet dates presented, the impact of each
category of adjustment on previously reported revenue, operating
income (loss), income (loss) from continuing operations before
provision for income taxes, net income (loss) and earnings per
share, and assets, liabilities and stockholders’ equity.
Below is a description of the restatement adjustments.

Goodwill Impairment:

Adjustments were made to properly
record goodwill impairment at a reporting unit within our sports
and marketing business.

Revenue Recognition related to Customer Contracts:

Adjustments were recorded to properly state the revenue in
accordance with the terms of customer contracts and our
policies. In certain transactions with our customers the
persuasive evidence of the customer arrangement was not always
adequate to support revenue recognition, or the timing of
revenue recognition did appropriately follow the specific
contract terms.

Other Adjustments:

We have identified other items which
do not conform to GAAP and recorded adjustments to our 2005
Consolidated Financial Statements which relate to previously
reported periods. Cash and accounts payable balances were
increased due to the identification of cash accounts held on
behalf of our clients.

Item 9.

Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on
    Accounting and Financial Disclosure

Not applicable.

Item 9A.

Controls and Procedures

Management’s Assessment on Internal Control over Financial
Reporting and the Report of Independent Registered Public
Accounting Firm located in Item 8 are incorporated by
reference herein.

Disclosure controls and procedures

We have carried out an evaluation under the supervision of, and
with the participation of, our management, including the Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the
effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure
controls and procedures as of December 31, 2005. Our
evaluation has disclosed numerous material weaknesses in our
internal control over financial reporting as noted in
Management’s Assessment on Internal Control over Financial
Reporting located in Item 8. Material weaknesses in
internal controls may also constitute deficiencies in our
disclosure controls and procedures. Based on an evaluation of
these material weaknesses, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls
and procedures are not effective as of December 31, 2005,
to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be
disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported,
within the time periods specified in the applicable rules and
forms, and that it is accumulated and communicated to our
management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our
Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure. However, based on work
performed to date, management believes that there are no
material inaccuracies or omissions of any material fact in this
2005 Annual Report. Management, to the best of its knowledge,
believes that the financial statements contained in the 2005
Annual Report are fairly presented in all material respects.

There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any
system of disclosure controls and procedures, including the
possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding
of the controls and procedures. Accordingly, even effective
disclosure controls and procedures can only provide reasonable
assurance of achieving their control objectives.

Changes in internal control over financial reporting

We have assessed our internal control over financial reporting
as of December 31, 2005 and reported on our assessment in
Item 8 of this report.

There has been no change in internal control over financial
reporting in the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2005,
that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to
materially affect, our internal control over financial
reporting. We continue to develop a remediation plan to address
the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial
reporting. The development of our remediation plan is described
in Remediation of Material Weaknesses in Internal Control over
Financial Reporting in Item 8. We expect that the
implementation of this plan will extend into 2006 and beyond.
