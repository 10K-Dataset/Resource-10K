PART I

Item 1.

Business

The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc. (“Interpublic,” “IPG,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) was incorporated in Delaware in September 1930 under the name of McCann-Erickson Incorporated as the successor to the advertising agency businesses founded in 1902 by A.W. Erickson and in 1911 by Harrison K. McCann.  The company has operated under the Interpublic name since January 1961.

About Us

We are one of the world’s premier global advertising, and marketing services companies.  Through our

45,400

employees in all major world markets, our companies specialize in consumer advertising, digital marketing, communications planning and media buying, public relations and specialized communications disciplines.  Our agencies create customized marketing programs for clients that range in scale from large global marketers to regional and local clients.  Comprehensive global services are critical to effectively serve our multinational and local clients in markets throughout the world, as they seek to build brands, increase sales of their products and services and gain market share.

The work we produce for our clients is specific to their unique needs.  Our solutions vary from project-based activity involving one agency to long-term, fully integrated campaigns created by multiple IPG agencies working together.  With offices in over


countries, we can operate in a single region, or deliver global integrated programs.

The role of our holding company is to provide resources and support to ensure that our agencies can best meet clients’ needs. Based in New York City, our holding company sets company-wide financial objectives and corporate strategy,  establishes financial management and operational controls, guides personnel policy, directs collaborative inter-agency programs, conducts investor relations, manages corporate social responsibility programs, provides enterprise risk management and oversees mergers and acquisitions. In addition, we provide certain centralized functional services that offer our companies operational efficiencies, including accounting and finance, executive compensation management and recruitment assistance, employee benefits, marketing information retrieval and analysis, internal audit, legal services, real estate expertise and travel services.

Our Brands

Interpublic is home to some of the world’s best-known and most innovative communications specialists.  We have three global networks, McCann Worldgroup ("McCann"), Draftfcb and Lowe & Partners ("Lowe"), that provide integrated, large-scale advertising and marketing solutions for clients, and three global media services companies, UM, Initiative and Brand Programming Network ("BPN"), operating under the IPG Mediabrands umbrella.  We also have a range of best-in-class global specialized communications assets as well as premier domestic integrated and interactive agencies that are industry leaders.

•

McCann Worldgroup is a leading global marketing solutions network, comprised of a collaborative group of best-in-class agencies that emphasize creativity, innovation and performance. It operates in more than 100 countries, with a client roster that includes many of the world's most famous brands.  McCann Erickson is one of the world's largest advertising agency networks; MRM conducts digital marketing and relationship management; Momentum oversees event marketing and promotion; McCann Health directs professional and consumer healthcare communications; and Craft Worldwide is the network's global adaptation and production arm. UM (media management), Weber Shandwick (public relations), and FutureBrand (brand consulting) align with McCann Worldgroup to deliver fully integrated solutions to a number of our leading clients.

•

Draftfcb is a modern agency model for clients seeking creative and accountable marketing programs delivered in a channel-neutral manner under a unified, integrated business.  The company has its roots in both creative, brand-building consumer advertising and behavioral, data-driven direct marketing. We believe the agency is the first global, behavior-based, creative and accountable marketing communications organization operating as a financially and structurally integrated business unit.

•

Lowe is a premier creative agency that operates in the world’s most dynamic growth markets.  Lowe's core strength is developing high-value ideas that connect with popular culture and drive business results. This is evident in the agency's global creative rankings and strong local operations in major key markets.  Examples include DLKW/Lowe (U.K.), Lowe Lintas (India), Lowe SSP3 (Colombia), BorghiErh/Lowe (Brazil) and Lowe Campbell Ewald (U.S.).

•

IPG Mediabrands delivers on the scale and breadth of our media capabilities, making investment decisions for tens of billions of dollars of client marketing budgets, yet retains a nimble, collaborative culture.  Our media agencies UM, Initiative and BPN seek to deliver business results by advising clients on how to navigate an increasingly complex and digital marketing landscape.  Specialist brands within IPG Mediabrands focus on areas such as media innovation, the


targeting and aggregation of audiences in the digital space, hyper-local marketing, media barter and a range of other capabilities.

•

We also have exceptional global marketing specialists across a range of disciplines.  We have industry-leading public relations agencies such as Weber Shandwick and GolinHarris that have expertise in every significant area of communication management.  Jack Morton is a global brand experience agency, and FutureBrand is a leading brand consultancy.  Octagon is a global sports, entertainment and lifestyle marketing agency.  Our digital specialist agencies, led by R/GA, Huge and MRM, are among the industry's most award-winning digital agencies. Our premier healthcare communications specialists reside within our three global brands, McCann, Draftfcb and Lowe.

•

Our domestic integrated independent agencies include some of advertising's most recognizable and storied agency brands, including Carmichael Lynch, Deutsch, Hill Holliday, The Martin Agency and Mullen.  The marketing programs created by these agencies incorporate all media channels, customer relationship management (CRM), public relations and other marketing activities and have helped build some of the most powerful brands in the U.S., across all sectors and industries.

We list approximately


of our companies on our website under the "Our Agencies" section, with descriptions, case studies, social media channels and office locations for each.

Market Strategy

We operate in a media landscape that continues to evolve at a rapid pace.  Media channels continue to fragment and clients face an increasingly complex consumer environment.  To stay ahead of these challenges and to achieve our objectives, we have made and continue to make investments in creative and strategic talent in fast-growth digital marketing channels, high-growth geographic regions and strategic world markets.  In addition, we consistently review opportunities within our company to enhance our operations through mergers and strategic alliances, as well as the development of internal programs that encourage intra-company collaboration.  As appropriate, we also develop relationships with technology and emerging media companies that are building leading-edge marketing tools that complement our agencies' skill sets and capabilities.

In recent years, we have taken several major strategic steps to position our agencies as leaders in the global advertising and communications market.  These include:

•

We re-organized our media operations under a single management structure, IPG Mediabrands, to reinvent how we plan, buy and measure media investment on behalf of our clients.  We aligned a spectrum of specialist media companies under this structure and we have invested in technology and analytics, including the launch of the IPG Media Lab in New York in 2011, a highly advanced resource for our clients.  In 2012, we launched a third global full-service media buying and planning agency, BPN, with a focus on new technologies and a pay-for-performance compensation. BPN currently has 36 offices in 28 countries and during 2014 plans to expand into several new markets to have operations that extend further across the world. Additionally, during 2013, IPG Mediabrands announced the formation of the MAGNA Consortium, designed to accelerate the adoption of integrated automated and programmatic media buying solutions for digital media channels. Founders include IPG Mediabrands, A+E Networks, AOL, Cablevision, Clear Channel Media and Entertainment, and Tribune, and since the announcement the group has expanded to also include ESPN.  Available inventory includes display, video, mobile, digital out-of-home, radio and TV. Since its launch in 2008, IPG Mediabrands has delivered industry-leading performance and growth and in 2014 was named

Mediapost's

"Media Holding Company of the Year."

•

We moved Lowe to a hub model, focused on a smaller and more strategic global footprint, and significantly revamped its management team in an effort to turn around its operating performance.  Once this approach began to yield positive results, we strengthened Lowe's capabilities in the key Brazil and U.K. markets through acquisitions. In the U.S., we recently aligned Lowe with Campbell Ewald to create a more powerful offering from which to service and source multinational clients. In early 2014, Lowe and Partners acquired Profero, a global digital network, which will operate as Lowe Profero, serving as the network's global digital offering.

•

We combined a global creative agency with our leading direct marketing agency to create Draftfcb, our modern global agency network that combines accountability with creativity under a single P&L.  Over the course of 2013, IPG appointed new global leadership at Draftfcb. The new team has raised the quality of creative work for the global network and is evolving its integrated model to drive growth. Draftfcb brings together the best of brand advertising and accountable communications disciplines, such as digital, CRM and activation to benefit clients. The network and its new leadership team will continue to enhance its offering. In addition, Draftfcb acquired Inferno, a premier creative agency, which will enable the network to better serve global clients.

•

At our marketing services division, Constituency Management Group (“CMG”), we continue to strengthen our market leading public relations and events marketing specialists.  In recent years, we developed significant social media practices


across CMG agencies and expanded our operations in Latin America, China and the Middle East. Our strong public relations offering led

The Holmes Report

to name Interpublic Group its “Holding Company of the Year” in 2013, the first time the award was given for this category.

•

McCann Worldgroup is well-positioned to deliver best-in-class integrated marketing communications solutions in all geographic regions for many of the world's largest and most sophisticated advertisers, including local, regional and multinational clients.  During 2013, we acquired specialty marketing agencies within McCann, extending its capabilities in strategically important disciplines.  McCann's renewed focus on its creative capabilities and reputation was rewarded with several account wins and industry recognition.  Notably, McCann produced the most-awarded digital work of 2013 and was named the most-awarded agency in the world by

The Gunn Report.

•

During the last several years we have invested in the domestic and international expansion of our digital brands R/GA, Huge, MRM and several of our agencies under the Mediabrands Audience Platform. We have opened new offices and expanded existing offices in high-growth markets as well as strategic world markets, and we expect to continue this strategic investment in future years.

Digital Growth

Demand for our digital marketing services continues to evolve rapidly.  In order to meet this need and provide high-value resources to clients, we have focused on embedding digital talent and technology throughout the organization.  This reflects our belief that digital marketing should not be treated as a stand-alone function, but should, instead, be integrated within all of our companies. This structure mirrors the way in which consumers incorporate digital media into their other media habits, and, ultimately, their day-to-day life.  We continue to invest in recruiting and developing digital expertise at all our agencies and in all marketing disciplines.

To meet the changing needs of the marketplace, we have acquired and incubated specialty digital assets, such as Reprise Media (search engine marketing), Huge (e-commerce solutions), Cadreon (audience management platform) and The IPG Media Lab, as well as making strategic investments in mobile marketing capabilities.  We have also continued to invest in existing assets such as R/GA, a digital agency and industry leader in the development of award-winning interactive campaigns for global clients, as well as MRM, a leading global digital agency.  These companies have unique capabilities and service their own client rosters while also serving as key digital partners to many of the agencies within IPG.

Fast-Growth Regions

We continue to invest and expand our presence in high-growth geographic regions.  In recent years, we have made significant investments in India and Brazil, further strengthening our leadership position in these high-growth, developing markets.  Recent transactions in India include the acquisition of Interactive Avenues, a digital media agency, the acquisition of End to End, a database marketing agency and the acquisition of Corporate Voice, a communications agency. Our operations in India continue to be best-in-class as we support our strong growth in the region with partnerships and talent investment. Recent transactions completed in Brazil include the acquisition of E/OU, a digital agency, and the acquisition of S2 Publicom, a leading public relations company.  We also hold a majority stake in the Middle East Communication Networks (“MCN”), among the region's premier marketing services companies.  MCN is headquartered in Dubai, with 65 offices across 14 countries. Our partner in Russia is a leader in that country.  In China, where we operate with all of our global networks and across the full spectrum of marketing services, we continue to invest organically in the talent of our agency brands.  Additional areas of investment include other key strategic markets in Asia Pacific, Latin America, Eastern Europe and Africa.

Acquisition Strategy

A disciplined acquisition strategy, focused on high-growth capabilities and regions of the world, is one component of growing our services in today's rapidly-changing marketing services and media landscape.  When an outstanding resource or a strong tactical fit becomes available, we have been opportunistic in making tuck-in, niche acquisitions that enhance our service offerings. We will continue to focus on digital and marketing services agencies throughout the world, and international growth markets.

In recent years, IPG has acquired agencies across the marketing spectrum, including firms specializing in digital, mobile marketing, social media, healthcare communications and public relations, as well as agencies with full-service capabilities. All of these acquired agencies have been integrated into one of our global networks or agencies.

Financial Objectives

Our financial goals include competitive organic revenue growth and operating margin expansion, which we expect will further strengthen our balance sheet and total liquidity and increase value to our shareholders.  Accordingly, we remain focused on meeting the evolving needs of our clients while concurrently managing our cost structure.  We continually seek greater efficiency in the delivery of our services, focusing on more effective resource utilization, including the productivity of our employees, real estate,


information technology and shared services, such as finance, human resources and legal.  The improvements we have made in our financial reporting and business information systems in recent years, and which continue, allow us more timely and actionable insights from our global operations.  Our disciplined approach to our balance sheet and liquidity provides us with a solid financial foundation and financial flexibility to manage our business.

We believe that our strategy and execution position us to meet our financial goals and to deliver long-term shareholder value.

Financial Reporting Segments

We have two reportable segments, which are Integrated Agency Networks (“IAN”) and CMG.  IAN is comprised of McCann, Draftfcb, Lowe, IPG Mediabrands, our digital specialist agencies and our domestic integrated agencies. CMG is comprised of a number of our specialist marketing services offerings. We also report results for the “Corporate and other” group.  See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

Principal Markets

Our agencies are located in over


countries, including every significant world market.  Our geographic revenue breakdown is listed below.

For further information regarding revenues and long-lived assets on a geographical basis for each of the last three years, see Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Sources of Revenue

Our revenues are primarily derived from the planning and execution of multi-channel advertising, marketing and communications programs around the world.  Our revenues are directly dependent upon the advertising, marketing and corporate communications requirements of our existing clients and our ability to win new clients.   Most of our client contracts are individually negotiated and, accordingly, the terms of client engagements and the bases on which we earn commissions and fees vary significantly.  As is customary in the industry, our contracts generally provide for termination by either party on relatively short notice, usually 90 days.

Revenues for the creation, planning and placement of advertising are determined primarily on a negotiated fee basis and, to a lesser extent, on a commission basis.  Fees are usually calculated to reflect hourly rates plus proportional overhead and a mark-up. Many clients include an incentive compensation component in their total compensation package.  This provides added revenue based on achieving mutually agreed-upon qualitative or quantitative metrics within specified time periods. Commissions are earned based on services provided and are usually derived from a percentage or fee over the total cost to complete the assignment. Commissions can also be derived when clients pay us the gross rate billed by media and we pay for media at a lower net rate; the difference is the commission that we earn, which we either retain in full or share with the client depending on the nature of the applicable services agreement.

We also generate revenue in negotiated fees from our public relations, sales promotion, event marketing, sports and entertainment marketing and corporate and brand identity services.

In most of our businesses, our agencies enter into commitments to pay production and media costs on behalf of clients.  To the extent possible, we pay production and media charges after we have received funds from our clients.  Generally, we act as the client’s agent rather than the primary obligor. In some instances we agree with the provider that we will only be liable to pay the production and media costs after the client has paid us for the charges.

Our revenue is typically lowest in the first quarter and highest in the fourth quarter.  This reflects the seasonal spending of our clients, incentives earned at year end on various contracts and project work completed that is typically recognized during the fourth quarter.  Fee revenue recognized on a completed contract basis also contributes to the higher seasonal revenues experienced in the fourth quarter because the majority of our contracts end at December 31.


See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our revenue recognition accounting policies.

Clients

Our large and diverse client base includes many of the most recognizable companies and brands throughout the world.  Our holding company structure allows us to maintain a diversified client base across and within a full range of industry sectors.  In the aggregate, our top ten clients based on revenue accounted for approximately

21%

of revenue in


and


.  Our largest client accounted for approximately

5%

of revenue for


and


.  Based on revenue for the year ended

December 31, 2013

, our five largest clients (in alphabetical order) were General Motors, Johnson & Johnson, L'Oréal, Microsoft and Unilever.  We represent several different brands or divisions of each of these clients in a number of geographic markets, as well as provide services across multiple advertising and marketing disciplines, in each case through more than one of our agency brands. Representation of a client rarely means that we handle advertising for all brands or product lines of the client in all geographical locations.  Any client may transfer its business from one of our agencies to another one of our agencies or to a competing agency, and a client may reduce its marketing budget at any time.

We operate in a highly competitive advertising and marketing communications industry.  Our operating companies compete against other large multinational advertising and marketing communications companies as well as numerous independent and niche agencies to win new clients and maintain existing client relationships.

Personnel

As of

December 31, 2013

, we employed approximately

45,400

people, of whom approximately

18,400

were employed in the United States.  Because of the service character of the advertising and marketing communications business, the quality of personnel is of crucial importance to our continuing success.  We conduct extensive employee training and development throughout our agencies, and benchmark our compensation programs against those of our industry for their competitiveness and effectiveness in recruitment and retention.  There is keen competition for qualified employees.

Item 1A.

Risk Factors

We are subject to a variety of possible risks that could adversely impact our revenues, results of operations or financial condition. Some of these risks relate to general economic and financial conditions, while others are more specific to us and the industry in which we operate.  The following factors set out potential risks we have identified that could adversely affect us.  The risks described below may not be the only risks we face.  Additional risks that we do not yet know of, or that we currently think are immaterial, could also have a negative impact on our business operations or financial condition. See also

Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Disclosure

.


•

We operate in a highly competitive industry.

The advertising and marketing communications business is highly competitive.  Our agencies and media services compete with other agencies, and with other providers of creative, marketing or media services, to maintain existing client relationships and to win new business. Our competitors include not only other large multinational advertising and marketing communications companies, but also smaller entities that operate in local or regional markets as well as new forms of market participants.

The client’s perception of the quality of our agencies’ creative work and its relationships with key personnel at the Company or our agencies are important factors that affect our competitive position. An agency’s ability to serve clients, particularly large international clients, on a broad geographic basis and across a range of services may also be important competitive considerations.  On the other hand, because an agency’s principal asset is its people, freedom of entry into the business is almost unlimited and a small agency is, on occasion, able to take all or some portion of a client’s account from a much larger competitor.

Many companies put their advertising and marketing communications business up for competitive review from time to time, and clients may choose to terminate their contracts on a relatively short timeframe. We have won and lost client accounts in the past as a result of such periodic competitions.  In the aggregate, our top ten clients based on revenue accounted for approximately

21%

of revenue in


.  A substantial decline in a large client’s advertising and marketing spending, or the loss of a significant part of its business, could have a material adverse effect upon our business and results of operations.

Our ability to attract new clients and to retain existing clients may also, in some cases, be limited by clients’ policies or perceptions about conflicts of interest.  These policies can, in some cases, prevent one agency, or even different agencies under our ownership, from performing similar services for competing products or companies.

•

Our results of operations are highly susceptible to decrease when economic conditions are unfavorable.

Economic conditions continue to vary across geographic regions, and areas of uncertainty about the prospects for continued improvements in the global economy or economic conditions in certain regions, and a degree of caution on the part of some marketers, continue to have an effect on the demand for advertising and marketing communication services.  The  industry can be affected more severely than other sectors by an economic downturn and can recover more slowly than the economy generally.  In the past, some clients have responded to weak economic and financial conditions by reducing their marketing budgets, which include discretionary components that are easier to reduce in the short term than other operating expenses. This pattern may recur in the future. Furthermore, unexpected revenue shortfalls can result in misalignments of costs and revenues, resulting in a negative impact to our operating margins. If our business is significantly adversely affected by unfavorable economic conditions, the negative impact on our revenue could pose a challenge to our operating income and cash generation from operations.

•

We may lose or fail to attract and retain key employees and management personnel.

Our employees, including creative, digital, research, media and account specialists, and their skills and relationships with clients, are among our most valuable assets.  An important aspect of our competitiveness is our ability to identify and develop the appropriate talent, and to attract and retain key employees and management personnel.  Our ability to do so is influenced by a variety of factors, including the compensation we award and other factors which may be beyond our control.  In addition, the advertising and marketing services industry is characterized by a high degree of employee mobility.  If we were to fail to attract key personnel or lose them to competitors or clients, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.

•

We may not be able to meet our performance targets and milestones.

From time to time, we communicate to the public certain targets and milestones for our financial and operating performance that are intended to provide metrics against which to evaluate our performance.  They should not be understood as predictions or guidance about our expected performance.  Our ability to meet any target or milestone is subject to inherent risks and uncertainties, and we caution investors against placing undue reliance on them.  See

Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Disclosure

.

•

Our financial condition could be adversely affected if our available liquidity is insufficient.

We maintain a $1 billion committed credit facility to increase our financial flexibility (the “Credit Agreement”).  If credit under the Credit Agreement were unavailable or insufficient, our liquidity could be adversely affected.  The Credit Agreement contains financial covenants, and events like a material economic downturn could adversely affect our ability to comply with them.  For example, compliance with the financial covenants would be more difficult to achieve if we were to experience substantially lower revenues, a substantial increase in client defaults or sizable asset impairment charges. If we were unable to comply with any of the financial covenants contained in the Credit Agreement, we could be required to seek an amendment or waiver from our lenders, and our costs under the Credit Agreement could increase.  If we were unable to obtain a necessary amendment or waiver, the Credit Agreement could be terminated, and any outstanding amounts could be subject to acceleration.  Furthermore, the Credit Agreement includes commitments from a syndicate of financial institutions, and if any of them were unable to perform and no other bank assumed that institution’s commitment, the availability of credit under that agreement would be correspondingly reduced.


In most of our businesses, our agencies enter into commitments to pay production and media costs on behalf of clients.  The amounts involved substantially exceed our revenues, and primarily affect the level of accounts receivable, expenditures billable to clients, accounts payable and accrued liabilities.  Although to the extent possible we pay production and media charges only after we have received funds from our clients, if clients are unable to pay for commitments we have entered into on their behalf there could be an adverse effect on our working capital, which would negatively impact our operating cash flow.

Furthermore, if our business or financial needs lead us to seek new or additional sources of liquidity, there can be no guarantee that we would be able to access any new sources of liquidity on commercially reasonable terms or at all.  For further discussion of our liquidity profile and outlook, see “Liquidity and Capital Resources” in Part II, Item 7,

•

International business risks could adversely affect our operations.

We are a global business.  Operations outside the United States represent a significant portion of our revenues, approximately

44%

in


.  These operations are exposed to risks that include local legislation, currency variation, exchange control restrictions, and difficult local political or economic conditions. We also must comply with applicable U.S., local and other international anti-corruption laws, which can be complex and stringent, in all jurisdictions where we operate. In developing countries or regions, we may face further risks, such as slower receipt of payments, nationalization, social and economic instability, currency repatriation restrictions and undeveloped or inconsistently enforced commercial laws.  These risks may limit our ability to grow our business and effectively manage our operations in those countries.

In addition, because a significant portion of our business is denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar, such as the Australian Dollar, Brazilian Real, Euro, Indian Rupee, Japanese Yen, Pound Sterling and South African Rand, fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. Dollar and such currencies may materially affect our financial results. Concerns persist in Europe in particular over the debt burdens of certain countries that use the Euro as their currency and the overall stability of the Euro. Possible consequences, such as the re-introduction of individual currencies in countries currently employing the Euro or the dissolution of the Euro as a common currency, or market perceptions and uncertainties about the possibility and impact of such events, could adversely affect the value of our Euro-denominated assets and results of operations.

•

If our clients experience financial distress, their weakened financial position could negatively affect our own financial position and results.

We have a large and diverse client base, and at any given time, one or more of our clients may experience financial difficulty, file for bankruptcy protection or go out of business. Unfavorable economic and financial conditions could result in an increase in client financial difficulties that affect us. The direct impact on us could include reduced revenues and write-offs of accounts receivable and expenditures billable to clients, and if these effects were severe, the indirect impact could include impairments of intangible assets, credit facility covenant violations and reduced liquidity.  For a description of our client base, see “Clients” in Item 1,

•

We are subject to industry regulations and other legal or reputational risks that could restrict our activities or negatively impact our performance or our financial condition.

Our industry is subject to government regulation and other governmental action, both domestic and foreign.  Advertisers and consumer groups may challenge advertising through legislation, regulation, judicial actions or otherwise, for example on the grounds that the advertising is false and deceptive or injurious to public welfare.  Our business is also subject to specific rules, prohibitions, media restrictions, labeling disclosures and warning requirements applicable to advertising for certain products.  Existing and proposed laws and regulations, in particular in the European Union and the United States, concerning user privacy, use of personal information and on-line tracking technologies could affect the efficacy and profitability of internet-based and digital marketing.  Legislators, agencies and other governmental units may also continue to initiate proposals to ban the advertising of specific products, such as alcohol or tobacco, and to impose taxes on or deny deductions for advertising, which, if successful, may hinder our ability to accomplish our clients’ goals and have an adverse effect on advertising expenditures and, consequently, on our revenues.  Furthermore, we could suffer reputational risk as a result of governmental or legal action or from undertaking work that may be challenged by consumer groups or considered controversial.

•

We face risks associated with our acquisitions and other investments.

We regularly undertake acquisitions and other investments that we believe will enhance our service offerings to our clients.  These transactions can involve significant challenges and risks, including that the transaction does not advance our business strategy or fails to produce a satisfactory return on our investment.  While our evaluation of any potential acquisition includes business, legal and financial due diligence with the goal of identifying and evaluating the material risks involved, we may be unsuccessful in ascertaining or evaluating all such risks.  Though we typically structure our acquisitions to provide for future contingent purchase


payments that are based on the future performance of the acquired entity, our forecasts of the investment’s future performance also factor into the initial consideration.  When actual financial results differ, our returns on the investment could be adversely affected.

We may also experience difficulty integrating new employees, businesses, assets or systems into our organization, including with respect to our internal policies and required controls.  We may face reputational and legal risks in situations where we have a significant minority investment but limited control over the investment's operations.  Furthermore, it may take longer than anticipated to realize the expected benefits from these transactions, or those benefits may ultimately be smaller than anticipated or may not be realized at all.  Talent is among our most valuable assets, and we also may not realize the intended benefits of a transaction if we fail to retain targeted personnel.  Acquisition and integration activity may also divert management’s attention and other corporate resources from other business needs.  If we fail to realize the intended advantages of any given investment or acquisition, or if we do not identify or correctly measure the associated risks and liabilities, our results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected.

•

We rely extensively on information technology systems.

We rely extensively and increasingly on information technologies and infrastructure to manage our business, including digital storage of marketing strategies and client information, developing new business opportunities and processing business transactions. We operate in many respects on a decentralized basis, with a large number of agencies and legal entities, and the resulting size, diversity and disparity of our technology systems and complications in implementing standardized technologies and procedures could increase the potential vulnerability of our systems to breakdown, malicious intrusion or random attack.  Likewise, data privacy breaches, as well as improper use of social media, by employees and others may pose a risk that sensitive data could be exposed to third parties or to the public generally.  Any such breakdowns or breaches in our systems or data-protection policies could adversely affect our reputation or business.

•

Our earnings would be adversely affected if we were required to recognize asset impairment charges or increase our deferred tax valuation allowances.

We evaluate all of our long-lived assets (including goodwill, other intangible assets and fixed assets), investments and deferred tax assets for possible impairment or realizability annually or whenever there is an indication that they are impaired or not realizable. If certain criteria are met, we are required to record an impairment charge or valuation allowance.

As of

December 31, 2013

, we have substantial amounts of long-lived assets, deferred tax assets and investments on our Consolidated Balance Sheet, including approximately

$3.6 billion

of goodwill.  Future events, including our financial performance, market valuation of us or market multiples of comparable companies, loss of a significant client’s business or strategic decisions, could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that the asset values associated with long-lived assets, deferred tax assets and investments may have become impaired.  For further discussion of goodwill and other intangible assets, and our sensitivity analysis of our valuation of these assets, see “Critical Accounting Estimates” in Part II, Item 7,

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

.  Any significant impairment loss would have an adverse impact on our reported earnings in the period in which the charge is recognized.

•

Downgrades of our credit ratings could adversely affect us.

We can be adversely affected if our credit ratings are downgraded or if they are significantly weaker than those of our competitors, because ratings are an important factor influencing our ability to access capital and the terms of any new indebtedness, including covenants and interest rates. Our clients and vendors may also consider our credit profile when negotiating contract terms, and if they were to change the terms on which they deal with us, it could have an adverse effect on our liquidity.

Item 2.

Properties

Substantially all of our office space is leased from third parties.  Certain leases are subject to rent reviews or contain escalation clauses, and certain of our leases require the payment of various operating expenses, which may also be subject to escalation. Physical properties include leasehold improvements, furniture, fixtures and equipment located in our offices.  We believe that facilities leased or owned by us are adequate for the purposes for which they are currently used and are well maintained.  See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our lease commitments.


Item 3.

Legal Proceedings

We are involved in various legal proceedings, and subject to investigations, inspections, audits, inquiries and similar actions by governmental authorities, arising in the normal course of our business. The types of allegations that arise in connection with such legal proceedings vary in nature, but can include claims related to contract, employment, tax and intellectual property matters.  While any outcome related to litigation or such governmental proceedings in which we are involved cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe that the outcome of these matters, individually and in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

Repurchase of Equity Securities

The following table provides information regarding our purchases of our equity securities during the period from October 1, 2013 to

December 31, 2013

.


Includes shares of our common stock, par value $0.10 per share, withheld under the terms of grants under employee stock-based compensation plans to offset tax withholding obligations that occurred upon vesting and release of restricted shares (the "Withheld Shares").  We repurchased 1,067 Withheld shares in October 2013.  No Withheld Shares were purchased in November or December of 2013.


The average price per share for each of the months in the fiscal quarter and for the three-month period was calculated by dividing the sum of the applicable period of the aggregate value of the tax withholding obligations and the aggregate amount we paid for shares acquired under our stock repurchase program, described in Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, by the sum of the number of Withheld Shares and the number of shares acquired in our stock repurchase program.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

The following Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) is intended to help you understand The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc. and its subsidiaries (“IPG,” “we,” “us” or “our”). MD&A should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes included in this report.  Our MD&A includes the following sections:

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY provides a discussion about our strategic outlook, factors influencing our business and an overview of our results of operations and liquidity.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS provides an analysis of the consolidated and segment results of operations for

or that have not yet been required to be implemented and may be applicable to our future operations.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

During


, our organic revenue increase was primarily driven by growth in our domestic market, which was a result of net new business with clients won during the year and growth with existing clients.  Our international organic increase was primarily in the Asia Pacific and Latin America regions, across our marketing disciplines. The Continental Europe region weighed on our international growth, mainly due to a challenging economic climate. Across most regional markets, we continued to have strong growth in demand for our digital, media and marketing services. Increased operating expenses reflected investments made in our agencies to support our new business portfolio and growing disciplines, as well as to service our existing clients. We incurred expenses for restructuring in order to better align our cost structure with our revenue, primarily in Continental Europe.

With challenging economic conditions in many markets around the world, particularly in Europe, marketers continue to show a degree of caution in their marketing investment.  We continue to derive substantial benefit from our diversified client base, our global footprint and the broad range and strength of our professional offerings. We continued to enhance our businesses during 2013 by making investments in creative and strategic talent that emphasize our growth priorities: fast-growth digital marketing channels, high-growth geographic regions and strategic world markets. We believe our continued investment in tools, technology and process improvements will create efficiencies in the delivery of our services.

We continued to enhance value to our shareholders through common stock dividends, share repurchases and improvements in our balance sheet. During 2013, average diluted shares decreased by

11%

primarily due to share repurchases.  Basic earnings per share available to IPG common stockholders for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 were

$0.62

, $1.01 and $1.12 per share, respectively. Diluted earnings per share for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 were

$0.61

, $0.94 and $0.99 per share, respectively. Basic and diluted earnings per share for the

year ended December 31,


included a negative impact of

$0.12

and

$0.11

per share, respectively, from the effects of restructuring and related costs, net of tax.   Basic and diluted earnings per share for the

year ended December 31,


included a negative impact of

$0.06

per share from a loss on early extinguishment of debt, net of tax.  Basic and diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2012 included $0.14 and $0.12 per share, respectively, from the gain recorded for the sale of our remaining holdings in Facebook, net of tax.  Basic and diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31,


included $0.27 and $0.23 per share, respectively, from the gain recorded for the sale of approximately half of our holdings in Facebook, net of tax.



Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - (continued)

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)

The following tables present a summary of financial performance for the year ended

December 31, 2013

, as compared with the same periods in


and


.

When we analyze period-to-period changes in our operating performance we determine the portion of the change that is attributable to changes in foreign currency rates and the net effect of acquisitions and divestitures, and the remainder we call organic change, which indicates how our underlying business performed.  The performance metrics that we use to evaluate our results include the organic change in revenue, salaries and related expenses and office and general expenses, and the components of operating expenses, expressed as a percentage of total consolidated revenue. Additionally, in certain of our discussions we analyze revenue by business sector, where we focus on our top 100 clients, which typically constitutes approximately 55% to 60% of our annual consolidated revenues. We also analyze revenue by geographic region.

The change in our operating performance attributable to changes in foreign currency rates is determined by converting the prior-period reported results using the current-period exchange rates and comparing these prior-period adjusted amounts to the prior-period reported results.  Although the U.S. Dollar is our reporting currency, a substantial portion of our revenues and expenses are generated in foreign currencies.  Therefore, our reported results are affected by fluctuations in the currencies in which we conduct our international businesses.  We do not use derivative financial instruments to manage this translation risk.  Our exposure is mitigated as the majority of our revenues and expenses in any given market are generally denominated in the same currency.  Both positive and negative currency fluctuations against the U.S. Dollar affect our consolidated results of operations, and the magnitude of the foreign currency impact on us related to each geographic region depends on the significance and operating performance of the region.  The primary foreign currencies that impacted our results during


include the Australian Dollar, Brazilian Real, Euro, Japanese Yen and the South African Rand.  During


, the U.S. Dollar was stronger relative to several foreign currencies in regions where we primarily conduct our business as compared to the prior-year period, which had a net negative impact on our


consolidated results of operations.  For


, foreign currency fluctuations resulted in net decreases of approximately 1% in revenues and operating expenses, which had a minimal impact on our operating margin percentage.  For


, foreign currency fluctuations resulted in net decreases of approximately 2% in revenues and operating expenses, which had no net impact on our operating margin percentage.

For purposes of analyzing changes in our operating performance attributable to the net effect of acquisitions and divestitures, transactions are treated as if they occurred on the first day of the quarter during which the transaction occurred.  During the past few years we have acquired companies that we believe will enhance our offerings and disposed of businesses that are not consistent with our strategic plan.  For


and


, the net effect of acquisitions and divestitures increased revenue and operating expenses

compared to the prior-year period. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our acquisitions.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Consolidated Results of Operations

REVENUE

Our revenue is directly impacted by our ability to win new clients and the retention and spending levels of existing clients.  Most of our expenses are recognized ratably throughout the year and are therefore less seasonal than revenue.  Our revenue is typically lowest in the first quarter and highest in the fourth quarter.  This reflects the seasonal spending of our clients, incentives earned at year end on various contracts and project work completed that is typically recognized during the fourth quarter.  In the events marketing business, revenues can fluctuate due to the timing of completed projects, as revenue is typically recognized when the project is complete.  We generally act as principal for these projects and accordingly record the gross amount billed to the client as revenue and the related costs incurred as pass-through costs in office and general expenses.

During


, our revenue increased by

$166.1

, or

2.4%

, compared to


, due to an organic revenue increase of

$196.2

, or

2.8%

, and the effect of net acquisitions of

$50.3

, partially offset by an adverse foreign currency rate impact of

$80.4

. We had growth in the domestic market, with our organic revenue increase primarily attributable to net client wins, most notably in the auto and transportation sector, and net higher spending from existing clients, primarily in the healthcare sector, partially offset by decreases in the technology and telecom sector.  In addition, our organic revenue increase in the domestic market was mainly driven by our events marketing and public relations businesses.  In our international market, the organic revenue increase was primarily in the Asia Pacific region, led by Australia and China, and in the Latin America region, primarily in Brazil. Also contributing to our international organic revenue increase was net higher spending from existing clients throughout nearly all client sectors, most notably in the technology and telecom and healthcare sectors. The international organic revenue increase was partially offset by a decline in the Continental Europe region, across most countries in the market, due to a continued challenging economic climate.

During


, our revenue decreased by

$58.4

. Our organic revenue increase was primarily attributable to new client wins and net higher spending from existing clients in our international markets.  We had strong growth in the Asia Pacific region, primarily in Australia, Singapore, India and China, and in the Latin America region, predominantly in Brazil.  Also contributing to our international organic revenue increase was an

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)

increase in the United Kingdom, predominately due to our events marketing business, which benefited from work performed in connection with the London Olympics in the third quarter of 2012.  The organic revenue increase in our international markets was throughout nearly all client sectors, most notably in the retail and technology and telecom sectors, partially offset by a decrease in the consumer goods sector due to net client losses in the prior year.  Our revenue decreased in the Continental Europe region, primarily in Spain and Italy, due to a continued challenging economic climate. This was partially offset by growth in Germany.  In our domestic market, our organic revenue decrease was due to net client losses in the prior year, most notably in the consumer goods and technology and telecom sectors, and a decline in spending from existing clients, primarily in the retail and health care sectors.  Partially offsetting this decline in the domestic market was an organic revenue increase in the auto and transportation and financial services sectors.

Refer to the segment discussion later in this MD&A for information on changes in revenue by segment.

OPERATING EXPENSES

Salaries and Related Expenses

Salaries and related expenses consist of payroll costs, employee performance incentives, including annual bonus and long-term incentive awards, costs for temporary workers, severance and other benefits associated with client service professional staff and administrative staff.  Salaries and related expenses do not vary significantly with short-term changes in revenue levels.  However, salaries may fluctuate due to the timing of the hiring of personnel to support revenue growth and changes in the performance levels and types of employee incentive awards.  Additionally, we may take severance actions in areas where we have or anticipate decreases in operating performance or to enhance our teams or leadership.  Changes in our incentive awards mix can impact future-period expense, as annual bonus awards are expensed during the year they are earned and long-term incentive awards are expensed over the performance period, generally three years.  Factors impacting long-term incentive awards are the actual number of awards vesting, the change in our stock price, actual results, and changes to our projected results, which could impact the achievement of certain performance targets.

The organic increase was primarily attributable to an increase in base salaries, benefits and temporary help of $150.1, primarily due to increases in our workforce in international markets, predominantly in the Asia Pacific and Latin America regions, as well as in our domestic market at businesses where we had revenue growth or new business wins, and to a lesser extent,  modest wage increases.

The organic increase was primarily due to an increase in base salaries, benefits and temporary help of $96.4, primarily attributable to increases in our workforce in international regions, most notably in the Asia Pacific and Latin America regions, and businesses where we had revenue growth, as well as modest wage increases. Our workforce decreased in regions and businesses where we had revenue declines as we were disciplined in managing our workforce.



Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - (continued)

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)

Partially offsetting this organic increase was a reduction in incentive award expense of $51.1, resulting from lower financial performance compared to targets.

The following table details our staff cost ratio.

Office and General Expenses

Office and general expenses primarily include rent expense, professional fees, certain expenses incurred by our staff in servicing our clients and depreciation and amortization costs. Office and general expenses also include costs directly attributable to client engagements, including production costs, out-of-pocket costs such as travel for client service staff, and other direct costs that are rebilled to our clients. Production expenses can vary significantly between periods depending upon the timing of completion of certain projects where we act as principal, which could impact trends between various periods in the future.

The organic increase was primarily attributable to an increase in occupancy costs and higher production expenses in our domestic market related to pass-through costs, which are also reflected in revenue, for certain projects where we acted as principal that increased in size or were new during 2013, partially offset by certain adjustments to contingent acquisition obligations.

Restructuring and Other Reorganization-Related Charges (Reversals), net

The components of the restructuring and other reorganization-related charges, net for 2013 and prior restructuring plans are listed below.

In the fourth quarter of 2013, we implemented a cost savings initiative (the “2013 Plan”) to better align our cost structure with our revenue, primarily in Continental Europe. In connection with this initiative, we recorded pre-tax restructuring charges of

$61.2

comprised of severance and termination costs of

$55.9

, lease terminations costs of

$4.8

, and other exit costs of

$0.5

. All restructuring actions were identified and initiated by the end of 2013, with all actions expected to be substantially completed by the end of the first quarter of 2014.

The following table presents the 2013 Plan restructuring and other reorganization-related charges, net, and employee headcount reduction for the year ended December 31, 2013.

The 2013 Plan includes a planned reduction in workforce of 541 employees across all levels and functions and costs associated with offices that were vacated. We expect these initiatives to generate an estimated annual pre-tax savings of approximately $40 in 2014.

Net restructuring and other reorganization-related (reversals) charges related to the 2007, 2003 and 2001 restructuring plans  for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 were

EXPENSES AND OTHER INCOME

Net Interest Expense

For


, net interest expense decreased by

$6.0

as compared to


, primarily due to a decrease in cash interest on debt obligations.  Cash interest expense decreased primarily due to the retirement of our

4.75%

Convertible Senior Notes due


(the "

4.75%

Notes") in the first quarter of 2013 and redemption of our

10.00%

Senior Unsecured Notes due


(the "

10.00%

Notes") in July 2013, which were refinanced with debt issued at lower rates in 2012. Non-cash interest expense increased primarily as a result of the retirement of our

4.75%

Notes and our

4.25%

Convertible Senior Notes due


(the "

4.25%

Notes") in the first quarter of 2013 and first quarter of 2012, respectively. At retirement, the premiums associated with these Notes, which had reduced interest expense in prior periods, were fully amortized.



Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - (continued)

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)

For


, net interest expense increased by

$5.0

as compared to


, primarily due to an increase in non-cash interest expense.  Non-cash interest expense increased since the premium associated with our

4.25%

Notes, which we retired in March 2012, which had reduced interest expense in prior periods, was fully amortized.  Cash interest expense decreased primarily due to the retirement of our 4.25% Notes, which was offset by lower interest income, primarily in the United States due to lower cash balances.

Other (Expense) Income, net

Results of operations include certain items that are not directly associated with our revenue-producing operations.

Loss on Early Extinguishment of Debt

– During 2013, we recorded a charge of

$45.2

related to the redemption of our

10.00%

Notes. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

Sales of Businesses and Investments

– During


, we recognized gains from the sale of marketable securities in the Asia Pacific region within our IAN segment and the sale of investments in our Rabbi Trusts, which was partially offset by a loss from the sale of a business in the United Kingdom within our IAN segment. During 2012, we recognized gains from the sale of our remaining holdings in Facebook and a business in an international market within our CMG segment, which were partially offset by losses from the sale of businesses within our IAN segment, as well as an adjustment relating to a reserve for a change in estimate in connection with a business disposed of in a prior year.  During 2011, we recognized a gain from the sale of approximately half of our holdings in Facebook, which was partially offset by a loss relating to the sale of a business in the domestic market within our IAN segment.

Vendor Discounts and Credit Adjustments

– In connection with the liabilities related to vendor discounts and credits established as part of the restatement we presented in our 2004 Annual Report on Form 10-K, these adjustments reflect the reversal of certain of these liabilities primarily where the statute of limitations has lapsed, or as a result of differences resulting from settlements with clients or vendors.

Other Income (Expense), net

– During


, other income (expense), net primarily included a non-cash gain on re-measurement to fair value of an equity interest in an affiliate, located in the Asia Pacific region within our CMG segment, upon acquiring a controlling interest.

INCOME TAXES

Our tax rates are affected by many factors, including our worldwide earnings from various countries, changes in legislation and tax characteristics of our income.  In


, our effective income tax rate of

38.7%

was positively impacted by the recognition

of losses attributable to worthless securities in a consolidated subsidiary and the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits as a result of the settlement of the 2002-2006 New York State audit cycle. Our effective income tax rate was negatively impacted primarily by losses in certain foreign jurisdictions where we receive no tax benefit due to

100%

valuation allowances.

In


, our effective income tax rate of

31.6%

was positively impacted by the reversals of valuation allowances associated with the Asia Pacific and Continental Europe regions, of

$26.2

and

$21.8

, respectively, as well as by a benefit derived from the deduction of foreign tax credits that previously had a full valuation allowance.  Our effective income tax rate was negatively impacted by an adjustment of

$19.5

associated with the establishment of a previously unrecorded reserve for a tax contingency for the years 2007 through 2010, losses in certain foreign locations where we receive no tax benefit due to 100% valuation allowances and state and local income taxes, net of federal income tax benefit.



Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - (continued)

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)

In


, our effective income tax rate of

25.8%

was positively impacted primarily from the utilization of capital losses to offset nearly all of the

$132.2

capital gain realized from the Facebook transaction.  The capital gain enabled us to use capital loss carryforwards, on which a 100% valuation allowance had been previously established, and capital losses attributable to worthless securities in a consolidated subsidiary.  Additionally, the effective income tax rate was positively impacted by the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits as a result of the effective settlement of the 2007-2008 IRS audit cycle, a lower effective income tax rate on non-U.S. operations and the net reversal of valuation allowances, primarily in Europe. The effective income tax rate was negatively impacted by state and local taxes and losses in certain foreign locations where we receive no tax benefit due to 100% valuation allowances. The settlement of the 2007-2008 audit cycle resulted in no cash payment.

Segment Results of Operations

As discussed in Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, we have two reportable segments as of

December 31, 2013

: IAN and CMG. We also report results for the "Corporate and other" group.

IAN

REVENUE

During


, IAN revenue increased by

$67.1

compared to


, due to an organic revenue increase of

$99.9

and the effect of net acquisitions of

$40.4

, partially offset by an adverse foreign currency rate impact of

$73.2

.  The organic revenue increase in our domestic market was primarily attributable to net client wins, most notably in the auto and transportation sector, and net higher spending from existing clients, primarily in the healthcare sector, partially offset by decreases in the technology and telecom and retail sectors. In our international markets, the organic revenue increase was primarily due to net higher spending from existing clients across most client sectors, primarily in the Asia Pacific region, led by Australia, and in the Latin America region, primarily in Brazil. The international organic revenue increase was partially offset by a decline in the Continental Europe region across most countries in the market.

During


, IAN revenue decreased by

$163.3

compared to


, due to an adverse foreign currency rate impact of

$138.7

and an organic revenue decrease of

$44.4

, partially offset by the effect of net acquisitions of

$19.8

. The organic revenue decrease



Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - (continued)

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)

was attributable to a decline in our domestic market due to net client losses in the prior year, most notably in the consumer goods and technology and telecom sectors, and a decline in spending from existing clients, primarily in the health care and retail sectors. Partially offsetting this decline in the domestic market were increases in the auto and transportation and financial services sectors. In our international markets, our organic revenue increase was primarily attributable to net client wins and net higher spending from existing clients throughout nearly all client sectors, most notably in the Asia Pacific region, primarily in Australia and India, and in the Latin America region, predominantly in Brazil. The sectors primarily contributing to the international organic revenue increase were the retail and technology and telecom sectors, which was partially offset by a decrease in the consumer goods sector. The international organic revenue increase was partially offset by an organic revenue decrease in the Continental Europe region, primarily due to a continued challenging economic climate.

SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME


Segment operating income and operating margin exclude approximately

$56

of restructuring and other reorganization-related charges. See "Restructuring and Other Reorganization-Related Charges (Reversals), net" in

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

and Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

Operating income decreased during


when compared to


due to an increase in salaries and related expenses of

$109.5

,  partially offset by an increase in revenue of

$67.1

and a decrease in office and general expenses of

$4.3

. The increase in salaries and related expenses was primarily due to an increase in base salaries, benefits and temporary help, primarily attributable to an increase in our workforce in certain businesses where we had revenue growth or new business wins during 2013. The decrease in office and general expenses was primarily attributable to lower production expenses related to pass-through costs for certain projects where we acted as principal that decreased in size or did not occur during


, certain adjustments to contingent acquisition obligations and lower discretionary spending, partially offset by an increase in occupancy costs.

Operating income decreased during


when compared to


due to a decrease in revenue of

$163.3

, partially offset by decreases in salaries and related expenses of $69.9 and office and general expenses of $64.8.  The decrease in salaries and related expenses was primarily due to a reduction in incentive award expense resulting from lower financial performance compared to targets and, to a lesser extent, lower severance expense. The decrease in office and general expenses was primarily attributable to lower production expenses related to pass-through costs for certain projects where we acted as principal that decreased in size or did not occur during


, lower occupancy costs and, to a lesser extent, lower professional fees.

CMG

REVENUE

During


, CMG revenue increased by

$99.0

compared to


, primarily due to an organic revenue increase of

$96.3

.  We had growth in the domestic market, with our organic revenue increase primarily due to net client wins and net higher spending from existing clients across all disciplines, most notably in our events marketing and public relations businesses. The international organic revenue increase occurred primarily in our public relations business and was predominantly in the Latin America region, mostly notably in Brazil, and in the Asia Pacific region, primarily in China. Mostly offsetting the international organic revenue increase was an organic revenue decrease in the United Kingdom, due to a decrease in our events marketing business which in the prior-year included work performed for the London Olympics, and in the Continental Europe region due to a continued challenging economic climate.



Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - (continued)

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)

During


, CMG revenue increased by

$104.9

compared to


, due principally to an organic revenue increase of

$91.8

. The organic revenue increase was primarily due to net client wins and net higher spending from existing clients across all disciplines, primarily in our events marketing and public relations businesses.  The international organic revenue increase occurred throughout nearly all regions, primarily in the Asia Pacific region, most notably in Australia, Singapore and China, and in the United Kingdom, where our events marketing business benefited from work performed for the London Olympics in the third quarter of 2012.  Revenues in the events marketing business can fluctuate due to timing of completed projects where we act as principal, as revenue is typically recognized when the project is complete.  The domestic organic revenue increase was primarily due to growth in our public relations and sports marketing businesses.

.

CORPORATE AND OTHER

Certain corporate and other charges are reported as a separate line item within total segment operating income and include corporate office expenses, as well as shared service center and certain other centrally managed expenses that are not fully allocated to operating divisions.  Salaries and related expenses include salaries, long-term incentives, annual bonuses and other miscellaneous benefits for corporate office employees.  Office and general expenses primarily include professional fees related to internal control compliance, financial statement audits and legal, information technology and other consulting services that are engaged and managed through the corporate office.  In addition, office and general expenses also include rental expense and depreciation of leasehold improvements for properties occupied by corporate office employees.  A portion of centrally managed expenses are allocated to operating divisions based on a formula that uses the planned revenues of each of the operating units.  Amounts allocated also include specific charges for information technology-related projects, which are allocated based on utilization.

Corporate and other expenses increased during


by

$3.5

to

$140.8

compared to


, primarily due to an increase in  salaries and related expenses, mainly attributable to higher base salaries, benefits and temporary help, partially offset by lower severance expenses and a decrease in office and general expenses.

Corporate and other expenses decreased slightly during


by

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

CASH FLOW OVERVIEW

The following tables summarize key financial data relating to our liquidity, capital resources and uses of capital.


Reflects net income adjusted primarily for depreciation and amortization of fixed assets and intangible assets, amortization of restricted stock and other non-cash compensation, non-cash loss related to early extinguishment of debt, and deferred income taxes.


Reflects changes in accounts receivable, expenditures billable to clients, other current assets, accounts payable and accrued liabilities.

Operating Activities

Net cash provided by operating activities during


was

$592.9

, which was an increase of

$235.7

as compared to


, primarily as a result of an improvement in working capital usage of

$283.6

, offset by a decrease in net income.  Due to the seasonality of our business, we typically generate cash from working capital in the second half of a year and use cash from working capital in the first half of a year, with the largest impacts in the first and fourth quarters. The improvement in working capital in


was impacted by our media businesses and an ongoing focus on working capital management at our agencies.

Net cash provided by operating activities during


was

$357.2

, which was an increase of

$83.7

as compared to 2011, primarily as a result of a decrease in working capital usage of

$66.2

. The net working capital usage in


was primarily impacted by our media businesses.

The timing of media buying on behalf of our clients affects our working capital and operating cash flow.  In most of our businesses, our agencies enter into commitments to pay production and media costs on behalf of clients.  To the extent possible we pay production and media charges after we have received funds from our clients.  The amounts involved substantially exceed our revenues, and primarily affect the level of accounts receivable, expenditures billable to clients, accounts payable and accrued liabilities.  Our assets include both cash received and accounts receivable from clients for these pass-through arrangements, while our liabilities include amounts owed on behalf of clients to media and production suppliers.

Our accrued liabilities are also affected by the timing of certain other payments.  For example, while annual cash incentive awards are accrued throughout the year, they are generally paid during the first quarter of the subsequent year.

Investing Activities

Net cash used in investing activities during


primarily relates to payments for capital expenditures and acquisitions. Capital expenditures of

$173.0

relate primarily to computer hardware and software and leasehold improvements. We made payments of

$61.5

related to acquisitions completed during


.

Net cash used in investing activities during


primarily related to payments for capital expenditures and acquisitions, partially offset by the net proceeds of

$94.8

received from the sale of our remaining holdings in Facebook.  Capital expenditures of

$169.2

primarily related to computer hardware and software, and leasehold improvements. Capital expenditures increased in


compared to the prior year, primarily due to an increase in leasehold improvements made during the year. Payments for acquisitions of

$145.5

primarily related to payments for new acquisitions.

Financing Activities

Net cash used in financing activities during


primarily related to the purchase of long-term debt, the repurchase of our common stock, and payment of dividends. We redeemed all $600.0 in aggregate principal amount of our

10.00%

Notes. In addition, we repurchased

31.8

shares of our common stock for an aggregate cost of

$481.8

, including fees, and made dividend payments of

$126.0

on our common stock.



Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - (continued)

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)

Net cash provided by financing activities during


primarily reflected net proceeds from our debt transactions. We issued

$300.0

in aggregate principal amount of

2.25%

Senior Notes due 2017 (the "2.25% Notes"),

$500.0

in aggregate principal amount of

3.75%

Senior Notes due 2023 (the "3.75% Notes") and

$250.0

in aggregate principal amount of

4.00%

Senior Notes due


(the "

4.00%

Notes").  The proceeds from the issuance of the

4.00%

Notes were applied towards the repurchase and redemption of

$399.6

in aggregate principal amount of our

4.25%

Notes. Offsetting the net proceeds from our debt transactions was the repurchase of

32.7

shares of our common stock for an aggregate cost of

$350.5

, including fees, and dividend payments of

$103.4

on our common stock.

Foreign Exchange Rate Changes

The effect of foreign exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows resulted in a decrease of

$94.1

in


. The decrease was primarily a result of the U.S. Dollar being stronger than several foreign currencies, including the Australian Dollar, Brazilian Real, Japanese Yen, Canadian Dollar and South African Rand as of

December 31, 2013

compared to

December 31, 2012

.

The effect of foreign exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows resulted in a decrease of

$6.2

in


.  The decrease was a result of the U.S. Dollar being stronger than several foreign currencies, including the Brazilian Real and South African Rand, offset by the U.S. Dollar being weaker than other foreign currencies, including the Australian Dollar, British Pound and the Euro, as of as of

December 31, 2012

compared to

December 31, 2011

.

LIQUIDITY OUTLOOK

We expect our cash flow from operations, cash and cash equivalents to be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating requirements at a minimum for the next twelve months.  We also have a committed corporate credit facility as well as uncommitted facilities available to support our operating needs.  We continue to maintain a disciplined approach to managing liquidity, with flexibility over significant uses of cash, including our capital expenditures, cash used for new acquisitions, our common stock repurchase program and our common stock dividends.

From time to time, we evaluate market conditions and financing alternatives for opportunities to raise additional funds or otherwise improve our liquidity profile, enhance our financial flexibility and manage market risk.  Our ability to access the capital markets depends on a number of factors, which include those specific to us, such as our credit rating, and those related to the financial markets, such as the amount or terms of available credit.  There can be no guarantee that we would be able to access new sources of liquidity on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.

Funding Requirements

Our most significant funding requirements include: our operations, non-cancelable operating lease obligations, capital expenditures, acquisitions, common stock dividends, taxes, debt service, restructuring, and contributions to pension and postretirement plans.  Additionally, we may be required to make payments to minority shareholders in certain subsidiaries if they exercise their options to sell us their equity interests.

Notable funding requirements include:

•

Debt service –  Our $350.0 in aggregate principal amount of the 6.25% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2014 mature on November 15, 2014. The remainder of our debt is primarily long-term, with maturities scheduled through 2023.  See the table below for the maturity schedule of our long-term debt.

•

Acquisitions –  We paid cash of $60.6, which was net of cash acquired of $7.1, for acquisitions completed in


. We also paid cash of $30.5 related to acquisitions made in prior years. In addition to potential cash expenditures for new



Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - (continued)

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)

acquisitions, we expect to pay approximately $10.0 in


related to prior-year acquisitions. We may also be required to pay approximately $21.0 in


related to put options held by minority shareholders if exercised.  We will continue to evaluate strategic opportunities to grow and continue to strengthen our position, particularly in our digital and marketing services offerings, and to expand our presence in high-growth and key strategic world markets.

•

Dividends – During


, we paid cash dividends of $0.30 per share on our common stock, which corresponded to an aggregate dividend payment of

$126.0

. On

February 14, 2014

, we announced that our Board of Directors (the "Board") had declared a common stock cash dividend of

$0.095

per share, payable on

March 17, 2014

to holders of record as of the close of business on

March 3, 2014

. Assuming a quarterly dividend of

$0.095

per share and no significant change in the number of outstanding shares as of

December 31, 2013

, we expect to pay approximately

$161.0

in


. On October 17, 2013, we converted all of our Series B Cumulative Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock and we will no longer be required to pay annual preferred stock dividends of $11.6. Assuming we continue to pay common stock dividends at our current rate, our common stock dividends over the next twelve months would include $6.6 related to the common shares issued as a result of the conversion.

•

Restructuring – We paid cash of approximately $11 in connection with restructuring actions we have taken through December 31, 2013. We expect to make cash payments of approximately $45, in 2014, with remaining cash payments to be made through 2017.

•

Contributions to pension plans – Our funding policy regarding our pension plans is to make contributions necessary to satisfy minimum pension funding requirements, plus such additional contributions as we consider appropriate to improve the plans’ funded status.  During


, we contributed

$0.5

and

$18.3

of cash to our domestic and foreign pension plans, respectively.  For


, we expect to contribute approximately

$3.0

and

$25.0

of cash to our domestic and foreign pension plans, respectively.

The following summarizes our estimated contractual cash obligations and commitments as of

December 31, 2013

and their effect on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods.


Amounts represent maturity at par and interest payments based on contractual obligations.  We may redeem all or some of the

2.25%

Notes, the

3.75%

Notes and the

4.00%

Notes at the greater of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed and a "make-whole" amount, plus, in either case, accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption. The interest payments on long-term debt noted above are expected to decrease as a result of the maturity of certain notes in 2014.


Non-cancelable operating lease obligations are presented net of future receipts on contractual sublease arrangements.


We have structured certain acquisitions with additional contingent purchase price obligations based on the future performance of the acquired entity.  See Note 5 and Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.


The amounts presented are an estimate due to inherent uncertainty of tax settlements, including the ability to offset liabilities with tax loss carryforwards.

Share Repurchase Program

In February 2012, our Board authorized a program to repurchase from time to time up to

$300.0

, excluding fees, of our common stock (the "2012 share repurchase program").  In November 2012, the Board authorized an increase in the amount available under our 2012 share repurchase program up to

$400.0

, excluding fees, of our common stock, as a result of the sale of our remaining holdings in Facebook. In February 2013, the Board authorized a new share repurchase program to repurchase from time to time up to

$300.0

, excluding fees, of our common stock (the "2013 share repurchase program"). In March 2013, the Board authorized an increase in the amount available under our 2013 share repurchase program up to

$500.0

, excluding fees, of our common stock to be used towards the repurchase of shares resulting from the conversion to common stock of the 4.75% Notes. We fully utilized the 2012 share repurchase program as of the second quarter of 2013. As of

December 31, 2013

,

$118.6

remained available for repurchase under the 2013 share repurchase program.



Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - (continued)

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)

On February 14, 2014, we announced that our Board had approved a new share repurchase program to repurchase from time to time up to $300.0, excluding fees, of our common stock. The new authorization is in addition to any amounts remaining available for repurchase under the 2013 share repurchase program.

We may effect such repurchases through open market purchases, trading plans established in accordance with SEC rules, derivative transactions or other means.  We expect to continue to repurchase our common stock in future periods, although the timing and amount of the repurchases will depend on market conditions and other funding requirements. There is no expiration date associated with the share repurchase programs.

FINANCING AND SOURCES OF FUNDS

Substantially all of our operating cash flow is generated by our agencies.  Our cash balances are held in numerous jurisdictions throughout the world, primarily at the holding company level and at our largest subsidiaries.  Below is a summary of our sources of liquidity.


We are required from time to time to post letters of credit, primarily to support obligations of our subsidiaries. These letters of credit historically have not been drawn upon.

At

December 31, 2013

, we held

$871.4

of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities in foreign subsidiaries.  We have not provided U.S. federal income taxes on undistributed foreign earnings of our foreign subsidiaries because we consider such earnings to be permanently reinvested outside the United States. If in the future we distribute these amounts to the United States, an additional provision for the U.S. income and foreign withholding taxes, net of foreign tax credits, could be necessary.

Credit Agreements

We maintain a committed corporate credit facility to increase our financial flexibility. On

December 12, 2013

, we amended and restated our credit agreement, originally dated as of

July 18, 2008

(as amended and restated as of

December 12, 2013

, the "Credit Agreement"). The amendment extended the Credit Agreement's expiration to

December 12, 2018

, reduced costs and provides additional flexibility with respect to certain covenants such as restrictions on acquisitions, liens, and subsidiary debt.  The Credit Agreement is a revolving facility, under which amounts borrowed by us or any of our subsidiaries designated under the Credit Agreement may be repaid and reborrowed, subject to an aggregate lending limit of

$1,000.0

or the equivalent in other currencies. The Company continues to have the ability to increase the commitments under the Credit Agreement from time to time by an additional amount of up to

$250.0

, provided the Company receives commitments for such increases and satisfies certain other conditions. The aggregate available amount of letters of credit outstanding may decrease or increase, subject to a sublimit on letters of credit of

$200.0

or the equivalent in other currencies. We use our Credit Agreement to provide letters of credit primarily to support obligations of our subsidiaries. Our obligations under the Credit Agreement are unsecured.

Under the Credit Agreement, we can elect to receive advances bearing interest based on either the base rate or the Eurocurrency rate (each as defined in the Credit Agreement) plus an applicable margin that is determined based on our credit ratings.  As of December 31, 2013, the applicable margin is

0.275%

for base rate advances and

1.275%

for Eurocurrency rate advances.  Letter of credit fees accrue on the average daily aggregate amount of letters of credit outstanding, at a rate equal to the applicable margin for Eurocurrency rate advances, and fronting fees accrue on the aggregate amount of letters of credit outstanding at an annual rate of

0.250%

. We also pay a facility fee at an annual rate of

0.225%

on the aggregate lending commitment under the Credit Agreement.

If we were unable to comply with our covenants in the future, we would seek an amendment or waiver from our lenders, but there is no assurance that our lenders would grant an amendment or waiver.  If we were unable to obtain the necessary amendment or waiver, the credit facility could be terminated and our lenders could accelerate payments of any outstanding principal.  In addition, under those circumstances we could be required to deposit funds with one of our lenders in an amount equal to any outstanding letters of credit under the credit facility.

We also have uncommitted credit facilities with various banks that permit borrowings at variable interest rates.  As of

December 31, 2013

, there were borrowings under some of the uncommitted facilities. We have guaranteed the repayment of some of these borrowings made by certain subsidiaries.  If we lose access to these credit lines, we would have to provide funding directly to some of our international operations.  The weighted-average interest rate on outstanding balances under the uncommitted credit facilities as of

December 31, 2013

and


was approximately

4.0%

.

Cash Pooling

We aggregate our domestic cash position on a daily basis.  Outside the United States we use cash pooling arrangements with banks to help manage our liquidity requirements.  In these pooling arrangements, several IPG agencies agree with a single bank that the cash balances of any of the agencies with the bank will be subject to a full right of set-off against amounts the other agencies owe the bank, and the bank provides for overdrafts  as long as the net balance for all the agencies does not exceed an agreed-upon level. Typically, each agency pays interest on outstanding overdrafts and receives interest on cash balances.  Our Consolidated Balance Sheets reflect cash, net of bank overdrafts, under all of our pooling arrangements, and as of

December 31, 2013

and


the amounts netted were

$1,415.3

and

$1,166.3

, respectively.

CAPPED CALL

In November 2010 we purchased capped call options to hedge the risk of price appreciation on the shares of our common stock into which our 4.75% Notes were convertible. In

March 2013

, we exercised our capped call options and elected net share settlement. We received a total of

1.5

settlement shares from the option counterparties as a result of exercising these options. Our capped call transaction met the definition of an off-balance sheet arrangement per Regulation S-K Item 303(a)(4).

DEBT CREDIT RATINGS

Our long-term debt credit ratings as of

February 14, 2014

are listed below.

We are rated investment-grade by both Moody's Investor Services ("Moody's") and Fitch Ratings. The most recent update to our credit ratings occurred in February 2013, when Standard & Poor's changed our outlook from positive to stable. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning credit rating agency. The rating of each credit rating agency should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Credit ratings could have an impact on liquidity, either adverse or favorable, including, among other things, because they could affect funding costs in the capital markets or otherwise.  For example, our Credit Agreement fees and borrowing rates are based on a credit ratings grid.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

Our Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  Preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures requires us to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts re

ported and disclosed in the accompanying financial statements and footnotes.  Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  We believe that of our significant accounting policies, the following critical acc

ounting estimates involve management’s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments.  We consider these accounting estimates to be critical because changes in the underlying assumptions or estimates have the potential to materially impact our Consolidated Financial Statements.  Management has discussed with our Audit Committee the development, selection, application and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates.  We regularly evaluate our judgments, assumptions and estimates based on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be relevant under the circumstances.  Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

Revenue Recognition

Our revenues are primarily derived from the planning and execution of multi-channel advertising, marketing and communications programs around the world.  Most of our client contracts are individually negotiated and, accordingly, the terms of client engagements and the bases on which we earn commissions and fees vary significantly.  Our client contracts are complex arrangements that may include provisions for incentive compensation and vendor rebates and credits.  Our largest clients are multinational entities and, as such, we often provide services to these clients out of multiple offices and across many of our agencies. In arranging for such services, it is possible that we will enter into global, regional and local agreements.  Agreements of this nature are reviewed by legal counsel to determine the governing terms to be followed by the offices and agencies involved.  Critical judgments and estimates are involved in determining both the amount and timing of revenue recognition under these arrangements.

Revenue for our services is recognized when all of the following criteria are satisfied: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (ii) the price is fixed or determinable; (iii) collectability is reasonably assured; and (iv) services have been performed. Depending on the terms of a client contract, fees for services performed can be recognized in three principal ways: proportional performance (input or output), straight-line (or monthly basis) or completed contract.

Depending on the terms of the client contract, revenue is derived from diverse arrangements involving fees for services performed, commissions, performance incentive provisions and combinations of the three.  Commissions are generally earned on the date of the broadcast or publication.  Contractual arrangements with clients may also include performance incentive provisions designed to link a portion of our revenue to our performance relative to either qualitative or quantitative goals, or both.  Performance incentives are recognized as revenue for quantitative targets when the target has been achieved and for qualitative targets when confirmation of the incentive is received from the client.  The classification of client arrangements to determine the appropriate revenue recognition involves judgments.  If the judgments change there can be a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements, and particularly on the allocation of revenues between periods.

The majority of our revenue is recorded as the net amount of our gross billings less pass-through expenses charged to a client. In most cases, the amount that is billed to clients significantly exceeds the amount of revenue that is earned and reflected in our Consolidated Financial Statements because of various pass-through expenses, such as production and media costs.  We assess whether our agency or the third-party supplier is the primary obligor, and we evaluate the terms of our client agreements as part of this assessment.  In addition, we give appropriate consideration to other key indicators such as latitude in establishing price, discretion in supplier selection and credit risk to the vendor.  Because we operate broadly as an advertising agency, based on our primary lines of business and given the industry practice to generally record revenue on a net versus gross basis, we believe that there must be strong evidence in place to overcome the presumption of net revenue accounting.  Accordingly, we generally record revenue net of pass-through charges as we believe the key indicators of the business suggest we generally act as an agent on behalf of our clients in our primary lines of business.  In those businesses where the key indicators suggest we act as a principal (primarily sales promotion and event, sports and entertainment marketing), we record the gross amount billed to the client as revenue and the related incremental direct costs incurred as office and general expenses.  In general, we also report revenue net of taxes assessed by governmental authorities that are directly imposed on our revenue-producing transactions.

As we provide services as part of our core operations, we generally incur incidental expenses, which, in practice, are commonly referred to as “out-of-pocket” expenses.  These expenses often include expenses related to airfare, mileage, hotel stays, out-of-town meals and telecommunication charges.  We record the reimbursements received for such incidental expenses as revenue with a corresponding offset to office and general expense.



Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - (continued)

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)

The determination as to whether revenue in a particular line of business should be recognized net or gross involves complex judgments.  If we make these judgments differently it could significantly affect our reported results.  If it were determined that we must recognize a significant portion of revenues on a gross basis rather than a net basis it would positively impact revenues, have no impact on our operating income and have an adverse impact on operating margin.

We receive credits from our vendors and media outlets for transactions entered into on behalf of our clients that, based on the terms of our contracts and local law, are either remitted to our clients or retained by us.  If amounts are to be passed through to clients, they are recorded as liabilities until settlement or, if retained by us, are recorded as revenue when earned.

Income Taxes

The provision for income taxes includes U.S. federal, state, local and foreign taxes.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and their respective tax bases.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the year in which the temporary differences are expected to be reversed.  Changes to enacted tax rates would result in either increases or decreases in the provision for income taxes in the period of change.

We are required to evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets, which is primarily dependent on future earnings.  A valuation allowance shall be recognized when, based on available evidence, it is “more likely than not” that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized due to the inability to generate sufficient taxable income in future periods.  In circumstances where there is negative evidence, establishment of a valuation allowance must be considered. We believe that cumulative losses in the most recent three-year period represent significant negative evidence when evaluating a decision to establish a valuation allowance.  Conversely, a pattern of sustained profitability represents significant positive evidence when evaluating a decision to reverse a valuation allowance.  Further, in those cases where a pattern of sustained profitability exists, projected future taxable income may also represent positive evidence, to the extent that such projections are determined to be reliable given the current economic environment.  Accordingly, the increase and decrease of valuation allowances has had and could have a significant negative or positive impact on our current and future earnings.  In


we recorded a net charge for the establishment of valuation allowances of

$3.2

.  In


and


we recorded a net reversal of valuation allowances of

$57.3

and

$32.9

, respectively.

The authoritative guidance for uncertainty in income taxes prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement criteria for the financial statement reporting of a tax position that an entity takes or expects to take in a tax return.  Additionally, guidance is provided for de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition.  The assessment of recognition and measurement requires critical estimates and the use of complex judgments.  We evaluate our tax positions using the “more likely than not” recognition threshold and then apply a measurement assessment to those positions that meet the recognition threshold.  We have established tax reserves that we believe to be adequate in relation to the potential for additional assessments in each of the jurisdictions in which we are subject to taxation.  We regularly assess the likelihood of additional tax assessments in those jurisdictions and adjust our reserves as additional information or events require.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

We account for our business combinations using the acquisition accounting method, which requires us to determine the fair value of net assets acquired and the related goodwill and other intangible assets.  Determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management's judgment and involves the use of significant estimates, including projections of future cash inflows and outflows, discount rates, asset lives and market multiples.  Considering the characteristics of advertising, specialized marketing and communication services companies, our acquisitions usually do not have significant amounts of tangible assets, as the principal asset we typically acquire is creative talent.  As a result, a substantial portion of the purchase price is allocated to goodwill and other intangible assets.

We review goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives not subject to amortization as of October 1

st

each year and whenever events or significant changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.  We evaluate the recoverability of goodwill at a reporting unit level.  We have


reporting units that were subject to the


annual impairment testing.  Our annual impairment review as of October 1, 2013 did not result in an impairment charge at any of our reporting units.

During 2011 and 2012, we adopted new authoritative guidance for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, respectively, which permits an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is “more likely than not” that the goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets are impaired. Qualitative factors to consider may include macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors that may have a negative effect on earnings, financial performance, and other relevant entity-specific events such as changes in management, key personnel, strategy or clients, as well as pending litigation. If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances such as those described above, an entity determines that it is "more likely than not" that the goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired, then the entity is required to determine the fair value and



Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - (continued)

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)

perform the quantitative impairment test by comparing the fair value with the carrying value. Otherwise, no additional testing is required.

For reporting units not included in the qualitative assessment, or for any reporting units identified in the qualitative assessment as "more likely than not" that the fair value is less than its carrying value, the first step of the quantitative impairment test is performed. For our annual impairment test, we compare the respective fair value of our reporting units' equity to the carrying value of their net assets. The first step is a comparison of the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. The sum of the fair values of all our reporting units is reconciled to our current market capitalization plus an estimated control premium. Goodwill allocated to a reporting unit whose fair value is equal to or greater than its carrying value is not impaired, and no further testing is required.  Should the carrying amount for a reporting unit exceed its fair value, then the first step of the quantitative impairment test is failed and the magnitude of any goodwill impairment is determined under the second step, which is a comparison of the implied fair value of a reporting unit's goodwill to its carrying value. The implied fair value of goodwill is the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over its carrying value, excluding goodwill. Impaired goodwill is written down to its implied fair value with a charge to expense in the period the impairment is identified.

For our


and


annual impairment tests, we performed a qualitative impairment assessment for six and nine reporting units and performed the first step of a two-step quantitative impairment test for seven and two reporting units, respectively. In 2013, we performed a quantitative impairment test for three of the seven reporting units due to a reorganization of their reporting unit structure. For the qualitative analysis we took into consideration all the relevant events and circumstances, including financial performance, macroeconomic conditions and entity-specific factors such as client wins and losses.  Based on this assessment, we have concluded that for each of our reporting units subject to the qualitative assessment, it is not “more likely than not” that its fair value was less than its carrying value; therefore, no additional testing was required.

The


and


fair values of reporting units for which we performed quantitative impairment tests were estimated using a combination of the income approach, which incorporates the use of the discounted cash flow method, and the market approach, which incorporates the use of earnings and revenue multiples based on market data.  We generally applied an equal weighting to the income and market approach for our analysis.  For the income approach, we used projections, which require the use of significant estimates and assumptions specific to the reporting unit as well as those based on general economic conditions.  Factors specific to each reporting unit include revenue growth, profit margins, terminal value growth rates, capital expenditures projections, assumed tax rates, discount rates and other assumptions deemed reasonable by management.  For the market approach, we used judgment in identifying the relevant comparable-company market multiples.

These estimates and assumptions may vary between each reporting unit depending on the facts and circumstances specific to that unit.  The discount rate for each reporting unit is influenced by general market conditions as well as factors specific to the reporting unit.  For the


test, the discount rates we used for our reporting units tested were between

10.0%

and

13.5%

, and the terminal value growth rate for all seven of our reporting units tested was

3.0%

.  The terminal value growth rate represents the expected long-term growth rate for the advertising and marketing services industry, incorporating the type of services the reporting unit provides, and the global economy.  For the


test, the revenue growth rates for our reporting units used in our analysis were generally between

4.0%

and

5.0%

.  Factors influencing the revenue growth rates include the nature of the services the reporting unit provides for its clients, the geographic locations in which the reporting unit conducts business and the maturity of the reporting unit.  We believe that the estimates and assumptions we made are reasonable, but they are susceptible to change from period to period.  Actual results of operations, cash flows and other factors will likely differ from the estimates used in our valuation, and it is possible that differences and changes could be material.  A deterioration in profitability, adverse market conditions, significant client losses, changes in spending levels of our existing clients or a different economic outlook than currently estimated by management could have a significant impact on the estimated fair value of our reporting units and could result in an impairment charge in the future.

We also perform a sensitivity analysis to detail the impact that changes in assumptions may have on the outcome of the first step of the impairment test.  Our sensitivity analysis provides a range of fair value for each reporting unit, where the low end of the range reduces growth rates by 0.25% and increases discount rates by 0.5%, and the high end of the range increases growth rates by 0.25% and decreases discount rates by 0.5%.  We use the average of our fair values for purposes of our comparison between carrying value and fair value for the first step of the quantitative impairment test.

The table below displays the goodwill midpoint of the range for each reporting unit tested in the


and


annual impairment tests.  Our results of the comparison between carrying value and fair value at the average fair value indicated that for the


test there was one reporting unit and for the


test there were no reporting units whose fair value exceeded its carrying value by less than 20%.



Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - (continued)

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)

Additionally, we performed a sensitivity analysis and reviewed the carrying values compared to the high end and low end of the valuation range.  The table below displays the  range of the sensitivity analysis for each reporting unit tested in the


and


annual impairment tests. For the


test, using the low of the valuation range, there were two reporting units whose fair value exceeded its carrying value by less than 20%, but not less that 0%.  For the


test, using the low of the valuation range, there were no reporting units whose fair value exceeded its carrying value by less than 20%.

Based on the analysis described above, for the reporting units for which we performed the first step of the quantitative impairment test, we concluded that our goodwill was not impaired as of October 1, 2013, because these reporting units passed the first step of the test as the fair values of each of the reporting units were substantially in excess of their respective net book values.

We review intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization whenever events or circumstances indicate that a carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.  Recoverability of these assets is determined by comparing the carrying value of these assets to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by these assets.  These assets are impaired when their carrying value exceeds their fair value.  Impaired intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization are written down to their fair value with a charge to expense in the period the impairment is identified.  Intangible assets with definite lives are amortized on a straight-line basis with estimated useful lives generally between


and


years.  Events or circumstances that might require impairment testing include the loss of a significant client, the identification of other impaired assets within a reporting unit, loss of key personnel, the disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit, significant decline in stock price or a significant adverse change in business climate or regulations.

Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans

We use various actuarial assumptions in determining our net pension and postretirement benefit costs and obligations.  Management is required to make significant judgments about a number of actuarial assumptions, including discount rates and expected returns on plan assets, which are updated annually or more frequently with the occurrence of significant events.

The discount rate is a significant assumption that impacts our net pension and postretirement benefit costs and obligations. We determine our discount rates for our domestic pension plan, significant foreign pension plans and domestic postretirement benefit plan based on either a bond selection/settlement approach or bond yield curve approach.  Using the bond selection/settlement approach, we determine the discount rate by selecting a portfolio of corporate bonds appropriate to provide for the projected benefit payments.  Using the bond yield curve approach, we determine the discount rate by matching the plans' cash flows to spot rates developed from a yield curve.  Both approaches utilize high-quality AA-rated corporate bonds and the plans' projected cash flows to develop a discounted value of the benefit payments, which is then used to develop a single discount rate.  In countries where



Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - (continued)

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)

markets for high-quality long-term AA corporate bonds are not well developed, a portfolio of long-term government bonds is used as a basis to develop hypothetical corporate bond yields, which serve as a basis to derive the discount rate.

For the year ended

December 31, 2013

, a discount rate of

4.00%

was used for the domestic pension and postretirement benefit plans and a weighted-average discount rate of

4.32%

for the significant foreign pension plans to calculate


net pension and postretirement benefit costs.  A 25 basis point increase or decrease in the discount rate would have decreased or increased the


net pension and postretirement benefit cost by approximately

$1.0

, respectively.

As of

December 31, 2013

, we used a discount rate of

4.85%

for the domestic pension and postretirement benefit plans and a weighted-average discount rate of

4.29%

for our significant foreign pension plans to measure our benefit obligations.  A 25 basis point increase or decrease in the discount rate would have decreased or increased the

December 31, 2013

benefit obligation by approximately

$26.0

and

$27.0

, respectively.

The expected rate of return on pension plan assets is another significant assumption that impacts our net pension cost and is determined at the beginning of the year.  Our expected rate of return considers asset class index returns over various market and economic conditions, current and expected market conditions, risk premiums associated with asset classes and long-term inflation rates.  We determine both a short-term and long-term view and then select a long-term rate of return assumption that matches the duration of our liabilities.

For


, the weighted-average expected rates of return of

7.00%

and

5.24%

were used in the calculation of net pension costs for the domestic and significant foreign pension plans, respectively.  For


, we plan to use an expected rate of return of

7.00%

and

6.18%

for the domestic and significant foreign pension plans, respectively.  Changes in the rates are typically due to lower or higher expected future returns based on the mix of assets held.  A lower expected rate of return would increase our net pension cost.  A 25 basis point increase or decrease in the expected return on plan assets would have decreased or increased the


net pension cost by approximately

$1.0

, respectively.

RECENT ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on certain accounting standards that have been adopted during


or that have not yet been required to be implemented and may be applicable to our future operations.


Item 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

(Amounts in millions)

In the normal course of business, we are exposed to market risks related to interest rates, foreign currency rates and certain balance sheet items. From time to time, we use derivative instruments, pursuant to established guidelines and policies, to manage some portion of these risks. Derivative instruments utilized in our hedging activities are viewed as risk management tools and are not used for trading or speculative purposes.

Interest Rates

Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the fair market value and cash flows of our debt obligations. The majority of our debt (approximately

89%

and

93%

as of

December 31, 2013

and


, respectively) bears interest at fixed rates. We do have debt with variable interest rates, but a 10% increase or decrease in interest rates would not be material to our interest expense or cash flows. The fair market value of our debt is sensitive to changes in interest rates, and the impact of a 10% change in interest rates is summarized below.

We have used interest rate swaps for risk management purposes to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates. We do not have any interest rate swaps outstanding as of

December 31, 2013

.

We had

$1,642.1

of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of

December 31, 2013

that we generally invest in conservative, short-term bank deposits or securities. The interest income generated from these investments is subject to both domestic and foreign interest rate movements.  During


and


, we had interest income of

$24.7

and

$29.5

, respectively.

Based on our


results, a 100-basis-point increase or decrease in interest rates would affect our interest income by approximately

$16.4

, assuming that all cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are impacted in the same manner and balances remain constant from year-end


levels.

Foreign Currency Rates

We are subject to translation and transaction risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Since we report revenues and expenses in U.S. Dollars, changes in exchange rates may either positively or negatively affect our consolidated revenues and expenses (as expressed in U.S. Dollars) from foreign operations. The primary foreign currencies that impacted our results during


were the Australian Dollar, Brazilian Real, Euro, Japanese Yen and the South African Rand. Based on


exchange rates and operating results, if the U.S. Dollar were to strengthen or weaken by 10%, we currently estimate operating income would decrease or increase between

3%

and

4%

, assuming that all currencies are impacted in the same manner and our international revenue and expenses remain constant at


levels.

The functional currency of our foreign operations is generally their respective local currency.  Assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date, and revenues and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates during the period presented.  The resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax, in the stockholders’ equity section of our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Our foreign subsidiaries generally collect revenues and pay expenses in their functional currency, mitigating transaction risk. However, certain subsidiaries may enter into transactions in currencies other than their functional currency. Assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are susceptible to movements in foreign currency until final settlement. Currency transaction gains or losses primarily arising from transactions in currencies other than the functional currency are included in office and general expenses.  We have not entered into a material amount of foreign currency forward exchange contracts or other derivative financial instruments to hedge the effects of potential adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.

We monitor the currencies of countries in which we operate in order to determine if the country should be considered a highly inflationary environment. A currency is determined to be highly inflationary when there is cumulative inflation of approximately 100% or more over a three-year period.  If this occurs the functional currency of that country would be changed to our reporting currency, the U.S. Dollar, and foreign exchange gains or losses would be recognized on all monetary transactions, assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar until the currency is no longer considered highly inflationary.


Credit and Market Risks

Balance sheet items that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk are primarily cash and cash equivalents, short-term marketable securities, accounts receivable and expenditures billable to clients. We invest our cash primarily in investment-grade, short-term securities and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one counterparty. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are mitigated by our large number of clients and their dispersion across different industries and geographic areas. We perform ongoing credit evaluations on a large number of our clients and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon the expected collectability of all accounts receivable.

Our pension plan assets are also exposed to market risk. The fair value of our pension plan assets may appreciate or depreciate during the year, which can result in lower or higher pension expense and funding requirements in future periods.


Item 8.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

INDEX


REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets and the related Consolidated Statements of Operations, of Comprehensive Income, of Cash Flows, and of Stockholders’ Equity present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc., and its subsidiaries,

at

December 31, 2013

and

December 31, 2012

, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended

December 31, 2013

in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2013

, based on criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework (1992)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company's management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits.  We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.  Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.  Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.  Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries, some of which are not wholly owned.  Investments in companies over which we do not have control, but the ability to exercise significant influence, are accounted for using the equity method of accounting.  Investments in companies over which we have neither control nor have the ability to exercise significant influence are accounted for under the cost method.  All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

We have consolidated certain entities meeting the definition of variable interest entities, and the inclusion of these entities does not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Reclassifications

Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior period financial statements to conform to the current-year presentation.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) requires us to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the reporting date and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates and assumptions.

Revenue Recognition

Our revenues are primarily derived from the planning and execution of multi-channel advertising, marketing and communications programs around the world. Our revenues are directly dependent upon the advertising, marketing and corporate communications requirements of our existing clients and our ability to win new clients. Our revenue is typically lowest in the first quarter and highest in the fourth quarter.  This reflects the seasonal spending of our clients, incentives earned at year end on various contracts and project work completed that is typically recognized during the fourth quarter.

Most of our client contracts are individually negotiated and, accordingly, the terms of client engagements and the bases on which we earn commissions and fees vary significantly. As is customary in the industry, our contracts generally provide for termination by either party on relatively short notice, usually 90 days.

Our client contracts are complex arrangements that may include provisions for incentive compensation and vendor rebates and credits.  Our largest clients are multinational entities and, as such, we often provide services to these clients out of multiple offices and across many of our agencies.  In arranging for such services, it is possible that we will enter into global, regional and local agreements.  Agreements of this nature are reviewed by legal counsel to determine the governing terms to be followed by the offices and agencies involved.

Revenue for our services is recognized when all of the following criteria are satisfied: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (ii) the price is fixed or determinable; (iii) collectability is reasonably assured; and (iv) services have been performed. Depending on the terms of a client contract, fees for services performed can be recognized in three principal ways: proportional performance (input or output), straight-line (or monthly basis) or completed contract.

•

Fees are generally recognized as earned based on the proportional performance input method of revenue recognition in situations where our fee is reconcilable to the actual hours incurred to service the client as detailed in a contractual staffing plan, where the fee is earned on a per hour basis or where actual hours incurred are provided to the client on a periodic basis (whether or not the fee is reconcilable), with the amount of revenue recognized in these situations limited to the amount realizable under the client contract. We believe an input-based measure (the ‘hour’) is appropriate in situations where the client arrangement essentially functions as a time and out-of-pocket expense contract and the client receives the benefit of the services provided throughout the contract term.



Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – (continued)

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)

•

Fees are recognized on a straight-line or monthly basis when service is provided essentially on a pro-rata basis and the terms of the contract support monthly basis accounting.

•

Certain fees (such as for major marketing events) are deferred until contract completion if the final act is so significant in relation to the service transaction taken as a whole or if any of the terms of the contract do not otherwise qualify for proportional performance or monthly basis recognition.  Fees may also be deferred and recognized upon delivery of a project if the terms of the client contract identify individual discrete projects.

Depending on the terms of the client contract, revenue is derived from diverse arrangements involving fees for services performed, commissions, performance incentive provisions and combinations of the three.  Commissions are generally earned on the date of the broadcast or publication. Contractual arrangements with clients may also include performance incentive provisions designed to link a portion of our revenue to our performance relative to either qualitative or quantitative goals, or both.  Performance incentives are recognized as revenue for quantitative targets when the target has been achieved and for qualitative targets when confirmation of the incentive is received from the client.

The majority of our revenue is recorded as the net amount of our gross billings less pass-through expenses charged to a client. In most cases, the amount that is billed to clients significantly exceeds the amount of revenue that is earned and reflected in our Consolidated Financial Statements because of various pass-through expenses, such as production and media costs.  We assess whether our agency or the third-party supplier is the primary obligor, and we evaluate the terms of our client agreements as part of this assessment.  In addition, we give appropriate consideration to other key indicators such as latitude in establishing price, discretion in supplier selection and credit risk to the vendor. Because we operate broadly as an advertising agency, based on our primary lines of business and given the industry practice to generally record revenue on a net versus gross basis, we believe that there must be strong evidence in place to overcome the presumption of net revenue accounting.  Accordingly, we generally record revenue net of pass-through charges as we believe the key indicators of the business suggest we generally act as an agent on behalf of our clients in our primary lines of business.  In those businesses where the key indicators suggest we act as a principal (primarily sales promotion and event, sports and entertainment marketing), we record the gross amount billed to the client as revenue and the related incremental direct costs incurred as office and general expenses.  In general, we also report revenue net of taxes assessed by governmental authorities that are directly imposed on our revenue-producing transactions.

As we provide services as part of our core operations, we generally incur incidental expenses, which, in practice, are commonly referred to as “out-of-pocket” expenses.  These expenses often include expenses related to airfare, mileage, hotel stays, out-of-town meals and telecommunication charges.  We record the reimbursements received for such incidental expenses as revenue with a corresponding offset to office and general expense.

We receive credits from our vendors and media outlets for transactions entered into on behalf of our clients that, based on the terms of our contracts and local law, are either remitted to our clients or retained by us. If amounts are to be passed through to clients, they are recorded as liabilities until settlement or, if retained by us, are recorded as revenue when earned.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash equivalents are highly liquid investments, which include certificates of deposit, government securities, commercial paper and time deposits with original maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase and are stated at estimated fair value, which approximates cost. Cash is maintained at multiple high-credit-quality financial institutions.

Short-Term Marketable Securities

Short-term marketable securities include investment-grade time deposits, commercial paper and government securities with maturities greater than three months but less than twelve months. These securities are classified as available-for-sale and are carried at fair value with net unrealized gains and losses reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss, which is a component of stockholders’ equity. The cost of securities is determined based upon the average cost of the securities sold.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

The allowance for doubtful accounts is estimated based on the aging of accounts receivable, reviews of client credit reports, industry trends and economic indicators, as well as reviews of recent payment history for specific customers. The estimate is based largely on a formula-driven calculation but is supplemented with economic indicators and knowledge of potential write-offs of specific client accounts.

Expenditures Billable to Clients

Expenditures billable to clients are primarily comprised of production and media costs that have been incurred but have not yet been billed to clients, as well as fees that have been earned which have not yet been billed to clients. Unbilled amounts are



Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – (continued)

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)

presented in expenditures billable to clients regardless of whether they relate to our fees or production and media costs.  A provision is made for unrecoverable costs as deemed appropriate.

Accounts Payable

Accounts payable includes all operating payables, including those related to all media and production costs. These payables are due within one year.

Investments

Our investments in publicly traded companies over which we do not exert a significant influence are classified as available-for-sale. These investments are reported at fair value based on quoted market prices with net unrealized gains and losses reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss. Our non-publicly traded investments and all other publicly traded investments, including investments to fund certain deferred compensation and retirement obligations, are accounted for using the equity method or cost method.  We do not disclose the fair value for equity method investments or investments held at cost as it is not practical to estimate fair value since there is no readily available market data and it is cost prohibitive to obtain independent valuations.  We regularly review our equity and cost method investments to determine whether a significant event or change in circumstances has occurred that may impact the fair value of each investment. In the event a decline in fair value of an investment occurs, we determine if the decline has been other-than-temporary. We consider our investments strategic and long-term in nature, so we determine if the fair value decline is recoverable within a reasonable period. For our investments, we evaluate fair value based on specific information (valuation methodologies, estimates of appraisals, financial statements, etc.) in addition to quoted market price, if available. We consider all known quantitative and qualitative factors in determining if an other-than-temporary decline in value of an investment has occurred.

Derivatives

We are exposed to market risk related to interest rates, foreign currency rates and certain balance sheet items. From time to time we enter into derivative instruments for risk management purposes, and not for speculative purposes.  All derivative instruments are recorded at fair value on our balance sheet.  Changes in fair value are immediately included in earnings if the derivatives are not designated as a hedge instrument or if the derivatives do not qualify as effective hedges.  For derivatives designated as hedge instruments, we evaluate for hedge accounting both at inception and throughout the hedge period.  If a derivative is designated as a fair value hedge, then changes in the fair value of the derivative are offset against the changes in the fair value of the underlying hedged item.  If a derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge, then the effective portion of the changes in the fair value of the derivative is recognized as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income and subsequently reclassified to earnings in our Consolidated Statement of Operations in the same period as the underlying hedged transaction affects earnings.

Furniture, Equipment and Leasehold Improvements

Furniture, equipment and leasehold improvements are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. Furniture and equipment are depreciated generally using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets, which range from


to


years for furniture, equipment and computer software costs,


to


years for buildings and

the shorter of the useful life or the remaining lease term

for leasehold improvements.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

We account for our business combinations using the acquisition accounting method, which requires us to determine the fair value of net assets acquired and the related goodwill and other intangible assets.  Determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management's judgment and involves the use of significant estimates, including projections of future cash inflows and outflows, discount rates, asset lives and market multiples.  Considering the characteristics of advertising, specialized marketing and communication services companies, our acquisitions usually do not have significant amounts of tangible assets, as the principal asset we typically acquire is creative talent.  As a result, a substantial portion of the purchase price is allocated to goodwill and other intangible assets.

We review goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives not subject to amortization as of October 1

st

each year and whenever events or significant changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.  We evaluate the recoverability of goodwill at a reporting unit level.  We have


reporting units that were subject to the


annual impairment testing. Our annual impairment review as of October 1, 2013 did not result in an impairment charge for any of our reporting units.

During 2011 and 2012, we adopted new authoritative guidance for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, respectively, which permits an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is “more likely than not” that the goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets are impaired. Qualitative factors to consider may include macroeconomic conditions, industry



Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – (continued)

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)

and market considerations, cost factors that may have a negative effect on earnings, financial performance, and other relevant entity-specific events such as changes in management, key personnel, strategy or clients, as well as pending litigation. If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances such as those described above, an entity determines that it is "more likely than not" that the goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired, then the entity is required to determine the fair value and perform the quantitative impairment test by comparing the fair value with the carrying value. Otherwise, no additional testing is required.

For reporting units not included in the qualitative assessment, or for any reporting units identified in the qualitative assessment as "more likely than not" that the fair value is less than its carrying value, the first step of the quantitative impairment test is performed.  For our annual impairment test, we compare the respective fair value of our reporting units' equity to the carrying value of their net assets.  The first step is a comparison of the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. The sum of the fair values of all our reporting units is reconciled to our current market capitalization plus an estimated control premium.  Goodwill allocated to a reporting unit whose fair value is equal to or greater than its carrying value is not impaired, and no further testing is required.  Should the carrying amount for a reporting unit exceed its fair value, then the first step of the quantitative impairment test is failed and the magnitude of any goodwill impairment is determined under the second step, which is a comparison of the implied fair value of a reporting unit's goodwill to its carrying value.  The implied fair value of goodwill is the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over its carrying value, excluding goodwill.  Impaired goodwill is written down to its implied fair value with a charge to expense in the period the impairment is identified.

The fair value of a reporting unit for


and


was estimated using a combination of the income approach, which incorporates the use of the discounted cash flow method, and the market approach, which incorporates the use of earnings and revenue multiples based on market data.

We review intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization whenever events or circumstances indicate that a carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.  Recoverability of these assets is determined by comparing the carrying value of these assets to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by these assets.  These assets are impaired when their carrying value exceeds their fair value.  Impaired intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization are written down to their fair value with a charge to expense in the period the impairment is identified.  Intangible assets with definite lives are amortized on a straight-line basis with estimated useful lives generally between


and


years.  Events or circumstances that might require impairment testing include the loss of a significant client, the identification of other impaired assets within a reporting unit, loss of key personnel, the disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit, significant decline in stock price or a significant adverse change in business climate or regulations.

Foreign Currencies

The functional currency of our foreign operations is generally their respective local currency.  Assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date, and revenues and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates during the period presented. The resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in the stockholders’ equity section of our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Currency transaction gains or losses primarily arising from transactions in currencies other than the functional currency are included in office and general expenses.  Foreign currency transactions resulted in a pre-tax loss of

$0.6

in


, a pre-tax gain of

$1.2

in


and a pre-tax loss

$0.9

in


.

We monitor the currencies of countries in which we operate in order to determine if the country should be considered a highly inflationary environment. A currency is determined to be highly inflationary when there is cumulative inflation of approximately 100% or more over a three-year period. If this occurs the functional currency of that country would be changed to our reporting currency, the U.S. Dollar, and foreign exchange gains or losses would be recognized on all monetary transactions, assets and liabilities in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar until the currency is no longer considered highly inflationary.

Income Taxes

The provision for income taxes includes U.S. federal, state, local and foreign taxes.  Income taxes are accounted for under the liability method.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and their respective tax bases.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the year in which the temporary differences are expected to be reversed.  We evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets and establish a valuation allowance when it is “more likely than not” that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We evaluate our tax positions using the “more likely than not” recognition threshold and then apply a measurement assessment to those positions that meet the recognition threshold.  We have established tax reserves that we believe to be adequate in relation to the potential for additional assessments



Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – (continued)

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)

in each of the jurisdictions in which we are subject to taxation.  We regularly assess the likelihood of additional tax assessments in those jurisdictions and adjust our reserves as additional information or events require.

Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests

Many of our acquisitions include provisions under which the noncontrolling equity owners can require us to purchase additional interests in a subsidiary at their discretion.  Payments for these redeemable noncontrolling interests are contingent upon achieving projected operating performance targets and satisfying other conditions specified in the related agreements and are subject to revisions as the earn-out periods progress. We record these redeemable noncontrolling interests in “mezzanine equity” in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.  Each reporting period, redeemable noncontrolling interests are reported at their estimated redemption value, but not less than their initial fair value.  Any adjustment to the redemption value above initial value prior to exercise will also impact retained earnings or additional paid-in capital, but will not impact net income.  Adjustments as a result of currency translation will affect the redeemable noncontrolling interest balance, but do not impact retained earnings or additional paid-in capital.

Earnings Per Share (“EPS”)

Basic EPS available to IPG common stockholders equals net income available to IPG common stockholders divided by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the applicable period. Diluted EPS equals net income available to IPG common stockholders adjusted to exclude, if dilutive, preferred stock dividends, interest expense related to potentially dilutive securities calculated using the effective interest rate method and the benefit from the preferred stock repurchased, divided by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding, plus any additional common shares that would have been outstanding if potentially dilutive shares had been issued.

Diluted EPS reflect the potential dilution that would occur if certain potentially dilutive securities or debt obligations were exercised or converted into common stock. The potential issuance of common stock is assumed to occur at the beginning of the year (or at the time of issuance of the potentially dilutive instrument, if later) and the incremental shares are included using the treasury stock or “if-converted” method. The proceeds utilized in applying the treasury stock method consist of the amount, if any, to be paid upon exercise and, as it relates to stock-based compensation, the amount of compensation cost attributed to future service not yet recognized and any tax benefits credited to additional paid-in-capital related to the exercise. These proceeds are then assumed to be used to purchase common stock at the average market price of our stock during the period. The incremental shares (difference between the shares assumed to be issued and the shares assumed to be purchased), to the extent they would have been dilutive, are included in the denominator of the diluted EPS calculation.

We may be required to calculate basic EPS using the two-class method, as a result of our redeemable noncontrolling interests. To the extent that the redemption value increases and exceeds the then-current fair value of a redeemable noncontrolling interest, net income available to IPG common stockholders (used to calculate EPS) could be negatively impacted by that increase, subject to certain limitations. The partial or full recovery of any reductions to net income available to IPG common stockholders (used to calculate EPS) is limited to any cumulative prior-period reductions. For the years ended December 31,


,


and


, there was no impact to EPS for adjustments related to our redeemable noncontrolling interests.

Pension and Postretirement Benefits

We have pension and postretirement benefit plans covering certain domestic and international employees. We use various actuarial methods and assumptions in determining our net pension and postretirement benefit costs and obligations, including the discount rate used to determine the present value of future benefits, expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and healthcare cost trend rates. The overfunded or underfunded status of our pension and postretirement benefit plans is recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Stock-Based Compensation

Compensation costs related to share-based transactions, including employee stock options, are recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements based on fair value. Stock-based compensation expense is generally recognized ratably over the requisite service period based on the estimated grant-date fair value, net of estimated forfeitures.

Convertible Senior Notes due


(the "

4.75%

Notes were retired in the first quarter of 2013.

Annual maturities are scheduled as follows based on the book value as of

December 31, 2013

.

For those debt securities that have a premium or discount at the time of issuance, we amortize the amount through interest expense based on the maturity date or the first date the holders may require us to repurchase the debt securities, if applicable.  A premium would result in a decrease in interest expense and a discount would result in an increase in interest expense in future periods.  We also have recorded debt issuance costs related to certain financing transactions in other assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, which are also amortized through interest expense.  As of

December 31, 2013

and


, we had unamortized debt issuance costs of

$15.4

and

$27.5

, respectively.

Our debt securities include covenants that, among other things, limit our liens and the liens of certain of our consolidated subsidiaries, but do not require us to maintain any financial ratios or specified levels of net worth or liquidity.

Interest Rate Swaps

We enter into interest rate swaps to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates.  In March and April of 2012, we entered into forward-starting interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional amount of

$300.0

to effectively lock in the benchmark rate for a forecasted issuance of debt to occur prior to

December 31, 2013

. These swaps qualified for hedge accounting as cash flow hedges, and, as such, the effective portion of the losses on the swaps was recorded in other comprehensive income and the ineffective portion of the losses on the swaps was recorded in other income, net. In November 2012, we terminated these swaps when we issued our

3.75%

Notes. We paid

$24.0

in cash to settle the swaps, which was classified under the financing section of our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, and recognized a charge of

$2.1

, which was included as a component of other (expense) income, net in our Consolidated Statement of Operations. The deferred losses on the swaps of

$21.9

are being amortized as an increase to interest expense over the term of the

3.75%

Notes.

For the year ended

December 31, 2013

, we reclassified

$1.7

from accumulated other comprehensive loss into interest expense. Within the next twelve months, we expect to reclassify approximately

$1.8

from accumulated other comprehensive loss into interest expense in our Consolidated Statement of Operations.

Credit Agreements

We maintain a committed corporate credit facility and uncommitted credit facilities with various banks that permit borrowings at variable interest rates. As of

December 31, 2013

and


, there were no borrowings under our committed corporate credit facility. However, there were borrowings under some of the uncommitted facilities.  We have guaranteed the repayment of some of these borrowings made by certain subsidiaries. The weighted-average interest rate on outstanding balances under the uncommitted credit facilities as of

December 31, 2013

and


was approximately

4.0%

.

A summary of our credit facilities is presented below.

In December 2013, we amended and restated our credit agreement, originally dated as of July 18, 2008 (as amended and restated as of

December 12, 2013

, the "Credit Agreement"). The amendment extends the Credit Agreement's expiration to

December 12, 2018

, reduced costs and provides additional flexibility with respect to certain covenants such as restrictions on acquisitions, liens, and subsidiary debt.  The Credit Agreement is a revolving facility, under which amounts borrowed by us or any of our subsidiaries designated under the Credit Agreement may be repaid and reborrowed, subject to an aggregate lending limit of

$1,000.0

or the equivalent in other currencies. The Company continues to have the ability to increase the commitments under the Credit Agreement from time to time by an additional amount of up to

$250.0

, provided the Company receives commitments for such increases and satisfies certain other conditions. The aggregate available amount of letters of credit outstanding may decrease or increase, subject to a sublimit on letters of credit of

$200.0

or the equivalent in other currencies. Our obligations under the Credit Agreement are unsecured.

Under the Credit Agreement, we can elect to receive advances bearing interest based on either the base rate or the Eurocurrency rate (each as defined in the Credit Agreement) plus an applicable margin that is determined based on our credit ratings.  As of

December 31, 2013

, the applicable margin is

0.275%

for base rate advances and

for Eurocurrency rate advances.  Letter of credit fees accrue on the average daily aggregate amount of letters of credit outstanding, at a rate equal to the applicable margin for Eurocurrency rate advances, and fronting fees accrue on the aggregate amount of letters of credit outstanding at an annual rate of

0.250%

. We also pay a facility fee at an annual rate of

0.225%

on the aggregate lending commitment under the Credit Agreement.



Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – (continued)

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)

We were in compliance with all of our covenants in the Credit Agreement as of

December 31, 2013

. The financial covenants in the Credit Agreement require that we maintain the following financial covenants listed below as of

December 31, 2013

and thereafter.


The interest coverage ratio is defined as EBITDA, as defined in the Credit Agreement, to net interest expense plus cash dividends on convertible preferred stock for the four quarters then ended.


The leverage ratio is defined as debt as of the last day of such fiscal quarter to EBITDA, as defined in the Credit Agreement, for the four quarters then ended.

Cash Pooling

We aggregate our domestic cash position on a daily basis. Outside the United States we use cash pooling arrangements with banks to help manage our liquidity requirements.  In these pooling arrangements, several IPG agencies agree with a single bank that the cash balances of any of the agencies with the bank will be subject to a full right of set-off against amounts the other agencies owe the bank, and the bank provides for overdrafts as long as the net balance for all the agencies does not exceed an agreed-upon level. Typically, each agency pays interest on outstanding overdrafts and receives interest on cash balances. Our Consolidated Balance Sheets reflect cash, net of bank overdrafts, under all of our pooling arrangements, and as of

December 31, 2013

and


the amounts netted were

$1,415.3

and

$1,166.3

, respectively.

Note 3:  Convertible Preferred Stock

Each share of our 5


/4% Series B Cumulative Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock (the “Series B Preferred Stock”) had a liquidation preference of $

1,000

per share and was convertible at the option of the holder at any time into shares of our common stock.  In addition, the Series B Preferred Stock was convertible at our option if the closing price of our common stock multiplied by the conversion rate in effect at that time equaled or exceeded 130% of the liquidation preference for 20 trading days during any consecutive 30 trading day period.

On

October 17, 2013

, we

exercised our option to

convert all of our outstanding shares of our Series B Preferred Stock.  Prior to the conversion, there were

221,474

shares (actual number) outstanding.  Each share of Series B Preferred Stock converted into common shares at a conversation rate of

77.8966

common shares per preferred share, or approximately

17.3

common shares. The company also paid a nominal cash amount in lieu of fractional shares.  The shares of Series B Preferred Stock were previously included as eligible dilutive securities in our calculation of diluted share count, and the approximately

17.3

newly issued common shares will now be included in our basic share count.

During


and


, we paid annual dividends of $

11.6

, or $

52.50

per share, on our Series B Preferred Stock.  Dividends were paid in January 15, April 15, July 15, and October 15, 2013.

Note 4:  Earnings Per Share

The following sets forth basic and diluted earnings per common share available to IPG common stockholders.


We retired all of our outstanding 4.75% Notes and 4.25% Notes in March 2013 and March 2012, respectively. See Note 2 for further information. For purposes of calculating diluted earnings per share for 2013 and 2012, the potentially dilutive shares are pro-rated based on the period they were outstanding.


We converted all of our Series B Preferred Stock into common stock in October 2013. See Note 3 for further information. For purposes of calculating diluted earnings per share for 2013, the potentially dilutive shares would have been pro-rated based on the period they were outstanding but were antidilutive.

The following table presents the potential shares excluded from the diluted earnings per share calculation because the effect of including these potential shares would be antidilutive.


We converted all of our Series B Preferred Stock into common stock in October 2013. See Note 3 for further information. For purposes of calculating diluted earnings per share for 2013, the potentially dilutive shares would have been pro-rated based on the period they were outstanding but were antidilutive.


These options are outstanding at the end of the respective periods. In any period in which the exercise price is less than the average market price, these options have the potential to be dilutive, and application of the treasury stock method would reduce this amount.

Note 5:  Acquisitions

We continue to evaluate strategic opportunities to expand our industry expertise, strengthen our position in high-growth and key strategic geographical markets and industry sectors, advance technological capabilities and improve operational efficiency through both acquisitions and increased ownership interests in current investments. Our acquisitions typically provide for an initial payment at the time of closing and additional contingent purchase price payments based on the future performance of the acquired entity.  We have entered into agreements that may require us to purchase additional equity interests in certain consolidated and unconsolidated subsidiaries. The amounts at which we record these transactions in our financial statements are based on estimates of the future financial performance of the acquired entity, the timing of the exercise of these rights, changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other factors.



Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – (continued)

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)

For companies acquired, we estimate the fair values of the assets and liabilities based on 100% of the business for consolidation. The purchase price in excess of the estimated fair value of the tangible net assets acquired is allocated to identifiable intangible assets and then to goodwill.  Due to the characteristics of advertising, specialized marketing and communication services companies, our acquisitions typically do not have significant amounts of tangible assets since the principal assets we acquire are client relationships and talent.  As a result, a substantial portion of the purchase price is primarily allocated to customer lists, trade names and goodwill.

For acquisitions we record deferred payment and redeemable noncontrolling interest amounts on our Consolidated Balance Sheets based on their acquisition-date fair value.  Deferred payments are recorded on a discounted basis and adjusted quarterly, if necessary, through operating income or net interest expense, depending on the nature of the arrangement, for both changes in estimate and accretion between the acquisition date and the final payment date.  See Note 15 for further information on contingent acquisition obligations.  Redeemable noncontrolling interests are adjusted quarterly to their estimated redemption value, but not less than their initial fair value.  Any adjustments to the redemption value impacts retained earnings or additional paid-in capital, except for foreign currency translation adjustments. The following table presents changes in our redeemable noncontrolling interests.

For all acquisitions, if a portion of the deferred payments and purchases of additional interests after the effective date of purchase are contingent upon employment terms, then that amount is accounted separately from the business combination and  recognized as compensation expense over the required earn-out period.  Payments deemed as compensation are excluded from the fair value purchase price allocation to tangible net assets and intangible assets acquired.

During


, we completed

eleven

acquisitions,

nine

of which were included in the Integrated Agency Networks ("IAN") operating segment and

two

of which were included in the Constituency Management Group ("CMG") operating segment. All acquired agencies have been integrated into one of our global networks or existing agencies.

10.00%

Notes. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

Sales of Businesses and Investments

– During


, we recognized gains from the sale of marketable securities in the Asia Pacific region within our IAN segment and the sale of investments in our Rabbi Trusts, which was partially offset by a loss from the sale of a business in the United Kingdom within our IAN segment.  During 2012, we recognized gains from the sale of our remaining holdings in Facebook and a business in an international market within our CMG segment, which were partially offset by losses from the sale of businesses within our IAN segment, as well as an adjustment relating to a reserve for a change in estimate in connection with a business disposed of in a prior year.  During 2011, we recognized a gain from the sale of approximately half of our holdings in Facebook, which was partially offset by a loss relating to the sale of a business in the domestic market within our IAN segment.

Vendor Discounts and Credit Adjustments

–  In connection with the liabilities related to vendor discounts and credits established as part of the restatement we presented in our 2004 Annual Report on Form 10-K, these adjustments reflect the reversal of certain of these liabilities primarily where the statute of limitations has lapsed, or as a result of differences resulting from settlements with clients or vendors.

Other Income (Expense), net

– During


, other income (expense), net primarily included a non-cash gain on re-measurement to fair value of an equity interest in an affiliate, located in the Asia Pacific region within our CMG segment, upon acquiring a controlling interest.

Share Repurchase Program

In February 2012, our Board of Directors (the "Board") authorized a share repurchase program to repurchase from time to time up to

$300.0

, excluding fees, of our common stock (the "2012 share repurchase program"). In November 2012, the Board authorized an increase in the amount available under our 2012 share repurchase program up to

$400.0

, excluding fees, of our common stock, as a result of the sale of our remaining holdings in Facebook. In February 2013, the Board authorized a new share repurchase program to repurchase from time to time up to

$300.0

, excluding fees, of our common stock (the "2013 share repurchase program"). In March 2013, the Board authorized an increase in the amount available under our 2013 share repurchase program up to

$500.0

, excluding fees, of our common stock to be used towards the repurchase of shares resulting from the conversion to common stock of the 4.75% Notes.

We may effect such repurchases through open market purchases, trading plans established in accordance with SEC rules, derivative transactions or other means.

Note 7:  Intangible Assets

Goodwill

Goodwill is the excess purchase price remaining from an acquisition after an allocation of purchase price has been made to identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on estimated fair values.  The changes in the carrying value of goodwill for our segments, IAN and CMG, for the

years ended December 31,


and


are listed below.


For all periods presented we have not recorded a goodwill impairment charge.


Primarily includes foreign currency translation adjustments.

See Note 1 for information regarding our annual impairment methodology.

Other Intangible Assets

Other intangible assets are comprised of assets with indefinite lives not subject to amortization and assets with definite lives subject to amortization. Other intangible assets primarily consist of customer lists and trade names, which have definitive lives and are subject to amortization on a straight-line basis with estimated useful lives generally between


and


years.  Amortization expense for other intangible assets for the

years ended December 31,

The components of income before income taxes, equity earnings and the impact of noncontrolling interests are listed below.

The provision for income taxes is listed below.



Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – (continued)

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)

A reconciliation of the effective income tax rate before equity earnings and the impact of noncontrolling interests as reflected in our Consolidated Statements of Operations to the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate is listed below.


Reflects changes in valuation allowance that impacted the effective income tax rate for each year presented.

In


, our effective income tax rate of

38.7%

was positively impacted by the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits as a result of  the recognition of losses attributable to worthless securities in a consolidated subsidiary and the settlement of the 2002-2006 New York State audit cycle. Our effective income tax rate was negatively impacted primarily by losses in certain foreign jurisdictions where we receive no tax benefit due to

100%

valuation allowances.

In


, our effective income tax rate of

31.6%

was positively impacted by the reversals of valuation allowances associated with the Asia Pacific and Continental Europe regions, of

$26.2

and

$21.8

, respectively, as well as by a benefit derived from the deduction of foreign tax credits that previously had a full valuation allowance. Our effective income tax rate was negatively impacted by an adjustment of

$19.5

associated with the establishment of a previously unrecorded reserve for a tax contingency for the years 2007 through 2010, losses in certain foreign locations where we receive no tax benefit due to

100%

valuation allowances and state and local income taxes, net of federal income tax benefit.

The components of deferred tax assets and liabilities are listed below.

We evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis. A valuation allowance is established when it is “more likely than not” that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. In circumstances where there is negative evidence, establishment of a valuation allowance is considered. We believe that cumulative losses in the most recent three-year



Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – (continued)

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)

period represent significant negative evidence, and as a result, we determined that certain of our deferred tax assets required the establishment of a valuation allowance.  The realization of our deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on future earnings. The amount of the deferred tax assets considered realizable could be reduced in the near future if estimates of future taxable income are lower than anticipated.  The deferred tax assets for which an allowance was recognized relate primarily to state and foreign tax loss carryforwards.

The change in the valuation allowance is listed below.

In


, amounts charged to costs and expenses primarily relate to the increase in valuation allowances in the U.S. and Continental Europe regions for existing and additional deferred tax assets. The amounts charged to gross tax assets and other accounts relate primarily to the effect of foreign currency translation.

In


, amounts reversed to costs and expenses primarily relate to the net reversal of valuation allowances in the Asia Pacific and Continental Europe regions, based on positive evidence in the form of a sustained pattern of profitability.  Amounts reversed to gross tax assets and other accounts relate primarily to the reversal of valuation allowance on foreign tax credits.

In


, amounts reversed to costs and expenses primarily relate to the utilization of capital loss carryforwards and the expiration of foreign tax credits on which 100% valuation allowances had been established, and the net reversal of valuation allowances based on positive evidence in the form of a sustained pattern of profitability.  These reversals were partially offset by the establishment of an additional deferred tax asset and a corresponding valuation allowance for a Luxembourg tax loss carryforward.

As of

December 31, 2013

, there are

$1,407.1

of loss carryforwards. These loss carryforwards are all non-U.S. tax loss carryforwards, of which

$1,147.2

have unlimited carryforward periods and

$259.9

have expiration periods from


to


.

As of

December 31, 2013

and


, we had

$1,959.8

and

$2,110.0

, respectively, of undistributed earnings attributable to foreign subsidiaries. It is our intention to permanently reinvest undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries. We have not provided deferred U.S. income taxes or foreign withholding taxes on temporary differences resulting from earnings for certain foreign subsidiaries which are permanently reinvested outside the U.S.  It is not practicable to determine the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability associated with these temporary differences.

The table below summarizes the activity related to our unrecognized tax benefits.

Included in the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits of

$219.2

as of

December 31, 2013

, is

$207.9

of tax benefits that, if recognized, would impact the effective income tax rate.  The total amount of accrued interest and penalties as of

December 31, 2013

and


is

$11.9

and

$13.5

, respectively, of which a detriment of

$2.8

and

$1.4

is included in our


and


Consolidated Statements of Operations, respectively.  In accordance with our accounting policy, interest and penalties accrued on unrecognized tax benefits are classified as income taxes in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.

In 2013, we settled the


-


NYS audit cycle.  The settlement resulted in a minor cash payment and our effective income tax rate was positively impacted by the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits.



Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – (continued)

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)

In 2011, we effectively settled the


-


IRS audit cycle.  The settlement resulted in no cash payment and our effective income tax rate was positively impacted by the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits.

We have various tax years under examination by tax authorities in various countries, and in various states, such as New York, in which we have significant business operations.  It is not yet known whether these examinations will, in the aggregate, result in our paying additional taxes.  We believe our tax reserves are adequate in relation to the potential for additional assessments in each of the jurisdictions in which we are subject to taxation.  We regularly assess the likelihood of additional tax assessments in those jurisdictions and, if necessary, adjust our reserves as additional information or events require.

With respect to all tax years open to examination by U.S. federal, various state and local, and non-U.S. tax authorities, we currently anticipate that total unrecognized tax benefits will decrease by an amount between

$10.0

and

$20.0

in the next twelve months, a portion of which will affect our effective income tax rate, primarily as a result of the settlement of tax examinations and the lapsing of statutes of limitations.  This net decrease is related to various items of income and expense, primarily transfer pricing adjustments.

We are effectively settled with respect to U.S. income tax audits for years prior to


.  With limited exceptions, we are no longer subject to state and local income tax audits for years prior to


, or non-U.S. income tax audits for years prior to


.

Note 9: Restructuring and Other Reorganization-Related Charges (Reversals), net

The components of restructuring and other reorganization-related charges (reversals), net for 2013 and prior restructuring plans are listed below.

2013 Restructuring Plan

In the fourth quarter of 2013, the Company implemented a cost savings initiative (the "2013 Plan") to better align our cost structure with our revenue, primarily in Continental Europe. In connection with this initiative, the Company recorded pre-tax restructuring charges of

$61.2

comprised of severance and termination costs of

$55.9

, lease terminations costs of

$4.8

, and other exit costs of

$0.5

. All restructuring actions were identified and initiated by the end of 2013, with all actions expected to be substantially completed by the end of the first quarter of 2014.

Severance and termination costs relate to a planned reduction in workforce of


employees. The employee groups affected include all levels and functions across the Company: executive, regional and account management and administrative, creative and media production personnel. Severance payments are expected to be substantially complete by the end of 2014.

Lease termination costs, net of estimated sublease income, relate to the offices that were vacated as part of the 2013 Plan. Given the remaining lease terms involved, the cash portion of the charge will be paid out over a period of several years. The charges related to leases terminated are recorded at fair value with the discount relating to lease terminations to be amortized over future periods.  Other exit costs are principally related to legal fees.

A summary of the liability for restructuring charges related to the 2013 Plan is as follows:

Net restructuring charges related to the 2013 Plan for the year ended December 31, 2013 was comprised of net charges of approximately

$56

at IAN and

$5

at CMG.



Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)

Prior Restructuring Plans

The 2007, 2003 and 2001 restructuring plans (the "Prior Restructuring Plans") with current year activity included net (reversals) charges that are adjustments primarily resulting from changes in management’s estimates relating to sublease rental income assumptions. For the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, the Prior Restructuring Plans incurred net restructuring and other reorganization-related (reversals) charges of

$(0.6)

,

$(1.2)

and

$1.0

, respectively.  As of December 31, 2013, the remaining liability for the Prior Restructuring Plans was

$1.3

.

Amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax for the

year ended December 31,


are as follows:


These accumulated other comprehensive loss components are included in the computation of net periodic cost. See Note 13 for further information

Note 11:  Incentive Compensation Plans


Performance Incentive Plan

We issue stock and cash-based incentive awards to our employees under a plan established by the Compensation and Leadership Talent Committee of the Board of Directors (the “Compensation Committee”) and approved by our shareholders. In May


, our shareholders approved the


Performance Incentive Plan (the “


PIP”), which replaced previous incentive plans. The number of shares of common stock initially available for granting new stock options and stock appreciation rights under the


PIP was

8.1

. The number of shares of common stock initially available for performance-based awards and other stock-based awards under the


PIP was

26.5

. Subject to the terms of the


PIP, there are limits on the number of shares that may be awarded to any one participant for each type of award. The vesting period of awards granted is generally commensurate with the requisite service period. We generally issue new shares to satisfy the exercise of stock options or the distribution of other stock-based awards.



Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – (continued)

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)

Additionally, under the


PIP, we are able to grant performance cash awards. The performance cash awards are granted to certain employees who otherwise would have been eligible to receive performance-based stock awards. These awards have a service period vesting condition and a performance vesting condition. The amount of the performance cash award received by an employee with a performance vesting condition can

range from 0% to 300% of the target amount

of the original grant value. Performance cash awards generally vest in

three years

.  A committee of the Board of Directors may grant performance cash awards to any eligible employee; however, no employee can receive more than

$6.0

during a performance period. Performance cash awards may be settled in shares on the vest date. The number of shares to be settled on the vesting date will be calculated as the cash value adjusted for performance divided by our stock price on the vesting date.

The amount of stock-based compensation expense as reflected in salaries and related expenses in our Consolidated Statement of Operations, and the related tax benefit, are listed below.


Represents charges recorded for severance expense related to stock-based compensation awards.

Stock Options

Stock options are granted with the exercise price equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the grant date. They are generally exercisable between

two

and

four years

from the grant date and expire

ten years

from the grant date (or earlier in the case of certain terminations of employment).

The following tables are a summary of stock option activity during


.



Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – (continued)

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)

There were

5.2

,

1.2

and

1.3

stock options exercised in


,


and


, respectively.  The total intrinsic value of stock options exercised during


,


and


was

$26.2

,

$2.0

and

$3.2

, respectively. The cash received from the stock options exercised in


,


and


was

$59.5

,

$11.7

and

$13.3

, respectively.  As of

December 31, 2013

, there was

$3.3

of total unrecognized compensation expense related to non-vested stock options granted, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of

1.4 years

.

We use the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to estimate the fair value of options granted, which requires the input of subjective assumptions including the option’s expected term and the price volatility of the underlying stock. Changes in the assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value and our results of operations could be materially impacted. The weighted-average grant-date fair value per option during the

years ended December 31,


,


and


was

$4.14

,

$4.24

and

$4.57

, respectively.

The fair value of each option grant has been estimated with the following weighted-average assumptions.


The expected volatility used to estimate the fair value of stock options awarded is based on a blend of: (i) historical volatility of our common stock for periods equal to the expected term of our stock options and (ii) implied volatility of tradable forward put and call options to purchase and sell shares of our common stock.


The estimate of our expected term is based on the average of (i) an assumption that all outstanding options are exercised upon achieving their full vesting date and (ii) an assumption that all outstanding options will be exercised at the midpoint between the current date (i.e., the date awards have ratably vested through) and their full contractual term. In determining the estimate, we considered several factors, including the historical option exercise behavior of our employees and the terms and vesting periods of the options.


The risk free rate is determined using the implied yield currently available for zero-coupon U.S. government issuers with a remaining term equal to the expected term of the options.


The expected dividend yield is calculated based on an annualized dividend of

$0.30

per share in 2013 and

$0.24

per share in 2012 and 2011.

Stock-Based Compensation

We grant other stock-based compensation awards such as stock-settled awards, cash-settled awards and performance-based awards (settled in cash or shares) to certain key employees. The number of shares or units received by an employee for performance-based awards depends on Company performance against specific performance targets and could

range from 0% to 300% of the target amount

of shares originally granted. Incentive awards are subject to certain restrictions and vesting requirements as determined by the Compensation Committee. The fair value of the shares on the grant date is amortized over the vesting period, which is generally

three years

. Upon completion of the vesting period for cash-settled awards, the grantee is entitled to receive a payment in cash based on the fair market value of the corresponding number of shares of common stock. No monetary consideration is paid by a recipient for any incentive award. The fair value of cash-settled awards is adjusted each quarter based on our share price. The holders of stock-settled awards have absolute ownership interest in the underlying shares of common stock prior to vesting, which includes the right to vote and receive dividends.  Dividends declared on common stock are accrued during the vesting period and paid when the award vests. The holders of cash-settled and performance-based awards have no ownership interest in the underlying shares of common stock until the awards vest and the shares of common stock are issued.

Stock-based compensation awards expected to be settled in cash have been classified as liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of

December 31, 2013

and


.

A summary of the activity of our non-vested stock-settled awards, cash-settled awards, and performance-based awards during

100%

of the shares originally granted).

During


,


and


, additional performance cash awards with a total target value of

$35.6

,

$33.6

and

$31.9

respectively, were awarded under the


PIP and will be settled in shares upon vesting, which is

three years

from the grant date.  As of

December 31, 2013

, there was

$31.9

of total unrecognized compensation expense related to these awards, which is expected to be recognized over a remaining weighted-average period of

1.9 years

.

In conjunction with our annual grant of long-term incentive compensation awards, we reviewed our estimates and assumptions in


, which resulted in an increase to our estimated forfeiture rate, as our review of our actual forfeitures indicated a higher level of forfeitures than previously assumed.


Restricted Cash Plan

In March


, the Compensation Committee approved the Interpublic Restricted Cash Plan (the “Cash Plan”). Under the Cash Plan, the Board, the Compensation Committee or the Plan Administrator may grant cash awards to certain employees eligible to receive stock-settled and cash-settled awards. Cash awards, when granted, have a service period vesting condition and generally vest in

three years

.

Cash Awards

During the

years ended December 31,


,


and


, the Compensation Committee granted cash awards under the Cash Plan with a total target value of

$4.6

,

$2.7

and

$4.2

, respectively, and we recognized

$4.0

,

$10.9

and

$16.6

, respectively, in salaries and related expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.

During the

years ended December 31,


,


and


, the Compensation Committee granted performance awards to be settled in cash under the


PIP with a total target value of

$47.4

,

$37.4

, and

$39.3

, respectively, and we recognized

$18.3

,

$18.9

and

$22.0

, respectively, in salaries and related expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.

We amortize the present value of the amount expected to vest for cash awards and performance cash awards over the vesting period using the straight-line method, less an assumed forfeiture rate. Cash awards do not fall within the scope of the authoritative guidance for stock compensation as they are not paid in equity and the value of the award is not correlated with our stock price. Due to the cash nature of the payouts and the vesting period, we account for these awards in accordance with authoritative guidance for deferred compensation arrangements.

Employee Stock Purchase Plans

The Interpublic Group of Companies Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “ESPP Plan”) became active

April 1, 2007

.  Under the ESPP Plan, eligible employees may purchase our common stock through payroll deductions not exceeding

10%

of their eligible compensation or


(actual number) shares each offering period. The price an employee pays for a share of common stock under the ESPP Plan is

90% of the lesser of the average market price of a share on the first business day of the offering period or the average market price of a share on the last business day of the offering period of three months

.  An aggregate of

15.0

shares are reserved for issuance under the ESPP Plan, of which

2.6

shares have been issued through

December 31, 2013

.

Note 12:  Fair Value Measurements

Authoritative guidance for fair value measurements establishes a fair value hierarchy which requires us to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. There are three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:

Financial Instruments that are Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis

We primarily apply the market approach to determine the fair value of financial instruments that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis.  There were no changes to our valuation techniques used to determine the fair value of financial instruments during


as compared to the prior year.



Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – (continued)

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)

The following tables present information about our financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of

December 31, 2013

and 2012, and indicates the fair value hierarchy of the valuation techniques utilized to determine such fair value.


Relates to unconditional obligations to purchase additional noncontrolling equity shares of consolidated subsidiaries.  Fair value measurement of the obligation was based upon the amount payable as if the forward contracts were settled.  The amount redeemable within the next twelve months is classified in accrued liabilities; any interests redeemable thereafter are classified in other non-current liabilities.

The following tables present additional information about financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis and for which we utilize Level 3 inputs to determine fair value.

Level 3 reductions primarily consist of cash payments made related to unconditional obligations to purchase additional equity interests in previous acquisitions, which are classified within the financing section of our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Level 3 additions relate to new unconditional obligations to purchase additional equity interests in previous acquisitions for cash in future periods.  Realized losses included in net income for mandatorily redeemable noncontrolling interests are reported as a component of interest expense in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.



Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – (continued)

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)

Gross unrealized and realized gains and losses for our long-term investments and short-term marketable securities were not material for the years ended

December 31, 2013

,


and


.

Financial Instruments that are not Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis

The following table presents information about our financial instruments that are not measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of

December 31, 2013

, and indicates the fair value hierarchy of the valuation techniques utilized to determine such fair value.

Our long-term debt comprises senior notes and other notes payable.  The fair value of our senior notes traded over-the-counter is based on quoted prices for such securities, but which fair value can also be derived from inputs that are readily observable.  Therefore, these senior notes are classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy.  Our other notes payable are not actively traded and their fair value is not solely derived from readily observable inputs.  Thus, the fair value of our other notes payable is determined based on a discounted cash flow model and other proprietary valuation methods, and therefore is classified as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy.  See Note 2 for further information on our long-term debt.

Non-financial Instruments that are Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis

Certain non-financial instruments are measured at fair value on a recurring basis, primarily accrued restructuring charges.  As of

December 31, 2013

, accrued restructuring charges was

$52.2

, which was valued using our internal estimates using a discounted cash flow model and is classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.

Non-financial Instruments that are Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis

Certain non-financial instruments are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, primarily goodwill, intangible assets, and property, plant and equipment.  Accordingly, these assets are not measured and adjusted to fair value on an ongoing basis but are subject to periodic evaluations for potential impairment.

Note 13:  Employee Benefits

Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans

We have a defined benefit pension plan (the “Domestic Pension Plan”) that consists of approximately

4,000

participants and has been closed to new participants.  We also have numerous funded and unfunded plans outside the U.S.  The Interpublic Limited Pension Plan in the U.K. is a defined benefit plan and is our most material foreign pension plan in terms of the benefit obligation and plan assets.  Some of our domestic and foreign subsidiaries provide postretirement health benefits and life insurance to eligible employees and, in certain cases, their dependents.  The domestic postretirement benefit plan is our most material postretirement benefit plan in terms of the benefit obligation.  This plan consists of approximately

2,300

participants, is closed to new participants and is unfunded.

Differences between the aggregate income statement and balance sheet amounts listed in the tables below and the totals reported in our Consolidated Statements of Operations, Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income and Consolidated Balance Sheets relate to non-material foreign pension and postretirement benefit plans.

Pension and Postretirement Benefit Obligation

The change in the benefit obligation, the change in plan assets, the funded status and amounts recognized for the domestic pension plan, the significant foreign pension plans and the domestic postretirement benefit plan are listed below.

In


, we estimate that we will recognize

and

$3.5

of net actuarial losses from accumulated other comprehensive loss, net into net periodic cost related to our domestic pension plan and significant foreign pension plans, respectively.



Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – (continued)

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)

Net Periodic Cost

The components of net periodic benefit cost and key assumptions are listed below.

Assumptions

Discount Rates

– At

December 31, 2013

,


and


, we determined our discount rates for our domestic pension plan, foreign pension plans and domestic postretirement benefit plan based on either a bond selection/settlement approach or bond yield curve approach.  Using the bond selection/settlement approach, we determine the discount rate by selecting a portfolio of corporate bonds appropriate to provide for the projected benefit payments.  Using the bond yield curve approach, we determine the discount rate by matching the plans' cash flows to spot rates developed from a yield curve.  Both approaches utilize high quality AA-rated corporate bonds and the plans' projected cash flows to develop a discounted value of the benefit payments, which is then used to develop a single discount rate.  In countries where markets for high-quality long-term AA corporate bonds are not well developed, a portfolio of long-term government bonds is used as a basis to develop hypothetical corporate bond yields, which serve as a basis to derive the discount rate.

Expected Return on Assets

– Our expected rate of return is determined at the beginning of each year and considers asset class index returns over various market and economic conditions, current and expected market conditions, risk premiums associated



Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – (continued)

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)

with asset classes and long-term inflation rates.  We determine both a short-term and long-term view and then select a long-term rate of return assumption that matches the duration of our liabilities.

Fair Value of Pension Plan Assets

The following table presents the fair value of our domestic and foreign pension plan assets as of

December 31, 2013

and


, and indicates the fair value hierarchy of the valuation techniques utilized to determine such fair value.  See Note 12 for a description of the fair value hierarchy.

Investment funds include mutual funds, common/collective trusts, hedge funds and other commingled assets that are invested primarily in equity and fixed income securities.  Mutual funds, which are publicly traded, are primarily valued using recently reported sales prices.  Investment funds, which are not publicly traded, are valued based on the net asset value of shares held by the plan at year end, which reflects the fair value of the underlying investments.  Insurance contracts are valued based on the cash surrender value of the contract.  Limited partnerships are invested primarily in equity and fixed income securities.  Other investments primarily include cash and cash equivalents, equity securities, derivatives and fixed income securities such as government and investment-grade corporate bonds.

The following table presents additional information about our domestic and foreign pension plan assets for which we utilize Level 3 inputs to determine fair value.

Asset Allocation

The primary investment goal for our plans’ assets is to maximize total asset returns while ensuring the plans’ assets are available to fund the plans’ liabilities as they become due.  The plans’ assets in aggregate and at the individual portfolio level are invested so that total portfolio risk exposure and risk-adjusted returns best achieve this objective.  The aggregate amount of our own stock held as investment for our domestic and foreign pension funds is considered negligible relative to the total fund assets.  As of

December 31, 2013

, the weighted-average target and actual asset allocations relating to our domestic and foreign pension plans' assets are listed below.

Cash Flows

During


, we contributed

$0.5

and

$18.3

of cash to our domestic and foreign pension plans, respectively. For


, we expect to contribute approximately

$3.0

and

$25.0

of cash to our domestic and foreign pension plans, respectively.

The following estimated future benefit payments, which reflect future service, as appropriate, are expected to be paid in the years indicated below.

The estimated future payments for our domestic postretirement benefit plan is before any estimated federal subsidies expected to be received under the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003.

The following federal subsidies are expected to be received in the years indicated below.

Savings Plans

We sponsor defined contribution plans (the “Savings Plans”) that cover substantially all domestic employees.  The Savings Plans permit participants to make contributions on a pre-tax and/or after-tax basis and allow participants to choose among various investment alternatives.  We match a portion of participant contributions based upon their years of service.  Amounts expensed for the Savings Plans for


,


and


were

$37.7

,

$35.6

and

$35.4

, respectively.  Expense includes a discretionary Company contribution of

$4.9

,

$4.8

and

$3.7

offset by participant forfeitures of

$3.3

,

$3.0

and

$2.6

in


,


and


, respectively.  In addition, we maintain defined contribution plans in various foreign countries and contributed

$36.9

,

$34.0

and

$30.8

to these plans in


,


and


, respectively.

Deferred Compensation and Benefit Arrangements

We have deferred compensation arrangements which (i) permit certain of our key officers and employees to defer a portion of their salary or incentive compensation, or (ii) require us to contribute an amount to the participant’s account.  The arrangements typically provide that the participant will receive the amounts deferred plus interest upon attaining certain conditions, such as completing a certain number of years of service or upon retirement or termination.  As of

December 31, 2013

and


, the deferred compensation liability balance was

$92.7

and

$90.0

, respectively.  Amounts expensed for deferred compensation arrangements in


,


and


were

$13.4

,

$9.8

and

$7.6

, respectively.

We have deferred benefit arrangements with certain key officers and employees that provide participants with an annual payment, payable when the participant attains a certain age and after the participant’s employment has terminated.  The deferred benefit liability was

$166.2

and

$173.8

as of

December 31, 2013

and


, respectively.  Amounts expensed for deferred benefit arrangements in


,


and


were

$14.0

,

$15.0

and

$14.8

, respectively.

We have purchased life insurance policies on participants’ lives to assist in the funding of the related deferred compensation and deferred benefit liabilities.  As of

December 31, 2013

and


, the cash surrender value of these policies was

$162.3

and

$150.2

, respectively.  In addition to the life insurance policies, certain investments are held for the purpose of paying the deferred compensation and deferred benefit liabilities.  These investments, along with the life insurance policies, are held in a separate revocable trust for the purpose of paying the deferred compensation and the deferred benefit arrangement liabilities.  As of



Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – (continued)

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)

December 31, 2013

and


, the value of such investments in the trust was

$7.7

and

$5.9

, respectively.  The short-term investments are included in cash and cash equivalents, and the long-term investments and cash surrender value of the policies are included in other assets.

Long-Term Disability Plan

We have a long-term disability plan which provides income replacement benefits to eligible participants who are unable to perform their job duties during the first

24 months

of disability.  Income replacement benefits are continued thereafter if the participant is unable to perform any job related to his or her education, training or experience.  As all income replacement benefits are fully insured,

no

related obligation is required as of

December 31, 2013

and


.  In addition to income replacement benefits, plan participants may remain covered for certain health and life insurance benefits up to age 65, and accordingly, we have recorded an obligation of

$10.5

and

$11.3

as of

December 31, 2013

and


, respectively.

Note 14:  Segment Information

As of

December 31, 2013

, we have two reportable segments, which are IAN and CMG. IAN is comprised of McCann Worldgroup, Draftfcb, Lowe & Partners, IPG Mediabrands, our digital specialist agencies, and our domestic integrated agencies.  CMG is comprised of a number of our specialist marketing services offerings.  We also report results for the “Corporate and other” group.

Within IAN, our agencies provide a comprehensive array of global communications and marketing services, each offering a distinctive range of solutions for our clients. Our digital specialist agencies provide unique digital capabilities and service their own client rosters while also serving as key digital partners. In addition, our domestic integrated agencies, including Hill Holliday, Carmichael Lynch and Mullen, provide a full range of advertising, marketing communications services and/or marketing services and partner with our global operating divisions as needed. IAN’s operating divisions share similar economic characteristics and are similar in other areas, specifically related to the nature of their services, the manner in which the services are provided and the similarity of their respective customers.

CMG, which includes Weber Shandwick, FutureBrand, DeVries, GolinHarris, Jack Morton, and Octagon Worldwide, provides clients with diversified services, including public relations, meeting and event production, sports and entertainment marketing, corporate and brand identity and strategic marketing consulting.  CMG shares some similarities with service lines offered by IAN; however, on an aggregate basis, CMG has a higher proportion of arrangements for which they act as principal, a different distribution model than IAN and different margin structure.

The profitability measure employed by our chief operating decision maker for allocating resources to operating divisions and assessing operating division performance is operating income, excluding the impact of restructuring and other reorganization-related charges (reversals), net.  With the exception of excluding these amounts from reportable segment operating income, all segments follow the same accounting policies as those described in Note 1.

Certain corporate and other charges are reported as a separate line item within total segment operating income and include corporate office expenses, as well as shared service center expenses and certain other centrally managed expenses that are not fully allocated to operating divisions.  Salaries and related expenses include salaries, long-term incentive awards, annual bonuses and other miscellaneous benefits for corporate office employees.  Office and general expenses primarily include professional fees related to internal control compliance, financial statement audits and legal, information technology and other consulting services, which are engaged and managed through the corporate office.  In addition, office and general expenses includes rental expense and depreciation of leasehold improvements for properties occupied by corporate office employees.  A portion of centrally managed expenses are allocated to operating divisions based on a formula that uses the planned revenues of each of the operating units.  Amounts allocated also include specific charges for information technology-related projects, which are allocated based on utilization.



Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – (continued)

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)

Summarized financial information concerning our reportable segments is shown in the following table.



Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – (continued)

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)

Revenue and long-lived assets, excluding intangible assets, are presented by major geographic area in the following table.

Revenue is primarily attributed to geographic areas based on where the services are performed.  Furniture, equipment and leasehold improvements are allocated based upon physical location.  Other assets and investments are allocated based on the location of the related operations.

Note 15:  Commitments and Contingencies

Leases

We lease office premises and equipment. Where leases contain escalation clauses or concessions, such as rent holidays and landlord/tenant incentives or allowances, the impact of such adjustments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the minimum lease period. Certain leases provide for renewal options and require the payment of real estate taxes or other occupancy costs, which are also subject to escalation clauses. Net rent expense is listed in the table below.

Cash amounts for future minimum lease commitments for office premises and equipment under non-cancelable leases, along with minimum sublease rental income to be received under non-cancelable subleases, are listed in the table below.

Guarantees

We have guaranteed certain obligations of our subsidiaries relating principally to operating leases and credit facilities of certain subsidiaries.  The amount of parent company guarantees on lease obligations was

$588.1

and

$410.3

as of

December 31, 2013

and


, respectively, and the amount of parent company guarantees primarily relating to credit facilities was

$279.6

and

$283.4

as of

December 31, 2013

and


, respectively.  In the event of non-payment by the applicable subsidiary of the obligations covered by a guarantee, we would be obligated to pay the amounts covered by that guarantee.  As of

December 31, 2013

, there were

no

material assets pledged as security for such parent company guarantees.



Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – (continued)

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)

Contingent Acquisition Obligations

The following table details the estimated future contingent acquisition obligations payable in cash as of

December 31, 2013

.


We have entered into certain acquisitions that contain both redeemable noncontrolling interests and call options with similar terms and conditions.  We have certain redeemable noncontrolling interests that are exercisable at the discretion of the noncontrolling equity owners as of

December 31, 2013

. These estimated payments of

$23.8

are included within the total payments expected to be made in


, and will continue to be carried forward into


or beyond until exercised or expired.  Redeemable noncontrolling interests are included in the table at current exercise price payable in cash, not at applicable redemption value in accordance with the authoritative guidance for classification and measurement of redeemable securities.

The estimated amounts listed would be paid in the event of exercise at the earliest exercise date.  See Note 5 for further information relating to the payment structure of our acquisitions.  All payments are contingent upon achieving projected operating performance targets and satisfying other conditions specified in the related agreements and are subject to revisions as the earn-out periods progress.

Legal Matters

We are involved in various legal proceedings, and subject to investigations, inspections, audits, inquiries and similar actions by governmental authorities, arising in the normal course of business.  We evaluate all cases each reporting period and record liabilities for losses from legal proceedings when we determine that it is probable that the outcome in a legal proceeding will be unfavorable and the amount, or potential range, of loss can be reasonably estimated.  In certain cases, we cannot reasonably estimate the potential loss because, for example, the litigation is in its early stages. While any outcome related to litigation or such governmental proceedings in which we are involved cannot be predicted with certainty, management believes that the outcome of these matters, individually and in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

Note 16:  Recent Accounting Standards

Comprehensive Income

In February 2013, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued amended guidance for presenting comprehensive income, which is effective for us January 1, 2013, and applied prospectively. This amended guidance requires an entity to disclose significant amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component and their corresponding effect on the respective line items in net income. The adoption of this amended guidance required us to include additional disclosures in our Consolidated Financial Statements.  See Note 10 for further information.

Unrecognized Tax Benefits

In July 2013, the FASB issued amended guidance on the presentation of unrecognized tax benefits when a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss or a tax credit carryforward exists at the reporting date. The amended guidance requires an entity to present unrecognized tax benefits as a reduction to the deferred tax assets created by net operating losses, similar tax losses or tax credits that occur in the same taxing jurisdiction.  To the extent that the unrecognized tax benefit exceeds these losses or credits, it shall be presented as a liability. We elected to adopt the guidance as of December 31, 2013. The adoption of this amended guidance did not have a significant impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Note 18:  Subsequent Events

In

February 2014

, we announced that our Board had approved a new share repurchase program to repurchase from time to time up to

$300.0

, excluding fees, of our common stock (the "2014 share repurchase program"). The authorization for repurchases under the 2014 share repurchase program is in addition to any amounts remaining available for repurchase under the 2013 share repurchase program. See Note 6 for further information on the 2013 share repurchase program. We may effect such repurchases under the 2014 share repurchase program through open market purchases, trading plans established in accordance with SEC rules, derivative transactions or other means. The timing and amount of repurchases under the authorization will depend on market conditions and other funding requirements. There is no expiration date associated with the share repurchase programs.

We also announced in

February 2014

, that our Board had declared a common stock cash dividend of

$0.095

per share, payable on

March 17, 2014

to holders of record as of the close of business on

Controls and Procedures

Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures

In connection with the preparation of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended

December 31, 2013

, we have carried out an evaluation under the supervision of, and with the participation of, our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)).  Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded (1) that the disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of

December 31, 2013

to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and (2) that the disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of

December 31, 2013

to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of the controls and procedures.  Accordingly, even effective disclosure controls and procedures can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives.

Management’s report on internal control over financial reporting

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f).  Management (with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer) conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework

(1992)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.  Based on this evaluation, management concluded that IPG’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of

December 31, 2013

. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited the effectiveness of IPG’s internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2013

, as stated in their report which appears in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Changes in internal control over financial reporting

There has been no change in internal control over financial reporting in the quarter ended

December 31, 2013

that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
