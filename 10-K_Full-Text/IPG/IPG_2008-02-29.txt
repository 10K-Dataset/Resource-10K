    this report under Item 1A, Risk Factors. Forward-looking
    statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we
    undertake no obligation to update publicly any of them in light
    of new information or future events.

Forward-looking statements involve inherent risks and
    uncertainties. A number of important factors could cause actual
    results to differ materially from those contained in any
    forward-looking statement. Such factors include, but are not
    limited to, the following:

•

our ability to attract new clients and retain existing clients;

•

our ability to retain and attract key employees;

•

risks associated with assumptions we make in connection with our
    critical accounting estimates;

•

potential adverse effects if we are required to recognize
    impairment charges or other adverse accounting-related
    developments;

•

potential adverse developments in connection with the ongoing
    Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”)
    investigation;

•

risks associated with the effects of global, national and
    regional economic and political conditions, including
    fluctuations in economic growth rates, interest rates and
    currency exchange rates; and

•

developments from changes in the regulatory and legal
    environment for advertising and marketing and communications
    services companies around the world.

Investors should carefully consider these factors and the
    additional risk factors outlined in more detail in Item 1A,
    Risk Factors, in this report.



PART I

Item 1.

Business

The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc. was incorporated in
    Delaware in September 1930 under the name of McCann-Erickson
    Incorporated as the successor to the advertising agency
    businesses founded in 1902 by A.W. Erickson and in 1911 by
    Harrison K. McCann. The Company has operated under the
    Interpublic name since January 1961.

About
    Us

We are one of the world’s premier advertising and marketing
    services companies. Our agency brands deliver custom marketing
    solutions to many of the world’s largest marketers. Our
    companies cover the spectrum of marketing disciplines and
    specialties, from consumer advertising and direct marketing to
    mobile and search engine marketing.

The work we produce for our clients is specific to their unique
    needs. Our solutions vary from project-based activity involving
    one agency and its client to long-term, fully-integrated
    campaigns created by a group of our companies working together
    on behalf of a client. With offices in over 100 countries, we
    can operate in a single region or align work globally across all
    major world markets.

The role of the holding company is to provide resources and
    support to ensure that our agencies can best meet our
    clients’ needs. Based in New York City, Interpublic sets
    company-wide financial objectives and corporate strategy,
    directs collaborative inter-agency programs, establishes
    financial management and operational controls, guides personnel
    policy, conducts investor relations and initiates, manages and
    approves mergers and acquisitions. In addition, we provide
    limited centralized functional services that offer our companies
    operational efficiencies, including accounting and finance,
    marketing information retrieval and analysis, legal services,
    real estate expertise, travel services, recruitment aid,
    employee benefits and executive compensation management.

To keep our company well-positioned, we support our
    agencies’ initiatives to expand their high-growth
    capabilities and build their offerings in key developing
    markets. When appropriate, we also develop relationships with
    companies that are building leading-edge marketing tools that
    complement our agencies and the programs they are developing for
    clients. In addition, we look for opportunities within our
    company to modernize operations through mergers, strategic
    alliances and the development of internal programs that
    encourage intra-company collaboration.

Market
    Strategy

We have taken several strategic steps in recent years to
    position our agencies as leaders in the global advertising and
    communications market. We operate in a media landscape that has
    vastly changed over the last few years. Media markets continue
    to fragment and clients face an increasingly complex consumer
    culture.

To stay ahead of these challenges and to achieve our objectives,
    we have invested in creative talent in high-growth areas and
    have realigned a number of our capabilities to meet market
    demand. At our McCann Worldgroup unit, we have continued to
    invest in talent and in upgrading the group’s integrated
    marketing services offering at MRM, Momentum and McCann
    Healthcare. We combined accountable marketing and consumer
    advertising agencies to form the unique global offering
    Draftfcb. And at our marketing services group, Constituency
    Management Group (“CMG”), we continue to strengthen
    our public relations and events marketing specialists.

We have also taken a unique approach to our media offering by
    aligning our largest media assets with global brand agencies.
    This approach ensures that the ideas we develop for clients work
    across new media as well as traditional channels. In 2007, this
    differentiated media strategy gained significant traction in the
    marketplace.



The digital component of our business continues to evolve and is
    increasingly vital to all of our agencies. In order to grow with
    our clients, we have accelerated our investment in talent,
    professional training and technology throughout the
    organization. This reflects our strongly held belief that
    digital marketing is not a silo. Instead, digital capabilities
    must reside in all of our assets. For example, our public
    relations companies increasingly use blogs and social networking
    sites to influence consumer opinion, while our special events
    companies use digital kiosks and website surveys to gauge
    audience response. Recruiting and developing digitally
    conversant talent at all our agencies and in all marketing
    disciplines is therefore a priority and an area where we must be
    willing to invest. Strong, multi-channel talent is vital if we
    are to continue building long-term relationships with our
    clients.

Where necessary, we have acquired or built specialty digital
    assets, such as Reprise Media (search engine marketing), The
    Interpublic Emerging Media Lab, and Ansible (mobile marketing),
    to meet the changing needs of our clients. R/GA, a stand-alone
    digital agency, is an industry leader in the development of
    award-winning interactive campaigns for global clients. All of
    these specialty assets have unique capabilities and serve as key
    digital partners to many of our agencies within the group.

Likewise, we continue to look for strategic investments that
    give us a leadership position in emerging markets. Recent
    investments in India, where we operate three leading agency
    networks, and Brazil give our clients a strong foot-hold in
    these high-growth developing markets. Our partner in Russia is
    the acknowledged advertising leader in the country. In China, we
    continue to invest in our existing companies in the market,
    building on our decades-long commercial history.

We believe that our market strategy and offerings can improve
    our organic revenue growth and operating income margin, with our
    ultimate objective to be fully competitive with our industry
    peer group on both measures. To further improve our operating
    margin we continue to focus on actively managing staff costs in
    non-revenue supporting roles; improving financial systems and
    back-office processing; reducing organizational complexity and
    rationalizing our portfolio by divesting non-core and
    underperforming businesses; and improving our real estate
    utilization.

Our
    Offering

Interpublic is home to some of the world’s best known and
    most innovative communications specialists. We have three global
    brands that provide integrated, large-scale solutions for
    clients: McCann Worldgroup (“McCann”), Draftfcb, and
    Lowe Worldwide (“Lowe”), as well as our domestic
    integrated agencies and media agencies.

•

McCann offers

best-in-class

communications tools and resources to many of the world’s
    top companies and most famous brands. We believe McCann is
    exceptionally qualified to meet client demands, in all regions
    of the world and in all marketing disciplines, through its
    operating units: McCann Erickson Advertising, with operations in
    over 100 countries; MRM Worldwide for relationship
    marketing and digital expertise; Momentum Worldwide for
    experiential marketing; and McCann Healthcare Worldwide for
    healthcare communications.

•

Launched in 2006, Draftfcb is a modern agency model for clients
    seeking creative and accountable marketing programs. With more
    than 130 years of expertise, the company has its roots in
    both consumer advertising and behavioral, data-driven direct
    marketing. We believe the agency is the first global,
    behavior-based, creative and accountable marketing
    communications organization operating as a financially and
    structurally integrated business unit.

•

Lowe is a premier creative agency that operates in the
    world’s largest advertising markets. Lowe is focused on
    delivering and sustaining high-value ideas for some of the
    world’s largest clients. The quality of the agency’s
    product is evident in its global creative rankings and its
    standing in major markets. By partnering with Interpublic’s
    marketing services companies, Lowe generates and executes ideas
    that are frequently recognized for effectiveness, amplified by
    smart communication channel planning.



•

Our domestic independent agencies include some of the larger
    full-service agency brands, Campbell-Ewald, Campbell Mithun,
    Deutsch, Hill Holliday, The Martin Agency and Mullen. The
    integrated marketing programs created by this group have helped
    build some of the most powerful brands in the U.S., across all
    sectors and industries.

•

We have exceptional marketing specialists across a range of
    channels. These include FutureBrand (corporate branding), Jack
    Morton (experiential marketing), Octagon (sports marketing),
    public relations specialists like WeberShandwick and Golin
    Harris, and

best-in-class

digital agencies, led by

R/GA.

Our
    healthcare communications specialists reside within our three
    global brands, McCann, Draftfcb and Lowe.

•

We also have two global media agencies, Initiative and Universal
    McCann, which provide specialized services in media planning and
    buying, market intelligence and

return-on-marketing

investment analysis for clients. Initiative and Universal McCann
    operate independently but work alongside Draftfcb and McCann
    Erickson, respectively. Aligning the efforts of our major media
    and our integrated communications networks improves cross-media
    communications and our ability to deliver integrated marketing
    programs.

Interpublic lists approximately 90 companies on our
    website’s “Company Finder” tool, with
    descriptions and office locations for each. To learn more about
    our broad range of capabilities, visit www.interpublic.com.
    Information on our website is not part of this report.

Financial
    Reporting Segments

We have two reportable segments: Integrated Agency Network
    (“IAN”), which is comprised of McCann, Draftfcb and
    Lowe, our media agencies and our leading stand-alone agencies,
    and CMG, which is comprised of the bulk of our specialist
    marketing service offerings. We also report results for the
    “Corporate and other” group. See Note 15 to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.

Principal
    Markets

Our agencies are located in over 100 countries, including every
    significant world market. We provide services for clients whose
    businesses are broadly international in scope, as well as for
    clients whose businesses are limited to a single country or a
    small number of countries. The U.S., Europe (excluding the
    U.K.), the U.K., Asia Pacific and Latin America represented
    55.7%, 16.5%, 9.0%, 8.9% and 4.8% of our total revenue,
    respectively, in 2007. For further discussion concerning
    revenues and long-lived assets on a geographical basis for each
    of the last three years, see Note 15 to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements.

Sources
    of Revenue

Our revenues are primarily derived from the planning and
    execution of advertising programs in various media and the
    planning and execution of other marketing and communications
    programs. Most of our client contracts are individually
    negotiated and accordingly, the terms of client engagements and
    the basis on which we earn commissions and fees vary
    significantly. Our client contracts are complex arrangements
    that may include provisions for incentive compensation and
    govern vendor rebates and credits. Our largest clients are
    multinational entities and, as such, we often provide services
    to these clients out of multiple offices and across various
    agencies. In arranging for such services to be provided, we may
    enter into global, regional and local agreements.

Revenues for creation, planning and placement of advertising are
    determined primarily on a negotiated fee basis and, to a lesser
    extent, on a commission basis. Fees are usually calculated to
    reflect hourly rates plus proportional overhead and a

mark-up.

Many clients include an incentive compensation component in
    their total compensation package. This provides added revenue
    based on achieving mutually

agreed-upon

qualitative

and/or

quantitative metrics within specified time periods. Commissions
    are earned based on services provided, and are usually derived
    from a percentage or fee over the total cost to complete the
    assignment. Commissions can also be derived when clients pay us
    the gross rate billed by media and we pay for media at a lower
    net



rate; the difference is the commission that we earn, which is
    either retained in total or shared with the client depending on
    the nature of the services agreement.

We pay the media charges with respect to contracts for
    advertising time or space that we place on behalf of our
    clients. To reduce our risk from a client’s non-payment, we
    typically pay media charges only after we have received funds
    from our clients. Generally, we act as the client’s agent
    rather than the primary obligor. In some instances we agree with
    the media provider that we will only be liable to pay the media
    after the client has paid us for the media charges.

We also generate revenue in negotiated fees from our public
    relations, sales promotion, event marketing, sports and
    entertainment marketing and corporate and brand identity
    services.

Our revenue is directly dependent upon the advertising,
    marketing and corporate communications requirements of our
    clients and tends to be higher in the second half of the
    calendar year as a result of the holiday season and lower in the
    first half as a result of the post-holiday slow-down in client
    activity.

Depending on the terms of the client contract, fees for services
    performed can be recognized in three principal ways:
    proportional performance, straight-line (or monthly basis) or
    completed contract. Fee revenue recognized on a completed
    contract basis also contributes to the higher seasonal revenues
    experienced in the fourth quarter because the majority of our
    contracts end at December 31. As is customary in the
    industry, our contracts generally provide for termination by
    either party on relatively short notice, usually 90 days.
    See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
    further discussion of our revenue recognition accounting
    policies.

Clients

One of the benefits of the holding company structure is that our
    agencies can work with a variety of clients from competing
    sectors. In the aggregate, our top ten clients based on revenue
    accounted for approximately 26% of revenue in 2007 and 2006.
    Based on revenue for the year ended December 31, 2007, our
    largest clients were General Motors Corporation, Microsoft,
    Johnson & Johnson, Unilever and Verizon. While the
    loss of the entire business of any one of our largest clients
    might have a material adverse effect upon our business, we
    believe that it is unlikely that the entire business of any of
    these clients would be lost at the same time. This is because we
    represent several different brands or divisions of each of these
    clients in a number of geographic markets, as well as provide
    services across multiple advertising and marketing disciplines,
    in each case through more than one of our agency systems.
    Representation of a client rarely means that we handle
    advertising for all brands or product lines of the client in all
    geographical locations. Any client may transfer its business
    from one of our agencies to a competing agency, and a client may
    reduce its marketing budget at any time.

Personnel

As of December 31, 2007, we employed approximately
    43,000 persons, of whom approximately 19,000 were employed
    in the U.S. Because of the service character of the
    advertising and marketing communications business, the quality
    of personnel is of crucial importance to our continuing success.
    There is keen competition for qualified employees.

Item 1A.

Risk
    Factors

We are subject to a variety of possible risks that could
    adversely impact our revenues, results of operations or
    financial condition. Some of these risks relate to the industry
    in which we operate, while others are more specific to us. The
    following factors set out potential risks we have identified
    that could adversely affect us. The risks described below may
    not be the only risks we face. Additional risks that we do not
    yet know of, or that we currently think are immaterial, could
    also impair our business operations or financial condition. See
    also Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Disclosure.

•

Ongoing SEC investigations regarding our accounting
    restatements could adversely affect us.

Since January 2003 the SEC has been conducting a formal
    investigation in response to the restatement we first announced
    in August 2002, and in 2005 the investigation expanded to
    encompass the restatement we presented in our Annual Report on

Form 10-K

for the year ended December 31, 2004 that we filed in
    September 2005. We have also responded to inquiries from the SEC
    staff concerning the restatement of the first three quarters of
    2005 that we made in our 2005 Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

We continue to cooperate with the investigation. We expect that
    the investigation will result in monetary liability, but as
    settlement discussions have not yet commenced, we cannot
    reasonably estimate the amount, range of amounts or timing of a
    resolution. Accordingly, we have not yet established any
    provision relating to these matters.

The SEC staff has informed us that it intends to seek approval
    from the Commission to enter into settlement discussions with us
    or, failing a settlement, to litigate an action charging the
    Company with various violations of the federal securities laws.
    In that connection, and as previously disclosed in our current
    report on

Form 8-K

filed June 14, 2007, the staff sent us a “Wells
    notice,” which invited us to make a responsive submission
    before the staff makes a final determination concerning its
    recommendation to the Commission. We expect to discuss
    settlement with the staff once the Commission authorizes the
    staff to engage in such discussions. We cannot at this time
    predict what the Commission will authorize or the outcome of any
    settlement negotiations.

•

We operate in a highly competitive industry.

The marketing communications business is highly competitive. Our
    agencies and media services must compete with other agencies,
    and with other providers of creative or media services, in order
    to maintain existing client relationships and to win new
    clients. Our competitors include not only other large
    multinational advertising and marketing communications
    companies, but also smaller entities that operate in local or
    regional markets. New market participants include systems
    integrators, database marketing and modeling companies,
    telemarketers and internet companies.

The client’s perception of the quality of an agency’s
    creative work, our reputation and the agencies’ reputations
    are important factors in determining our competitive position.
    An agency’s ability to serve clients, particularly large
    international clients, on a broad geographic basis is also an
    important competitive consideration. On the other hand, because
    an agency’s principal asset is its people, freedom of entry
    into the business is almost unlimited and a small agency is, on
    occasion, able to take all or some portion of a client’s
    account from a much larger competitor.



Many companies put their advertising and marketing
    communications business up for competitive review from time to
    time. We have won and lost client accounts in the past as a
    result of such periodic competitions. In the aggregate, our top
    ten clients based on revenue accounted for approximately 26% of
    revenue in 2007. While we believe it unlikely that we would lose
    the entire business of any one of our largest clients at the
    same time, a substantial decline in such a client’s
    advertising and marketing spending, or the loss of its entire
    business, could have a material adverse effect upon our business
    and results of operations.

Our ability to attract new clients and to retain existing
    clients may also, in some cases, be limited by clients’
    policies or perceptions about conflicts of interest. These
    policies can, in some cases, prevent one agency, or even
    different agencies under our ownership, from performing similar
    services for competing products or companies.

•

We may lose or fail to attract and retain key employees
    and management personnel.

Employees, including creative, research, media, account and
    practice group specialists, and their skills and relationships
    with clients, are among our most important assets. An important
    aspect of our competitiveness is our ability to attract and
    retain key employees and management personnel. Our ability to do
    so is influenced by a variety of factors, including the
    compensation we award, and could be adversely affected by our
    recent financial or market performance.

•

As a marketing services company, our revenues are highly
    susceptible to declines as a result of unfavorable economic
    conditions.

Economic downturns often more severely affect the marketing
    services industry than other industries. In the past, some
    clients have responded to weak economic performance in any
    region where we operate by reducing their marketing budgets,
    which are generally discretionary in nature and easier to reduce
    in the short-term than other expenses related to operations.
    This pattern may recur in the future.

•

Downgrades of our credit ratings could adversely affect
    us.

Our long-term debt is currently rated Ba3 with stable outlook by
    Moody’s, B with positive outlook by Standard and
    Poor’s, and BB- with stable outlook by Fitch. Any ratings
    downgrades or comparatively weak ratings can adversely affect
    us, because ratings are an important factor influencing our
    ability to access capital and the terms of any new indebtedness,
    including covenants and interest rates. Our clients and vendors
    may also consider our credit profile when negotiating contract
    terms, and if they were to change the terms on which they deal
    with us, it could have an adverse effect on our liquidity.

•

Our liquidity profile could be adversely affected.

In previous years, we have experienced operating losses and weak
    operating cash flow. Until our margins consistently improve in
    connection with our turnaround, cash generation from operations
    could be challenged in certain periods. This could have a
    negative impact on our liquidity in future years and could lead
    us to seek new or additional sources of liquidity to fund our
    working capital needs. There can be no guarantee that we would
    be able to access any new sources of liquidity on commercially
    reasonable terms or at all. If we were unable to do so, our
    liquidity position could be adversely affected.

•

If some of our clients experience financial distress,
    their weakened financial position could negatively affect our
    own financial position and results.

We have a large and diverse client base, and at any given time,
    one or more of our clients may experience financial distress,
    file for bankruptcy protection or go out of business. If any
    client with whom we have a substantial amount of business
    experiences financial difficulty, it could delay or jeopardize
    the collection of accounts receivable, may result in significant
    reductions in services provided by us and may have a material
    adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations
    and liquidity. For a description of our client base, see
    Item 1, Business — Clients.



•

International business risks could adversely affect our
    operations.

International revenues represent a significant portion of our
    revenues, approximately 44% in 2007. Our international
    operations are exposed to risks that affect foreign operations
    of all kinds, including local legislation, monetary devaluation,
    exchange control restrictions and unstable political conditions.
    These risks may limit our ability to grow our business and
    effectively manage our operations in those countries. In
    addition, because a significant portion of our business is
    denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, such
    as the Euro, Pound Sterling, Canadian Dollar, Brazilian Real,
    Japanese Yen and South African Rand, fluctuations in exchange
    rates between the U.S. dollar and such currencies may
    materially affect our financial results.

•

In 2006 and prior years, we recognized impairment charges
    and increased our deferred tax valuation allowances, and we may
    be required to record additional charges in the future related
    to these matters.

We evaluate all of our long-lived assets (including goodwill,
    other intangible assets and fixed assets), investments and
    deferred tax assets for possible impairment or realizability at
    least annually and whenever there is an indication of impairment
    or lack of realizability. If certain criteria are met, we are
    required to record an impairment charge or valuation allowance.
    In the past, we have recorded substantial amounts of goodwill,
    investment and other impairment charges, and have been required
    to establish substantial valuation allowances with respect to
    deferred tax assets and loss carry-forwards.

As of December 31, 2007, we have substantial amounts of
    long-lived assets, investments and deferred tax assets on our
    Consolidated Balance Sheet. Future events, including our
    financial performance and strategic decisions, could cause us to
    conclude that further impairment indicators exist and that the
    asset values associated with long-lived assets, investments and
    deferred tax assets may have become impaired. Any resulting
    impairment loss would have an adverse impact on our reported
    earnings in the period in which the charge is recognized.

•

We may not be able to meet our performance targets and
    milestones.

From time to time, we communicate to the public certain targets
    and milestones for our financial and operating performance
    including, but not limited to, the areas of revenue and
    operating margin growth. These targets and milestones are
    intended to provide metrics against which to evaluate our
    performance, but they should not be understood as predictions or
    guidance about our expected performance. Our ability to meet any
    target or milestone is subject to inherent risks and
    uncertainties, and we caution investors against placing undue
    reliance on them. See “Statement Regarding Forward-Looking
    Disclosure.”

•

We are subject to regulations and other governmental
    scrutiny that could restrict our activities or negatively impact
    our revenues.

Our industry is subject to government regulation and other
    governmental action, both domestic and foreign. There has been
    an increasing tendency on the part of advertisers and consumer
    groups to challenge advertising through legislation, regulation,
    the courts or otherwise, for example on the grounds that the
    advertising is false and deceptive or injurious to public
    welfare. Through the years, there has been a continuing
    expansion of specific rules, prohibitions, media restrictions,
    labeling disclosures and warning requirements with respect to
    the advertising for certain products. Representatives within
    government bodies, both domestic and foreign, continue to
    initiate proposals to ban the advertising of specific products
    and to impose taxes on or deny deductions for advertising,
    which, if successful, may have an adverse effect on advertising
    expenditures and consequently our revenues.

Properties

Substantially all of our office space is leased from third
    parties. Several of our leases will be expiring within the next
    few months, while the remainder will be expiring within the next
    17 years. Certain leases are subject to rent reviews or
    contain escalation clauses, and certain of our leases require
    the payment of various operating expenses, which may also be
    subject to escalation. Physical properties include leasehold
    improvements, furniture, fixtures and equipment located in our
    offices. We believe that facilities leased or owned by us are
    adequate for the purposes for which they are currently used and
    are well maintained. See Note 17 to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements for a discussion of our lease commitments.

Dividend
    Policy

No dividend has been paid on our common stock since the fourth
    quarter of 2002. Our future dividend policy will be determined
    on a

quarter-by-quarter

basis and will depend on earnings, financial condition, capital
    requirements and other factors. Our future dividend policy may
    also be influenced by the terms of certain of our outstanding
    securities. The terms of our outstanding series of preferred
    stock do not permit us to pay dividends on our common stock
    unless all accumulated and unpaid dividends have been or
    contemporaneously are declared and paid or provision for the
    payment thereof has been made. In the event we pay dividends on
    our common stock, holders of our 4.50% Convertible Senior
    Notes will be entitled to additional interest and the conversion
    terms of our 4.75% Convertible Senior Notes,
    4.25% Convertible Senior Notes and our Series B
    Convertible Preferred Stock, and the exercise prices of our
    outstanding warrants, will be adjusted (see Notes 10, 11

Item 7.

Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations

The following Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
    Financial Condition and Results of Operations
    (“MD&A”) is intended to help you understand The
    Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the
    “Company”, “Interpublic”, “we”,
    “us” or “our”). MD&A should be read in
    conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the
    accompanying notes. Our MD&A includes the following
    sections:

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY provides an overview of our results of
    operations and liquidity.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES provides a discussion of our
    accounting policies that require critical judgment, assumptions
    and estimates.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS provides an analysis of the consolidated
    and segment results of operations for 2007 compared to 2006 and
    2006 compared to 2005.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES provides an overview of our cash
    flows, funding requirements, contractual obligations, financing
    and sources of funds.

OTHER MATTERS provides a discussion of other significant items
    which may impact our financial statements.

RECENT ACCOUNTING STANDARDS, by reference to Note 18 to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements, provides a description of
    accounting standards which we have not yet been required to
    implement and may be applicable to our future operations.

EXECUTIVE
    SUMMARY

We are one of the world’s premier advertising and marketing
    services companies. Our agency brands deliver custom marketing
    solutions to many of the world’s largest marketers. Our
    companies cover the spectrum of marketing disciplines and
    specialties, from consumer advertising and direct marketing to
    mobile and search engine marketing. Major global brands include
    Draftfcb, FutureBrand, GolinHarris International, Initiative,
    Jack Morton Worldwide, Lowe Worldwide (“Lowe”), MAGNA
    Global, McCann Erickson, Momentum, MRM, Octagon, Universal
    McCann and Weber Shandwick. Leading domestic brands include
    Campbell-Ewald, Carmichael Lynch, Deutsch, Hill Holliday, Mullen
    and The Martin Agency.

The work we produce for our clients is specific to their unique
    needs. Our solutions vary from project-based activity involving
    one agency and its client to long-term, fully-integrated
    campaigns created by a group of our companies working together
    on behalf of a client. With offices in over 100 countries, we
    can operate in a single region or align work globally across all
    major world markets. Our revenue is directly dependent upon the
    advertising, marketing and corporate communications requirements
    of our clients and tends to be higher in the second half of the
    calendar year as a result of the holiday season and lower in the
    first half as a result of the post-holiday slow-down in client
    activity.

Our strategy is focused on improving our organic revenue growth
    and operating income. We are working to achieve significant
    improvements in our organic revenue growth and operating
    margins, with our ultimate objective to be fully competitive
    with our industry peer group on both measures.

We analyze period-to-period changes in our operating performance
    by determining the portion of the change that is attributable to
    foreign currency rates and the change attributable to the net
    effect of acquisitions and divestitures, with the remainder
    considered the organic change. For purposes of analyzing this
    change, acquisitions and divestitures are treated as if they
    occurred on the first day of the quarter during which the
    transaction occurred.

We have strategically realigned a number of our capabilities to
    promote revenue growth. For example, we have combined
    accountable marketing and consumer advertising to form the
    global offering Draftfcb and



Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition

and Results of Operations — (Continued)

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)

implemented a differentiated approach to media by aligning our
    largest media assets with our global brand agencies. We continue
    to develop our capacity in strategically critical areas, notably
    digital, marketing services and media, that we expect will drive
    future revenue growth. The digital component of our business
    continues to evolve and is increasingly vital to all of our
    agencies. In order to grow with our clients, we have accelerated
    our investment in talent, professional development and
    technology throughout the organization.

To further improve our operating margin we continue to focus on
    the following areas:

•

Actively managing staff costs in non-revenue supporting roles;

•

Improving financial systems and back-office processing;

•

Reducing organizational complexity and divesting non-core and
    underperforming businesses; and

•

Improving our real estate utilization.

Although the U.S. Dollar is our reporting currency, a
    substantial portion of our revenues is generated in foreign
    currencies. Therefore, our reported results are affected by
    fluctuations in the currencies in which we conduct our
    international businesses. The weakening of the U.S. Dollar
    against the currencies of many countries in which we operate
    contributed to higher revenues and operating expenses. In
    particular, during 2007 and 2006, the U.S. Dollar was
    weaker against the Euro, Pound Sterling, Brazilian Real and
    Canadian Dollar compared to 2006 and 2005, respectively. The
    2007 impact was also due to the strength of the Australian
    Dollar compared to 2006. The average value of the Euro and Pound
    Sterling, currencies in which the majority of our international
    operations are conducted, each strengthened approximately 9%
    against the U.S. Dollar during 2007. Foreign currency
    variations resulted in increases of approximately 3% in
    revenues, salaries and related expenses and office and general
    expenses in 2007 compared to 2006.

As discussed in more detail in this MD&A, for 2007 compared
    to 2006:

•

Total revenue increased by 5.9%.

•

Organic revenue increase was 3.8%, primarily due to higher
    revenue from existing clients.

•

Operating margin was 5.3% in 2007, compared to 1.7% in 2006.
    Salaries and related expenses as a percentage of revenue was
    63.2% in 2007 compared to 63.7% in 2006. Office and general
    expenses as a percentage of revenue was 31.2% in 2007, compared
    to 33.6% in 2006.

•

Operating expenses increased $125.1.

•

Total salaries and related expenses increased 4.9%, primarily to
    support the growth of our business. The organic increase was
    2.7%.

•

Total office and general expenses decreased 1.6% mainly due to
    improvements in our financial systems, back-office processes and
    internal controls, which resulted in lower professional fees.
    The organic decrease was 2.7%.

•

Restructuring and other reorganization-related charges reduced
    operating income by $25.9 in 2007 and $34.5 in 2006. The
    majority of charges in 2007 related to a restructuring plan at
    Lowe and the reorganization of our media businesses.

•

As of December 31, 2007, cash and cash equivalents and
    marketable securities increased $80.3 primarily due to improved
    operating results and proceeds from the sale of businesses and
    investments, partially offset by working capital usage,
    acquisitions, including deferred payments, and capital
    expenditures.

•

We have successfully completed our

18-month

plan to remediate the remainder of our previous material
    weaknesses as of December 31, 2007. See Item 9A,
    Controls and Procedures, for further discussion.

Our Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance
    with generally accepted accounting principles in the United
    States of America. Preparation of the Consolidated Financial
    Statements and related disclosures requires us to make
    judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts
    reported and disclosed in the accompanying financial statements
    and notes. We believe that of our significant accounting
    policies, the following critical accounting estimates involve
    management’s most difficult, subjective or complex
    judgments. We consider these accounting estimates to be critical
    because changes in the underlying assumptions or estimates have
    the potential to materially impact our financial statements.
    Management has discussed with our Audit Committee the
    development, selection, application and disclosure of these
    critical accounting estimates. We regularly evaluate our
    judgments, assumptions and estimates based on historical
    experience and various other factors that we believe to be
    relevant under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from
    these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

Revenue
    Recognition

Our revenues are primarily derived from the planning and
    execution of advertising programs in various media and the
    planning and execution of other marketing and communications
    programs. Most of our client contracts are individually
    negotiated and accordingly, the terms of client engagements and
    the bases on which we earn commissions and fees vary
    significantly. Our client contracts are complex arrangements
    that may include provisions for incentive compensation and
    govern vendor rebates and credits. Our largest clients are
    multinational entities and, as such, we often provide services
    to these clients out of multiple offices and across various
    agencies. In arranging for such services to be provided, it is
    possible for a global, regional and local agreement to be
    initiated. Multiple agreements of this nature are reviewed by
    legal counsel to determine the governing terms to be followed by
    the offices and agencies involved. Critical judgments and
    estimates are involved in determining both the amount and timing
    of revenue recognition under these arrangements.

Revenue for our services is recognized when all of the following
    criteria are satisfied: (i) persuasive evidence of an
    arrangement exists; (ii) the price is fixed or
    determinable; (iii) collectibility is reasonably assured;
    and (iv) services have been performed. Depending on the
    terms of a client contract, fees for services performed can be
    recognized in three principal ways: proportional performance,
    straight-line (or monthly basis) or completed contract. See
    Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further
    discussion.

Depending on the terms of the client contract, revenue is
    derived from diverse arrangements involving fees for services
    performed, commissions, performance incentive provisions and
    combinations of the three. Commissions are generally earned on
    the date of the broadcast or publication. Contractual
    arrangements with clients may also include performance incentive
    provisions designed to link a portion of the revenue to our
    performance relative to both qualitative and quantitative goals.
    Performance incentives are recognized as revenue for
    quantitative targets when the target has been achieved and for
    qualitative targets when confirmation of the incentive is
    received from the client. The classification of client
    arrangements to determine the appropriate revenue recognition
    involves judgments. If the judgments change there can be a
    material impact on our financial statements, and particularly on
    the allocation of revenues between periods. Incremental direct
    costs incurred related to contracts where revenue is accounted
    for on a completed contract basis are generally expensed as
    incurred. There are certain exceptions made for significant
    contracts or for certain agencies where the majority of the
    contracts are project-based and systems are in place to properly
    capture appropriate direct costs.

Substantially all of our revenue is recorded as the net amount
    of our gross billings less pass-through expenses charged to a
    client. In most cases, the amount that is billed to clients
    significantly exceeds the amount of revenue that is earned and
    reflected in our financial statements, because of various
    pass-through expenses such as production and media costs. In
    compliance with Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”)
    Issue

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)

No. 99-19,

Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an
    Agent

, we assess whether our agency or the third-party
    supplier is the primary obligor. We evaluate the terms of our
    client agreements as part of this assessment. In addition, we
    give appropriate consideration to other key indicators such as
    latitude in establishing price, discretion in supplier selection
    and credit risk to the vendor. Because we operate broadly as an
    advertising agency, based on our primary lines of business and
    given the industry practice to generally record revenue on a net
    versus gross basis, we believe that there must be strong
    evidence in place to overcome the presumption of net revenue
    accounting. Accordingly, we generally record revenue net of
    pass-through charges as we believe the key indicators of the
    business suggest we generally act as an agent on behalf of our
    clients in our primary lines of business. In those businesses
    (primarily sales promotion, event, sports and entertainment
    marketing and corporate and brand identity services) where the
    key indicators suggest we act as a principal, we record the
    gross amount billed to the client as revenue and the related
    costs incurred as office and general expenses. Revenue is
    reported net of taxes assessed by governmental authorities that
    are directly imposed on our revenue-producing transactions.

The determination as to whether revenue in a particular line of
    business should be recognized net or gross involves complex
    judgments. If we make these judgments differently, it could
    significantly affect our financial performance. If it were
    determined that we must recognize a significant portion of
    revenues on a gross basis rather than a net basis, it would
    positively impact revenues, have no impact on our operating
    income and have an adverse impact on operating margin.

We receive credits from our vendors and media outlets for
    transactions entered into on behalf of our clients that, based
    on the terms of our contracts and local law, are either remitted
    to our clients or retained by us. If amounts are to be passed
    through to clients they are recorded as liabilities until
    settlement or, if retained by us, are recorded as revenue when
    earned. Negotiations with a client at the close of a current
    engagement could result in either payments to the client in
    excess of the contractual liability or in payments less than the
    contractual liability. These items, referred to as concessions,
    relate directly to the operations of the period and are recorded
    as operating expense or income. Concession income or expense may
    also be realized in connection with settling vendor discount or
    credit liabilities that were established as part of the
    restatement we presented in our Annual Report on

Form 10-K

for the year ended December 31, 2004 that we filed in
    September 2005 (the “2004 Restatement”). In these
    situations, and given the historical nature of these
    liabilities, we have recorded such items as other income or
    expense in order to prevent distortion of current operating
    results. See Notes 1 and 4 to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements for further discussion.

Stock-Based
    Compensation

We account for stock-based compensation in accordance with
    Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”)
    No. 123 (revised 2004),

Share-Based Payment

(“SFAS 123R”). SFAS 123R requires
    compensation costs related to share-based transactions,
    including employee stock options, to be recognized in the
    financial statements based on fair value. Compensation cost is
    generally recognized ratably over the requisite service period,
    net of estimated forfeitures.

We use the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to estimate the
    fair value of options granted, which requires the input of
    subjective assumptions including the option’s expected term
    and the price volatility of the underlying stock. Changes in the
    assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value and
    our results of operations could be materially impacted. The
    expected volatility factor is based on a blend of historical
    volatility of our common stock and implied volatility of our
    tradable forward put and call options to purchase and sell
    shares of our common stock. The expected term is based on the
    average of an assumption that outstanding options are exercised
    upon achieving their full vesting date and will be exercised at
    the midpoint between the current date (i.e., the date awards
    have been ratably vested through) and their full contractual
    term. Additionally, we calculate an estimated forfeiture rate
    which impacts our recorded expense. See Note 14 to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.

Income
    Taxes

The provision for income taxes includes federal, state, local
    and foreign taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
    recognized for the estimated future tax consequences of
    temporary differences between the financial statement carrying
    amounts and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and
    liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to
    apply to taxable income in the year in which the temporary
    differences are expected to be reversed. Changes to enacted tax
    rates would result in either increases or decreases in the
    provision for income taxes in the period of changes.

Under SFAS No. 109,

Accounting for Income Taxes

(“SFAS 109”)

,

we are required to
    evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets. The
    realization of our deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on
    future earnings. SFAS 109 requires that a valuation
    allowance be recognized when it is more likely than not that all
    or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. In
    circumstances where there is significant negative evidence,
    establishment of valuation allowance must be considered. We
    believe that cumulative losses in the most recent three-year
    period represent significant negative evidence under the
    provisions of SFAS 109. A pattern of sustained
    profitability is considered significant positive evidence to
    reverse a valuation allowance. Accordingly, the increase and
    decrease of valuation allowances has had and could have a
    significant negative or positive impact on our future earnings.

On January 1, 2007 we adopted FASB Interpretation
    No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes

(“FIN 48”), which prescribes a recognition
    threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement
    recognition and measurement of a tax position that an entity
    takes or expects to take in a tax return. Additionally,
    FIN 48 provides guidance on de-recognition, classification,
    interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods,
    disclosure, and transition. The assessment of recognition and
    measurement requires critical estimates and the use of complex
    judgments. We evaluate our tax positions using a “more
    likely than not” recognition threshold and then we apply a
    measurement assessment to those positions that meet the
    recognition threshold. We have established tax reserves that we
    believe to be adequate in relation to the potential for
    additional assessments in each of the jurisdictions in which we
    are subject to taxation. We regularly assess the likelihood of
    additional tax assessments in those jurisdictions and adjust our
    reserves as additional information or events require. See
    Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further
    information.

Goodwill
    and Other Intangible Assets

We account for our business combinations using the purchase
    accounting method. The total costs of the acquisitions are
    allocated to the underlying net assets, based on their
    respective estimated fair market values and the remainder
    allocated to goodwill and other intangible assets. Determining
    the fair market value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed
    requires management’s judgment and involves the use of
    significant estimates, including future cash inflows and
    outflows, discount rates, asset lives and market multiples.
    Considering the characteristics of advertising, specialized
    marketing and communication services companies, our acquisitions
    usually do not have significant amounts of tangible assets as
    the principal asset we typically acquire is creative talent. As
    a result, a substantial portion of the purchase price is
    allocated to goodwill.

We review goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite
    lives not subject to amortization during the fourth quarter of
    each year or whenever events or significant changes in
    circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be
    recoverable. We evaluate the recoverability of goodwill at a
    reporting unit level. We have 15 reporting units subject to the
    2007 annual impairment testing that are either the entities at
    the operating segment level or one level below the operating
    segment level. In accordance with SFAS No. 142,

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

(“SFAS 142”), we did not test certain
    reporting units in 2007 as we determined we could carry forward
    the fair value of the reporting unit from the previous year.



Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition

and Results of Operations — (Continued)

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)

We review intangible assets with definite lives subject to
    amortization whenever events or circumstances indicate that a
    carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Intangible
    assets with definite lives subject to amortization are amortized
    on a straight-line basis with estimated useful lives generally
    between 7 and 15 years. Events or circumstances that might
    require impairment testing include the loss of a significant
    client, the identification of other impaired assets within a
    reporting unit, loss of key personnel, the disposition of a
    significant portion of a reporting unit, or a significant
    adverse change in business climate or regulations.

SFAS 142 specifies a two-step process for goodwill
    impairment testing and measuring the magnitude of any
    impairment. The first step of the impairment test is a
    comparison of the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying
    value, including goodwill. Goodwill allocated to a reporting
    unit whose fair value is equal to or greater than its carrying
    value is not impaired, and no further testing is required.
    Should the carrying amount for a reporting unit exceed its fair
    value, then the first step of the impairment test is failed and
    the magnitude of any goodwill impairment is determined under the
    second step. The second step is a comparison of the implied fair
    value of a reporting unit’s goodwill to its carrying value.
    Goodwill of a reporting unit is impaired when its carrying value
    exceeds its implied fair value. Impaired goodwill is written
    down to its implied fair value with a charge to expense in the
    period the impairment is identified.

The fair value of a reporting unit is estimated using
    traditional valuation techniques such as the income approach,
    which incorporates the use of the discounted cash flow method
    and the market approach, which incorporates the use of earning
    and revenue multiples. These techniques use projections which
    require the use of significant estimates and assumptions as to
    matters such as future revenue growth, profit margins, capital
    expenditures, assumed tax rates and discount rates. We believe
    that the estimates and assumptions made are reasonable but they
    are susceptible to change from period to period. For example,
    our strategic decisions or changes in market valuation multiples
    could lead to impairment charges. Actual results of operations,
    cash flows and other factors used in a discounted cash flow
    valuation will likely differ from the estimates used and it is
    possible that differences and changes could be material.

Our annual impairment reviews as of October 1, 2007 did not
    result in an impairment charge at any of our reporting units. In
    order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations
    on the goodwill impairment test, we applied a hypothetical 10%
    decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit at the low
    end of the valuation range. The following tables show the number
    of reporting units we tested in our 2007 and 2006 annual
    impairment reviews, together with the range of values we
    obtained for the excess of fair value over carrying value of
    each non-impaired reporting unit determined by using fair values
    for each unit (a) at the low end of our valuation range,
    (b) at the high end of our valuation range and (c) 10%
    below the low end of our valuation range.

Units

Excess of Fair Value Over Carrying Value (Lowest -
    Highest)

Tested

Low End

High End

90% of Low End



$5.3 – $250.6

$13.4 – $380.6

$(42.7) – $124.6



$0.2 – $1,990.2

$2.4 – $2,400.2

$(46.8) – $1,330.2

Applying the hypothetical 10% decrease in 2007 to the fair
    values would result in 3 reporting units failing step one of the
    goodwill impairment test.

Pension
    and Postretirement Benefits

We use various actuarial assumptions in determining our net
    pension and postretirement benefit costs and obligations. These
    assumptions include discount rates and expected returns on plan
    assets and are updated annually or more frequently with the
    occurrence of significant events. Changes in the related pension
    and postretirement benefit costs may occur in the future due to
    changes in the assumptions.



Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition

and Results of Operations — (Continued)

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)

The discount rate is one of the significant assumptions that
    impact our net pension and postretirement costs and obligations.
    Changes in the discount rates are generally due to increases or
    decreases in long-term interest rates. A higher discount rate
    will decrease our pension cost. The discount rates are
    determined at the beginning of the year based on prevailing
    interest rates as of the measurement date and are adjusted to
    match the duration of the underlying obligation. For 2008, we
    plan to use weighted average discount rates of 5.89%, 5.33% and
    6.00% for the domestic pension plans, foreign plans and the
    postretirement plan, respectively. A 25 basis point
    increase or decrease in the discount rate would have decreased
    or increased the 2007 net pension and postretirement cost
    by $2.4 and $2.5, respectively. In addition, a 25 basis
    point increase or decrease in the discount rate would have
    decreased or increased the December 31, 2007 benefit
    obligation by $22.5 and $23.8, respectively.

The expected rate of return on pension plan assets is another
    significant assumption that impacts our net pension cost and is
    determined at the beginning of the year. Changes in the rates
    are due to lower or higher expected future returns based on the
    mix of assets held. For 2008, we plan to use weighted average
    expected rates of return of 8.15% and 7.02% for the domestic and
    foreign pension plans, respectively. A lower expected rate of
    return will increase our net pension cost. A 25 basis point
    increase or decrease in the expected return on plan assets would
    have decreased or increased the 2007 net pension cost by
    $1.0. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements
    for further discussion.

Our revenue increased by $363.4, which consisted of a favorable
    foreign currency rate impact of $197.5, net divestitures of
    $70.7 and organic revenue growth of $236.6. The change in
    revenues was negatively affected by net divestitures of
    non-strategic businesses, primarily at Draftfcb and Lowe, and a
    sports marketing business at the Constituency Management Group
    (“CMG”). This was partially offset by businesses
    acquired during 2007, primarily in the U.S. and India. The
    organic revenue growth was primarily driven by domestic markets
    through expanding business with existing clients, winning new
    clients in advertising and public relations and completing
    several projects within the events marketing business. The
    international organic revenue increase was primarily driven by
    increases in spending by existing clients in the Asia Pacific
    region, partially offset by net client losses in Continental
    Europe, primarily in France at the Integrated Agency Network
    (“IAN”).

Revenue decreased due to net divestitures, partially offset by
    organic revenue increases and changes in foreign currency
    exchange rates. Net divestitures primarily impacted IAN, largely
    from Draftfcb and McCann Worldgroup (“McCann”) during
    2005. There were net organic revenue increases in both our
    international and domestic locations. The international organic
    increase was driven by higher revenue from existing clients,
    primarily in the Asia Pacific and Latin America regions,
    partially offset by net client losses, primarily in 2005, at IAN
    as well as decreases in the events marketing businesses at CMG
    in the U.K. The domestic organic increase was primarily driven
    by growth in the public relations and branding businesses at CMG
    as well as higher revenue from existing clients, partially
    offset by net client losses and decreased client spending at IAN.

Salaries
    and Related Expenses

Salaries and related expenses is the largest component of
    operating expenses and consist of payroll costs, employee
    performance incentives, including cash bonus and long-term
    incentive stock awards, and other benefits associated with
    client service professional staff and administrative staff.
    Salaries and related expenses do not vary significantly with
    short-term changes in revenue levels. However, salaries may
    fluctuate due to the timing of hiring freelance contractors who
    are utilized to support business development, changes in the
    funding levels of employee performance incentives, changes in
    foreign currency exchange rates and acquisitions and
    dispositions of businesses. Changes can occur in employee
    performance incentives based on



Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)

projected results and could affect trends between various
    periods in the future. In addition, long-term incentive stock
    awards may fluctuate as they are tied to our financial
    performance, generally for three-year periods beginning with the
    grant year, with the achievement of performance targets required
    for these awards. Our financial performance over the past few
    years has lagged behind that of our peers, primarily due to
    lower revenue and operating margin growth. As a result, salaries
    and related expenses reflect significant severance charges and
    investments in hiring creative talent to realign the business
    for revenue growth and improved operating margins. Also,
    salaries and related expenses reflect the hiring of additional
    finance professionals and information technology staff to
    upgrade system infrastructure and to address weaknesses in our
    accounting and control environment, as well as to develop shared
    services.

    Compared to 2006

Salaries and related expenses increased by $195.1, which
    consisted of a negative foreign currency rate impact of $122.2,
    net divestitures of $32.5 and an organic salary increase of
    $105.4. Net divestitures related primarily to the disposition of
    non-strategic businesses offset in part by acquisitions of
    businesses, primarily in the U.S. and India. The organic
    increase was primarily due to the following:

•

Base salaries, benefits and temporary help grew by $99.1,
    primarily to support business growth in IAN, predominantly at
    our largest network, McCann, and to support growth in the public
    relations businesses in CMG.

•

Cash bonus accruals and long-term incentive stock expense
    increased by $31.7, primarily due to improved operating
    performance versus financial targets at certain operating units,
    higher long-term incentive stock expense due to the effect of
    equity awards granted in June 2006 and a one-time
    performance-based equity award granted in 2006 to a limited
    number of senior executives across the Company.

These increases were offset by a decrease in severance expense
    of $22.4 during 2007, primarily in IAN.

    Compared to 2005

Salaries and related expenses decreased during 2006 due to net
    divestitures, primarily from the sale of several businesses at
    IAN during 2005, partially offset by changes in foreign currency
    exchange rates and an organic increase. Total salaries and
    related expenses as a percentage of revenue remained flat as a
    result of the decline in revenue. Key factors behind the organic
    increase in salaries and related expenses from the prior year



Management’s

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)

were an increase in long-term incentive awards and bonus awards
    of $67.6 offset by a significant reduction in severance expense
    of $63.6. Expenses related to incentive awards increased in 2006
    due to long-term equity based awards granted in June 2006 and
    the full year impact of awards granted in August 2005, while
    expenses related to bonus awards increased primarily due to
    performance.

Office
    and General Expenses

Office and general expenses primarily include rent expense,
    professional fees, expenses attributable to the support of
    client service professional staff, depreciation and amortization
    costs, bad debt expense relating to accounts receivable, the
    costs associated with the development of a shared services
    center and implementation costs associated with upgrading our
    information technology infrastructure. Office and general
    expenses also include costs directly attributable to client
    engagements. These costs include out-of-pocket costs such as
    travel for client service professional staff, production costs
    and other direct costs that are rebilled to our clients.

Office and general expenses decreased by $34.2, which consisted
    of a negative foreign currency rate impact of $66.0, net
    divestitures of $43.8 and an organic decrease of $56.4. Net
    divestitures related primarily to the disposition of
    non-strategic businesses offset in part by acquisitions of
    businesses, primarily in the U.S. and India. The organic
    decrease was primarily due to the following:

•

Improvements in our financial systems, back-office processes and
    internal controls resulted in a reduction in professional fees
    of $75.8. We expect professional fees to continue to decline in
    2008.

•

Occupancy costs, including depreciation and amortization,
    declined by $13.6.

These decreases were partially offset by an increase in
    production expenses of $34.2, primarily related to increased
    business at the events marketing business at CMG.

    Compared to 2005

Office and general expenses for 2006 declined as a result of
    significant reductions in professional fees, which decreased by
    $93.7, primarily for projects related to our restatement
    activities and internal control compliance that occurred in
    2005, lower production expenses, lower bad debt expenses and net
    divestitures, primarily due to the sale of several businesses at
    IAN during 2005. Partially offsetting this decrease were

higher rent expense and a reduction in foreign exchange gains on
    certain balance sheet items. The above items resulted in an
    organic decline which was primarily reflected at Corporate and
    IAN.

Restructuring
    Charges (Reversals)

Restructuring charges (reversals) related to the 2003 and 2001
    restructuring programs and a restructuring program entered into
    at Lowe during the third quarter of 2007. Due to changes in the
    business environment that have occurred during the year, we
    committed to and began implementing a restructuring program to
    realign resources with our strategic business objectives within
    Lowe. This plan includes reducing and restructuring Lowe’s
    workforce both domestically and internationally, and terminating
    certain lease agreements. For this plan, we recognized charges
    related to severance and termination costs of $14.5 and expense
    related to lease termination and other exit costs of $4.6 during
    the year ended December 31, 2007. We expect to incur
    additional charges related to this program of approximately $4.0
    in the first half of 2008. Cash payments are expected to be made
    through December 31, 2009.

Offsetting the severance and termination costs incurred at Lowe
    were adjustments to estimates relating to our prior severance
    and termination related actions. Offsetting the lease
    termination and other exit costs incurred at Lowe were reversals
    related to the utilization of previously vacated property by a
    Draftfcb agency and adjustments to estimates relating to our
    prior year plans.

During the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 net
    lease termination and other exit costs were primarily related to
    adjustments to management’s estimates as a result of
    changes in sublease rental income assumptions and utilization of
    previously vacated properties relating to the 2003 program by
    certain of our agencies due to improved economic conditions in
    certain markets.

Other
    Reorganization-Related Charges

Other reorganization-related charges relate to strategic
    business decisions made during 2007 and 2006: our realignment of
    our media businesses and the 2006 merger of Draft Worldwide and
    Foote, Cone and Belding Worldwide to create Draftfcb. Charges in
    2007 and 2006 primarily related to severance and terminations
    costs and lease termination and other exit costs. We expect
    charges associated with the realignment of our media businesses
    in 2007 to be completed during 2008. Charges related to the
    creation of Draftfcb in 2006 are complete. The charges were
    separated from our operating expenses within the Consolidated
    Statements of Operations as they did not result from charges
    that occurred in the normal course of business.

Long-Lived
    Asset Impairment and Other Charges

Long-lived assets include furniture, equipment, leasehold
    improvements, goodwill and other intangible assets. Long-lived
    assets with finite lives are generally depreciated or amortized
    on a straight-line basis over their respective estimated useful
    lives. When necessary, we record an impairment charge for the
    amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds the
    implied fair value. No impairment charges were recorded for 2007.

The following table summarizes long-lived asset impairment and
    other charges in previous years:

Our long-term projections, which were updated in the fourth
    quarter of 2006, showed previously unanticipated declines in
    discounted future operating cash flows due primarily to client
    losses at one of our domestic advertising reporting units. These
    discounted future operating cash flow projections indicated that
    the implied fair value of goodwill at this reporting unit was
    less than its book value, resulting in a goodwill impairment
    charge of $27.2.


A triggering event occurred subsequent to our 2005 annual
    impairment test when a major client was lost by Lowe’s
    London agency and the possibility of losing other clients was
    considered a higher risk due to management defections and
    changes in the competitive landscape. This caused projected
    revenue growth to decline. As a result of these changes, our
    long-term projections showed declines in discounted future
    operating cash flows. These revised cash flows indicated that
    the implied fair value of Lowe’s goodwill was less than the
    related book value resulting in a goodwill impairment charge of
    $91.0 at our Lowe reporting unit.

During our annual impairment test in the third quarter of 2005,
    we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $5.8 at a reporting
    unit within our sports and entertainment marketing business. The
    long-term projections showed previously unanticipated declines
    in discounted future operating cash flows and, as a result,
    these discounted future operating cash flows indicated that the
    implied fair value of goodwill was less than the related book
    value.

Net
    Interest Expense

The increase in net interest expense during 2007 is primarily
    attributable to higher cash interest expense on increased
    short-term debt, partially offset by increased interest income
    due to higher average cash balances and higher interest rates at
    some of our international agencies. The change in non-cash
    amortization from the prior year was minimal. Non-cash
    amortization primarily consists of amortization of debt issuance
    costs and deferred warrant costs from a transaction in 2006,
    which we refer to as the “ELF Financing,” in
    connection with entering into our current committed credit
    agreement, partially offset by reduced expense related to the
    amortization of the loss on extinguishment of $400.0 of our
    4.50% Convertible Senior Notes. For additional information,
    see Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

The increase in net interest expense during 2006 was primarily
    due to increases in non-cash amortization of $27.3, offset by
    interest income due to an increase in interest rates and higher
    average cash balances compared to the prior year. Non-cash
    amortization was primarily from the amortization of fees and
    deferred warrant costs incurred as a result of the ELF Financing
    transaction, prior year benefit from the amortization of gains
    on terminated swaps and the amortization of the remaining costs
    associated with our previous committed credit agreement.
    Additionally, the increase was due to one-time fees associated
    with the exchange of our Floating Rate Notes in 2006. The
    2006 year-over-year comparison benefited from the fact that
    we did not incur waiver and consent fees similar to those
    incurred in 2005 for the amendment of the indentures governing
    our debt securities and our prior credit facility.

Loss on
    Early Extinguishment of Debt

•

2007 — In November, we retired $200.0 of our
    4.50% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023 in connection with
    the issuance of $200.0 aggregate principal amount of
    4.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023 and as a result we
    recorded non-cash charges relating to the debt extinguishment.

•

2006 — In November, we retired $400.0 of our
    4.50% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023 in connection with
    the issuance of $400.0 aggregate principal amount of
    4.25% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023 and as a result we
    recorded non-cash charges relating to the debt extinguishment.

For additional information, see Note 10 to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements.

Net
    (Losses) Gains on Sales of Businesses

•

2007 — In the second quarter we sold several
    businesses within Draftfcb for a loss of $9.3 and in the third
    quarter incurred charges at Lowe of $7.8 as a result of the
    realization of cumulative translation adjustment balances from
    the liquidation of several businesses, as well as charges from
    the partial disposition of a business in South Africa.

•

2006 — In connection with the 2005 sale of a European
    FCB agency, we released $11.1 into income primarily related to
    certain contingent liabilities that we retained subsequent to
    the sale, which were resolved in the fourth quarter of 2006.

•

2005 — We had net gains related to the sale of a
    McCann agency of $18.6, partially offset by a loss of $13.0 from
    the sale of a European FCB agency.

Vendor
    Discount and Credit Adjustments

•

We are in the process of settling our liabilities related to
    vendor discounts and credits primarily established during the
    2004 Restatement. Amounts included in other income (expense)
    reflect the reversal of certain liabilities as a result of
    settlements with clients or vendors or where the statute of
    limitations has lapsed. For further information on vendor
    discounts and credits see Note 4 to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements and the Liquidity and Capital Resources
    section.

Net Gains
    on Sales of Available-for-Sale Securities and Miscellaneous

    sold our interest in a German advertising agency and recognized
    its remaining cumulative translation adjustment balance, which
    resulted in a non-cash benefit of $17.0.

•

2005 — We had net gains of $8.3 related to the sale of

In 2007, our effective tax rate was negatively impacted by
    foreign profits subject to tax at different rates and by losses
    in certain foreign locations where we receive no tax benefit due
    to 100% valuation allowances. Our effective tax rate was
    positively impacted in 2007 by the release of tax reserves
    resulting from the effective settlement of the IRS examination
    for

2003-2004

and by the net reversal of valuation allowances. Certain tax law
    changes also impacted the effective tax rate, which resulted in
    the write-down of net deferred tax assets of $16.2, primarily in
    certain

non-U.S. jurisdictions

and, to a lesser extent, certain U.S. states.

The effective settlement of the IRS examination referred to
    above resulted in the realization of previously unrecognized tax
    benefits, of which approximately $80.0 was attributable to
    certain worthless securities deductions. The favorable impact of
    this item and other net reserve releases are primary reasons for
    the change in the effective tax rate compared to 2006.

The tax provision for 2006 was primarily impacted by domestic
    losses, foreign profits subject to tax at different rates and
    losses in certain foreign locations where we receive no tax
    benefit due to 100% valuation allowances.

The tax provision for 2005 was primarily impacted by an increase
    in valuation allowances, a non-deductible asset impairment,
    state and local taxes and the resolution of various income tax
    audits and issues.

During 2007, we had a net reversal of valuation allowances of
    $49.0, of which $30.5 relates to the write-down of deferred tax
    assets due to tax law changes in jurisdictions with existing
    valuation allowances and $18.5 relates to reversals of valuation
    allowances in various countries where we believe that it is now
    more likely than not that the corresponding tax loss
    carryforwards will be utilized. During 2006 and 2005, we had net
    provisions for valuation allowances of $63.6 and $69.9,
    respectively, recorded in continuing operations on existing
    deferred tax assets, current year tax losses and temporary
    differences. The total valuation allowance as of
    December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 was $481.6, $504.0 and
    $501.0, respectively.

For additional information, see Note 9 to the Consolidated

The revenue increase in 2007 was a result of net changes in
    foreign currency exchange rates and organic revenue increases,
    partially offset by net divestitures. The domestic organic
    increase was a result of higher revenue from existing clients
    and net client wins, primarily at McCann and Hill Holliday.
    Partially offsetting this domestic organic increase was
    decreased revenue from existing clients at Lowe and net client
    losses at Draftfcb. The international organic increase was due
    to increases in client spending at McCann in the U.K. and Asia
    Pacific, partially offset by net client losses at Draftfcb and
    Lowe across most international regions. Net divestitures
    negatively affected revenue, due to the sale of non-strategic
    businesses in 2007 and 2006, primarily at Draftfcb and Lowe,
    partially offset by businesses acquired, primarily at Lowe.

The revenue decline in 2006 was a result of net divestitures,
    primarily from the sale of several businesses at Draftfcb and
    McCann in 2005, partially offset by an organic increase and
    changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The organic increase
    was driven primarily by McCann and Draftfcb, partially offset by
    decreases at Lowe and The Works, one of our independent
    agencies. The organic increase at McCann was the result of
    higher revenue from existing clients across domestic and
    international regions, primarily Asia Pacific and Latin America.
    McCann’s increase was primarily driven by digital, direct
    and event marketing services. The increase at Draftfcb was
    primarily the result of increased spending from existing
    clients, partially offset by net client losses, primarily in
    2005, across domestic and most international regions, primarily
    Europe, Asia Pacific and Latin America. The decrease at Lowe was
    primarily due to reduced spending by existing clients and net
    client losses, primarily in domestic locations in 2005. The
    revenue decrease at The Works, a dedicated General Motors
    resource, was primarily due to the loss of the General Motors
    U.S. media buying business in 2005.

Operating income increased due to an increase in revenue of
    $275.1, partially offset by increases in salaries and related
    expenses of $122.9 and office and general expenses of $15.4.
    Higher salaries and related expenses were primarily due to an
    increase in base salaries, benefits and temporary help of $131.2
    to support growth, primarily at McCann. The increase in office
    and general expenses was due to shared service expenses which
    were not allocated in prior years and the increased allocation
    of technology expenses from Corporate, partially offset by lower
    occupancy costs, primarily due to lease termination and other
    exit costs related to facilities exited in 2006.

    Compared to 2005

Operating income increased during 2006 due to a decrease in
    office and general expenses of $139.7, a decrease in salaries
    and related expenses of $99.2, partially offset by a decrease in
    revenue of $97.2. The reduction in office and general expenses
    primarily related to a decrease in production expenses of $46.4,
    a reduction in professional fees of $26.3 in connection with
    accounting projects, such as those related to our restatement
    activities, and a decrease in bad debt expense of $22.2. The
    reduction in salaries and related expenses primarily related to
    a reduction in severance expense of $63.1 for headcount
    reductions that occurred in international locations in 2005 and
    a decrease in salaries of $42.0.

Revenue growth was a result of organic increases and net changes
    in foreign currency exchange rates, partially offset by net
    divestitures. The domestic organic revenue increase was
    primarily due to client wins and expanding business with
    existing clients in the public relations business, the
    completion of several projects with existing clients in the
    events marketing business and expanding business with existing
    clients in the sports marketing business. Revenues in the events
    marketing business can fluctuate due to timing of completed
    projects, as revenue is typically recognized when the project is
    complete. Furthermore, we generally act as principal for these
    projects and as such record the gross amount billed to the
    client as revenue and the related costs incurred as pass-through
    costs in office and general expenses. The international organic
    revenue increase was primarily from existing clients in the
    public relations business in Europe and the Asia Pacific Region.
    The international revenue increase was partially offset by
    decreased revenues from existing clients in Europe primarily due
    to project-based events in 2006 that did not recur in 2007
    related to the sports marketing business. Net divestitures
    primarily relate to a sports marketing business sold in 2006.

Revenue growth was a result of domestic organic revenue
    increases in the public relations and branding businesses, which
    was due to higher revenue from existing clients. Additionally,
    there were organic revenue increases domestically in the sports
    marketing and events marketing businesses due to higher revenue
    from existing clients and client wins. The domestic increase was
    partially offset by declines at some CMG agencies due to client
    losses. Internationally, the decline related primarily to a
    decrease in the events marketing and sports marketing businesses
    caused by client losses. The international decrease was
    partially offset by increases in the public relations and
    branding businesses due to higher revenue from existing clients.

Operating income increased primarily due to an increase in
    revenue of $88.3, partially offset by increases in office and
    general expenses of $46.1 and salaries and related expenses of
    $35.9. Salaries and related expenses increased primarily due to
    an increase in salaries of $28.4 related to the hiring of
    additional staff in the public relations business to support
    revenue growth. Office and general expenses increased primarily
    due to higher production expenses of $32.0 related to the
    completion of several projects in the events marketing business
    and higher occupancy costs, primarily due to lease termination
    charges and accelerated depreciation and amortization related to
    certain leasehold improvements in facilities exited in 2007.

    Compared to 2005

Operating income decreased slightly, primarily as a result of an
    increase in salaries and related expenses of $32.0, partially
    offset by a decrease in office and general expenses of $14.6 and
    an increase in revenue of $16.0. The increase in salaries and
    related expenses primarily related to an increase in base
    salaries expense of $22.3 and the decrease in office and general
    expenses primarily related to a decrease in production expenses
    of $19.8.

CORPORATE
    AND OTHER

Certain corporate and other charges are reported as a separate
    line item within total segment operating income (loss) and
    include corporate office expenses and shared service center
    expenses, as well as certain other centrally managed expenses
    that are not fully allocated to operating divisions. Salaries
    and related expenses include salaries, long-term incentives,
    bonus, and other miscellaneous benefits for corporate office
    employees. Office and general expenses primarily includes
    professional fees related to internal control compliance,
    financial statement audits, legal, information technology and
    other consulting services, which are



Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition

engaged and managed through the corporate office. In addition,
    office and general expenses also includes rental expense and
    depreciation of leasehold improvements for properties occupied
    by corporate office employees. Offsetting these expenses are
    amounts we allocate to operating divisions based on a formula
    that uses the revenues of each of the operating units. Amounts
    allocated also include specific charges for information
    technology-related projects, which are allocated based on
    utilization.

    Compared to 2006

Corporate and other expenses decreased by $59.4 to $215.9 for
    the year ended December 31, 2007. This was primarily driven
    by improvements in our financial systems, back-office processes
    and internal controls, which resulted in a reduction in
    professional fees. Partially offsetting this reduction were
    higher salaries and related expenses, primarily related to
    long-term incentive award accruals for a one-time
    performance-based equity award granted in 2006 to a limited
    number of senior executives across the Company and the transfer
    of resources into a global finance organization as part of a
    regional monitoring program. In addition, amounts allocated to
    operating divisions increased primarily due to the charging of
    shared services expenses that were not previously allocated as
    well as for costs relating to the consolidation of certain
    global processes into our shared service center.

    Compared to 2005

Corporate and other expenses decreased by $41.0 to $275.3 for
    the year ended December 31, 2006. Expenses decreased
    primarily due to reduced professional fees and higher amounts
    allocated to operating divisions, partially offset by higher
    rent, depreciation and amortization and increased salaries and
    related expenses. We incurred lower professional fees for
    accounting projects, which included those related to our
    prior-year restatement activities. Amounts allocated to
    operating divisions increased primarily due to the
    implementation of new information technology-related projects,
    the consolidation of information technology support staff, and
    the allocation of audit fees, which are now being allocated back
    to operating divisions. Higher rent, depreciation and
    amortization were due to software-related costs from our ongoing
    initiatives to consolidate and upgrade our financial systems, as
    well as to further develop our shared services. Salaries and
    related expenses increased due to higher headcount, primarily
    related to our technology initiatives, and for larger incentive
    compensation and bonus awards related to performance.

Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities increased by
    $80.3 during 2007, primarily due to improved operating results
    and proceeds from the sale of businesses and investments,
    partially offset by



Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition

and Results of Operations — (Continued)

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)

working capital usage, acquisitions, including deferred
    payments, and capital expenditures. Of this change, marketable
    securities increased by $21.1.

Operating
    Activities

Cash provided by operating activities of $298.1 reflects a
    significant improvement compared to both 2006 and 2005. The
    increase was primarily due to net income of $167.6, which
    includes net non-cash expense items of $316.1, partially offset
    by working capital usage of $171.0. Net non-cash expense items
    primarily include depreciation of fixed assets, the amortization
    of intangible assets, restricted stock awards, non-cash
    compensation, bond discounts and deferred financing costs, and
    deferred taxes.

During 2007 working capital improved to a use of working capital
    of $171.0 compared to the use of working capital of $250.6
    during 2006. Working capital usage reflects changes in accounts
    receivable, expenditures billable to clients, prepaid expenses
    and other current assets, accounts payable and accrued
    liabilities. The working capital usage was impacted by the
    timing of certain vendor payments and cash collections from
    clients, the reversal, payment or settlement of various prior
    period liabilities that were established during the 2004
    Restatement and the resolution of various tax matters. As we
    continue to strengthen our business operations we anticipate
    that working capital will improve.

The timing of media buying on behalf of our clients affects our
    working capital and operating cash flow. In most of our
    businesses, we collect funds from our clients that we use, on
    their behalf, to pay production costs and media costs. The
    amounts involved substantially exceed our revenues, and
    primarily affect the level of accounts receivable, expenditures
    billable to clients, accounts payable and accrued media and
    production liabilities. Our assets include both cash received
    and accounts receivable from clients for these pass-through
    arrangements, while our liabilities include amounts owed on
    behalf of clients to media and production suppliers. Generally,
    we pay production and media charges after we have received funds
    from our clients, and our risk from client nonpayment has
    historically not been significant.

In addition to the timing of accrued media and production,
    accrued liabilities are also affected by the timing of certain
    payments. For example, while cash incentive awards are accrued
    throughout the year, they are generally paid during the first
    quarter of the subsequent year.

Investing
    Activities

Cash used in investing activities during 2007 primarily reflects
    acquisitions and capital expenditures, partially offset by
    proceeds from sales of investments. Payments for acquisitions
    relate to purchases of agencies and deferred payments on prior
    acquisitions. During 2007, we made a number of acquisitions for
    total cash consideration of $140.4. Under the contractual terms
    of certain of our prior acquisitions we made cash payments of
    $17.5 for the year ended December 31, 2007. For additional
    information, see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements. Capital expenditures of $147.6 primarily related to
    costs associated with leasehold improvements and computer
    hardware.

Financing
    Activities

Cash used in financing activities during 2007 primarily reflects
    dividend payments of $27.6 on our Series B Preferred Stock
    and distributions to our minority interests.

LIQUIDITY
    OUTLOOK

We expect our operating cash flow, cash and cash equivalents to
    be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating requirements at
    a minimum for the next twelve months. We believe that a
    conservative approach to liquidity is appropriate for our
    Company, in view of the cash requirements resulting from, among
    other things,



Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition

and Results of Operations — (Continued)

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)

liabilities to our clients for vendor discounts and credits, any
    potential penalties or fines that may have to be paid in
    connection with the ongoing SEC investigation, the normal cash
    variability inherent in our operations, other unanticipated
    requirements and our funding requirements noted below. In
    addition, until our margins consistently improve in connection
    with our turnaround, cash generation from operations could be
    challenged in certain periods.

A reduction in our liquidity in future periods could lead us to
    seek new or additional sources of liquidity to fund our working
    capital needs. From time to time we evaluate market conditions
    and financing alternatives for opportunities to raise additional
    financing or otherwise improve our liquidity profile and enhance
    our financial flexibility. There can be no guarantee that we
    would be able to access new sources of liquidity on commercially
    reasonable terms, or at all.

Funding
    Requirements

Our most significant funding requirements include: our
    operations, non-cancelable operating lease obligations,
    acquisitions, capital expenditures, payments related to vendor
    discounts and credits, debt service, preferred stock dividends,
    contributions to pension and postretirement plans, and taxes.

•

Acquisitions — We continue to evaluate strategic
    opportunities to grow and to increase our ownership interests in
    current investments, particularly to develop the digital and
    marketing services components of our business and to expand our
    presence in high-growth markets, including Brazil, Russia, India
    and China.

•

Payments related to vendor discounts and
    credits — Of the liabilities recognized as part
    of the 2004 Restatement, we estimate that we will pay
    approximately $65.0 related to vendor discounts and credits,
    internal investigations and international compensation
    arrangements over the next 12 months. As of
    December 31, 2007 our liability balance was $184.6.

•

Debt Service — On March 15, 2008 holders of our
    $200.0 4.50% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023 may
    require us to repurchase these Notes for cash at par. Based on
    current market conditions, we believe that most or all holders
    will require us to repurchase their Notes. The remainder of our
    debt profile is primarily long-term, with maturities scheduled
    from 2009 to 2023.

Contractual
    Obligations

Holders of our $200.0 4.50% Notes may require us to

    such, starting with the first quarter of 2007, we have included
    these Notes in short-term debt on our Consolidated Balance
    Sheets. These Notes will mature in 2023 if not converted or
    repurchased.



Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)

Holders of our $400.0 4.25% Notes may require us to
    repurchase their 4.25% Notes for cash at par in March 2012.
    These Notes will mature in 2023 if not converted or repurchased.

(2)

We have structured certain acquisitions with additional
    contingent purchase price obligations in order to reduce the
    potential risk associated with negative future performance of
    the acquired entity. All payments are contingent upon achieving
    projected operating performance targets and satisfying other
    conditions specified in the related agreements and are subject
    to revisions as the earn-out periods progress. See Note 17
    to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

Regular quarterly dividends on our Series B Preferred Stock
    are $6.9, or $27.6 annually. For additional information, see
    Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

We have not included obligations under our pension and
    postretirement benefit plans in the contractual obligations
    table. Our funding policy regarding our funded pension plan is
    to contribute amounts necessary to satisfy minimum pension
    funding requirements plus such additional amounts from time to
    time as are determined to be appropriate to improve the
    plans’ funded status. The funded status of our pension
    plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on
    invested assets, level of market interest rates and levels of
    voluntary contributions to the plans. For the year ended
    December 31, 2007, we made contributions of $30.1 to our
    foreign pension plans, but did not contribute to our domestic
    pension plans. For 2008, we do not expect to contribute to our
    domestic pension plans, and expect to contribute $24.7 to our
    foreign pension plans.

FINANCING
    AND SOURCES OF FUNDS

Substantially all of our operating cash flow is generated by our
    agencies. Our liquid assets are held primarily at the holding
    company level, and to a lesser extent at our largest
    subsidiaries.

Since 2006, we have engaged in several transactions to improve
    our liquidity and debt maturity profile:

•

In November 2007, we exchanged $200.0 of our
    4.50% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023 for the same
    aggregate principal amount of our 4.75% Convertible Senior
    Notes due 2023. This transaction extended the first date on
    which holders can require us to repurchase this portion of our
    debt from 2008 to 2013. It also extended the first date on which
    we can redeem this portion of our debt from 2009 to 2013.

•

In December 2006, we exchanged all of our $250.0 Floating Rate
    Notes due 2008 for the same aggregate principal amount of
    Floating Rate Notes due 2010. The new Floating Rate Notes bear
    interest at a per annum rate equal to three-month LIBOR plus
    200 basis points, 125 basis points less than the
    interest rate on the old Floating Rate Notes.

•

In November 2006, we exchanged $400.0 of our
    4.50% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023 for the same
    aggregate principal amount of our 4.25% Convertible Senior
    Notes due 2023. This transaction extended the first date on
    which holders can require us to repurchase this portion of our
    debt from 2008 to 2012 and extended the second date on which
    holders can require us to repurchase this portion of our debt
    from 2013 to 2015. It also extended the first date on which we
    can redeem this portion of our debt from 2009 to 2012.

•

In June 2006, we replaced our existing $500.0 Three-Year
    Revolving Credit Facility, which would have expired in May 2007,
    with a new $750.0 Three-Year Credit Agreement (the “Credit
    Agreement”) as part of a capital markets transaction.

Credit
    Facilities

Under our principal credit facility, the Credit Agreement, a
    special-purpose entity called ELF Special Financing Ltd.
    (“ELF”) acts as the lender and letter of credit
    issuer. ELF is obligated at our request to make



Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition

and Results of Operations — (Continued)

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)

cash advances to us and to issue letters of credit for our
    account, in an aggregate amount not to exceed $750.0 outstanding
    at any time. The aggregate face amount of letters of credit may
    not exceed $600.0 at any time. Our obligations under the Credit
    Agreement are unsecured. The Credit Agreement is a revolving
    facility, under which amounts borrowed may be repaid and
    borrowed again, and the aggregate available amount of letters of
    credit may decrease or increase, subject to the overall limit of
    $750.0 and the $600.0 limit on letters of credit. We have not
    drawn on this facility to date or on our previous committed
    credit agreements since late 2003. We are not subject to any
    financial or other material restrictive covenants under this
    facility. For additional information, see Note 10 to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements.

In addition to the Credit Agreement, we have uncommitted credit
    facilities with various banks that permit borrowings at variable
    interest rates. We use our uncommitted credit lines for working
    capital needs at some of our operations outside the
    U.S. There were borrowings under the uncommitted facilities
    made by several of our subsidiaries outside the
    U.S. totaling $95.9 and $80.3 as of December 31, 2007
    and 2006, respectively. We have guaranteed the repayment of some
    of these borrowings by our subsidiaries. If we lose access to
    these credit lines, we would have to provide funding directly to
    some overseas operations. The weighted-average interest rate on
    outstanding balances under the uncommitted short-term facilities
    as of December 31, 2007 and 2006 was approximately 5%.

Letters
    of Credit

We are required from time to time to post letters of credit,
    primarily to support our commitments, or those of our
    subsidiaries, to purchase media placements, mostly in locations
    outside the U.S., or to satisfy other obligations. These letters
    of credit are generally backed by letters of credit issued under
    the Credit Agreement. The aggregate amount of outstanding
    letters of credit issued for our account under the Credit
    Agreement was $222.9 and $219.9 as of December 31, 2007 and
    2006, respectively. These letters of credit have historically
    not been drawn upon.

Cash
    Pooling

We aggregate our net domestic cash position on a daily basis.
    Outside the U.S., we use cash pooling arrangements with banks to
    help manage our liquidity requirements. In these pooling
    arrangements, several Interpublic agencies agree with a single
    bank that the cash balances of any of the agencies with the bank
    will be subject to a full right of setoff against amounts the
    other agencies owe the bank, and the bank provides overdrafts as
    long as the net balance for all the agencies does not exceed an

agreed-upon

level. Typically each agency pays interest on outstanding
    overdrafts and receives interest on cash balances. Our
    Consolidated Balance Sheets reflect cash net of overdrafts for
    each pooling arrangement. As of December 31, 2007 and 2006
    a gross amount of $1,295.7 and $1,052.5, respectively, in cash
    was netted against an equal gross amount of overdrafts under
    pooling arrangements.

DEBT
    RATINGS

Our long-term debt credit ratings as of February 15, 2008
    were Ba3 with stable outlook, B with positive outlook and BB-
    with stable outlook, as reported by Moody’s Investors
    Service, Standard & Poor’s and Fitch Ratings,
    respectively. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy,
    sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or
    withdrawal at any time by the assigning credit rating agency.
    The rating of each credit rating agency should be evaluated
    independently of any other rating.

OTHER
    MATTERS

SEC
    Investigation

Since January 2003 the SEC has been conducting a formal
    investigation in response to the restatement we first announced
    in August 2002, and in 2005 the investigation expanded to
    encompass the 2004 Restatement. We have also responded to
    inquiries from the SEC staff (the “Staff”) concerning
    the restatement of the first three quarters of 2005 that we made
    in our 2005 Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

We continue to cooperate with the investigation. We expect that
    the investigation will result in monetary liability, but as
    settlement discussions have not yet commenced, we cannot
    reasonably estimate the amount, range of amounts or timing of a
    resolution. Accordingly, we have not yet established any
    provision relating to these matters.

The Staff has informed us that it intends to seek approval from
    the Commission to enter into settlement discussions with us or,
    failing a settlement, to litigate an action charging the Company
    with various violations of the federal securities laws. In that
    connection, and as previously disclosed by the Company in a
    current report on

Form 8-K

filed June 14, 2007, the Staff sent the Company a
    “Wells notice,” which invited us to make a responsive
    submission before the Staff makes a final determination
    concerning its recommendation to the Commission. We expect to
    discuss settlement with the Staff once the Commission authorizes
    the Staff to engage in such discussions. We cannot at this time
    predict what the Commission will authorize or the outcome of any
    settlement negotiations.

    Out-of-Period Amounts

During 2006, we recorded adjustments to certain vendor discounts
    and credits, contractual liabilities, foreign exchange, tax and
    other miscellaneous items which related to prior periods. For
    the year ended December 31, 2006, these adjustments
    resulted in a net favorable impact to revenue of $6.1, a net
    favorable impact to salaries and related expenses of $5.6, a net
    unfavorable impact to office and general expenses of $6.5 and a
    net favorable impact to net loss of $4.5. The operating income
    impact of these adjustments primarily affected our IAN segment.
    Because these changes are not material to our financial
    statements for the periods prior to 2006, for the quarters of
    2006 or for 2006 as a whole, we recorded these out-of-period
    amounts in their respective quarters of 2006. See also
    Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
    additional information.

RECENT
    ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

See Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a
    complete description of recent accounting pronouncements that
    have affected us or may affect us.



Item 7A.

Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

In the normal course of business, we are exposed to market risks
    related to interest rates and foreign currency rates. From time
    to time, we use derivatives, pursuant to established guidelines
    and policies, to manage some portion of these risks. Derivative
    instruments utilized in our hedging activities are viewed as
    risk management tools, involve little complexity and are not
    used for trading or speculative purposes.

Interest
    Rates

Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates
    relates primarily to our debt obligations. As of
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, approximately 85% of our debt
    obligations bore interest at fixed interest rates. Accordingly,
    assuming the fixed-rate debt is not refinanced, there would be
    no impact on interest expense or cash flow from either a 10%
    increase or decrease in market rates of interest. However, there
    would be an impact on the fair market value of the debt, as the
    fair market value of debt is sensitive to changes in interest
    rates. For 2007, the fair market value of the debt obligations
    would decrease by $18.4 if market rates were to increase by 10%
    and would increase by $19.4 if market rates were to decrease by
    10%. For 2006, the fair market value of the debt obligations
    would decrease by $28.8 if market rates were to increase by 10%
    and would increase by $29.5 if market rates were to decrease by
    10%. For that portion of the debt that bore interest at variable
    rates, based on outstanding amounts and rates as of
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, net interest expense and cash
    out-flow would increase or decrease by approximately $2.0 in
    each year if market rates were to increase or decrease by 10%.
    Interest rate swaps have been used to manage the mix of our
    fixed and floating rate debt obligations. However, we currently
    have none outstanding.

Foreign
    Currencies

We face translation and transaction risks related to changes in
    foreign currency exchange rates. Amounts invested in our foreign
    operations are translated into U.S. Dollars at the exchange
    rates in effect at the balance sheet date. The resulting
    translation adjustments are recorded as a component of
    accumulated other comprehensive loss in the stockholders’
    equity section of our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Our foreign
    subsidiaries generally collect revenues and pay expenses in
    currencies other than the U.S. Dollar, mitigating
    transaction risk. Since the functional currency of our foreign
    operations is generally the local currency, foreign currency
    translation of the balance sheet is reflected as a component of
    stockholders’ equity and does not impact operating results.
    Since we report revenues and expenses in U.S. Dollars,
    changes in exchange rates may either positively or negatively
    affect our consolidated revenues and expenses (as expressed in
    U.S. Dollars) from foreign operations. Currency transaction
    gains or losses arising from transactions in currencies other
    than the functional currency are included in results of
    operations and were not significant in the years ended
    December 31, 2007 and 2006. We have not entered into a
    material amount of foreign currency forward exchange contracts
    or other derivative financial instruments to hedge the effects
    of adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.

Derivatives

The terms of the 4.50% Notes include two embedded
    derivative instruments and the terms of our 4.75% Notes,
    4.25% Notes and our Series B Preferred Stock each
    include one embedded derivative instrument. The fair value of
    these derivatives on December 31, 2007 was negligible. In
    addition, we have entered into operating leases in a foreign
    country with payments that are payable in the U.S. dollar
    or its equivalent dollar value in that country’s currency
    and future rent increases are based on the U.S. inflation
    rate according to the Consumer Price Index. As such, these
    leases contain an embedded foreign currency derivative and we
    have recorded a long-term asset on our Consolidated Balance
    Sheets. The changes in value of this asset, which are
    negligible, have been recorded as other income or expense in our
    Consolidated Statements of Operations.

MANAGEMENT’S
    REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
    adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term
    is defined in Exchange Act

Rule 13a-15(f).

Management (with the participation of our Chief Executive
    Officer and Chief Financial Officer) conducted an evaluation of
    the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting
    based on the framework in Internal Control —
    Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this
    evaluation, management concluded that the Company’s
    internal control over financial reporting was effective as of
    December 31, 2007. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an
    independent registered public accounting firm, has audited the
    effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, as stated in
    their report which appears in this annual report.



REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To The Board of Directors and Stockholders of The Interpublic
    Group of Companies, Inc.

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and
    the related consolidated statements of operations, of cash flows
    and of stockholders’ equity and comprehensive income (loss)
    present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position
    of The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc. and its subsidiaries
    (the “Company”) at December 31, 2007 and 2006,
    and the results of their operations and their cash flows for
    each of the three years in the period ended December 31,
    2007 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
    in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the
    Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal
    control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007,
    based on criteria established in Internal Control —
    Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The
    Company’s management is responsible for these financial
    statements, for maintaining effective internal control over
    financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness
    of internal control over financial reporting, included in
    Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial
    Reporting appearing under Item 8. Our responsibility is to
    express opinions on these financial statements and on the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting based
    on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance
    with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
    Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and
    perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
    the financial statements are free of material misstatement and
    whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
    maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial
    statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence
    supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
    statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
    significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the
    overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal
    control over financial reporting included obtaining an
    understanding of internal control over financial reporting,
    assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing
    and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of
    internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also
    included performing such other procedures as we considered
    necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits
    provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

As discussed in Note 13 to the consolidated financial
    statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts
    for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans in
    2006.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that
    transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
    financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
    company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)

Note 1:

Summary
    of Significant Accounting Policies

Business
    Description

The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc. and subsidiaries (the
    “Company”, “Interpublic”, “we”,
    “us” or “our”) is one of the world’s
    premier advertising and marketing services companies. Our agency
    brands deliver custom marketing solutions to many of the
    world’s largest marketers. Our companies cover the spectrum
    of marketing disciplines and specialties, from consumer
    advertising and direct marketing to mobile and search engine
    marketing and develop marketing programs that build brands,
    influence consumer behavior and sell products.

Principles
    of Consolidation

The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of
    the Company and its subsidiaries, most of which are wholly
    owned. Investments in companies over which we do not have
    control, but the ability to exercise significant influence, are
    accounted for using the equity method of accounting. Investments
    in companies over which we have neither control nor the ability
    to exercise significant influence are accounted for under the
    cost method. All intercompany accounts and transactions have
    been eliminated in consolidation.

In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board
    (“FASB”) Interpretation No. 46(R),

Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (revised December
    2003), an Interpretation of ARB No. 51

, along with
    certain revisions, we have consolidated certain entities meeting
    the definition of variable interest entities. The inclusion of
    these entities does not have a material impact on our
    Consolidated Financial Statements.

Reclassifications

Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior period
    financial statements to conform to the current year presentation.

Use of
    Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
    America (“GAAP”) requires us to make estimates and
    assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
    liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
    at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts
    of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual
    results could differ from those estimates.

Revenue
    Recognition

Our revenues are primarily derived from the planning and
    execution of advertising programs in various media and the
    planning and execution of other marketing and communications
    programs. Our revenue is directly dependent upon the
    advertising, marketing and corporate communications requirements
    of our clients and tends to be higher in the second half of the
    calendar year as a result of the holiday season and lower in the
    first half as a result of the post-holiday slow-down in client
    activity.

Most of our client contracts are individually negotiated and
    accordingly, the terms of client engagements and the bases on
    which we earn commissions and fees vary significantly. Our
    client contracts are complex arrangements that may include
    provisions for incentive compensation and govern vendor rebates
    and credits. Our largest clients are multinational entities and,
    as such, we often provide services to these clients out of
    multiple offices and across various agencies. In arranging for
    such services to be provided, it is possible for a global,
    regional and local agreement to be initiated. Multiple
    agreements of this nature are reviewed by legal counsel to
    determine the governing terms to be followed by the offices and
    agencies involved.



Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)

Revenue for our services is recognized when all of the following
    criteria are satisfied: (i) persuasive evidence of an
    arrangement exists; (ii) the price is fixed or
    determinable; (iii) collectibility is reasonably assured;
    and (iv) services have been performed. Depending on the
    terms of a client contract, fees for services performed can be
    recognized in three principal ways: proportional performance,
    straight-line (or monthly basis) or completed contract.

•

Fees are generally recognized as earned based on the
    proportional performance method of revenue recognition in
    situations where our fee is reconcilable to the actual hours
    incurred to service the client as detailed in a contractual
    staffing plan or where the fee is earned on a per hour basis,
    with the amount of revenue recognized in both situations limited
    to the amount realizable under the client contract. We believe
    an input based measure (the ‘hour’) is appropriate in
    situations where the client arrangement essentially functions as
    a time and out-of-pocket expense contract and the client
    receives the benefit of the services provided throughout the
    contract term.

•

Fees are recognized on a straight-line or monthly basis when
    service is provided essentially on a pro rata basis and the
    terms of the contract support monthly basis accounting.

•

Certain fees (such as for major marketing events) are deferred
    until contract completion as the final act is so significant in
    relation to the service transaction taken as a whole. Fees are
    also recognized on a milestone basis if the terms of the
    contract call for the delivery of discrete projects, or on the
    completed contract basis if any of the criteria of Staff
    Accounting Bulletin (“SAB”) No. 104,

Revenue
    Recognition,

were not satisfied prior to job completion or
    if the terms of the contract do not otherwise qualify for
    proportional performance or monthly basis recognition.

Depending on the terms of the client contract, revenue is
    derived from diverse arrangements involving fees for services
    performed, commissions, performance incentive provisions and
    combinations of the three. Commissions are generally earned on
    the date of the broadcast or publication. Contractual
    arrangements with clients may also include performance incentive
    provisions designed to link a portion of the revenue to our
    performance relative to both qualitative and quantitative goals.
    Performance incentives are recognized as revenue for
    quantitative targets when the target has been achieved and for
    qualitative targets when confirmation of the incentive is
    received from the client. Incremental direct costs incurred
    related to contracts where revenue is accounted for on a
    completed contract basis are generally expensed as incurred.
    There are certain exceptions made for significant contracts or
    for certain agencies where the majority of the contracts are
    project-based and systems are in place to properly capture
    appropriate direct costs.

Substantially all of our revenue is recorded as the net amount
    of our gross billings less pass-through expenses charged to a
    client. In most cases, the amount that is billed to clients
    significantly exceeds the amount of revenue that is earned and
    reflected in our financial statements, because of various
    pass-through expenses such as production and media costs. In
    compliance with Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”)
    Issue

No. 99-19,

Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an
    Agent

, we assess whether our agency or the third-party
    supplier is the primary obligor. We evaluate the terms of our
    client agreements as part of this assessment. In addition, we
    give appropriate consideration to other key indicators such as
    latitude in establishing price, discretion in supplier selection
    and credit risk to the vendor. Because we operate broadly as an
    advertising agency, based on our primary lines of business and
    given the industry practice to generally record revenue on a net
    versus gross basis, we believe that there must be strong
    evidence in place to overcome the presumption of net revenue
    accounting. Accordingly, we generally record revenue net of
    pass-through charges as we believe the key indicators of the
    business suggest we generally act as an agent on behalf of our
    clients in our primary lines of business. In those businesses
    (primarily sales promotion, event, sports and entertainment
    marketing and corporate and brand identity services) where the
    key indicators suggest we act as a principal, we record the
    gross amount billed to the client as revenue and the related
    costs incurred as office and general expenses. Revenue is
    reported net of taxes assessed by governmental authorities that
    are directly imposed on our revenue-producing transactions.



Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)

As we provide services as part of our core operations, we
    generally incur incidental expenses, which, in practice, are
    commonly referred to as “out-of-pocket” expenses.
    These expenses often include expenses related to airfare,
    mileage, hotel stays, out of town meals and telecommunication
    charges. In accordance with EITF Issue

No. 01-14,

Income Statement Characterization of Reimbursements Received
    for ‘Out-of-Pocket’ Expenses Incurred

, we record
    the reimbursements received for incidental expenses as revenue
    with a corresponding offset to office and general expense.

We receive credits from our vendors and media outlets for
    transactions entered into on behalf of our clients that, based
    on the terms of our contracts and local law, are either remitted
    to our clients or retained by us. If amounts are to be passed
    through to clients they are recorded as liabilities until
    settlement or, if retained by us, are recorded as revenue when
    earned. Negotiations with a client at the close of a current
    engagement could result in either payments to the client in
    excess of the contractual liability or in payments less than the
    contractual liability. These items, referred to as concessions,
    relate directly to the operations of the period and are recorded
    as operating expense or income. Concession income or expense may
    also be realized in connection with settling vendor discount or
    credit liabilities that were established as part of the
    restatement we presented in our Annual Report on

Form 10-K

for the year ended December 31, 2004 that we filed in
    September 2005 (the “2004 Restatement”). In these
    situations, and given the historical nature of these
    liabilities, we have recorded such items as other income or
    expense in order to prevent distortion of current operating
    results. We release certain of these credit liabilities when the
    statute of limitations has lapsed, unless the liabilities are
    associated with customers with whom we are in the process of
    settling such liabilities. These amounts are reported in other
    income (expense).

Cash
    Equivalents

Cash equivalents are highly liquid investments, including
    certificates of deposit, government securities, commercial paper
    and time deposits with original maturities of three months or
    less at the time of purchase and are stated at estimated fair
    value, which approximates cost. Cash is maintained at
    high-credit quality financial institutions.

As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, we held restricted cash
    of $45.8 and $44.0, respectively, included in other current
    assets. Restricted cash primarily represents cash equivalents
    that are maintained on behalf of our clients and are legally
    restricted for a specified business purpose.

Short-Term
    Marketable Securities

We classify short-term marketable debt and equity securities as
    available-for-sale, which are carried at fair value with the
    corresponding unrealized gains and losses reported as a separate
    component of other comprehensive income (loss), which is a
    component of stockholders’ equity. The cost of securities
    sold is determined based upon the average cost of the securities
    sold.

Allowance
    for Doubtful Accounts

The allowance for doubtful accounts is estimated based on the
    aging of accounts receivable, reviews of client credit reports,
    industry trends and economic indicators, as well as analysis of
    recent payment history for specific customers. The estimate is
    based largely on a formula-driven calculation but is
    supplemented with economic indicators and knowledge of potential
    write-offs of specific client accounts.

Expenditures
    Billable to Clients

Expenditures billable to clients are primarily comprised of
    production and media costs that have been incurred but have not
    yet been billed to clients, as well as internal labor and
    overhead amounts and other accrued receivables which have not
    yet been billed to clients. Unbilled amounts are presented in
    expenditures



Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)

billable to clients regardless of whether they relate to our
    fees or production and media costs. A provision is made for
    unrecoverable costs as deemed appropriate.

Investments

Publicly traded investments in companies over which we do not
    exert a significant influence are classified as
    available-for-sale and reported at fair value with net
    unrealized gains and losses reported as a component of other
    comprehensive income (loss). Non-publicly traded investments and
    all other publicly traded investments are accounted for on the
    equity basis or cost basis, including investments to fund
    certain deferred compensation and retirement obligations. We
    regularly review our equity and cost method investments to
    determine whether a significant event or change in circumstances
    has occurred that may have an adverse effect on the fair value
    of each investment. In the event a decline in fair value of an
    investment occurs, we determine if the decline has been
    other-than-temporary. We consider our investments strategic and
    long-term in nature, so we determine if the fair value decline
    is recoverable within a reasonable period. For investments
    accounted for using the equity basis or cost basis, we evaluate
    fair value based on specific information (valuation
    methodologies, estimates of appraisals, financial statements,
    etc.) in addition to quoted market price, if available. In the
    absence of other evidence, cost is presumed to equal fair value
    for our cost and equity method investments. Factors indicative
    of an other-than-temporary decline include recurring operating
    losses, credit defaults and subsequent rounds of financing with
    pricing that is below the cost basis of the investment. This
    list is not all-inclusive; we consider all known quantitative
    and qualitative factors in determining if an
    other-than-temporary decline in value of an investment has
    occurred. Our assessments of fair value represent our best
    estimates at the time of impairment review.

Dividends received from our investments in unconsolidated
    affiliated companies were $3.1, $4.4 and $5.9 in 2007, 2006 and
    2005, respectively, and reduced the carrying values of the
    related investments.

Furniture,
    Equipment and Leasehold Improvements

Furniture, equipment and leasehold improvements are stated at
    cost, net of accumulated depreciation. Furniture and equipment
    are depreciated generally using the straight-line method over
    the estimated useful lives of the related assets, which range
    from 3 to 7 years for furniture, equipment and computer
    software costs, 10 to 35 years for buildings and the
    shorter of the useful life or the remaining lease term for
    leasehold improvements. The total depreciation and amortization
    expense for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and
    2005 was $168.7, $167.4 and $167.3, respectively.

Goodwill
    and Other Intangible Assets

We account for our business combinations using the purchase
    accounting method. The total costs of the acquisitions are
    allocated to the underlying net assets, based on their
    respective estimated fair market values and the remainder
    allocated to goodwill and other intangible assets. Considering
    the characteristics of advertising, specialized marketing and
    communication services companies, our acquisitions usually do
    not have significant amounts of tangible assets as the principal
    asset we typically acquire is creative talent. As a result, a
    substantial portion of the purchase price is allocated to
    goodwill. Determining the fair market value of assets acquired
    and liabilities assumed requires management’s judgment and
    involves the use of significant estimates, including future cash
    inflows and outflows, discount rates, asset lives and market
    multiples.

We perform an annual impairment review of goodwill as of
    October 1st of each year or whenever events or
    significant changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
    value may not be recoverable. We evaluate the recoverability of
    goodwill at a reporting unit level. We have 15 reporting units
    subject to the 2007 annual impairment testing that are either
    the entities at the operating segment level or one level below
    the operating segment level. For 2007, in accordance with
    Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”)
    No. 142,



Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

(“SFAS 142”), we did not test certain
    reporting units in 2007 as we determined we could carry forward
    the fair value of the reporting unit from the previous year.

We review intangible assets with definite lives subject to
    amortization whenever events or circumstances indicate that a
    carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Events or
    circumstances that might require impairment testing include the
    loss of a significant client, the identification of other
    impaired assets within a reporting unit, loss of key personnel,
    the disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit, or
    a significant adverse change in business climate or regulations.

SFAS 142 specifies a two-step process for goodwill
    impairment testing and measuring the magnitude of any
    impairment. The fair value of a reporting unit is estimated
    using traditional valuation techniques such as the income
    approach, which incorporates the use of the discounted cash flow
    method and the market approach, which incorporates the use of
    earning and revenue multiples.

Foreign
    Currencies

The financial statements of our foreign operations, when the
    local currency is the functional currency, are translated into
    U.S. Dollars at the exchange rates in effect at each year
    end for assets and liabilities and average exchange rates during
    each year for the results of operations. The related unrealized
    gains or losses from translation are reported as a separate
    component of other comprehensive income (loss). Transactions
    denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are
    recorded based on exchange rates at the time such transactions
    arise. Subsequent changes in exchange rates result in
    transaction gains or losses, which are reflected within office
    and general expenses.

Credit
    Risk

Financial instruments that potentially subject us to
    concentrations of credit risk are primarily cash and cash
    equivalents, short-term marketable securities, accounts
    receivable, expenditures billable to clients and foreign
    exchange contracts. We invest our excess cash in
    investment-grade, short-term securities with financial
    institutions and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one
    counterparty. Concentrations of credit risk with accounts
    receivable are limited due to our large number of clients and
    their dispersion across different industries and geographical
    areas. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our clients and
    maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon the
    expected collectibility of all accounts receivable. We are
    exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the
    counterparties of foreign currency contracts. We limit our
    exposure to any one financial institution and do not anticipate
    nonperformance by these counterparties.

A downgrade in our credit ratings could adversely affect our
    ability to access capital and could result in more stringent
    covenants and higher interest rates under the terms of any new
    indebtedness.

Income
    Taxes

The provision for income taxes includes federal, state, local
    and foreign taxes. Income taxes are accounted for under the
    liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
    recognized for the estimated future tax consequences of
    temporary differences between the financial statement carrying
    amounts and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and
    liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to
    apply to taxable income in the year in which the temporary
    differences are expected to be reversed. We evaluate the
    realizability of our deferred tax assets and establish a
    valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that all or
    a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. See
    Note 9 for further explanation.



Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)

Earnings
    (Loss) Per Share

In periods when we generate income, we calculate basic Earnings
    Per Share (“EPS”) using the two-class method, pursuant
    to EITF Issue

No. 03-6,

Participating Securities and the Two-Class Method under
    SFAS Statement No. 128

(“EITF 03-6”).

The two-class method is required as our 4.50% Convertible
    Senior Notes qualify as participating securities, having the
    right to receive dividends or dividend equivalents should
    dividends be declared on common stock. Under this method,
    earnings for the period (after deduction for contractual
    preferred stock dividends) are allocated on a pro-rata basis to
    the common stockholders and to the holders of participating
    securities based on their right to receive dividends. The
    weighted-average number of shares outstanding is increased to
    reflect the number of common shares into which the participating
    securities could convert. In periods when we generate a loss,
    basic loss per share is computed by dividing the loss
    attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average
    number of common shares and contingently issuable shares
    outstanding for the period, if applicable. We do not use the
    two-class method in periods when we generate a loss as the
    4.50% Convertible Notes do not participate in losses.

Diluted earnings (loss) per share reflects the potential
    dilution that would occur if certain potentially dilutive
    securities or debt obligations were exercised or converted into
    common stock. The potential issuance of common stock is assumed
    to occur at the beginning of the year (or at the time of
    issuance of the potentially dilutive instrument, if later), and
    the incremental shares are included using the treasury stock or
    “if-converted” methods. The proceeds utilized in
    applying the treasury stock method consist of the amount, if
    any, to be paid upon exercise and, as it relates to stock-based
    compensation, the amount of compensation cost attributed to
    future service not yet recognized and any tax benefits credited
    to additional

paid-in-capital

related to the exercise. These proceeds are then assumed to be
    used by us to purchase common stock at the average market price
    during the period. The incremental shares (difference between
    the shares assumed to be issued and the shares assumed to be
    purchased), to the extent they would have been dilutive, are
    included in the denominator of the diluted EPS calculation.

Pension
    and Postretirement Benefits

We have pension and postretirement benefit plans covering
    certain domestic and international employees. We use various
    actuarial methods and assumptions in determining our pension and
    postretirement benefit costs and obligations, including the
    discount rate used to determine the present value of future
    benefits, expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and
    healthcare cost trend rates. On December 31, 2006 we
    adopted SFAS No. 158,

Employers’ Accounting
    for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans

(“SFAS 158”). SFAS 158 requires, among
    other things, balance sheet recognition of the overfunded or
    underfunded status of pension and postretirement benefit plans.
    See Note 13 for further discussion.

Stock-Based
    Compensation

We account for stock-based compensation in accordance with
    SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004),

Share-Based Payment

(“SFAS 123R”). SFAS 123R requires
    compensation costs related to share-based transactions,
    including employee stock options, to be recognized in the
    financial statements based on fair value. We implemented
    SFAS 123R as of January 1, 2006 using the modified
    prospective transition method. Under this transition method, the
    compensation expense recognized beginning January 1, 2006
    includes compensation expense for (i) all stock-based
    payments granted prior to, but not yet vested as of
    January 1, 2006, based on the grant-date fair value
    estimated in accordance with the original provisions of
    SFAS No. 123,

Accounting for Stock-Based
    Compensation

(“SFAS 123”), and (ii) all
    stock-based payments granted subsequent to December 31,
    2005 based on the grant-date fair value estimated in accordance
    with the provisions of SFAS 123R. Stock-based compensation
    expense is generally recognized ratably over the requisite
    service period, net of estimated forfeitures.



Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)

Prior to January 1, 2006, we accounted for stock-based
    compensation plans in accordance with the provisions of
    Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25,

Accounting
    for Stock Issued to Employees

(“APB 25”), as
    permitted by SFAS 123, and accordingly did not recognize
    compensation expense for the issuance of stock options with an
    exercise price equal or greater than the market price at the
    date of grant. In addition, our previous Employee Stock Purchase
    Plan (‘ESPP’) was not considered compensatory under
    APB 25 and, therefore, no expense was required to be recognized.
    Compensation expense was previously recognized for restricted
    stock, restricted stock units, performance-based stock and share
    appreciation performance-based units. The effect of forfeitures
    on restricted stock, restricted stock units and
    performance-based stock was recognized when such forfeitures
    occurred. See Note 14 for further discussion.

Restructuring
    Charges (Reversals)

Restructuring charges (reversals) relate to the 2003 and 2001
    restructuring programs and a restructuring program entered into
    at Lowe Worldwide (“Lowe”) during the third quarter of
    2007. Included in net charges and (reversals) for the years
    ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 are adjustments
    resulting from changes in management’s estimates. With the
    exception of medical and dental benefits paid to employees who
    are on long-term disability, we do not establish liabilities
    associated with ongoing post-employment benefits that may vest
    or accumulate as the employee provides service as we cannot
    reasonably predict what our future experience will be. See
    Note 13 for further discussion.

Due to changes in the business environment that have occurred
    during the year, we committed to and began implementing a
    restructuring program to realign resources with our strategic
    business objectives within Lowe. This plan includes reducing and
    restructuring Lowe’s workforce both domestically and
    internationally, and terminating certain lease agreements. For
    this plan, we recognized charges related to severance and
    termination costs of $14.5 and expense related to lease
    termination and other exit costs of $4.6 during the year ended
    December 31, 2007. We expect to incur additional charges
    related to this program of approximately $4.0 in the first half
    of 2008. Cash payments are expected to be made through
    December 31, 2009.

The 2003 program was initiated in response to softness in demand
    for advertising and marketing services. The 2001 program was
    initiated following the acquisition of True North Communications
    Inc. and was designed to integrate the acquisition and improve
    productivity. Since their inception, total net charges for the
    2007, 2003 and 2001 programs were $19.1, $221.4 and $639.6,
    respectively. Substantially all activities under the 2003 and
    2001 programs have been completed.

Offsetting the severance and termination costs incurred at Lowe
    were adjustments to estimates relating to our prior severance
    and termination related actions. Offsetting the lease
    termination and other exit costs



Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)

incurred at Lowe were reversals related to the utilization of
    previously vacated property by a Draftfcb agency and adjustments
    to estimates relating to our prior year plans.

During the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 net
    lease termination and other exit costs were primarily related to
    adjustments to management’s estimates as a result of
    changes in sublease rental income assumptions and utilization of
    previously vacated properties relating to the 2003 program by
    certain of our agencies due to improved economic conditions in
    certain markets.

Net restructuring charges for the year ended December 31,
    2007 was comprised of net charges of $14.5 at Integrated Agency
    Networks (“IAN”), partially offset by net reversals of
    $1.1 at Constituency Management Group (“CMG”). For the
    year ended December 31, 2006 net restructuring charges
    consisted of net charges of $1.5 at CMG. In addition, for the
    year ended December 31, 2005, net restructuring reversals
    was comprised of net reversals at IAN and Corporate, partially
    offset by net charges at CMG.

A summary of the remaining liability for the 2007, 2003 and 2001
    restructuring programs is as follows:

Other
    Reorganization-Related Charges

Other reorganization-related charges relate to strategic
    business decisions made during 2007 and 2006: our realignment of
    our media businesses and the 2006 merger of Draft Worldwide and
    Foote, Cone and Belding Worldwide to create Draftfcb. Charges in
    2007 and 2006 primarily related to severance and terminations
    costs and lease termination and other exit costs. We expect
    charges associated with the realignment of our media businesses
    in 2007 to be completed during 2008. Charges related to the
    creation of Draftfcb in 2006 are complete. The charges were
    separated from our operating expenses within the Consolidated
    Statements of Operations as they did not result from charges
    that occurred in the normal course of business.

Note 3:

Acquisitions
    and Dispositions

Acquisitions

During 2007, we made eight acquisitions, of which the most
    significant were: a) a full-service advertising agency in
    Latin America, b) Reprise Media, which is a full-service
    search engine marketing firm in North America, c) the
    remaining interests in two full-service advertising agencies in
    India in which we previously held 49% and 51% interests,
    d) a professional healthcare services business in the U.K.,
    and e) a branded entertainment business in the
    U.S. Total cash consideration for our 2007 acquisitions was
    $140.4. The acquired businesses do not have significant amounts
    of tangible assets, therefore a substantial portion of the total
    consideration has been allocated to goodwill and identifiable
    intangible assets (approximately $122.0). The purchase price
    allocations for our acquisitions are substantially complete,
    however certain of these allocations



Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)

are based on estimates and assumptions and are subject to
    change. The final determination of the estimated fair value of
    the acquired net assets will be completed as soon as possible,
    but no later than one year from the acquisition date. All
    acquisitions during 2007 are included within our IAN segment.
    Pro forma information related to these acquisitions is not
    presented because the impact of these acquisitions, either
    individually or in the aggregate, on the Company’s
    consolidated results of operations is not significant. We did
    not complete any acquisitions during 2006 and 2005.

The majority of our acquisitions include an initial payment at
    the time of closing and provide for additional contingent
    purchase price payments over a specified time. The initial
    purchase price of an acquisition is allocated to tangible net
    assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on estimated fair
    values with any excess being recorded as goodwill and other
    intangible assets. Contingent purchase price payments are
    recorded within the financial statements as an increase to
    goodwill and other intangible assets once the terms and
    conditions of the contingent acquisition obligations have been
    met and the consideration is determinable and distributable, or
    expensed as compensation in our Consolidated Statements of
    Operations based on the acquisition agreement and the terms and
    conditions of employment for the former owners of the acquired
    businesses. See Note 17 for further discussion.

Cash paid and stock issued for acquisitions are comprised of:
    (i) initial acquisition payments; (ii) contingent
    payments as described above; (iii) further investments in
    companies in which we already have an ownership interest; and
    (iv) other payments related to loan notes and guaranteed
    deferred payments that have been previously recognized on the
    Consolidated Balance Sheets.

The results of operations of our acquired companies were
    included in our consolidated results from the closing date of
    each acquisition. We made stock payments related to acquisitions
    initiated in prior years of $0.3, $11.3 and $12.9 during 2007,
    2006 and 2005, respectively. Details of cash paid for current
    and prior years’ acquisitions are as follows:

Dispositions

In connection with the sale of our NFO World Group Inc.
    (“NFO”) operations in the fourth quarter of 2003, we
    established reserves for certain income tax contingencies with
    respect to the determination of our tax basis in NFO for income
    tax purposes at the time of the disposition of NFO. During the
    fourth quarter of 2005, $9.0 of these reserves were reversed, as
    the related income tax contingencies were no longer considered
    probable based on our preliminary review of our tax basis.
    During the third quarter of 2006 we finalized the tax basis of
    our investment and we determined that the remaining reserve of
    $5.0 should be reversed as the related contingency was no longer
    considered probable. The 2006 and 2005 amounts were reversed
    through income from discontinued operations for the year ended
    December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

    Restatement Liabilities

As part of the 2004 Restatement, we recognized liabilities
    related to vendor discounts and credits where we had a
    contractual or legal obligation to rebate such amounts to our
    clients or vendors. Reductions to these liabilities are
    primarily achieved through settlements with clients and vendors
    but also may occur if a statute of limitations in a jurisdiction
    has lapsed. For the year ended December 31, 2007, we
    satisfied $27.6 of these



Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)

liabilities through cash payments of $14.6 and reductions of
    certain client receivables of $13.0. The remaining decline was
    primarily the result of favorable settlements with clients and
    the release of liabilities due to the lapse of the respective
    statutes of limitations, offset by foreign currency effects.

Also as part of the 2004 Restatement, we recognized liabilities
    related to internal investigations and international
    compensation arrangements. A summary of these and the vendor
    discounts and credits liabilities is as follows:

Loss on
    Early Extinguishment of Debt

•

2007 — In November, we retired $200.0 of our
    4.50% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023 in connection with
    the issuance of $200.0 aggregate principal amount of
    4.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023 and as a result we
    recorded non-cash charges relating to the debt extinguishment.

•

2006 — In November, we retired $400.0 of our
    4.50% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023 in connection with
    the issuance of $400.0 aggregate principal amount of
    4.25% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023 and as a result we
    recorded non-cash charges relating to the debt extinguishment.

See Note 10 for further discussion on our debt transactions.

Net
    (Losses) Gains on Sales of Businesses

•

2007 — In the second quarter we sold several
    businesses within Draftfcb for a loss of $9.3 and in the third
    quarter incurred charges at Lowe of $7.8 as a result of the
    realization of cumulative translation adjustment balances from
    the liquidation of several businesses, as well as charges from
    the partial disposition of a business in South Africa.

•

2006 — In connection with the 2005 sale of a European
    FCB agency, we released $11.1 into income, primarily related to
    certain contingent liabilities that we retained subsequent to
    the sale, which were resolved in the fourth quarter of 2006.

•

2005 — We had net gains related to the sale of a
    McCann agency of $18.6, partially offset by a loss of $13.0 from
    the sale of a European FCB agency.



Notes to

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)

Vendor
    Discount and Credit Adjustments

•

We are in the process of settling our liabilities related to
    vendor discounts and credits primarily established during the
    2004 Restatement. The amounts included in other income (expense)
    reflect the reversal of certain liabilities as a result of
    settlements with clients or vendors or where the statute of
    limitations has lapsed.

Net Gains on Sales of Available-for-Sale Securities and
    Miscellaneous Investment Income

•

2007 — In the fourth quarter we realized a gain of
    $3.0 related to the sale of certain available-for-sale
    securities.

•

2006 — In the second quarter, we had net gains of
    $20.9 related to the sale of an investment located in Asia
    Pacific and the sale of our remaining ownership interest in an
    agency within Lowe. In addition, during the third quarter, we
    sold our interest in a German advertising agency and recognized
    its remaining cumulative translation adjustment balance, which
    resulted in a non-cash benefit of $17.0.

•

2005 — We had net gains of $8.3 related to the sale of
    our remaining equity ownership interest in an agency within FCB,
    and net gains on sales of certain available-for-sale securities
    of $7.9.

Investment
    Impairments

•

2007 — During the fourth quarter we realized an
    other-than-temporary charge of $5.8 relating to a $12.5
    investment in auction rate securities, representing our total
    investment in auction rate securities.

•

2005 — We recorded charges of $12.2, primarily related
    to a $7.1 adjustment of the carrying amount of our remaining
    unconsolidated investment in Latin America to fair value as a
    result of our intent to sell and $3.7 related to a decline in
    value of certain available-for-sale investments that were
    determined to be other-than-temporary.

See Note 16 for further discussion on our financial
    instruments.

Other
    Income

•

2007 — Primarily includes dividend income from our
    cost investments.

    applicable to common stockholders adjusted to exclude, if

    Our participating securities have no impact on our net loss

    securities do not participate in our net loss.

Basic and diluted shares outstanding and loss per share are
    equal for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005
    because our potentially dilutive securities are antidilutive as
    a result of the net loss applicable to common stockholders.

These options represent what is outstanding at the end of the
    respective year. At the point that the exercise price is less
    than the average market price, these options have the potential
    to be dilutive and application of the treasury stock method
    would reduce this amount.

(2)

The potential dilutive impact of the warrants would be based
    upon the difference between the market price of one share of our
    common stock and the stated exercise prices of the warrants. See
    Note 11 for further discussion.

There were an additional 5.7, 6.2 and 3.3 outstanding options to
    purchase common shares as of December 31, 2007, 2006 and
    2005, respectively, with exercise prices less than the average
    market price for the respective year. However, these options are
    not included in the table above presenting the potential shares
    excluded from diluted earnings (loss) per share due to the
    application of the treasury stock method and the rules related
    to stock-based compensation arrangements.

Goodwill
    and Other Intangible Assets

Goodwill

Goodwill is the excess purchase price remaining from an
    acquisition after an allocation of purchase price has been made
    to identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on
    estimated fair values. The changes in the carrying value of
    goodwill by segment for the years ended December 31, 2007
    and 2006 are as follows:

Other
    Intangible Assets

Included in other intangible assets are assets with indefinite
    lives not subject to amortization and assets with definite lives
    subject to amortization. Other intangible assets include
    non-compete agreements, license costs, trade names and customer
    lists. Intangible assets with definitive lives subject to
    amortization are amortized on a straight-line basis with
    estimated useful lives generally between 7 and 15 years.
    Amortization expense for other intangible assets for the years
    ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 was $8.5, $6.2 and
    $1.5, respectively. Expected annual amortization expense of
    other intangible assets for the next five years is as follows:
    $9.8 in 2008, $8.5 in 2009, $6.8 in 2010, $6.1 in 2011 and $5.2

Long-Lived
    Asset Impairment and Other Charges

Long-lived assets include furniture, equipment, leasehold
    improvements, goodwill and other intangible assets. Long-lived
    assets with finite lives are depreciated or amortized on a
    straight-line basis over their respective estimated useful
    lives. When necessary, we record an impairment charge for the
    amount that the carrying value of the asset exceeds the implied
    fair value. No impairment charges were recorded for 2007.

Our long-term projections, which were updated in the fourth
    quarter of 2006, showed previously unanticipated declines in
    discounted future operating cash flows due primarily to client
    losses at one of our domestic advertising reporting units. These
    discounted future operating cash flow projections indicated that
    the implied fair value of the goodwill at this reporting unit
    was less than its book value resulting in a goodwill impairment
    charge of $27.2.


A triggering event occurred subsequent to our 2005 annual
    impairment test when a major client was lost by Lowe’s
    London agency and the possibility of losing other clients was
    considered a higher risk due to management defections and
    changes in the competitive landscape. This caused projected
    revenue growth to decline. As a result of these changes, our
    long-term projections showed declines in discounted future
    operating cash flows. These revised cash flows indicated that
    the implied fair value of Lowe’s goodwill was less than the
    related book value resulting in a goodwill impairment charge of
    $91.0 at our Lowe reporting unit.

During our annual impairment test in the third quarter of 2005,
    we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $5.8 at a reporting
    unit within our sports and entertainment marketing business. The
    long-term projections showed previously unanticipated declines
    in discounted future operating cash flows and, as a result,
    these discounted future operating cash flows indicated that the
    implied fair value of goodwill was less than the related book
    value.

In 2007, our effective tax rate was negatively impacted by
    foreign profits subject to tax at different rates and by losses
    in certain foreign locations where we receive no tax benefit due
    to 100% valuation allowances. Our effective tax rate was
    positively impacted in 2007 by the release of tax reserves
    resulting from the effective settlement of the IRS examination
    for

2003-2004

and by the net reversal of valuation allowances. Certain tax law
    changes also impacted the effective tax rate, which resulted in
    the write-down of net deferred tax assets of $16.2, primarily in
    certain

non-U.S. jurisdictions

and, to a lesser extent, certain U.S. states.

As required by SFAS No. 109,

Accounting for Income
    Tax

(“SFAS 109”)

,

we evaluate on a
    quarterly basis the realizability of our deferred tax assets.
    SFAS 109 requires a valuation allowance to be established
    when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of
    deferred tax assets will not be realized. In circumstances where
    there is sufficient negative evidence, establishment of a
    valuation allowance must be considered. We believe that
    cumulative losses in the most recent three-year period represent
    significant negative evidence under the provisions of
    SFAS 109, and as a result, we determined that certain of
    our deferred tax assets required the establishment of a
    valuation allowance. The realization of our deferred tax assets
    is primarily dependent on future earnings. The amount of the
    deferred tax assets considered realizable could be reduced in
    the near future if estimates of future taxable income are lower
    than anticipated. The deferred tax assets for which an allowance
    was recognized relate primarily to tax credit carryforwards,
    foreign tax loss carryforwards and U.S. capital loss
    carryforwards. The change in the valuation allowance during the
    period is as follows:

Amounts reversed to costs and expenses primarily relate to a
    reversal of $30.5 from the write-down of deferred tax assets in
    certain jurisdictions with existing valuation allowances due to
    tax law changes. The remainder relates to reversals of valuation
    allowances in various countries where we believe that it is now
    more likely than not that tax loss carryforwards will be
    utilized. Amounts charged to gross tax assets and other accounts
    relate primarily to the effect of foreign currency translation.



Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)

The change during 2006 in the deferred tax valuation allowance
    relates to uncertainties regarding future utilization of tax
    loss carryforwards, offset primarily by reversals of $45.0 of
    valuation allowances in two European countries where we believed
    that it was more likely than not that the corresponding tax loss
    carryforwards will be utilized. In addition, we believed that it
    was more likely than not that approximately $29.0 of
    U.S. capital loss carryforwards and $17.0 of foreign tax
    credits would not be utilized. We also wrote off previously
    reserved for deferred tax assets that were deemed to be
    permanently unrealizable due to the expiration of tax loss
    carryforwards and sales of certain businesses.

As of December 31, 2007, there are $68.1 of tax credit
    carryforwards with expiration periods beginning in 2009 and
    ending in 2013. There are also $1,793.2 of loss carryforwards,
    of which $681.2 are U.S. capital and tax loss carryforwards
    that expire in the years 2008 through 2026. The remaining
    $1,112.0 are

non-U.S. tax

loss carryforwards of which $835.2 have unlimited carry forward
    periods and $276.8 have expiration periods from 2008 through
    2023.

As of December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006, we had
    approximately $1,228.0 and $991.8, respectively, of
    undistributed earnings attributable to foreign subsidiaries. It
    is our intention to permanently reinvest undistributed earnings
    of our foreign subsidiaries. We have not provided deferred
    U.S. income taxes or foreign withholding taxes on temporary
    differences resulting from earnings for certain foreign
    subsidiaries which are permanently reinvested outside the
    U.S. It is not practicable to determine the amount of
    unrecognized deferred tax liability associated with these
    temporary differences.

We adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes

(“FIN 48”), on January 1, 2007. As a
    result of the implementation of FIN 48, we recorded a $9.5
    increase in the net liability for unrecognized tax positions,
    which was recorded as an adjustment to retained earnings
    effective January 1, 2007.

The following table summarizes the activity related to our
    unrecognized tax benefits:

Included in the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits of
    $121.1 as of December 31, 2007, is $103.5 of tax benefits
    that, if recognized, would impact the effective tax rate and
    $17.6 of tax benefits that, if recognized, would result in
    adjustments to other tax accounts, primarily deferred taxes. The
    total amount of accrued interest and penalties as of
    December 31, 2007 is $33.6, of which $9.2 is included in
    the current year’s Consolidated Statement of Operations. In
    accordance with our accounting policy, interest and penalties
    accrued on unrecognized tax benefits are classified as income
    taxes in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. We have not
    elected to change this classification with the adoption of
    FIN 48.

With respect to all tax years open to examination by
    U.S. federal and various state, local, and

non-U.S. tax

authorities, we currently anticipate that the total unrecognized
    tax benefits will decrease by an amount between $40.0 and $50.0
    in the next twelve months, a portion of which will affect the
    effective tax rate, primarily as a result of the settlement of
    tax examinations and the lapsing of statutes of limitation. This
    net decrease is related to various items of income and expense,
    including transfer pricing adjustments and restatement
    adjustments. For this purpose, we expect to complete our
    discussions with the IRS appeals division regarding the years
    1997 through 2004 within the next twelve months.



Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)

On May 1, 2007, the IRS completed its examination of our
    2003 and 2004 income tax returns and proposed a number of
    adjustments to our taxable income. We have appealed a number of
    these items. In addition, during the second quarter of 2007,
    there were net reversals of tax reserves, primarily related to
    previously unrecognized tax benefits related to various items of
    income and expense, including approximately $80.0 for certain
    worthless securities deductions associated with investments in
    consolidated subsidiaries, which was a result of the completion
    of the tax examination.

In December 2007, the IRS commenced its examination for the 2005
    and 2006 tax years. In addition, we have various tax years under
    examination by tax authorities in various countries, such as the
    U.K., and in various states, such as New York, in which we have
    significant business operations. It is not yet known whether
    these examinations will, in the aggregate, result in our paying
    additional taxes. We have established tax reserves that we
    believe to be adequate in relation to the potential for
    additional assessments in each of the jurisdictions in which we
    are subject to taxation. We regularly assess the likelihood of
    additional tax assessments in those jurisdictions and adjust our
    reserves as additional information or events require.

With limited exceptions, we are no longer subject to
    U.S. income tax audits for years prior to 1997, state and
    local income tax audits for years prior to 1999, or

non-U.S. income

tax audits for years prior to 2000.

    Transactions

Floating
    Rate Senior Unsecured Notes

In December 2006, we exchanged all of our $250.0 Floating Rate
    Notes due 2008 for $250.0 aggregate principal amount Floating
    Rate Notes due 2010. The new Floating Rate Notes mature on
    November 15, 2010 and bear interest at a per annum rate
    equal to three-month LIBOR plus 200 basis points,
    125 basis points less than the interest rate on the old
    Floating Rate Notes. In connection with the exchange, we made an
    early participation payment of $41.25 (actual amount) in cash
    per $1,000 (actual amount) principal amount of old Floating Rate
    Notes for a total payment of $10.3.

In accordance with EITF Issue

No. 96-19,

Debtor’s Accounting for a Modification or Exchange of
    Debt Instruments

(“EITF 96-19”),

this transaction was treated as an exchange of debt for
    accounting purposes because the present value of the remaining
    cash flows under the terms of the original instrument were not
    substantially different from those of the new instrument. The
    new Floating Rate Notes were reflected on our 2006 Consolidated
    Balance Sheet net of the $10.3 early participation payment on
    exchange, which is amortized over the life of the new Floating
    Rate Notes as a discount, using an effective interest method and
    recorded in interest expense. We amortized $2.6 and $0.2 of the
    discount in interest expense during 2007 and 2006, respectively.
    Direct fees associated with the exchange of $3.5 were reflected
    in interest expense in the 2006 Consolidated Statement of
    Operations.

Convertible
    Senior Notes

In November 2007, we exchanged $200.0 of our
    4.50% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023 (the
    “4.50% Notes”) for $200.0 aggregate principal
    amount of 4.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023 (the
    “4.75% Notes”). In accordance with

EITF 96-19

and EITF Issue

No. 06-6,

Debtor’s Accounting for a Modification (or Exchange) of
    Convertible Debt Instruments

(“EITF 06-6”),

this exchange was treated as an extinguishment of the
    4.50% Notes and an issuance of 4.75% Notes for
    accounting purposes because the fair value of the embedded
    conversion option under the terms of the original instrument was
    substantially different from that of the new instrument. As a
    result, the 4.75% Notes were reflected on our 2007
    Consolidated Balance Sheet at their fair value at issuance, or
    $212.0. We recorded a non-cash charge in the fourth quarter of



Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)

2007 of $12.0 reflecting the difference between the fair value
    of the new debt and the carrying value of the 4.50% Notes
    exchanged. The difference between the fair value and carrying
    value will be amortized through March 15, 2013, which is
    the first date holders may require us to repurchase the
    4.75% Notes, resulting in a reduction of interest expense
    in future periods.

In November 2006, we exchanged $400.0 of our 4.50% Notes
    for $400.0 aggregate principal amount of 4.25% Convertible
    Senior Notes due 2023 (the “4.25% Notes”). In
    accordance with

EITF 96-19,

this exchange was treated as an extinguishment of the
    4.50% Notes and an issuance of 4.25% Notes for
    accounting purposes because the present value of the remaining
    cash flows plus the fair value of the embedded conversion option
    under the terms of the original instrument were substantially
    different from those of the new instrument. As a result, the
    4.25% Notes were reflected on our 2006 Consolidated Balance
    Sheet at their fair value at issuance, or $477.0. We recorded a
    non-cash charge in the fourth quarter of 2006 of $77.0
    reflecting the difference between the fair value of the new debt
    and the carrying value of the old debt. The difference between
    the fair value and carrying value will be amortized through
    March 15, 2012, which is the first date holders may require
    us to repurchase the 4.25% Notes, resulting in a reduction
    of interest expense in future periods. We amortized $14.4 and
    $1.8 of the premium in interest expense during 2007 and 2006,
    respectively.

Convertible
    Senior Note Terms

Conversion
    Features

Our 4.25%, 4.50% and 4.75% Notes (“Convertible
    Notes”) are convertible into our common stock at a
    conversion price of $12.42 per share, subject to adjustment in
    specified circumstances including, for the 4.25% and
    4.75% Notes, any payment of cash dividends on our common
    stock. The conversion rates of our Convertible Notes are also
    subject to adjustment for certain events arising from stock
    splits and combinations, stock dividends and certain other
    actions by us that modify our capital structure. The Convertible
    Notes provide for an additional “make-whole”
    adjustment to the conversion rate in the event of a change of
    control meeting specified conditions.

Our Convertible Notes are convertible at any time if the average
    price of our common stock for 20 trading days immediately
    preceding the conversion date is greater than or equal to a
    specified percentage of the conversion price; this percentage
    was equal to 118.0% in 2007 and declines 0.5% each year until it
    reaches 110% at maturity. Each series of our Convertible Notes
    is also convertible, regardless of the price of our common
    stock, if: (i) we call that series of Convertible Notes for
    redemption; (ii) we make specified distributions to
    shareholders; (iii) we become a party to a consolidation,
    merger or binding share exchange pursuant to which our common
    stock would be converted into cash or property (other than
    securities); or (iv) the credit ratings assigned to that
    series of Convertible Notes by any two of Moody’s Investors
    Service, Standard & Poor’s and Fitch Ratings are
    lower than Ba2, BB and BB, respectively, or that series of
    Convertible Notes is no longer rated by at least two of these
    ratings services. Because of our current credit ratings, all of
    our Convertible Notes are currently convertible. Our 4.25% and
    4.75% Notes are also convertible, whether or not the above
    conditions are met, from February 15 to March 15, 2023.

Repurchase
    / Redemption Options

Holders of our Convertible Notes may require us to repurchase
    the Notes on certain dates for cash only, and on other dates for
    cash or our common stock or a combination of cash and common
    stock, at our election. Additionally, investors may require us
    to repurchase our Convertible Notes in the event of certain
    change of control events that occur prior to certain dates, for
    cash or our common stock or a combination of cash and common
    stock, at our election. At our option, we may redeem our
    Convertible Notes on or at any time after certain dates for
    cash. The redemption price in each of these instances will be
    100% of the principal amount

of the Convertible Notes being redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid

Participating
    Security Features

With respect to the 4.50% Notes, if at any time on or after
    March 13, 2003 we pay cash dividends on our common stock,
    we will pay contingent interest in an amount equal to 100% of
    the per share cash dividend paid on the common stock multiplied
    by the number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion
    of the 4.50% Notes.

In accordance with

EITF 03-6,

the 4.25% Notes and 4.75% Notes are not considered
    securities with participation rights in earnings available to
    common stockholders as there are no features attached to these
    securities that allow holders to participate in our
    undistributed earnings. The 4.50% Notes are considered
    securities with participation rights in earnings available to
    common stockholders due to the feature of these securities that
    allows investors to participate in cash dividends paid on our
    common stock. For periods in which we generate net income, the
    impact of these securities’ participation rights is
    included in the calculation of earnings per share. For periods
    in which we incur a net loss, the 4.50% Notes have no
    impact on the calculation of earnings per share due to the fact
    that the holders of these securities do not participate in our
    losses.

Embedded
    Derivatives

The terms of the 4.50% Notes include two embedded
    derivative instruments and the terms of our 4.75% Notes and
    4.25% Notes each include one embedded derivative
    instrument. The fair value of these derivatives on
    December 31, 2007 and 2006 was negligible.

Credit
    Arrangements

We have a committed credit agreement and uncommitted credit
    facilities with various banks that permit borrowings at variable
    interest rates. As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, there
    were no borrowings under our committed credit facility. However,
    there were borrowings under the uncommitted facilities made by
    several of our subsidiaries outside the U.S. We have
    guaranteed the repayment of some of these borrowings by our
    subsidiaries. The weighted-average interest rate on outstanding
    balances under the uncommitted short-term

    Consolidated Financial

facilities as of December 31, 2007 and 2006 was

Our primary credit agreement is a $750.0 Three-Year Credit
    Agreement, dated as of June 13, 2006 (the “Credit
    Agreement”). Under the Credit Agreement, a special-purpose
    entity called ELF Special Financing Ltd. (“ELF”) acts
    as the lender and letter of credit issuer. ELF is obligated at
    our request to make cash advances to us and to issue letters of
    credit for our account, in an aggregate amount not to exceed
    $750.0 outstanding at any time. The aggregate face amount of
    letters of credit may not exceed $600.0 at any time. Our
    obligations under the Credit Agreement are unsecured. The Credit
    Agreement is a revolving facility, under which amounts borrowed
    may be repaid and borrowed again, and the aggregate available
    amount of letters of credit may decrease or increase, subject to
    the overall limit of $750.0 and the $600.0 limit on letters of
    credit. We are not subject to any financial or other material
    restrictive covenants under the Credit Agreement.

We pay commitment fees on the undrawn amount, less the letters
    of credit, under the Credit Agreement at 0.78% per annum, and we
    pay commissions of 0.78% per annum on the amounts available to
    be drawn under the letters of credit. In addition, we pay a
    facility fee equal to 0.15% per annum on the undrawn amount,
    including letters of credit, under the facility. If we draw
    under the facility, interest is payable on any outstanding
    advances under the Credit Agreement at

3-month

LIBOR plus 0.78% per annum. The Credit Agreement will expire on
    June 15, 2009.

We entered into the Credit Agreement during the second quarter
    of 2006 as part of a transaction we refer to as the “ELF
    Financing.” ELF is a special-purpose entity incorporated in
    the Cayman Islands, in which we have no equity or other interest
    and which we do not consolidate for financial reporting
    purposes. In the ELF Financing, institutional investors
    purchased from ELF debt securities issued by ELF (the “ELF
    Notes”) and warrants issued by us (refer to Note 11).
    ELF received $750.0 in proceeds from these sales, which it used
    to purchase AAA-rated liquid assets. It will hold the liquid
    assets pending any request for borrowing from us or any drawing
    on any letters of credit issued for our account under the Credit
    Agreement, which ELF will fund by selling liquid assets. We are
    not the issuer of the ELF Notes and are not party to the
    indenture governing the ELF Notes. In conjunction with the ELF
    Financing we paid $41.2 of issuance costs, with the offset
    recorded in other assets. The issuance costs consist of
    approximately $25.0 of underwriting commissions, legal and
    accounting fees, printing costs and other fees or expenses, with
    the balance in a fee to one of the initial purchasers for its
    services as structuring agent for the offering. These costs will
    be amortized through the exercise date of the warrants on a
    straight-line basis as a component of interest expense. During
    2007, we amortized $13.7 of issuance costs.

Under certain circumstances, including certain events of default
    involving us or occurring under the ELF Notes, the commitment to
    make advances and issue letters of credit under the Credit
    Agreement may be terminated by ELF, acting on instruction of the
    holders of the ELF Notes. We will be entitled, prior to any such
    termination, to make a borrowing of up to the entire available
    amount of the commitment under the Credit Agreement (regardless
    of whether our obligations under the Credit Agreement have been
    accelerated). Upon termination of the commitment, the holders of
    the ELF Notes will automatically receive interests in the
    outstanding loans in exchange for their ELF Notes. Thereafter we
    will not be able to borrow or reborrow



Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)

additional funds under the Credit Agreement, but the advances
    will remain outstanding as term loans maturing on June 15,
    2009 (subject to the rights of the holders to accelerate the
    loans upon an event of default).

Cash
    Poolings

We aggregate our net domestic cash position on a daily basis.
    Outside the U.S., we use cash pooling arrangements with banks to
    help manage our liquidity requirements. In these pooling
    arrangements, several Interpublic agencies agree with a single
    bank that the cash balances of any of the agencies with the bank
    will be subject to a full right of setoff against amounts the
    other agencies owe the bank, and the bank provides overdrafts as
    long as the net balance for all the agencies does not exceed an

agreed-upon

level. Typically each agency pays interest on outstanding
    overdrafts and receives interest on cash balances. Our
    Consolidated Balance Sheets reflect cash net of overdrafts for
    each pooling arrangement. As of December 31, 2007 and 2006,
    a gross amount of $1,295.7 and $1,052.5, respectively, in cash
    was netted against an equal gross amount of overdrafts under
    pooling arrangements.

Note 11:

Warrants

As part of the ELF Financing completed during the second quarter
    of 2006, we issued 67.9 warrants, consisting of 29.1 capped
    warrants (“Capped Warrants”) and 38.8 uncapped
    warrants (“Uncapped Warrants”). In accordance with
    EITF Issue

No. 00-19,

Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments Indexed to,
    and Potentially Settled in, a Company’s Own Stock

(“EITF 00-19”),

we recorded $63.4 of deferred warrant cost in other assets, with
    the offset recorded to additional paid-in capital within
    stockholders’ equity. This amount is a non-cash transaction
    and represents the fair value of the warrants at the transaction
    close date estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing
    model, which requires reliance on variables including the price
    volatility of the underlying stock. The deferred warrant cost
    will be amortized through the exercise date of the warrants as
    issuance costs on a straight-line basis as a non-cash element of
    interest expense. During 2007 and 2006, we amortized $21.1 and
    $11.4, respectively, in interest expense in the Consolidated
    Statements of Operations.

The stated exercise date of the warrants is June 15, 2009.
    Following the exercise of the warrants each warrant will entitle
    the warrant holder to receive an amount in cash, shares of our
    common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of our common
    stock, at our option. The amount will be based, subject to
    customary adjustments, on the difference between the market
    price of one share of our common stock (calculated as the
    average share price over 30 trading days following expiration)
    and the stated exercise price of the warrant. For the Uncapped
    Warrants, the exercise price is $11.91 per warrant. For the
    Capped Warrants, the exercise price is $9.89 per warrant but the
    amount deliverable upon exercise is capped so a holder will not
    benefit from appreciation of the common stock above $12.36 per
    share.

Concurrently with the issuance of the warrants described above,
    we entered into call spread transactions with four different
    counterparties to reduce the potential dilution or cash cost
    upon exercise of the Uncapped Warrants. Each transaction gives
    us the right to receive, upon expiration of the options
    thereunder, an amount in cash, shares of our common stock, or a
    combination of cash and shares of our common stock, at our
    option. The amount will be based, subject to customary
    adjustments, on the difference between the market price of one
    share of our common stock (calculated as the average share price
    over 30 trading days following expiration) and $11.91 per share,
    the exercise price of the Uncapped Warrants. The amount
    deliverable to us under the call spread transactions, however,
    is capped so we will not receive any amount relating to
    appreciation of our common stock above $14.38 per share, and we
    will incur dilution or cash costs upon exercise of the Uncapped
    Warrants to the extent our share price exceeds $14.38 per share
    at that time. The four transactions cover an aggregate notional
    amount of 38.8 shares, equivalent to the full number of the
    Uncapped Warrants, and had an aggregate purchase price of $29.2.
    In accordance with

EITF 00-19

the cost of the four transactions has been recorded as a
    reduction to additional paid-in capital within
    stockholders’ equity.



Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)

In accordance with

EITF 03-6,

the warrants are not considered securities with participation
    rights in earnings available to common stockholders due to the
    contingent nature of the exercise feature of these securities.

Note 12:

Convertible
    Preferred Stock

Each share of our 5.25% Series B Cumulative Convertible
    Perpetual Preferred Stock (“Series B Preferred
    Stock”) has a liquidation preference of $1,000 per share
    and is convertible at the option of the holder at any time into
    73.1904 shares of our common stock, subject to adjustment
    upon the occurrence of certain events, which represents a
    conversion price of $13.66. On or after October 15, 2010,
    each share of the Series B Preferred Stock may be converted
    at our option if the closing price of our common stock
    multiplied by the conversion rate then in effect equals or
    exceeds 130% of the liquidation preference of $1,000 per share
    for 20 trading days during any consecutive 30 trading day
    period. Holders of the Series B Preferred Stock will be
    entitled to an adjustment to the conversion rate if they convert
    their shares in connection with a fundamental change meeting
    certain specified conditions. The Series B Preferred Stock
    is junior to all of our existing and future debt obligations and
    senior to our common stock, with respect to payments of
    dividends and rights upon liquidation, winding up or
    dissolution, to the extent of the liquidation preference of
    $1,000 per share.

The terms of the Series B Preferred Stock include an
    embedded derivative instrument, the fair value of which as of
    December 31, 2007 and 2006 was negligible.

In accordance with

EITF 03-6,

the Series B Preferred Stock is not considered a security
    with participation rights in earnings available to common
    stockholders due to the contingent nature of the conversion
    feature of these securities.

Payment
    of Dividends

The terms of our Series B Preferred Stock do not permit us
    to pay dividends on our common stock unless all accumulated and
    unpaid dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock have been
    or contemporaneously are declared and paid, or provision for the
    payment thereof has been made.

We paid dividends of $27.6, or $52.50 per share, on our
    Series B Preferred Stock during 2007. Regular quarterly
    dividends, if declared, are $6.9, or $13.125 per share.
    Dividends on each share of Series B Preferred Stock are
    payable quarterly in cash or, if certain conditions are met, in
    common stock, at our option, on January 15, April 15,
    July 15 and October 15 of each year. The dividend rate of the
    Series B Preferred Stock will be increased by one
    percentage point if we do not pay dividends on the Series B
    Preferred Stock for six quarterly periods (whether consecutive
    or not). The dividend rate will revert back to the original rate
    once all unpaid dividends are paid in full.

Dividends on our Series B Preferred Stock are cumulative
    from the date of issuance and are payable on each payment date
    to the extent that we have assets that are legally available to
    pay dividends and our Board of Directors or an authorized
    committee of our Board declares a dividend payable. Pursuant to
    the terms of the Series B Preferred Stock, if we do not pay
    dividends on any series of our preferred stock for six quarterly
    periods (whether consecutive or not), then holders of all series
    of our preferred stock then outstanding will have the right to
    elect two additional directors to the Board. These additional
    directors will remain on the Board until all accumulated and
    unpaid dividends on our cumulative preferred stock have been
    paid in full, or to the extent any series of non-cumulative
    preferred stock is outstanding, until non-cumulative dividends
    have been paid regularly for at least one year.

Note 13:

Employee
    Benefits

Pension
    Plans

We have a defined benefit pension plan (“Domestic
    Plan”) which covers substantially all regular domestic
    employees employed through March 31, 1998. This plan
    features a traditional career pay benefit as well as a cash
    balance benefit, which was added in 1992. Post-1992 participants
    are eligible for the cash balance benefit only. For pre-1992
    participants, the benefit is the greater of the cash balance
    benefit or the career pay benefit formula. Participants are
    eligible to receive their benefit in the form of a lump sum
    payment or an annuity. Effective April 1, 1998, plan
    participation and benefit accruals for the Domestic Plan were
    frozen and participants with less than five years of service
    became fully vested. As of December 31, 2007, there were
    approximately 4,500 participants in the Domestic Plan.
    Participants with five or more years of participation in the
    Domestic Plan as of March 31, 1998 retained their vested
    balances in the Domestic Plan and also became eligible for
    payments under a compensation arrangement, the
    “Supplemental Compensation Plan” (described below).
    Some of our agencies have additional domestic plans covering a
    total of approximately 300 employees. These plans are also
    closed to new participants.

We also have numerous plans outside the U.S., some of which are
    funded, while others provide payments at the time of retirement
    or termination under applicable labor laws or agreements. The
    Interpublic Pension Plan in the U.K. (“U.K. Pension
    Plan”) is the most material foreign pension plan in terms
    of the benefit obligation and plan assets. This plan is a
    defined benefit plan offering plan participants a final average
    pay benefit. Effective November 1, 2002, the U.K. Pension
    Plan was closed to new entrants, but existing participants may
    continue to earn benefits under the plan. New employees after
    November 1, 2002 may be eligible to join the industry
    wide plan that operates on a defined contribution basis.
    Effective July 1, 2007, certain remaining participants of
    the U.K. Pension Plan chose to join a defined contribution plan
    for future service. Benefits accrued through July 1, 2007
    will continue to be linked to a final average pay benefit.

Postretirement
    Benefit Plans

Some of our domestic subsidiaries provide postretirement health
    benefits to eligible employees and their dependents and
    postretirement life insurance to eligible employees. For
    domestic employees to be eligible for postretirement health
    benefits, an employee had to be hired prior to January 1,
    1988 (June 22, 2001 for domestic employees of the former
    True North Communications companies). To be eligible for life
    insurance, an employee had to be hired prior to December 1,
    1961 (June 22, 2001 for domestic employees of the former
    True North Communications companies). Benefits are provided to
    retirees before and after eligibility for Medicare, and our cost
    is based on each participant’s retirement date and pre- and
    post-Medicare eligibility. As of December 31, 2007, there
    were approximately 3,600 participants in these plans.

Our postretirement health benefits plans are unfunded, and we
    pay claims as presented by the plans’ administrator. The
    postretirement life insurance plan is insured and we pay
    premiums to the plan administrator.

In December 2003, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement
    and Modernization Act of 2003 (the “Act”) was enacted.
    The Act established a prescription drug benefit under Medicare,
    known as “Medicare Part D,” and a federal subsidy
    to sponsors of postretirement health benefits plans that provide
    a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to the
    Medicare Part D benefit. The prescription drug benefit
    provided to certain participants in the postretirement medical
    plan is at least actuarially equivalent to the Medicare
    Part D benefit, and, accordingly, we are entitled to a
    subsidy. Our application for the subsidy for 2007 was accepted
    by the Department of Health and Human Services. We elected to
    prospectively recognize the effect of the Act during the third
    quarter of 2004. The expected subsidy reduced the accumulated
    postretirement benefit obligation by $5.0 at adoption, and the
    net periodic cost by $1.0 for 2007, 2006 and 2005 compared to
    the amount calculated without considering the effects of the
    subsidy.



Notes to
    Consolidated Financial

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)

Certain of our foreign subsidiaries provide postretirement
    health benefits to eligible employees and their dependents.
    Eligibility requirements and benefit provisions vary in each
    country. As of December 31, 2007, the benefit obligation of
    these plans was $1.5 and there were approximately 100
    participants in these plans. The expense recognized during 2007
    was $0.1.

Adoption
    of SFAS 158

On September 29, 2006, the FASB issued SFAS 158.
    SFAS 158 requires an employer to recognize an asset or
    liability for the overfunded or underfunded status of their
    pension and other postretirement benefit plans. For a pension
    plan, the asset or liability is the difference between the fair
    value of the plan’s assets and the projected benefit
    obligation. For any other postretirement benefit plan, the asset
    or liability is the difference between the fair value of the
    plan’s assets and the accumulated postretirement benefit
    obligation. SFAS 158 requires employers to recognize all
    unrecognized transition obligations and assets, prior service
    costs and credits and actuarial gains and losses in accumulated
    other comprehensive loss, net of tax. Such amounts are adjusted
    as they are subsequently recognized through the components of
    net periodic benefit cost or income pursuant to the amortization
    provisions.

The following table summarizes the effect of required changes in
    the additional minimum liability (AML) as of December 31,
    2006 prior to the adoption of SFAS 158 as well as the
    impact of the initial adoption of SFAS 158 for domestic
    plans, the principal foreign pension plans and the
    postretirement benefit plan.

Determination
    of Discount Rates

For the domestic pension and postretirement benefit plans, we
    determine our discount rate based on the estimated rate at which
    annuity contracts could be purchased to effectively settle the
    respective benefit obligations. In determining the discount
    rate, we utilize a yield curve based on Moody’s Aa-rated
    corporate non-callable bonds. Each plan’s projected cash
    flow is matched to this yield curve and a present value is
    developed, which is then used to develop a single equivalent
    discount rate. The average duration of our domestic pension and
    postretirement health care obligations was 10 years as of
    December 31, 2007.

For the foreign pension plans, we determine a discount rate by
    referencing market yields on high quality corporate bonds in the
    local markets with the appropriate term as of December 31,
    2007.

Determination
    of the Expected Return on Assets

For the Domestic Plan, we develop the long-term expected rate of
    return assumptions which we use to model and determine overall
    asset allocations. Our rate of return analyses factor in
    historical trends, current market conditions, risk premiums
    associated with asset classes and long-term inflation rates. We
    determine both a short-term (5-7 year) and long-term
    (30 year) view and then attempt to select a long-term rate
    of return assumption that matches the duration of our
    liabilities. Factors included in the analysis of returns include
    historical trends of asset class index returns over various
    market cycles and economic conditions.

The U.K. Pension Plan makes up 86% of the foreign plan assets.
    The U.K. Pension Plan’s statement of investment principles
    specifies benchmark allocations by asset category for each
    investment manager employed, with specified ranges around the
    central benchmark allocation. For the U.K. Pension Plan, we
    determine the expected rate of return by utilizing a weighted
    average approach based on the current long-term expected rates
    of return for each asset category. The long-term expected rate
    of return for the equity category is based on the current
    long-term rates of return available on government bonds and
    applying suitable risk premiums that consider historical market
    returns and current market expectations.

Asset
    Allocation

The primary investment goal for our plans’ assets is to
    maximize total asset returns while ensuring the plans’
    assets are available to fund the plans’ liabilities as they
    become due. The plans’ assets in aggregate and at the
    individual portfolio level are invested so that total portfolio
    risk exposure and risk-adjusted returns best meet this objective.

As of December 31, 2007 our domestic and foreign (primarily
    the U.K.) pension plans’ target asset allocations for 2008,
    as well as the actual asset allocations as of December 31,
    2007 and 2006, are as follows:

The aggregate amount of our own stock held as investment for our

Healthcare
    Cost Trend

Assumed healthcare cost trend rates have a moderate effect on
    the amounts reported for the postretirement benefit plans. We
    develop our healthcare cost trend rate assumptions based on data
    collected on recent trends and forecasts. A one percentage point
    change in assumed healthcare cost trend rates would have the

    did not contribute to our domestic pension plans and we
    contributed $30.1 to our foreign pension plans.

The estimated future payments for our postretirement benefit

    from $0.6 in 2008 to $0.9 in 2012 and are estimated to be $5.0
    for the period

2013-2017.

Supplemental
    Compensation Plan

As discussed above, participants with five or more years of
    participation in the Domestic Plan as of March 31, 1998
    became eligible for payments under the Supplemental Compensation
    Plan. Under this plan, each participant is eligible for an
    annual allocation, which approximates the projected discontinued
    pension benefit accrual (formerly made under the cash balance
    formula in the Domestic Plan) plus interest, while they continue
    to work for us. Payments began in 2003 and are scheduled to end
    in 2008. As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, the Supplemental
    Compensation Plan liability recorded was $3.0 and $5.4,
    respectively. Amounts (reversed) expensed for the Supplemental
    Compensation Plan in 2007, 2006 and 2005 were $(0.1), $0.6 and
    $1.0, respectively.

Savings
    Plans

We sponsor a defined contribution plan (“Savings
    Plan”) that covers substantially all domestic employees.
    The Savings Plan permits participants to make contributions on a
    pre-tax

and/or

after-tax basis. The Savings Plan allows participants to choose
    among various investment alternatives. We match a portion of
    participant contributions based upon their years of service. We
    contributed $32.5, $31.2 and $29.9 to the Savings Plan in 2007,
    2006 and 2005, respectively. During 2007, we used approximately
    $6.0 of participant forfeitures to



Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)

offset our Savings Plan contributions. We contributed $8.1 to
    the Savings Plan during 2007 for the performance-based
    discretionary match for 2006 and during 2008, we expect to
    contribute $4.9 for 2007. In addition, we maintain defined
    contribution plans in various foreign countries and contributed
    $26.7, $11.8 and $5.3 to these plans in 2007, 2006 and 2005,
    respectively.

Deferred
    Compensation and Benefit Arrangements

We have deferred compensation arrangements which (i) permit
    certain of our key officers and employees to defer a portion of
    their salary or incentive compensation, or (ii) require us
    to contribute an amount to the participant’s account. The
    arrangements typically provide that the participant will receive
    the amounts deferred plus interest upon attaining certain
    conditions, such as completing a certain number of years of
    service or upon retirement or termination. As of
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, the deferred compensation
    liability balance was $137.6 and $143.9, respectively. Amounts
    expensed for deferred compensation arrangements in 2007, 2006
    and 2005 were $11.9, $10.3 and $10.2, respectively.

We have deferred benefit arrangements with certain key officers
    and employees which provide participants with an annual payment,
    payable when the participant attains a certain age and after the
    participant’s employment has terminated. The deferred
    benefit liability was $164.5 and $157.9 as of December 31,
    2007 and 2006, respectively. Amounts expensed for deferred
    benefit arrangements in 2007, 2006 and 2005 were $15.5, $13.7
    and $30.9, respectively.

A significant assumption used to estimate certain deferred
    benefit liabilities is a participant’s retirement age. For
    one of our more significant deferred benefit arrangements,
    during the fourth quarter of 2005, based on an analysis of
    recent trends, we determined most eligible participants were
    retiring and beginning to collect their deferred benefits at
    age 60. This compares to previous periods which used an
    assumed retirement of age 65 within the related deferred
    benefit liability calculation. This change in estimate, recorded
    during the fourth quarter of 2005, resulted in a $14.8 charge to
    salaries and related expenses, with a corresponding increase to
    the deferred benefit liability.

We have purchased life insurance policies on participants’
    lives to assist in the funding of the related deferred
    compensation and deferred benefit liabilities. As of
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, the cash surrender value of
    these policies was $109.7 and $117.0, respectively. In addition
    to the life insurance policies, certain investments are held for
    the purpose of paying the deferred compensation and deferred
    benefit liabilities. These investments, along with the life
    insurance policies, are held in a separate revocable trust for
    the purpose of paying the deferred compensation and the deferred
    benefit arrangement liabilities. As of December 31, 2007
    and 2006, the value of such investments in the trust was $93.5
    and $88.5, respectively. The short-term investments, long-term
    investments and cash surrender value of the policies in the
    trust are included in cash and cash equivalents, investments and
    other assets, respectively.

Long-term
    Disability Plan

We have a Long-term Disability (“LTD”) plan which
    provides income replacement benefits to eligible participants
    who are unable to perform their job duties during the first
    24 months of disability. Benefits are continued thereafter
    if the participant is unable to perform any job related to his
    or her education, training or experience, provided the
    participants receive disability benefits from Social Security.
    As all income replacement benefits are fully insured, no related
    obligation is required as of December 31, 2007 and 2006. In
    addition to income replacement benefits, LTD participants may
    remain covered for certain health and life insurance benefits up
    to age 65 (subject to minimum periods depending on the
    participants’ age at time of disability). We have recorded
    an obligation of $7.1 and $6.9 as of December 31, 2007 and
    2006, respectively, related to medical, dental benefits and life
    insurance benefits for LTD participants.

Note 14:

Stock-Based
    Compensation

    Performance Incentive Plan

We issue stock and cash based incentive awards to our employees
    under a plan established by the Compensation Committee of the
    Board of Directors and approved by our shareholders. In May
    2006, our shareholders approved the 2006 Performance Incentive
    Plan (the “2006 PIP”). Under the 2006 PIP, up to
    6.0 shares of common stock may be used for granting stock
    options and stock appreciation rights and up to 33.0 shares
    of common stock may be used for granting performance-based
    awards and other stock-based awards. Subject to the terms of the
    2006 PIP, additional awards may be granted from shares available
    for issuance under previous plans and in other limited
    circumstances. Only a certain number of shares are available for
    each type of award under the 2006 PIP, and there are limits on
    the number of shares that may be awarded to any one participant.
    The vesting period of awards granted is generally commensurate
    with the requisite service period. We generally issue new shares
    to satisfy the exercise of stock options or the distribution of
    other stock-based awards. We granted awards under the 2006 PIP
    for 2007 and 2006.

The following table summarizes stock-based compensation expense

Employee
    Stock Purchase Plans

The Interpublic Group of Companies Employee Stock Purchase Plan
    (2006) (the “2006 Plan”) became active April 1,
    2007. Under the 2006 Plan, eligible employees may purchase our
    common stock through payroll deductions not exceeding 10% of
    their eligible compensation or 900 (actual number) shares each
    offering period. The price an employee pays for a share of
    common stock under the 2006 Plan is 90% of the lesser of the
    average market price of a share on the first business day of the
    offering period or the average market price of a share on the
    last business day of the offering period of three months. An
    aggregate of 15.0 shares are reserved for issuance under
    the 2006 Plan, of which 0.3 shares were issued for the year
    ended December 31, 2007. Total compensation expense
    associated with the issued shares was $0.6 for the year ended
    December 31, 2007.

Stock
    Options

Stock options are granted with the exercise price equal to the
    fair market value of our common stock on the grant date, are
    generally exercisable between two and four years from the grant
    date and expire ten years from the grant date (or earlier in the
    case of certain terminations of employment).

in 2007, 2006 and 2005 was $3.0, $0.9 and $0.2, respectively. As
    of December 31, 2007 there was $23.4 of total unrecognized
    compensation expense related to non-vested stock options
    granted, which is expected to be recognized over a
    weighted-average period of 2.4 years. As of
    December 31, 2007, the aggregate intrinsic value for stock
    options outstanding, vested and expected to vest, exercisable
    and non-vested is zero.

We use the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to estimate the
    fair value of options granted, which requires the input of
    subjective assumptions including the option’s expected term
    and the price volatility of the underlying stock. Changes in the
    assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value and
    our results of operations could be materially impacted.

The fair value of each option grant has been estimated with the
    following weighted-average assumptions:

Stock-Settled
    Awards

Stock-settled awards include restricted stock and restricted
    stock units expected to be settled in stock. They are granted to
    certain key employees and are subject to certain restrictions
    and vesting requirements as determined by the Compensation
    Committee. The vesting period is generally three years. No
    monetary consideration is paid by a recipient for a
    stock-settled award, and the fair value of the shares on the
    grant date is amortized over the vesting period.

During 2007, 2006 and 2005, we awarded 5.0, 5.3 and
    4.6 shares of stock-settled awards with a weighted-average
    grant-date fair value of $11.68, $8.77 and $11.98 per award,
    respectively. The total fair value of vested stock-settled
    awards that were distributed to participants during 2007, 2006
    and 2005 was $41.5, $11.0 and $19.8, respectively.

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)

Cash-Settled
    Awards

Cash-settled awards include restricted stock units expected to
    be settled in cash. These awards are granted to certain key
    employees and generally vest over three years. Upon completion
    of the vesting period, the grantee is entitled, at the
    Compensation Committee’s discretion, to receive a payment
    in cash or in shares of common stock based on the fair market
    value of the corresponding number of shares of common stock. The
    holder of the cash-settled awards has no ownership interest in
    the underlying shares of common stock until the awards vest and
    the shares of common stock are issued. No monetary consideration
    is paid by a recipient for a cash-settled award. The fair value
    of cash-settled awards is adjusted at the end of each quarter
    based on our share price. We amortize stock-based compensation
    expense related to these awards over the vesting period based
    upon the quarterly-adjusted fair value.

During 2007, 2006 and 2005, we awarded 0.9, 2.2 and 1.6
    cash-settled awards with a weighted-average grant-date fair
    value of $11.44, $8.88 and $12.09 per award, respectively. The
    total fair value of cash in respect of cash-settled awards
    distributed to participants during 2007, 2006 and 2005 was $6.7,
    $0.2 and $0.1, respectively.

Performance-Based
    Awards

Performance-based awards have been granted to certain key
    employees subject to certain restrictions and vesting
    requirements as determined by the Compensation Committee.
    Performance-based awards are a form of stock-based compensation
    in which the number of shares or units ultimately received by
    the participant depends on Company

and/or

individual performance against specific performance targets and
    can be settled in cash or shares. The awards generally vest over
    a three-year period subject to the participant’s continuing
    employment and the achievement of certain performance
    objectives. The final number of shares or units that could
    ultimately be received by a participant ranges from 0% to 200%
    of the target amount of shares originally granted. The holder of
    a performance-based award has no ownership interest in the
    underlying shares of common stock until the award vests and
    shares of common stock are issued. We amortize stock-based
    compensation expense for the estimated number of
    performance-based awards that we expect to vest over the vesting
    period using the grant-date fair value of the shares. No
    monetary consideration is paid by a participant for a
    performance-based award.

During 2007, 2006 and 2005 we awarded 2.9, 9.9 and
    2.9 shares of performance-based stock, at target, with a
    weighted-average grant-date fair value of $11.69, $9.68 and
    $12.35 per award, respectively. The total fair value of
    performance-based awards distributed to participants during 2007
    and 2006 was $1.4 and $0.1, respectively. No performance-based
    stock awards were distributed during 2005.

Certain stock-based compensation awards expected to be settled
    in cash have been classified as liabilities in the Consolidated
    Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2007 and 2006.

Share
    Appreciation Performance-Based Units

In August 2005, we granted Michael I. Roth, Chairman of the
    Board and Chief Executive Officer, 0.3 share appreciation
    performance-based units (“SAPUs”) based on a
    weighted-average grant-date stock price of $12.17. At the
    Compensation Committee’s discretion, Mr. Roth is
    entitled to receive a payment in cash or shares of common stock
    upon completion of a four-year vesting period. Mr. Roth has
    no ownership interest in the underlying shares of common stock
    until the SAPUs vest and the shares of common stock are issued.
    The fair value of the SAPUs is estimated using the Black-Scholes
    valuation model, using assumptions similar to those used for
    stock options. For 2007, we recorded a credit to stock-based
    compensation expense for SAPUs of $(0.4). The compensation
    expense recorded in 2006 for SAPUs was $0.6. There was no
    compensation expense recorded in 2005 for SAPUs, as the exercise
    price exceeded the market price. As of December 31, 2007,
    there was $0.1 of total unrecognized compensation expense
    related to non-vested SAPUs that is expected to be recognized
    over a weighted-average period of 1.6 years. We amortize
    stock-based compensation expense related to these awards over
    the vesting period based upon the quarterly-adjusted fair value.

Note 15:

Segment
    Information

As of December 31, 2007, we have two reportable segments:
    IAN, which is comprised of Draftfcb, Lowe, McCann Worldgroup,
    our media agencies and our leading stand-alone agencies, and
    CMG, which is comprised of the bulk of our specialist marketing
    service offerings. We also report for the “Corporate and
    other” group. As of December 31, 2005, we had an
    additional segment, Motorsports, which was sold during 2004 and
    had immaterial residual operating results in 2005. Future
    changes to our organizational structure may result in changes to
    the reportable segment disclosure.

Within IAN, our agencies provide a comprehensive array of global
    communications and marketing services, each offering a
    distinctive range of solutions for our clients. In addition, our
    stand-alone agencies, including Campbell-Ewald, Hill Holliday,
    Deutsch and Mullen, provide a full range of advertising,
    marketing



Notes to

    Statements — (Continued)

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)

communications services

and/or

marketing services and partner with our global operating
    divisions as needed. IAN’s operating divisions share
    similar economic characteristics and are similar in other areas,
    specifically related to the nature of their services, the manner
    in which the services are provided and the similarity of their
    respective customers.

CMG, which includes Weber Shandwick, MWW Group, FutureBrand,
    DeVries, GolinHarris, Jack Morton, and Octagon Worldwide,
    provides clients with diversified services, including public
    relations, meeting and event production, sports and
    entertainment marketing, corporate and brand identity and
    strategic marketing consulting. CMG shares some similarities
    with service lines offered by IAN, however, CMG’s
    businesses, on an aggregate basis, have a higher proportion of
    arrangements for which they act as principal, a different
    distribution model than IAN and different margin structure.

The profitability measure employed by our chief operating
    decision maker for allocating resources to operating divisions
    and assessing operating division performance is operating income
    (loss), excluding the impact of restructuring and other
    reorganization-related charges (reversals) and long-lived asset
    impairment charges. With the exception of excluding these
    amounts from reportable segment operating income (loss), all
    segments follow the same accounting policies as those described
    in Note 1.

Certain Corporate and other charges are reported as a separate
    line item within total segment operating income (loss) and
    include corporate office expenses and shared service center
    expenses, as well as certain other centrally managed expenses
    that are not fully allocated to operating divisions. Salaries
    and related expenses include salaries, long-term incentives,
    bonus, and other miscellaneous benefits for corporate office
    employees. In addition, salaries and related expenses include
    long-term incentive award accruals for a one-time
    performance-based equity award granted in 2006 to a limited
    number of senior executives across the Company. Office and
    general expenses primarily includes professional fees related to
    internal control compliance, financial statement audits, legal,
    information technology and other consulting services, which are
    engaged and managed through the corporate office. In addition,
    office and general expenses also includes rental expense and
    depreciation of leasehold improvements for properties occupied
    by corporate office employees. Offsetting these expenses are
    amounts we allocate to operating divisions based on a formula
    that uses the revenues of each of the operating units. Amounts
    allocated also include specific charges for information
    technology-related projects, which are allocated based on
    utilization.

The carrying amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance
    Sheets for cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable,
    accounts payable, accrued expenses and short-term borrowings
    approximated their respective fair values as of
    December 31, 2007 and 2006.

Investment
    Securities

Short-term marketable securities consist primarily of
    available-for-sale debt and equity securities that are publicly
    traded. Long-term investments consist primarily of public and
    non-public available-for-sale equity securities. These are
    mostly equity interests of less than 20% that we have in various
    agencies and are accounted for under the cost method.

Gross unrealized gains on our investments were $2.0, $7.2 and
    $22.6 for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005,
    respectively. Gross unrealized losses on our investments were
    $6.0, $13.5 and $0.2 for the years ended December 31, 2007,
    2006 and 2005, respectively. Unrealized gains and losses are
    reported as a component of other comprehensive income (loss).

Gross realized gains on our investments were $4.8, $19.2 and
    $0.6 for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005,
    respectively. Gross realized losses on our investments were
    $5.8, $0.0 and $0.2 for the



Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)

years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
    Realized gains and losses are reported in other income (expense).

In July 2007, we purchased $12.5 of asset-backed, AAA-rated
    auction rate securities, representing our total investment in
    auction rate securities. These securities are purchased and sold
    through an auction process that allows us to either roll over
    our holdings, whereby we would continue to own our respective
    interest in the auction rate security, or sell our interests at
    par to gain immediate liquidity.

Our auction rate securities have failed to trade at recent
    auctions due to insufficient bids from buyers. Furthermore,
    based on recent market conditions we believe that it is
    uncertain that auctions will be successful and the market will
    recover in the foreseeable future. As such, we have determined
    that there has been an other-than-temporary decline in the fair
    value of these securities and have recognized an impairment
    charge of $5.8 to other income (expense). If future auctions are
    unsuccessful and the market continues to deteriorate, we may be
    required to further adjust the carrying value of these
    securities and realize an additional impairment charge for an
    other-than-temporary decline in fair value.

Long-Term
    Debt

Long-term debt includes variable and fixed rate debt. The fair
    value of our long-term debt instruments is based on market
    prices for debt instruments with similar terms and maturities.

Financial
    Commitments

Financial commitments include other forward contracts relating
    primarily to an obligation to repurchase 49% of the
    minority-owned equity shares of a consolidated subsidiary,
    valued pursuant to SFAS No. 150,

Accounting for
    Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristic of Both
    Liabilities and Equity.

Fair value measurement of the
    obligation was based upon the amount payable as if the forward
    contract was settled as of December 31, 2007 and 2006.
    Changes in the fair value of the obligation have been recorded
    as interest expense or income in the Consolidated Statements of
    Operations.

Note 17:

Leases

We lease office premises and equipment. Where leases contain
    escalation clauses or concessions, such as rent holidays and
    landlord/tenant incentives or allowances, the impact of such
    adjustments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the
    minimum lease period. Certain leases provide for renewal options
    and require the payment of real estate taxes or other occupancy
    costs, which are also subject to escalation clauses. Rent

Guarantees

We have certain contingent obligations under guarantees of
    certain of our subsidiaries (“parent company
    guarantees”) relating principally to credit facilities,
    guarantees of certain media payables and operating leases. The
    amount of such parent company guarantees was $327.1 and $327.9
    as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. In the
    event of non-payment by the applicable subsidiary of the
    obligations covered by a guarantee, we would be obligated to pay
    the amounts covered by that guarantee. As of December 31,
    2007, there are no material assets pledged as security for such
    parent company guarantees.

Contingent
    Acquisition Obligations

We have structured certain acquisitions with additional
    contingent purchase price obligations in order to reduce the
    potential risk associated with negative future performance of
    the acquired entity. In addition, we have entered into
    agreements that may require us to purchase additional equity
    interests in certain consolidated and unconsolidated
    subsidiaries. The amounts relating to these transactions are
    based on estimates of the future financial performance of the
    acquired entity, the timing of the exercise of these rights,
    changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other factors. We
    have not recorded a liability for these items since the
    definitive amounts payable are not determinable or
    distributable. When the contingent acquisition obligations have
    been met and consideration is determinable and distributable, we
    record the fair value of this consideration as an additional
    cost of the acquired entity. However, we recognize deferred
    payments and purchases of additional interests after the
    effective date of purchase that are contingent upon the future
    employment of owners as compensation expense. Compensation
    expense is determined based on the terms and conditions of the
    respective acquisition agreements and employment terms of the
    former owners of the acquired businesses. This future expense
    will not be allocated to the assets and liabilities acquired and
    is amortized over the required employment terms of the former
    owners.

The following table details the estimated liability with respect
    to our contingent acquisition obligations and the estimated
    amount that would be paid under the options, in the event of
    exercise at the earliest exercise date. All payments are
    contingent upon achieving projected operating performance
    targets and satisfying other

conditions specified in the related agreements and are subject
    to revisions as the earn-out periods progress. As of
    December 31, 2007, our estimated future contingent
    acquisition obligations payable in cash are as follows:

We have entered into certain acquisitions that contain both put
    and call options with similar terms and conditions. In such
    instances, we have included the related estimated contingent
    acquisition obligations with put options.

(2)

In addition, we have an obligation for a put option with a
    consolidated affiliate payable in stock at $0.9.

We maintain certain put options with consolidated affiliates
    that are exercisable at the discretion of the minority owners as
    of December 31, 2007. These put options are assumed to be
    exercised in the earliest possible period subsequent to
    December 31, 2007. Therefore, the related estimated
    acquisition payments of $43.5 have been included within the
    total payments expected to be made in 2008 in the table above.
    These payments, if not made in 2008, will continue to
    carry-forward into 2009 or beyond until they are exercised or
    expire.

Legal
    Matters

SEC Investigation —

Since January 2003 the SEC
    has been conducting a formal investigation in response to the
    restatement we first announced in August 2002, and in 2005 the
    investigation expanded to encompass the 2004 Restatement. We
    have also responded to inquiries from the SEC staff (the
    “Staff”) concerning the restatement of the first three
    quarters of 2005 that we made in our 2005 Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

We continue to cooperate with the investigation. We expect that
    the investigation will result in monetary liability, but as
    settlement discussions have not yet commenced, we cannot
    reasonably estimate the amount, range of amounts or timing of a
    resolution. Accordingly, we have not yet established any
    provision relating to these matters.

The Staff has informed us that it intends to seek approval from
    the Commission to enter into settlement discussions with us or,
    failing a settlement, to litigate an action charging the Company
    with various violations of the federal securities laws. In that
    connection, and as previously disclosed by the Company in a
    current report on

Form 8-K

filed June 14, 2007, the Staff sent the Company a
    “Wells notice,” which invited us to make a responsive
    submission before the Staff makes a final determination
    concerning its recommendation to the Commission. We expect to
    discuss settlement with the Staff once the Commission authorizes
    the Staff to engage in such discussions. We cannot at this time
    predict what the Commission will authorize or the outcome of any
    settlement negotiations.

Other Legal Matters —

We are or have been
    involved in other legal and administrative proceedings of
    various types. While any litigation contains an element of
    uncertainty, we do not believe that the outcome of such
    proceedings or claims will have a material adverse effect on our
    financial condition.

Note 18:

Recent
    Accounting Standards

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141
    (revised),

Business Combinations

(“SFAS 141R”), which replaces
    SFAS No. 141,

Business Combinations.

Under the
    standard, an acquiring entity is required to record assets
    acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination at
    fair value on the date of acquisition. Earn-out payments and
    other forms of contingent consideration will also be recorded at
    fair value on the acquisition date. The standard also requires
    fair value measurements to be used when recording
    non-controlling interests and contingent liabilities. In
    addition, the standard requires all costs associated with the
    business combination, including restructuring costs, to be
    expensed as incurred. For the Company, SFAS 141R is
    effective prospectively for business combinations having an
    acquisition date on or after January 1, 2009, with the
    exception of the accounting for valuation allowances on deferred
    taxes and acquired contingencies. SFAS 141R amends
    SFAS 109 such that adjustments made to valuation allowances
    on deferred taxes and acquired tax contingencies associated with
    acquisitions that closed prior to January 1, 2009 would
    also apply the provisions of SFAS 141R. We are currently
    evaluating the potential impact of SFAS 141R on our
    Consolidated Financial Statements.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160,

Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements

(“SFAS 160”)

,

which amends ARB
    No. 51,

Consolidated Financial Statements

. This
    standard requires a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary to
    be reported in equity on the consolidated financial statements
    separate from the parent’s equity. The standard also
    requires transactions that do not impact a parent’s
    controlling ownership and do not result in the deconsolidation
    of the subsidiary to be recorded as equity transactions, while
    those transactions that do result in a change in ownership and a
    deconsolidation of the subsidiary to be recorded in net income
    (loss) with the gain or loss measured at fair value. For the
    Company, SFAS 160 is effective January 1, 2009 and
    should be applied prospectively with the exception of the
    presentation and disclosure requirements which shall be applied
    retrospectively for all periods presented. We are currently
    evaluating the potential impact of SFAS 160 on our
    Consolidated Financial Statements.

In June 2007, the EITF ratified EITF Issue

No. 06-11,

Accounting for Income Tax Benefits of Dividends on
    Share-Based Payment Awards

(“EITF 06-11”).

Under

EITF 06-11

a realized tax benefit from dividends or dividend equivalents
    that are charged to retained earnings and paid to employees for
    equity classified non-vested equity shares, non-vested equity
    share units, and outstanding share options should be recognized
    as an increase to additional

paid-in-capital.

For the Company,

EITF 06-11

is effective, prospectively, as of January 1, 2008. We do
    not expect the adoption of

EITF 06-11

to have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial
    Statements.

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159,

The
    Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities

(“SFAS 159”), which permits an entity to
    measure certain financial assets and financial liabilities at
    fair value. Under SFAS 159, entities that elect the fair
    value option will report unrealized gains and losses in earnings
    at each subsequent reporting date. For the Company,
    SFAS 159 is effective as of January 1, 2008, but we do
    not intend to measure any additional financial instruments at
    fair value as a result of this statement. Therefore, we do not
    expect the adoption of SFAS 159 to have an impact on our
    Consolidated Financial Statements.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157,

Fair Value Measurements

(“SFAS 157”),
    which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring
    fair value in U.S. GAAP, and expands disclosures about fair
    value measurements. Under the standard, fair value refers to the
    price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to
    transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market
    participants in the market in which the reporting entity
    operates. The standard clarifies the principle that fair value
    should be based on the



Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)

assumptions market participants would use when pricing the asset
    or liability. In support of this principle, the standard
    establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the
    information used to develop those assumptions. The fair value
    hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active
    markets and the lowest priority to unobservable data, for
    example, the reporting entity’s own data. Under the
    standard, fair value measurements would be separately disclosed
    by level within the fair value hierarchy. For the Company,
    SFAS 157 is effective as of January 1, 2008. In
    February 2008, the FASB issued Staff Positions

No. 157-1

and

No. 157-2

which partially defer the effective date of SFAS 157 for
    one year for certain nonfinancial assets and liabilities and
    remove certain leasing transactions from its scope. We do not
    expect the adoption of SFAS 157 to have a material impact
    on our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Note 19:

Out-of-Period
    Adjustments

During 2006, we recorded adjustments to certain vendor discounts
    and credits, contractual liabilities, foreign exchange, tax and
    other miscellaneous items which related to prior periods.
    Because these changes are not material to our consolidated
    financial statements for the periods prior to 2006, for the
    quarters of 2006 or for 2006 as a whole, we recorded these
    out-of-period amounts in their respective quarters of 2006.

Description
    of Out-of-Period Adjustments:

Vendor Discounts and Credits

— In connection
    with our 2004 Restatement certain liabilities were recorded that
    were determined at that time to be a contractual obligation to
    clients. The revenue adjustment primarily relates to obtaining
    certain evidence in the fourth quarter of 2006 indicating that
    no actual contractual obligation existed in regard to those
    clients. The loss from continuing operations adjustment also
    includes a concession payment to a certain client.



Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

(Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)

Contractual Liabilities

— As part of our
    remediation efforts for accounting for purchase business
    combinations we mandated a procedure whereby compensatory
    earn-out liabilities should be evaluated quarterly to ensure
    that the amount being accrued is still appropriate. As a result,
    we identified an instance where the earn-out liability was
    overstated and should have been adjusted in prior periods based
    on the future financial performance projections for that
    respective acquired entity.

Foreign Exchange Adjustments

— We recorded
    adjustments related to the cumulative translation adjustment
    balances that remained on our books and records subsequent to
    the sale of certain agencies. In accordance with
    SFAS No. 52,

Foreign Currency Translation

,
    these amounts should have been reported as part of the gain or
    loss on sale or liquidation of the respective agency during the
    period in which that transaction occurred.

Other Adjustments

— Primarily relates to an
    adjustment to one of our cost investments of $3.2 which had been
    inappropriately marked to market.

Tax Adjustments

— Includes the tax effect of
    the adjustments noted above and the correction of certain
    deferred tax assets and liabilities.

Note 20:

    Review of Stock Option Practices

In 2006 we reviewed our practices for stock option grants. Under
    applicable accounting standards prior to January 1, 2006
    (APB No. 25), compensation expense should reflect the
    difference, if any, between an option’s exercise price and
    the market price of the Company’s stock at the measurement
    date, the point at which the terms and the recipients of the
    option grant are determined with finality. In some instances, we
    incorrectly determined the measurement date for accounting
    purposes to be the date as of which the exercise price was set
    rather than the date the grants were finalized. As a result,
    compensation expense in the pretax amount of $40.6 should have
    been recorded over the years 1996 through 2003.

In accordance with SAB No. 108, the materiality of
    these newly-identified errors was assessed against prior periods
    using the Company’s pre-SAB No. 108 policy
    (“iron-curtain” method) for quantifying materiality.
    After considering all of the quantitative and qualitative
    factors, these errors were not considered to be material to
    prior periods. Given that the effect of correcting these errors
    during 2006 would have caused our 2006 financial statements to
    be materially misstated, the Company concluded that the
    cumulative effect adjustment method of initially applying the
    guidance in SAB No. 108 was appropriate. The impact of
    the cumulative effect adjustment was a $26.4 charge to
    accumulated deficit, a $23.3 credit to additional paid-in
    capital and a $3.1 credit to other non-current liabilities to
    reflect certain taxes payable effective January 1, 2006.

As discussed in Note 19, during 2006 we recorded
    adjustments to certain vendor discounts and credits, contractual
    liabilities, foreign exchange, tax and other miscellaneous items
    which related to prior periods. For the fourth quarter of 2006,
    these adjustments resulted in a net favorable impact to revenue
    of $8.3, net favorable impact to salaries and related expenses
    of $4.2, net unfavorable impact to office and general expenses
    of $2.8 and a net favorable impact to net income of $11.9.



Item 9.

Changes
    in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and
    Financial Disclosure

Not applicable.

Item 9A.

Controls
    and Procedures

Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial
    Reporting located in Item 8 is incorporated by reference
    herein.

Evaluation
    of disclosure controls and procedures

In connection with the preparation of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

for the year ended December 31, 2007 we have carried out an
    evaluation under the supervision of, and with the participation
    of, our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and
    Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and
    operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such
    term is defined in

Rules 13a-15(e)

and

15d-15(e)

under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
    “Exchange Act”)). Based on this evaluation, our Chief
    Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded
    (1) that the disclosure controls and procedures were
    effective as of December 31, 2007 to provide reasonable
    assurance that information required to be disclosed in reports
    that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded,
    processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
    specified in SEC rules and forms and (2) that the
    disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of
    December 31, 2007 to provide reasonable assurance that
    information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file
    or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated
    to our management, including the principal executive officer and
    principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely
    decisions regarding required disclosure.

There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any
    system of disclosure controls and procedures, including the
    possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding
    of the controls and procedures. Accordingly, even effective
    disclosure controls and procedures can only provide reasonable
    assurance of achieving their control objectives.

Remediation
    of Previously Disclosed Material Weaknesses

As previously disclosed in our Annual Report on

Form 10-K

for the year ended December 31, 2006, we identified
    material weaknesses in our internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2006. A material weakness is a
    deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control
    over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable
    possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or
    interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected
    on a timely basis. The seven material weaknesses we reported as
    of December 31, 2006 are summarized as follows:

1.

Control Environment

— The Company did not
    maintain an effective control environment. Specifically, the
    Company did not maintain a sufficient complement of personnel
    throughout its worldwide offices with an appropriate level of
    accounting knowledge, experience and training in the application
    of GAAP commensurate with the Company’s financial reporting
    requirements. In addition, the Company did not maintain
    effective controls over the monitoring of its existing internal
    control activities over financial reporting and, instead, placed
    heavy reliance on manual procedures without sufficient review.

2.

Revenue Recognition

— The Company did not
    maintain effective controls over the accuracy, presentation and
    disclosure in recording revenue.

3.

Financial Statement Transactions and Journal Entries

— The Company did not maintain effective controls
    to ensure that certain financial statement transactions and
    journal entries, both recurring and non-recurring, were
    appropriately initiated, authorized, processed, documented,
    accurately recorded and reviewed.

4.

Income Taxes

— The Company did not maintain
    effective controls over (1) the accounting for income taxes
    to ensure amounts were accurately recorded in accordance with
    GAAP and (2) the reporting of income tax in the statutory
    accounts or income tax returns for operations outside of the U.S.



5.

Payroll and Compensation-Related Liabilities

— The Company did not maintain effective controls
    relating to the completeness and accuracy of local payroll and
    compensation-related liabilities in certain operations.

6.

Safeguarding of Assets

— The Company did not
    maintain effective controls over the safeguarding of assets.
    Controls were not designed and in place to segregate
    responsibility and authority between initiating, processing and
    recording transactions.

7.

Financial Applications and Data

— The Company
    did not maintain effective controls over access and changes to
    the Company’s financial applications and data, and controls
    over spreadsheets used in the Company’s financial reporting
    process.

We made improvements in our internal control over financial
    reporting throughout 2006 and 2007, and in the fourth quarter of
    2007 management concluded that the improved controls had been
    operating for a sufficient period of time to allow the
    effectiveness of the remediation measures to be validated. After
    reviewing the results of its testing in the fourth quarter of
    2007, management concluded that controls related to the
    remediation of the material weaknesses previously disclosed in
    the 2006 Annual Report on

Form 10-K

were designed, in place and operating effectively for a
    sufficient period of time for management to determine that each
    of the material weaknesses was remediated as of
    December 31, 2007. The key changes in internal control and
    remedial actions taken related to these previously reported
    material weaknesses are discussed below.

1. Control Environment

•

Assessed and trained the accounting and finance personnel
    Company-wide and where appropriate either replaced personnel or
    hired additional, more competent resources.

•

Formalized reporting relationships of all financial personnel
    Company-wide with accounting and control-related
    responsibilities to the Corporate Controller.

•

Standardized and formalized a set of worldwide key controls and
    processes that comprise the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting, including how each control is executed,
    evidenced, monitored and tested.

•

Created new standard global documentation and testing
    requirements of internal controls over financial reporting to
    ensure consistency in the overall evaluation of the design and
    operating effectiveness of internal controls within our
    operating units.

•

Held regularly scheduled meetings with management of our
    financial and operating units to ensure their understanding of
    the required procedures prior to executing internal management
    certification letters to accompany the financial statements they
    submit.

•

Ensured all employees with responsibility for the Company’s
    financial reporting, as well as other key personnel across the
    Company, completed a Code of Conduct course by the end of the
    fourth quarter of 2007 detailing the standards of conduct that
    are expected of all our employees in their day-to-day activities
    and in their relationships with our business partners and
    confirmed the employees’ understanding and commitment to
    adhere to these standards via a Company-wide certification
    process.

•

Created financial teams organized by region, reporting directly
    to the Corporate Controller, through which financial data and
    the corresponding control infrastructure at each entity is
    monitored and reviewed regularly. These teams execute formalized
    agency review programs and provide accounting advice and
    oversight of control-related procedures directly to agency
    financial personnel.

•

Reviewed, updated and communicated enhanced policies and
    procedures in several areas.



2. Revenue Recognition

•

Reviewed, updated and communicated an enhanced revenue
    recognition policy, which more clearly identifies the factors
    most relevant in determining the appropriate revenue recognition
    method to be used.

•

Implemented a global web-based revenue recognition platform that:

o

Documents the existence of persuasive evidence of the
    arrangement, whether the price is fixed or determinable and how
    collectibility is determined.

o

Documents the responses to a formalized series of questions
    focused on the significant terms and conditions of the contract
    to guide the determination of the appropriate revenue
    recognition method and timing on a consistent worldwide basis.

o

Requires varying levels of contract review and approval based on
    the contract value.

o

Facilitates the reconciliation between the revenue calculated
    using the data within the revenue recognition platform and the
    revenue recognized as reflected in the general ledger.

•

Established a central electronic repository for all
    documentation supporting significant client arrangements.

•

Developed and provided an intensive worldwide training program
    on revenue recognition principles and the use of the revenue
    recognition platform.

3. Financial Statement Transactions and Journal
    Entries

•

Continued the development and implementation of a shared
    services model to further consolidate various financial
    functions to attain efficiencies and to improve controls
    surrounding these activities.

•

Implemented a new global consolidation
    system.

This system allows for improved financial
    reporting across the Company and provides enhanced control
    features related to the accumulation and reporting of financial
    data submitted by the Company’s operating units, as well as
    required approvals and system security.

•

In the fourth quarter of 2007, implemented improved policies and
    procedures combined with a comprehensive training program
    emphasizing the importance of transaction-related controls.

•

Increased focus on monitoring and detective controls,
    particularly with the creation of the regional finance teams.

•

Established procedures, reporting and appropriate monitoring to
    identify, evaluate and properly address potential issues around
    segregation of incompatible financial duties.

4. Income Taxes

•

Implemented revised periodic reporting for tax accounts, updated
    and enhanced related policies and procedures and increased tax
    training at regional and local levels.

•

Hired additional personnel to ensure that tax reporting
    information is being provided timely and accurately.

•

Centralized and implemented many income tax internal controls at
    the Corporate level and, in the fourth quarter of 2007, executed
    those controls for the first time.

•

Engaged outside professional tax advisors to review the local
    income tax returns of

non-U.S. subsidiaries

prior to filing to ensure that the tax returns are filed on a
    timely basis and are prepared in accordance with local law and
    regulations.

•

Implemented a global tax compliance tool to track

non-U.S. tax

return compliance.



5. Payroll and Compensation-Related Liabilities

•

Formed a corporate compensation committee and process whereby
    written approval is required for any non-traditional employment
    arrangement or compensation practice. This committee consists of
    senior representatives of the accounting, human resources,
    legal, tax and treasury departments. Determinations are made for
    all such arrangements with due consideration of local law and
    practice as well as Company policies and procedures.

6. Safeguarding of Assets

•

In the fourth quarter of 2007, established a standard set of
    requirements and implemented a standard process across the
    Company to identify, evaluate and address potential issues
    around segregation of incompatible financial duties.

•

The regional financial teams conduct regular site reviews, of
    which a component is devoted to assessing appropriate
    segregation of duties. The frequency of the site reviews is
    based on, among other things, the sufficiency of each
    site’s segregation of duties.

•

Established controls to deter and detect fraud with significant
    oversight and input by our Board of Directors and Audit
    Committee, including, but not limited to, ensuring proper

follow-up

and resolution of whistleblowers’ assertions. We have
    communicated to all our locations that an anonymous alert line
    is in place for use by employees who do not feel comfortable
    communicating with local management.

•

Provided training on business ethics and whistleblowing to
    ensure that employees apply proper protocol as defined by our
    policies.

•

Increased focus on monitoring and detective controls,
    particularly with the creation of the regional finance teams.

7. Financial Applications and Data

•

Developed and implemented standard information security policies
    and procedures across the Company to support appropriate user
    access controls over financial systems.

•

Improved awareness of the importance of information security and
    communication across the Company, including training information
    technology groups and members of the financial organization to
    ensure the effectiveness of user access controls over financial
    systems.

•

Developed and implemented standard system development and
    program change controls to ensure that changes to significant
    financial systems are properly requested, authorized and tested
    prior to implementing the changes in the live production
    environment.

•

Implemented a standard policy and procedures to ensure the
    effectiveness of controls over key spreadsheets utilized in the
    Company’s financial reporting process.

Changes
    in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

There were changes in our internal control over financial
    reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2007 that
    have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
    affect, our internal control over financial reporting as follows:

•

Centralized and implemented income tax internal controls at the
    Corporate level.

•

Established a standard set of requirements and implemented a
    standard process across the Company to identify, evaluate and
    address potential issues around segregation of incompatible
    financial duties.

•

Implemented improved policies and procedures combined with a
    comprehensive training program emphasizing the importance of
    transaction-related controls.

•

Enhanced certain aspects of the controls around proportional
    performance revenue arrangements.
