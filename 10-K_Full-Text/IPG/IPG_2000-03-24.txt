                                     PART I

Item 1.    Business
           --------

         The Interpublic  Group of Companies,  Inc. was incorporated in Delaware
in  September  1930  under  the  name  of  McCann-Erickson  Incorporated  as the
successor to the advertising  agency businesses founded in 1902 by A.W. Erickson
and in 1911 by Harrison K. McCann.  It has operated under the  Interpublic  name
since  January  1961.  As  used in  this  Annual  Report,  the  "Registrant"  or
"Interpublic"  refers to The  Interpublic  Group of  Companies,  Inc.  while the
"Company" refers to Interpublic and its subsidiaries.

         The advertising agency business is the primary business of the Company.
This  business  is  conducted   throughout  the  world  primarily   through  two
advertising agency systems,  McCann-Erickson WorldGroup and The Lowe Group, plus
a  number  of  standalone  local  agencies.   Interpublic  also  carries  on  an
independent  media buying  business  through its ownership of  Initiative  Media
Worldwide  and  its  affiliates,  as well as a  separate  relationship  (direct)
marketing  business  through its  ownership of  DraftWorldwide,  a global public
relations  capability through  International  Public Relations,  an internet and
business consultancy through its Zentropy Partners,  and a multi-national sports
and event marketing  organization,  Octagon. The Company also offers advertising
agency services through association  arrangements with local agencies in various
parts of the world. Other activities conducted by the Company within the area of
"marketing communications" include brand equity and corporate identity services,
management consulting,  healthcare marketing,  market research, sales promotion,
internet  services,  sales meetings and events,  multicultural  advertising  and
promotion, and other related specialized marketing and communications services.

         The principal functions of an advertising agency are to plan and create
advertising  programs for its clients and to place  advertising in various media
such as television,  cinema, radio, magazines,  newspapers, direct mail, outdoor
and interactive electronic media. The planning function involves analysis of the
market for the particular product or service,  evaluation of alternative methods
of distribution and choice of the appropriate  media to reach the desired market
most efficiently.  The advertising agency develops a communications strategy and
then creates an advertising  program,  within the limits imposed by the client's
advertising budget, and places orders for space or time with the media that have
been selected.

         The principal  advertising agency subsidiaries of Interpublic operating
within the United States directly or through  subsidiaries  and the locations of
their respective corporate headquarters are:

Campbell-Ewald Company............      Detroit (Warren), Michigan

Campbell Mithun Esty LLC..........      Minneapolis, Minnesota

Dailey & Associates, Inc..........      Los Angeles, California

DraftWorldwide, Inc...............      Chicago, Illinois

         In addition to domestic  operations,  the Company provides services for
clients whose  business is  international  in scope as well as for clients whose
business is  restricted to a single  country or a small number of countries.  It
has offices in Canada as well as in one or more cities in each of the  following

         For  information   concerning  revenues  and  long-lived  assets  on  a
geographical  basis for each of the last three years,  reference is made to Note
12:  Geographic Areas of the Notes to the Consolidated  Financial  Statements in
the Company's  Annual  Report to  Stockholders  for the year ended  December 31,
1999, which Note is hereby incorporated by reference.

Developments in 1999
- --------------------

         The Company completed a number of acquisitions within the United States
and abroad in 1999.

         See Note 4 to the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  incorporated by
reference in this Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of acquisitions.

Income from Commissions and Fees
- --------------------------------

         The  Company  generates  income  from  planning,  creating  and placing
advertising   in  various   media  and  from   planning  and   executing   other
communications or marketing programs.  Historically, the commission customary in
the industry was 15% of the gross charge  ("billings") for advertising  space or
time;  more recently  lower  commissions  have been  negotiated,  but often with
additional  incentives  for  better  performance.   For  example,  an  incentive
component  is  frequently   included  in  arrangements  with  clients  based  on
improvements  in an  advertised  brand's  awareness or image,  or increases in a
client's  sales or market  share of the products or services  being  advertised.
Under commission arrangements,  media bill the Company at their gross rates. The
Company bills these amounts to its clients,  remits the net charges to the media
and retains the balance as its  commission.  Some  clients,  however,  prefer to
compensate the Company on a fee basis,  under which the Company bills its client
for the net  charges  billed by the media plus an  agreed-upon  fee.  These fees
usually are calculated to reflect the Company's  salary costs and  out-of-pocket
expenses  incurred on the  client's  behalf,  plus  proportional  overhead and a
profit mark-up.

         Normally,  the Company,  like other agencies,  is primarily responsible
for paying the media with  respect to firm  contracts  for  advertising  time or
space. This is a problem only if the client is unable to pay the Company because
of insolvency  or  bankruptcy.  The Company makes serious  efforts to reduce the
risk from a client's  insolvency,  including (1) carrying out credit clearances,
(2)  requiring in some cases  payment of media in advance,  or (3) agreeing with
the media that the Company will be solely liable to pay the media only after the
client has paid the Company for the media charges.

         The Company  also  receives  commissions  from clients for planning and
supervising  work done by outside  contractors  in the physical  preparation  of
finished  print  advertisements  and the  production  of  television  and  radio
commercials  and other forms of  advertising.  This  commission  is  customarily
17.65% of the outside  contractor's net charge,  which is the same as 15% of the
outside contractor's total charges including  commission.  With the expansion of
negotiated fees, the terms on which outstanding  contractors' charges are billed
are  subject  to  wide  variations  and  even  include  in  some  instances  the
elimination of commissions  entirely provided that there are adequate negotiated
fees.

         The  Company  also  derives  income in many other ways,  including  the
planning and placement in media of advertising produced by unrelated advertising
agencies;  the  maintenance  of  specialized  media  placement  facilities;  the
creation and publication of brochures,  billboards,  point of sale materials and
direct  marketing  pieces  for  clients;   the  planning  and  carrying  out  of
specialized   marketing  research;   developments/public   relations  campaigns,
managing special events at which clients'  products are featured;  and designing
and carrying out interactive programs for special uses.

         The five clients of the Company that made the largest  contribution  in
1999 to income from commissions and fees accounted individually for 1.8% to 8.0%
of such income and in the aggregate accounted for over approximately 18% of such
income.  Twenty clients of the Company  accounted for  approximately 28% of such
income.  Based on income from commissions and fees, the three largest clients of
the Company are General Motors Corporation,  Nestle and Unilever. General Motors
Corporation  first became a client of one of the  Company's  agencies in 1916 in
the United States.  Predecessors of several of the Lintas agencies have supplied
advertising services to Unilever since 1893. The client relationship with Nestle
began in 1940 in Argentina.  While the loss of the entire business of one of the
Company's  three largest  clients might have a material  adverse effect upon the
business of the Company,  the Company believes that it is very unlikely that the
entire business of any of these clients would be lost at the same time,  because
it represents  several different brands or divisions of each of these clients in
a number of  geographical  markets - in each case  through  more than one of the
Company's agency systems.

         Representation  of a  client  rarely  means  that the  Company  handles
advertising  for all brands or product  lines of the client in all  geographical
locations.  Any client may  transfer  its business  from an  advertising  agency
within  the  Company  to a  competing  agency,  and  a  client  may  reduce  its
advertising budget at any time.

         The Company's  agencies in many instances  have written  contracts with
their  clients.  As is customary in the industry,  these  contracts  provide for
termination  by either party on  relatively  short  notice,  usually 90 days but
sometimes  shorter or longer. In 1999,  however,  23% of income from commissions
and fees was derived from clients that had been  associated  with one or more of
the Company's agencies or their predecessors for 20 or more years.

Personnel
- ---------

         As of  January 1,  2000,  the  Company  employed  approximately  38,600
persons,  of whom nearly 16,200 were employed in the United  States.  Because of
the personal service  character of the marketing  communications  business,  the
quality of personnel is of crucial  importance to continuing  success.  There is
keen  competition for qualified  employees.  Interpublic  considers its employee
relations to be satisfactory.

         The Company has an active program for training  personnel.  The program
includes  meetings and seminars  throughout the world. It also involves training
personnel in its offices in New York and in its larger offices worldwide.

Competition and Other Factors
- -----------------------------

         The advertising  agency and other marketing  communications  businesses
are highly  competitive.  The Company's agencies and media services must compete
with other agencies and with other providers of creative or media services which
are not themselves  advertising  agencies,  in order to maintain existing client
relationships and to obtain new clients.  Competition in the advertising  agency
business depends to a large extent on the client's  perception of the quality of
an  agency's  "creative   product".   An  agency's  ability  to  serve  clients,
particularly large international clients, on a broad geographic basis is also an
important  competitive  consideration.  On the other  hand,  because an agency's
principal  asset is its  people,  freedom of entry into the  business  is almost
unlimited and quite small  agencies  are, on occasion,  able to take all or some
portion of a client's account from a much larger competitor.

         Moreover,  increasing  size  bring  some  limitations  to  an  agency's
potential  for securing  new  business,  because  many clients  prefer not to be
represented by an agency that represents a competitor.  Also, clients frequently
wish to have different products represented by different agencies. The fact that
the Company owns two separate  worldwide  agency  systems and interests in other
advertising agencies gives it additional competitive opportunities.

         The advertising and marketing  communications  businesses is subject to
government  regulation,  both domestic and foreign. There has been an increasing
tendency  in the  United  States  on the part of  advertisers  to  resort to the
courts, industry and self-regulatory bodies to challenge comparative advertising
on the grounds that the  advertising is false and deceptive.  Through the years,
there has been a continuing  expansion of specific  rules,  prohibitions,  media
restrictions,  labeling disclosures and warning requirements with respect to the
advertising for certain products.  Representatives  within state governments and
the  federal  government  as well as foreign  governments  continue  to initiate
proposals to ban the advertising of specific  products and to impose taxes on or
deny deductions for advertising which, if successful, may have an adverse effect
on advertising expenditures.

         Some countries are relaxing  commercial  restrictions  as part of their
efforts to attract foreign investment.  However,  with respect to other nations,
the  international  operations  of the Company  still remain  exposed to certain
risks which affect foreign  operations of all kinds, such as local  legislation,
monetary  devaluation,  exchange  control  restrictions  and unstable  political
conditions. In addition, international advertising agencies are still subject to
ownership  restrictions  in certain  countries  because they are  considered  an
integral factor in the communications process.


Statement Regarding Forward Looking Disclosure
- ----------------------------------------------

         Certain sections of this report, including "Business", "Competition and
Other Factors" and "Management's  Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations" contain forward looking statements  concerning future
events and developments  that involve risks and  uncertainties,  including those
associated  with the effect of national and regional  economic  conditions,  the
ability of the Company to attract new clients and retain existing  clients,  the
financial  success of clients of the Company,  other  developments of clients of
the  Company,  and  developments  from  changes  in  the  regulatory  and  legal
environment for advertising agencies around the world.

Item 2.    Properties
           ----------

         Most of the operations of the Company are conducted in leased premises,
and  its  physical  property  consists  primarily  of  leasehold   improvements,
furniture,  fixtures  and  equipment.  These  facilities  are located in various
cities in which  the  Company  does  business  throughout  the  world.  However,
subsidiaries of the Company own office buildings in Louisville, Kentucky; Blair,
Nebraska; Warren, Michigan;  Frankfurt,  Germany; Sao Paulo, Brazil; Lima, Peru;
Mexico City,  Mexico;  Santiago,  Chile;  and  Brussels,  Belgium and own office
condominiums  in  Buenos  Aires,  Argentina;   Bogota,  Colombia;   Manila,  the
Philippines;  in England,  subsidiaries  of the Company own office  buildings in
London, Manchester, Birmingham and Stoke-on-Trent.

         The Company's  ownership of the office building in Frankfurt is subject
to three  mortgages  which became  effective on or about  February  1993.  These
mortgages  terminate  at  different  dates,  with the last to expire in February
2003.  Reference  is  made to Note  10:  Long-Term  Debt,  of the  Notes  to the
