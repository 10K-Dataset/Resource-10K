ITEM 1.  BUSINESS

                                  ORGANIZATION

Registrant was organized in 1974 under the laws of the State of Ohio.  It began
operations in 1975 upon reorganization of its principal subsidiary, The Fifth
Third Bank.  The executive offices of the Registrant are located in Cincinnati,
Ohio.  The Registrant is a multi-bank holding company as defined in the Bank
Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, and is registered as such with the
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  The Registrant is also a
multi-savings-and-loan holding company and is registered with the Office of
Thrift Supervision.  Registrant has sixteen wholly-owned subsidiaries:  Fifth
Third Kentucky Bank Holding Company; The Fifth Third Bank; The Fifth Third Bank
of Columbus Ohio; The Fifth Third Bank of Northwestern Ohio, N.A.; The Fifth
Third Bank of Southern Ohio; The Fifth Third Bank of Western Ohio; Fifth Third
Bank of Northeastern Ohio; Fifth Third Savings Bank of Northern Ohio, FSB; Fifth
Third Bank of Florida; Fifth Third Bank of Northern Kentucky, Inc.; Fifth Third
Bank of Kentucky, Inc.; The Fifth Third Savings Bank of Western Kentucky, FSB;
Fifth Third Community Development Company; Fifth Third Investment Company; and
Fountain Square Insurance Company.  Unless the context otherwise indicates the
term "Company" as used herein means the Registrant and the term "Bank" means its
wholly-owned subsidiary, The Fifth Third Bank.

As of December 31, 1995, the Company's consolidated total assets were
$17,052,883,000 and stockholders' equity totalled $1,724,575,000.

The Bank has four wholly-owned subsidiaries: Midwest Payment Systems, Inc.;
Fifth Third Securities, Inc.; The Fifth Third Company; and The Fifth Third
Leasing Company.


                               ACQUISITIONS

The Company is the result of mergers and acquisitions over the years involving
financial institutions throughout Ohio, Indiana, Kentucky, and Florida.  The
Company made the following acquisitions during 1995:

On January 20, 1995, the Company acquired Mutual Federal Savings Bank of
Miamisburg (Ohio), A Federal Savings Bank, with total assets of approximately
$78 million, in a transaction accounted for as a pooling of interests. 

On June 23, 1995, the Company purchased approximately $16 million in deposits
and the fixed assets of the Lebanon, Ohio branch of Bank One.

On July 21, 1995, the Company acquired Falls Financial, Inc., with consolidated
assets of approximately $573 million, and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Falls
Savings Bank, FSB ("Falls FSB") in a transaction accounted for as a pooling of
interests. 









                                    Page  3

On September 8, 1995, the Company acquired Bank of Naples (Florida), with total
assets of approximately $49 million, in a transaction accounted for as a pooling
of interests.  Concurrent with this transaction, Fifth Third Trust Co. & Savings
Bank, FSB retained the bank charter of Bank of Naples and was renamed Fifth
Third Bank of Florida.

On September 22, 1995, the Company purchased the Dayton Division of PNC Bank
(Ohio).  The offices, with approximately $256 million in deposits and $215
million in assets, were merged into the Bank's branch network.

On November 17, 1995, the Company purchased approximately $118 million in
deposits and the fixed assets of several offices of Bank One, Cincinnati.

In August of 1995, the Company entered into a merger agreement with Kentucky
Enterprise Bancorp, Inc., with $280 million in assets.  In October of 1995 the
Company entered into an agreement with NBD Bank (Ohio), a subsidiary of NBD
Bancorp, Inc. to acquire 25 offices with deposits of $542 million in Columbus
and Dayton.  These transactions are expected to be completed in the first
quarter of 1996.

On January 19, 1996, the Company purchased approximately $1.4 billion in
deposits and the fixed assets of 28 Cleveland-area offices from 1st Nationwide
Bank.  The acquisition price of the deposits, offices and other fixed assets was
approximately $136 million.

                                  COMPETITION

There are hundreds of commercial banks, savings and loans and other financial
services providers in Ohio, Kentucky, Indiana, Florida and nationally, which
provide strong competition to the Company's banking subsidiaries.  As providers
of a full range of financial services, these subsidiaries compete with national
and state banks, savings and loan associations, securities dealers, brokers,
mortgage bankers, finance and insurance companies, and other financial service
companies.  With respect to data processing services, the Bank's data processing
subsidiary, Midwest Payment Systems, Inc., competes with other electronic fund
transfer (EFT) service providers such as Deluxe Data Services, EDS and
Electronic Payment Systems and other merchant processing providers such as FDR,
NPC and FIRST USA.

The earnings of the Company are affected by general economic conditions as well
as by the monetary policies of the Federal Reserve Board.  Such policies, which
include regulating the national supply of bank reserves and bank credit, can
have a major effect upon the source and cost of funds and the rates of return
earned on loans and investments.  The Federal Reserve influences the size and
distribution of bank reserves through its open market operations and changes in
cash reserve requirements against member bank deposits.

                          REGULATION AND SUPERVISION

The Company, as a bank holding company, is subject to the restrictions of the
Bank Holding Company act of 1956, as amended.  This Act provides that the
acquisition of control of a bank is subject to the prior approval of the Board
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  The Company is required to obtain
the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board before it can acquire control
of more than 5% of the voting shares of another bank.  The Act does not permit
the Federal Reserve Board to approve an acquisition by the Company, or any of
its subsidiaries, of any bank located in a state other than Ohio, unless the
acquisition is specifically authorized by the law of the state in which such
bank is located.
                             Page  4

On September 29, 1994, the Act was amended by The Interstate Banking and Branch
Efficiency Act of 1994 which authorizes interstate bank acquisitions anywhere
in the country effective one year after the date of enactment, and interstate
branching by acquisition and consolidation effective June 1, 1997, in those
states that have not opted out by that date.  The impact of this amendment on
the Company cannot be measured at this time.

The Company's subsidiary state banks are primarily subject to the laws of the
state in which each is located, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve
System and/or the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.  The subsidiary bank
which is organized under the laws of the United States is primarily subject to
regulation by the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation.  The Company, as a savings and loan holding company, and its
savings and loan subsidiaries are subject to regulation by the Office of Thrift
Supervision.

The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to certain restrictions on
intercompany loans and investments.  The Company and its subsidiaries are also
subject to certain restrictions with respect to engaging in the underwriting and
public sale and distribution of securities.  In addition, the Company and its
subsidiaries are subject to examination at the discretion of supervisory
authorities.

The Bank Holding Company Act limits the activities which may be engaged in by
the Company and its subsidiaries to ownership of banks and those activities
which the Federal Reserve Board has deemed or may in the future find to be so
closely related to banking as to be a proper incident thereto.

The Financial Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA) provides
that a holding company's controlled insured depository institutions are liable
for any loss incurred by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation in connection
with the default of, or any FDIC-assisted transaction involving, an affiliated
insured bank or savings association.

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (the "FDIC
Improvement Act") covers a wide expanse of banking regulatory issues.  The FDIC
Improvement Act deals with the recapitalization of the Bank Insurance Fund, with
deposit insurance reform, including requiring the FDIC to establish a risk-based
premium assessment system, and with a number of other regulatory and supervisory
matters.  

                               EMPLOYEES

As of December 31, 1995, there were no employees of the Company.  Subsidiaries
of the Company employed 6,432 employees--1,042 were officers and 1,270 were
part-time employees.

                           SECURITIES PORTFOLIO

The securities portfolio as of December 31 for each of the last five years, and
the maturity distribution and weighted average yield of securities as of
December 31, 1995, are incorporated herein by reference to the securities tables
on page 32 of the Company's 1995 Annual Report to Stockholders attached to this
filing as Exhibit 13.

The weighted average yields for the securities portfolio are yields to maturity
weighted by the par values of the securities.  The weighted average yields on
securities exempt from income taxes are computed on a taxable equivalent basis. 
The taxable equivalent yields are net after-tax yields to maturity divided by
the complement of the full corporate tax rate (35%).  In order to express yields
on a taxable equivalent basis, yields on obligations of states and political
subdivisions (municipal securities) have been increased as follows:

          Under 1 year                       2.48%
          1 - 5 years                        2.56%
          6 - 10 years                       2.63%
          Over 10 years                      2.95%
          Total municipal securities         2.56%


                             AVERAGE BALANCE SHEETS

The average balance sheets are incorporated herein by reference to Table 1 on
pages 28 and 29 of the Company's 1995 Annual Report to Stockholders attached to
this filing as Exhibit 13.


           ANALYSIS OF NET INTEREST INCOME AND NET INTEREST INCOME CHANGES

changes are incorporated herein by reference to Table 1 and Table 2 and the
related discussion on pages 28 through 30 of the Company's 1995 Annual Report
to Stockholders attached to this filing as Exhibit 13.

Reserve for Credit Losses
- -------------------------

The reserve for credit losses is established through charges to
operations by a provision for credit losses.  Loans and leases which
are determined to be uncollectible are charged against the reserve and
any subsequent recoveries are credited to the reserve.  The amount
charged to operations is based on several factors.  These include the
following:

    1.  Analytical reviews of the credit loss experience in relationship to
    outstanding loans and leases to determine an adequate reserve for
    credit losses required for loans and leases at risk.
    2.  A continuing review of problem or at risk loans and leases and the
    overall portfolio quality.
    3.  Regular examinations and appraisals of the loan and lease portfolio
    conducted by the Bank's examination staff and the banking supervisory
    authorities.
    4. Management's judgement with respect to the current and expected
    economic conditions and their impact on the existing loan and lease
    portfolio.

The amount provided for credit losses exceeded actual net charge-offs by
$13,101,000 in 1995, $18,306,000 in 1994 and $20,963,000 in 1993.

Management reviews the reserve on a quarterly basis to determine whether
additional provisions should be made after considering the factors noted
above.  Based on these procedures, management is of the opinion that the
reserve at December 31, 1995 of $177,388,000 is adequate.
