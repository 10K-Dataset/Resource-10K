FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

This report contains statements that we believe are “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Rule 175 promulgated thereunder, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Rule 3b-6 promulgated thereunder. These statements relate to our financial condition, results of
operations, plans, objectives, future performance or business. They usually can be identified by the use of forward-looking language such as “will likely result,” “may,” “are expected to,” “is anticipated,”
“potential,” “estimate,” “forecast,” “projected,” “intends to,” or may include other similar words or phrases such as “believes,” “plans,” “trend,”
“objective,” “continue,” “remain,” or similar expressions, or future or conditional verbs such as “will,” “would,” “should,” “could,” “might,” “can,” or
similar verbs. You should not place undue reliance on these statements, as they are subject to risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to the risk factors set forth in the Risk Factors section in Item 1A in this Annual Report on Form
10-K. When considering these forward-looking statements, you should keep in mind these risks and uncertainties, as well as any cautionary statements we may make. Moreover, you should treat these statements as speaking only as of the date they are
made and based only on information then actually known to us. There are a number of important factors that could cause future results to differ materially from historical performance and these forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause
such a difference include, but are not limited to: (1) general economic or real estate market conditions, either nationally or in the states in which Fifth Third, one or more acquired entities and/or the combined company do business, weaken or
are less favorable than expected; (2) deteriorating credit quality; (3) political developments, wars or other hostilities may disrupt or increase volatility in securities markets or other economic conditions; (4) changes in the
interest rate environment reduce interest margins; (5) prepayment speeds, loan origination and sale volumes, charge-offs and loan loss provisions; (6) Fifth Third’s ability to maintain required capital levels and adequate sources of
funding and liquidity; (7) maintaining capital requirements and adequate sources of funding and liquidity may limit Fifth Third’s operations and potential growth; (8) changes and trends in capital markets; (9) problems
encountered by larger or similar financial institutions may adversely affect the banking industry and/or Fifth Third; (10) competitive pressures among depository institutions increase significantly; (11) changes in customer preferences or
information technology systems; (12) effects of critical accounting policies and judgments; (13) changes in accounting policies or procedures as may be required by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) or other regulatory
agencies; (14) legislative or regulatory changes or actions, or significant litigation, adversely affect Fifth Third, one or more acquired entities and/or the combined company or the businesses in which Fifth Third, one or more acquired
entities and/or the combined company are engaged, including the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act; (15) ability to maintain favorable ratings from rating agencies; (16) failure of models or risk management systems
or controls; (17) fluctuation of Fifth Third’s stock price; (18) ability to attract and retain key personnel; (19) ability to receive dividends from its subsidiaries; (20) potentially dilutive effect of future acquisitions
on current shareholders’ ownership of Fifth Third; (21) declines in the value of Fifth Third’s goodwill or other intangible assets; (22) effects of accounting or financial results of one or more acquired entities;
(23) difficulties from Fifth Third’s investment in, relationship with, and nature of the operations of Vantiv Holding, LLC; (24) loss of income from any sale or potential sale of businesses (25) difficulties in separating the
operations of any branches or other assets divested; (26) losses or adverse impacts on the carrying values of branches and long-lived assets in connection with their sales or anticipated sales; (27) inability to achieve expected benefits
from branch consolidations and planned sales within desired timeframes, if at all; (28) ability to secure confidential information and deliver products and services through the use of computer systems and telecommunications networks; and
(29) the impact of reputational risk created by these developments on such matters as business generation and retention, funding and liquidity.

31  Fifth
Third Bancorp


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

OVERVIEW

This overview of MD&A highlights selected information in the financial results of the
Bancorp and may not contain all of the information that is important to you. For a more complete understanding of trends, events, commitments, uncertainties, liquidity, capital resources and critical accounting policies and estimates, you should
carefully read this entire document. Each of these items could have an impact on the Bancorp’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, refer to the Glossary of Abbreviations and Acronyms in this report for a list
of terms included as a tool for the reader of this annual report on Form 10-K. The abbreviations and acronyms identified therein are used throughout this MD&A, as well as the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements.

Net interest income, net interest margin and the efficiency ratio are presented in MD&A on an FTE
basis. The FTE basis adjusts for the tax-favored status of income from certain loans and securities held by the Bancorp that are not taxable for federal income tax purposes. The Bancorp believes this presentation to be the preferred industry
measurement of net interest income as it provides a relevant comparison between taxable and non-taxable amounts. The FTE basis for presenting net interest income is a non-GAAP measure. For further information, refer to the Non-GAAP Financial
Measures section of MD&A.

The Bancorp’s revenues are dependent on both net interest income and noninterest
income. For the year ended December 31, 2016, net interest income on an FTE basis and noninterest income provided 57% and 43% of total revenue, respectively. The Bancorp derives the majority of its revenues within the U.S. from customers
domiciled in the United States. Revenue from foreign countries and external customers domiciled in foreign countries was immaterial to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Changes in interest rates, credit quality, economic trends and the capital
markets are primary factors that drive the performance of the Bancorp. As discussed later in the Risk Management section of MD&A, risk identification, measurement, monitoring, control and reporting are important to the management of risk and to
the financial performance and capital strength of the Bancorp.

Net interest income is the difference between interest
income earned on assets such as loans, leases and securities, and interest expense incurred on liabilities such as deposits, short-term borrowings and long-term debt. Net interest income is affected by the general level of interest rates, the
relative level of short-term and long-term interest rates, changes in interest rates and changes in the amount and composition of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Generally, the rates of interest the Bancorp earns on its
assets and pays on its liabilities are established for a period of time. The change in market interest rates over time exposes the Bancorp to interest rate risk through potential adverse changes to net interest income and financial position. The
Bancorp manages this risk by continually analyzing and adjusting the composition of its assets and liabilities based on their payment streams and interest rates, the timing of their maturities and their sensitivity to changes in market interest
rates. Additionally, in the ordinary course of business, the Bancorp enters into certain derivative transactions as part of its overall strategy to manage its interest rate and prepayment risks. The Bancorp is also exposed to the risk of losses on
its loan and lease portfolio as a result of changing expected cash flows caused by borrower credit events, such as loan defaults and inadequate collateral due to a weakened economy within the Bancorp’s footprint.

Noninterest income is derived from service charges on deposits, corporate banking revenue, wealth and asset management
revenue, card and processing revenue, mortgage banking net revenue, securities gains, net and other noninterest income.

Noninterest expense includes personnel costs, net occupancy expense, technology and communication costs, card and processing expense, equipment expense and other noninterest expense.

Vantiv, Inc. and Vantiv Holding, LLC Transactions

On July 27, 2016, the Bancorp entered into an agreement with Vantiv, Inc. under which a portion of its TRA with Vantiv, Inc. was
terminated and settled in full for consideration of a cash payment in the amount of $116 million from Vantiv, Inc. Under the agreement, the Bancorp terminated and settled certain TRA cash flows it expected to receive in the years 2019 to 2035,
totaling an estimated $331 million. The Bancorp recognized a gain of $116 million in other noninterest income in the Consolidated Statements of Income from this settlement in 2016.

Additionally, the agreement provides that Vantiv, Inc. may be obligated to pay up to a total of approximately $171 million
to the Bancorp to terminate and settle certain remaining TRA cash flows, totaling an estimated $394 million, upon the exercise of certain call options by Vantiv, Inc. or certain put options by the Bancorp. If the associated call options or put
options are exercised, 10% of the obligations would be settled with respect to each quarter in 2017 and 15% of the obligations would be settled with respect to each quarter in 2018. The Bancorp recognized a gain of $164 million in other noninterest
income in the Consolidated Statements of Income in 2016 associated with these options. This agreement did not impact the TRA payments recognized in the fourth quarter of 2016 and is not expected to impact the TRA payment expected in the fourth
quarter of 2017.

During the fourth quarter of 2016, the Bancorp exercised its right to purchase approximately
7.8 million Class C Units underlying the warrant at the $15.98 strike price. This exercise was settled on a net basis for approximately 5.7 million Class C Units, which were then exchanged for approximately 5.7 million shares of
Vantiv, Inc. Class A Common Stock of which 4.8 million shares were sold in a secondary offering and 0.9 million shares were repurchased by Vantiv, Inc. The Bancorp recognized a gain of $9 million in other noninterest income in the
Consolidated Statements of Income in 2016 on the exercise of the remaining warrant in Vantiv Holding, LLC.

Branch Consolidations and Sales
Activity

The Bancorp monitors changing customer preferences associated with the channels it uses for banking transactions to
evaluate the efficiency, competitiveness and quality of the customer service experience in its consumer distribution network. As part of this ongoing assessment, the Bancorp may determine that it is no longer fully committed to maintaining
full-service branches at certain of its existing banking center locations. Similarly, the Bancorp may also determine that it is no longer fully committed to building banking centers on certain parcels of land which had previously been held for
future branch expansion. On June 16, 2015, the Bancorp’s Board of Directors authorized management to pursue a plan to further develop its distribution strategy, including a plan to consolidate and/or sell certain operating branch locations
and to sell certain parcels of undeveloped land that had been acquired by the Bancorp for future branch expansion (the “Branch Consolidation and Sales Plan”). In addition, the Bancorp announced on September 13, 2016 that it had
identified an additional 44 branch locations and 5 parcels of undeveloped land that it planned to consolidate or sell.

On January 29, 2016, the Bancorp closed the previously announced sale in the St. Louis MSA to Great Southern Bank and
recorded a gain on the sale of $8 million in other noninterest income.

32  Fifth Third Bancorp


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Additionally, on April 22, 2016, the Bancorp closed the previously announced sale in the Pittsburgh MSA to First National Bank of Pennsylvania and recorded a gain on the sale of $11 million
in other noninterest income. Both transactions were part of the Branch Consolidation and Sales Plan.

As of
December 31, 2016, the Bancorp had 64 branch locations and 35 parcels of undeveloped land that had been acquired for future branch expansion that it intended to consolidate or sell. These branch locations and parcels of undeveloped land, which
include unsold properties from the Branch Consolidation and Sales Plan as well as properties included in the September 13, 2016 announcement, represent $39 million, $16 million and $1 million of land and improvements, buildings and equipment,
respectively, included in bank premises and equipment in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2016, of which $29 million, $9 million and $1 million, respectively, were classified as held for sale. The Bancorp expects to receive
approximately $72 million in annual savings from operating expenses upon completion of the Branch Consolidation and Sales Plan and the consolidation and/or sale of properties included in the September 13, 2016 announcement. Approximately $60
million of the $72 million in total estimated annual savings are attributable to branches that were closed prior to December 31, 2016. For further information, refer to Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

On September 29, 2016, the Bancorp closed on the sale of an office complex. The sale also included all of the
Bancorp’s rights, title and interest as a landlord under existing leases in the complex. Under the terms of the transaction, the Bancorp received proceeds of approximately $31 million and entered into a lease agreement whereby the Bancorp
leased-back approximately 25% of the office complex. In conjunction with the transaction, which qualified as a sale-leaseback under U.S. GAAP, the Bancorp retired assets with a net book value of approximately $10 million, recognized a deferred gain
of $10 million, which is being amortized as a reduction of rent expense over the 15 year lease term, and recorded a gain on the transaction of $11 million in other noninterest income.

NorthStar Strategy

In the third
quarter of 2016, the Bancorp launched the NorthStar Strategy, a three-year plan designed to achieve the Bancorp’s

vision to be the One Bank people most value and trust and deliver strong, consistent returns through longer term economic cycles.

The strategy is designed to impact every line of business, every employee and, most importantly, every customer. The Bancorp
is focused on:

●

Building a differentiated brand and corporate reputation by improving the customer experience, increasing
brand equity and delivering on the Bancorp’s $30 billion community commitment.

●

Delivering a better, more differentiated value proposition by investing in our sales and service channels and
expanding on our products, solutions and expertise.

●

Generating returns on average tangible common equity (non-GAAP) of 12% to 14%, a return on average assets of
1.1% to 1.3% and an efficiency ratio below 60% by the end of 2019.

●

Achieving risk and operational excellence.

The Bancorp has implemented several initiatives to assist in achieving these goals, including the following: our
partnership with GreenSky, upgrades to our mortgage and teller systems, expansion of credit card and treasury management products, focused growth in asset-based lending and our commercial verticals and acceleration of our automation and robotics
initiatives.

Accelerated Share Repurchase Transactions

During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Bancorp entered into or settled a number of accelerated share repurchase
transactions. As part of these transactions, the Bancorp entered into forward contracts in which the final number of shares delivered at settlement was based generally on a discount to the average daily volume weighted-average price of the
Bancorp’s common stock during the term of the repurchase agreements. For more information on the accelerated share repurchase program, refer to Note 23 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. For a summary of the Bancorp’s
accelerated share repurchase transactions that were entered into or settled during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, refer to Table 2.

Open Market Share Repurchase Transactions

Between June 17, 2016 and June 20, 2016, the Bancorp repurchased 1,436,100 shares, or approximately $26 million, of its outstanding
common stock through open market repurchase transactions.

Senior and Subordinated Notes Offerings

On March 15, 2016, the Bank issued and sold $1.5 billion in aggregate principal amount of unsecured bank notes. The bank notes consisted
of $750 million of 2.30% senior fixed-rate notes due on March 15, 2019; and $750 million of 3.85% subordinated fixed-rate notes due on March 15, 2026. These bank notes will be

redeemable by the Bank, in whole or in part, on or after the date that is 30 days prior to the maturity date at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid
interest up to, but excluding, the redemption date.

On June 14, 2016, the Bank issued and sold $1.3 billion of
2.25% unsecured senior fixed-rate notes due on June 14, 2021. These bank notes will be redeemable by the Bank, in whole or in part, on or after the date that is 30 days prior to the maturity date at a redemption price equal to 100% of the
principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, the redemption date.

On September 27,
2016, the Bank issued and sold $1.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior bank notes due on September 27, 2019.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The bank notes consisted of $750 million of 1.625% senior fixed-rate notes and $250 million of senior floating-rate notes at three-month LIBOR plus 59 bps. The Bancorp entered into interest rate
swaps to convert the fixed-rate notes to a floating-rate, which resulted in an effective interest rate of three-month LIBOR plus 53 bps. These bank notes will be redeemable by the Bank, in whole or in part, on or after the date that is 30 days prior
to the maturity date at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, the redemption date.

Legislative and Regulatory Developments

The FRB conducted a regularly scheduled examination covering 2011 through 2013 to determine the Bank’s compliance with the CRA. This CRA
examination resulted in a rating of “Needs to Improve.” The Bank believes that the “Needs to Improve” rating reflects legacy issues that have been remediated during the intervening three years. While the Bank’s CRA rating is
“Needs to Improve” the Bancorp and the Bank face limitations and conditions on certain activities, including the commencement of new activities and merger with or acquisitions of other financial institutions. During the fourth quarter of
2016, the FRB began a CRA examination of the Bank. For further information, refer to the Regulation and Supervision subsection of Part I, Item 1 of the Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Earnings Summary

The Bancorp’s net income available to common shareholders for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $1.5 billion, or $1.93 per
diluted share, which was net of $75 million in preferred stock dividends. The Bancorp’s net income available to common shareholders for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $1.6 billion, or $2.01 per diluted share, which was net of $75
million in preferred stock dividends. Pre-provision net revenue was $2.4 billion and $2.8 billion for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Pre-provision net revenue is a non-GAAP measure. For further information, refer to
the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section of MD&A.

Net interest income on an FTE basis
(non-GAAP) was $3.6 billion for both the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. Net interest income was positively impacted by increases in average taxable securities of $3.1 billion and average loans and leases of $981 million for the year
ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. Additionally, net interest income was positively impacted by the decision of the Federal Open Market Committee to raise the target range of the federal funds rate 25 bps
to 50 bps in 2015 and 25 bps to 75 bps in 2016. These positive impacts were partially offset by an increase in average long-term debt of $750 million coupled with a decrease in the net interest rate spread to 2.66% during the year ended
December 31, 2016 from 2.69% during the year ended December 31, 2015. Net interest margin on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) was 2.88% for the both years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Noninterest income decreased $307 million from
the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily due to decreases in other noninterest income and mortgage banking net revenue partially offset by an increase in corporate banking revenue. Other noninterest income decreased $291 million from the year
ended December 31, 2015. The decrease included the impact of a gain of $331 million on the sale of Vantiv, Inc. shares in the fourth quarter of 2015. The Bancorp recognized positive valuation adjustments on the stock warrant associated with
Vantiv Holding, LLC of $64 million and $236 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. In addition to valuation adjustments, during the fourth quarter of 2015, the Bancorp recognized a gain of $89 million on both the
sale and exercise of a portion of the warrant associated with Vantiv Holding, LLC compared with a gain of $9 million on the sale of the remaining warrant in Vantiv Holding, LLC during 2016. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in
income from the TRAs associated with Vantiv, Inc. of $233 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in the prior year and a decrease in net losses on disposition and impairment of bank premises and equipment of
$88 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared with the same period in the prior year. Mortgage banking net revenue decreased $63 million from the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily due to a decrease in net mortgage
servicing revenue, partially offset by an increase in origination fees and gains on loan sales. Corporate banking revenue increased $48 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily
driven by increases in syndication fees and lease remarketing fees, partially offset by decreases in letter of credit fees and foreign exchange fees.

34  Fifth Third Bancorp


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Noninterest expense increased $128 million for the year ended
December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily due to increases in personnel costs, technology and communications expense and other noninterest expense partially offset by decreases in net occupancy expense and
card and processing expense. Personnel costs increased $103 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 driven by an increase in base compensation, variable compensation, and higher retirement
and severance costs related to the Bancorp’s voluntary early retirement program. Technology and communications expense increased $10 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 driven
primarily by increased investment in information technology associated with regulatory and compliance initiatives, system maintenance and other growth initiatives. Other noninterest expense increased $64 million for the year ended December 31,
2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily due to increases in FDIC insurance and other taxes, impairment on affordable housing investments, the provision for the reserve for unfunded commitments, losses and adjustments and
operating lease expense. These increases were partially offset by decreases in travel expense, professional service fees and loan and lease expense. Card and processing expense decreased $21 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared
to the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily due to the impact of renegotiated service contracts.

For more information on net interest income, noninterest income and
noninterest expense, refer to the Statements of Income Analysis section of MD&A.

Credit Summary

The provision for loan and lease losses was $343 million and $396 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
Net losses charged-off as a percent of average portfolio loans and leases decreased to 0.39% during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to 0.48% during the year ended December 31, 2015. At December 31, 2016, nonperforming
portfolio assets as a percent of portfolio loans and leases and OREO increased to 0.80% compared to 0.70% at December 31, 2015. For further discussion on credit quality, refer to the Credit Risk Management subsection of the Risk Management
section of MD&A.

Capital Summary

The Bancorp’s capital ratios exceed the “well-capitalized” guidelines as defined by the PCA requirements of the U.S. banking
agencies. As of December 31, 2016, as calculated under the Basel III transition provisions, the CET1 capital ratio was 10.39%, the Tier I risk-based capital ratio was 11.50%, the Total risk-based capital ratio was 15.02% and the Tier I leverage
ratio was 9.90%.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

The following are non-GAAP measures which are important to the reader of the Consolidated
Financial Statements but should be supplemental to primary U.S. GAAP measures.

The FTE basis adjusts for the
tax-favored status of income from certain loans and securities held by the Bancorp that are not

taxable for federal income tax purposes. The Bancorp believes this presentation to be the preferred industry measurement of net interest income as it provides a relevant comparison between
taxable and non-taxable amounts.

The following table

The Bancorp believes return on average tangible common equity is an important measure for
comparative purposes with other financial institutions, but is not defined under U.S. GAAP, and therefore is considered a non-GAAP financial measure. This measure is useful for evaluating the performance of a business as it

calculates the return available to common shareholders without the impact of intangible assets and their related amortization.

The Bancorp considers various measures when evaluating capital utilization and adequacy,
including the tangible equity ratio, tangible common equity ratio and tangible book value per share, in addition to capital ratios defined by the U.S. banking agencies. These calculations are intended to complement the capital ratios defined by the
U.S. banking agencies for both absolute and comparative purposes. Because U.S. GAAP does not include capital ratio measures, the Bancorp believes there are no comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures to these ratios. These ratios are not formally
defined by U.S. GAAP or codified in the federal banking regulations and, therefore, are considered to be non-GAAP financial measures. Additionally, the Bancorp became subject to the Basel III Final Rule on January 1, 2015 which defined various
regulatory capital ratios including the CET1 ratio.

The CET1 capital ratio has transition provisions that will be phased out over time. The Bancorp is presenting the CET1 capital ratio on a fully phased-in basis for comparative purposes with other
organizations. The Bancorp considers the fully phased-in CET1 ratio a non-GAAP measure since it is not the CET1 ratio in effect for the periods presented. Since analysts and the U.S. banking agencies may assess the Bancorp’s capital adequacy
using these ratios, the Bancorp believes they are useful to provide investors the ability to assess its capital adequacy on the same basis. The Bancorp encourages readers to consider its Consolidated Financial Statements in their entirety and not to
rely on any single financial measure.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

RECENT ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements provides a discussion of the
significant new accounting standards adopted

by the Bancorp during 2016 and the expected impact of significant accounting standards issued, but not yet required to be adopted.

CRITICAL
ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The Bancorp’s Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.
Certain accounting policies require management to exercise judgment in determining methodologies, economic assumptions and estimates that may materially affect the Bancorp’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows. The
Bancorp’s critical accounting policies include the accounting for the ALLL, reserve for unfunded commitments, income taxes, valuation of servicing rights, fair value measurements, goodwill and legal contingencies. No material changes were made
to the valuation techniques or models described below during the year ended December 31, 2016.

ALLL

The Bancorp disaggregates its portfolio loans and leases into portfolio segments for purposes of determining the ALLL. The Bancorp’s
portfolio segments include commercial, residential mortgage and consumer. The Bancorp further disaggregates its portfolio segments into classes for purposes of monitoring and assessing credit quality based on certain risk characteristics. For an
analysis of the Bancorp’s ALLL by portfolio segment and credit quality information by class, refer to Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

The Bancorp maintains the ALLL to absorb probable loan and lease losses inherent in its portfolio segments. The ALLL is
maintained at a level the Bancorp considers to be adequate and is based on ongoing quarterly assessments and evaluations of the collectability and historical loss experience of loans and leases. Credit losses are charged and recoveries are credited
to the ALLL. Provisions for loan and lease losses are based on the Bancorp’s review of the historical credit loss experience and such factors that, in management’s judgment, deserve consideration under existing economic conditions in
estimating probable credit losses. The Bancorp’s strategy for credit risk management includes a combination of conservative exposure limits significantly below legal lending limits and conservative underwriting, documentation and collections
standards. The strategy also emphasizes diversification on a geographic, industry and customer level, regular credit examinations and quarterly management reviews of large credit exposures and loans experiencing deterioration of credit quality.

The Bancorp’s methodology for determining the ALLL requires significant management judgement and is based on historical
loss rates, current credit grades, specific allocation on loans modified in a TDR and impaired commercial credits above specified thresholds and other qualitative adjustments. Allowances on individual commercial loans, TDRs and historical loss rates
are reviewed quarterly and adjusted as necessary based on changing borrower and/or collateral conditions and actual collection and charge-off experience. An unallocated allowance is maintained to recognize the imprecision in estimating and measuring
losses when evaluating allowances for pools of loans.

Larger commercial loans included
within aggregate borrower relationship balances exceeding $1 million that exhibit probable or observed credit weaknesses, as well as loans that have been modified in a TDR, are subject to individual review for impairment. The Bancorp considers the
current value of collateral, credit quality of any guarantees, the guarantor’s liquidity and willingness to cooperate, the loan structure and other factors when evaluating whether an individual loan is impaired. Other factors

may include the industry and geographic region of the borrower, size and financial condition of the borrower, cash flow and leverage of the borrower and the Bancorp’s evaluation of the
borrower’s management. When individual loans are impaired, allowances are determined based on management’s estimate of the borrower’s ability to repay the loan given the availability of collateral and other sources of cash flow, as
well as an evaluation of legal options available to the Bancorp. Allowances for impaired loans are measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s effective interest rate, fair value of the underlying
collateral or readily observable secondary market values. The Bancorp evaluates the collectability of both principal and interest when assessing the need for a loss accrual.

Historical credit loss rates are applied to commercial loans that are not impaired or are impaired, but smaller than the
established threshold of $1 million and thus not subject to specific allowance allocations. The loss rates are derived from migration analyses for several portfolio stratifications, which track the historical net charge-off experience sustained on
loans according to their internal risk grade. The risk grading system utilized for allowance analysis purposes encompasses ten categories.

Homogenous loans and leases in the residential mortgage and consumer portfolio segments are not individually risk graded.
Rather, standard credit scoring systems and delinquency monitoring are used to assess credit risks and allowances are established based on the expected net charge-offs. Loss rates are based on the trailing twelve month net charge-off history by loan
category. Historical loss rates may be adjusted for certain prescriptive and qualitative factors that, in management’s judgment, are necessary to reflect losses inherent in the portfolio. The prescriptive loss rate factors include adjustments
for delinquency trends, LTV trends and refreshed FICO score trends.

The Bancorp also considers qualitative factors in
determining the ALLL. These include adjustments for changes in policies or procedures in underwriting, monitoring or collections, economic conditions, portfolio mix, lending and risk management personnel, results of internal audit and quality
control reviews, collateral values and geographic concentrations. The Bancorp considers home price index trends when determining the collateral value qualitative factor.

The Bancorp’s primary market areas for lending are the Midwestern and Southeastern regions of the U.S. When evaluating
the adequacy of allowances, consideration is given to these regional geographic concentrations and the closely associated effect changing economic conditions have on the Bancorp’s customers. Refer to the Allowance for Credit Losses subsection
of the Risk Management section of MD&A for a discussion on the Bancorp’s ALLL sensitivity analysis.

Reserve for Unfunded Commitments

The reserve for unfunded commitments is maintained at a level believed by management to be sufficient to absorb estimated
probable losses related to unfunded credit facilities and is included in other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The determination of the adequacy of the reserve is based upon an evaluation of the unfunded credit facilities, including
an assessment of historical commitment utilization experience, credit risk grading and historical loss rates based on credit grade migration. This process takes into consideration the same risk elements that are analyzed in the determination of the
adequacy of the Bancorp’s ALLL, as previously discussed.

39  Fifth
Third Bancorp


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Net adjustments to the reserve for unfunded commitments are included in other noninterest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Income Taxes

The income tax
laws of the jurisdictions in which the Bancorp operates are complex and may be subject to different interpretations. The Bancorp evaluates and assesses the relative risks and appropriate tax treatment of transactions and filing positions after
considering statutes, regulations, judicial precedent and other information. The Bancorp maintains tax accruals consistent with its evaluation of these items.

Changes in the estimate of tax accruals occur periodically due to changes in tax rates, interpretation of tax laws and
regulations, and other guidance issued by tax authorities and the status of examinations conducted by tax authorities, as well as the expiration of statutes of limitations. These changes may significantly impact the Bancorp’s tax accruals,
deferred taxes and income tax expense and may significantly impact the operating results of the Bancorp.

Deferred taxes
are determined using the balance sheet method. Under this method, the net deferred tax asset or liability is calculated based on the difference between the book and tax bases of the assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates and laws.
Significant management judgment is required to determine the realizability of deferred tax assets. Deferred tax assets are recognized when management believes that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized. Where
management has determined that it is not more likely than not that certain deferred tax assets will be realized, a valuation allowance is maintained. For additional information on income taxes, refer to Note 20 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements.

Valuation of Servicing Rights

When the Bancorp sells loans through either securitizations or individual loan sales in accordance with its investment policies, it often
obtains servicing rights. Servicing rights resulting from loan sales are initially recorded at fair value and subsequently amortized in proportion to, and over the period of, estimated net servicing revenue. Servicing rights are assessed for
impairment monthly, based on fair value, with temporary impairment recognized through a valuation allowance and other-than-temporary impairment recognized through a write-off of the servicing asset and related valuation allowance. Significant
management judgement is necessary to identify key economic assumptions used in measuring any potential impairment of the servicing rights including the prepayment speeds of the underlying loans, the weighted-average life, the OAS spread and the
weighted-average coupon rate, as applicable. The primary risk of material changes to the value of the servicing rights resides in the potential volatility in the economic assumptions used, particularly the prepayment speeds. The Bancorp monitors
risk and adjusts its valuation allowance as necessary to adequately reserve for impairment in the servicing portfolio. In order to assist in this assessment, the Bancorp obtains external valuations of the MSR portfolio from third parties and
participates in peer surveys that provide additional confirmation of the

reasonableness of key assumptions utilized in the internal OAS model. For purposes of measuring impairment, the MSRs are stratified into classes based on the financial asset type (fixed-rate vs.
adjustable-rate) and interest rates. For additional information on servicing rights, refer to Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Fair Value Measurements

The
Bancorp measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between
market participants at the measurement date. Valuation techniques the Bancorp uses to measure fair value include the market approach, income approach and cost approach. The market approach uses prices or relevant information generated by market
transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities. The income approach involves discounting future amounts to a single present amount and is based on current market expectations about those future amounts. The cost approach is
based on the amount that currently would be required to replace the service capacity of the asset.

U.S. GAAP
establishes a fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets
or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). A financial instrument’s categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the instrument’s fair
value measurement. For additional information on the fair value hierarchy and fair value measurements, refer to Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

The Bancorp’s fair value measurements involve various valuation techniques and models, which involve inputs that are
observable, when available. Valuation techniques and parameters used for measuring assets and liabilities are reviewed and validated by the Bancorp on a quarterly basis. Additionally, the Bancorp monitors the fair values of significant assets and
liabilities using a variety of methods including the evaluation of pricing runs and exception reports based on certain analytical criteria, comparison to previous trades and overall review and assessments for reasonableness. The level of management
judgement necessary to determine fair value varies based upon the methods used in the determination of fair value. Financial instruments that are measured at fair value using quoted prices in active markets (Level 1) require minimal judgement. The
valuation of financial instruments when quoted market prices are not available (Levels 2 and 3) may require significant management judgement to assess whether quoted prices for similar instruments exist, the impact of changing market conditions
including reducing liquidity in the capital markets, and, the use of estimates surrounding significant unobservable inputs. Table 8 provides a summary of the fair value of financial instruments carried at fair value on a recurring basis and the
amounts of financial instruments valued using Level 3 inputs.

Refer to Note 27 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on
fair value measurements including a description of the valuation methodologies used for significant financial instruments.

Goodwill

Business combinations entered into by the Bancorp typically include the acquisition of goodwill. U.S. GAAP requires goodwill to be tested for
impairment at the Bancorp’s reporting unit level on an annual basis, which for the Bancorp is September 30, and more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that there may be impairment. Refer to Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements for a discussion on the methodology used by the Bancorp to assess goodwill for impairment.

Impairment exists when a reporting unit’s carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value. In testing
goodwill for impairment, U.S. GAAP permits the Bancorp to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. In this qualitative assessment, the
Bancorp evaluates events and circumstances which may include, but are not limited to, the general economic environment, banking industry and market conditions, the overall financial performance of the Bancorp, the performance of the Bancorp’s
common stock, the key financial performance metrics of the Bancorp’s reporting units and events affecting the reporting units to determine if it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying
amount. If the two-step impairment test is required or the decision to bypass the qualitative assessment is elected, the Bancorp would be required to perform the first step (Step 1) of the goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a
reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any.

The fair value of a reporting unit is the price that would be received to sell the unit as a whole in an orderly transaction
between market participants at the measurement date. As none of the Bancorp’s reporting units are publicly traded, individual reporting unit fair value determinations cannot be directly correlated to the Bancorp’s stock price. The
determination of the fair value of a reporting unit is a subjective process that involves the use of estimates and judgments, particularly related to cash flows, the appropriate discount rates and an applicable control premium. The Bancorp employs
an income-based approach, utilizing the reporting unit’s forecasted cash flows (including a terminal value approach to estimate cash flows beyond the final year of the forecast) and the reporting unit’s estimated cost of equity as the
discount rate. Significant management judgment is necessary in the preparation of each reporting unit’s forecasted cash flows surrounding expectations for earnings projections, growth and credit loss expectations and actual results may differ
from forecasted results. Additionally, the Bancorp determines its market capitalization based on the average of the closing price of the Bancorp’s stock during the month including the measurement date, incorporating an additional control
premium, and compares this market-based fair value measurement to the aggregate fair value of the Bancorp’s reporting units in order to corroborate the results of the income approach.

When required to perform Step 2, the Bancorp compares the implied fair value
of a reporting unit’s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount exceeds the implied fair value, an impairment loss equal to that excess amount is recognized. A recognized impairment loss cannot exceed the
carrying amount of that goodwill and cannot be reversed in future periods even if the fair value of the reporting unit subsequently recovers.

During Step 2, the Bancorp determines the implied fair value of goodwill for a reporting unit by assigning the fair value of
the reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit (including any unrecognized intangible assets) as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination. Significant management judgement is necessary in the
identification and valuation of unrecognized intangible assets and the valuation of the reporting unit’s recorded assets and liabilities. The excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities
is the implied fair value of goodwill. This assignment process is only performed for purposes of testing goodwill for impairment. The Bancorp does not adjust the carrying values of recognized assets or liabilities (other than goodwill, if
appropriate), nor does it recognize previously unrecognized intangible assets in the Consolidated Financial Statements as a result of this assignment process. Refer to Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information
regarding the Bancorp’s goodwill.

Legal Contingencies

The Bancorp and its subsidiaries are parties to numerous claims and lawsuits as well as threatened or potential actions or claims concerning
matters arising from the conduct of its business activities. The outcome of claims or litigation and the timing of ultimate resolution are inherently difficult to predict and significant judgment may be required in the determination of both the
probability of loss and whether the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable. The Bancorp’s estimates are subjective and are based on the status of legal and regulatory proceedings, the merit of the Bancorp’s defenses and consultation
with internal and external legal counsel. An accrual for a potential litigation loss is established when information related to the loss contingency indicates both that a loss is probable and that the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated.
Refer to Note 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding the Bancorp’s legal proceedings.

STATEMENTS OF INCOME ANALYSIS

Net Interest Income

Net interest income is the interest earned on loans and leases (including yield-related fees), securities and other short-term investments
less the interest paid for core deposits (includes transaction deposits and other time deposits) and wholesale funding (includes certificates $100,000 and over, other deposits, federal funds purchased, other short-term borrowings and long-term
debt). The net interest margin is calculated by dividing net interest income by average interest-earning assets. Net interest rate spread is the difference between the average yield earned on interest-earning assets and the average rate paid on
interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest margin is typically greater than net interest rate spread due to the interest income earned on those assets that are funded by noninterest-bearing liabilities, or free funding, such as demand deposits or
shareholders’ equity.

Tables 10 and 11 present the components of net interest income, net interest margin and net
interest rate spread for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, as well as the relative impact of changes in the balance sheet and changes in interest rates on net interest income. Nonaccrual loans and leases and loans held for sale
have been included in the average loan and lease balances. Average outstanding securities balances are based on amortized cost with any unrealized gains or losses on available-for-sale securities included in other assets.

Net interest income on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) was $3.6 billion for both the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.
Net interest income was positively impacted by increases in average taxable securities of $3.1 billion and average loans and leases of $981 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015.
Additionally, net interest income was positively impacted by the decision of the Federal Open Market Committee to raise the target range of the federal funds rate 25 bps to 50 bps in December 2015 and 25 bps to 75 bps in December 2016. These
positive impacts were partially offset by an increase in average long-term debt of $750 million coupled with a decrease in the net interest rate spread to 2.66% during the year ended December 31, 2016 from 2.69% during the year ended
December 31, 2015. The decrease in the net interest rate spread was driven by a 9 bps increase on rates paid on average interest-bearing liabilities partially offset by a 6 bps increase in yields on average interest-earning assets.

Net interest margin on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) was 2.88% for both the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. Net
interest margin was positively impacted by an increase in average free funding balances partially offset by the aforementioned decrease in net interest rate spread coupled with an increase of $2.7 billion in average interest-earning assets. The
increase in average free funding balances was driven by increases in average demand deposits and average shareholders’ equity of $698 million and $727 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended
December 31, 2015.

Interest income on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) from loans and leases increased
$86 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 due to an increase in average loans and leases coupled with an increase in yields on average loans and leases. Average loans and leases increased $981 million during the year ended
December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 and was primarily driven by increases in average residential mortgage loans, average commercial construction loans and average commercial and industrial loans partially offset
by decreases in average automobile loans and average home equity. Yields on average loans and leases increased 5 bps during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily as a result of increases in
yields on average commercial construction loans, average commercial and industrial loans and average home equity loans partially offset by a decrease in yields on average credit cards which included the impact of a $16 million reduction in interest
income related to refunds to be offered to certain bankcard customers. For more information on the Bancorp’s loan and lease portfolio, refer to the Loans and Leases subsection of the Balance Sheet Analysis section of MD&A. Interest income
from investment securities and other short-term investments increased $83 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase was primarily the result of the previously mentioned increase in average taxable securities, partially
offset by a decrease of $14 million in dividends on FRB stock, due to the amended provisions of the Federal Reserve Act governing dividend payments to FRB stockholders.

Interest expense on core deposits increased $15 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended
December 31, 2015. This increase was primarily due to increases in the cost of average interest-bearing core deposits to 26 bps for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to 24 bps for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase
in the cost of average interest-bearing core deposits was primarily due to an increase in the cost of average interest checking and money market deposits. Refer to the Deposits subsection of the Balance Sheet Analysis section of MD&A for
additional information on the Bancorp’s deposits.

Interest expense on average wholesale funding increased $68
million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily due to an increase of 26 bps in the rates paid on average long-term debt coupled with the aforementioned increase in average long-term
debt. Refer to the Borrowings subsection of the Balance Sheet Analysis section of MD&A for additional information on the Bancorp’s borrowings. Average wholesale funding represented 26% and 24% of average interest-bearing liabilities during
the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. For more information on the Bancorp’s interest rate risk management, including estimated earnings sensitivity to changes in market interest rates, see the Market Risk Management
subsection of the Risk Management section of MD&A.

Provision for Loan and Lease Losses

The Bancorp provides as an expense an amount for probable losses within the loan and lease portfolio that is based on factors previously
discussed in the Critical Accounting Policies section of MD&A. The provision is recorded to bring the ALLL to a level deemed appropriate by the Bancorp to cover losses inherent in the portfolio. Actual credit losses on loans and leases are
charged against the ALLL. The amount of loans and leases actually removed from the Consolidated Balance Sheets are referred to as charge-offs. Net charge-offs include current period charge-offs less recoveries on previously charged-off loans and
leases.

The provision for loan and lease losses was $343 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to
$396 million for the same period in the prior year. The decrease in provision expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the

prior year was primarily due to the decrease in the level of commercial criticized assets, which reflected improvement in the national economy and stabilization of commodity prices, and a
decrease in outstanding loan balances. The ALLL declined $19 million from December 31, 2015 to $1.3 billion at December 31, 2016. At December 31, 2016, the ALLL as a percent of portfolio loans and leases decreased to 1.36%, compared
to 1.37% at December 31, 2015.

Refer to the Credit Risk Management subsection of the Risk Management section of
MD&A as well as Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more detailed information on the provision for loan and lease losses, including an analysis of loan portfolio composition, nonperforming assets, net charge-offs and
other factors considered by the Bancorp in assessing the credit quality of the loan and lease portfolio and the ALLL.

Service charges on deposits

Service charges on deposits decreased $5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015
due primarily to a $10 million decrease in consumer deposit fees driven by a decrease in consumer checking fees, partially offset by a $5 million increase in commercial deposit fees driven by new customer acquisition.

Corporate banking revenue

Corporate
banking revenue increased $48 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase from the prior year was primarily driven by increases in syndication fees and lease remarketing fees. The
increase was partially offset by decreases in letter of credit fees and foreign exchange fees. Syndication fees increased $32 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 as a result of increased activity in the market and gains in
specialized business segments. Lease remarketing fees increased $30 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 from the prior year and included the impact of $16 million in gains on certain leveraged lease terminations. Additionally, the
increase included the impact of impairment charges of $20 million related to certain operating lease equipment that were recognized during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $36 million recognized during the year ended
December 31, 2015. Letter of credit fees decreased $10 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the prior year primarily driven by a decrease in outstanding VRDNs. Foreign exchange fees decreased $8 million

during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the prior year primarily driven by lower volume coupled with lower currency volatility.

Wealth and asset management revenue

Wealth and asset management revenue (formerly investment advisory revenue) decreased $14 million for the year ended December 31, 2016
compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease from the prior year was primarily due to a decrease of $16 million in securities and brokerage fees driven by lower transactional fees partially offset by an increase in managed account
fee-based business. The decrease was partially offset by a $2 million increase in private client service fees and institutional fees for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The Bancorp’s
Trust, Brokerage and Insurance businesses had approximately $315 billion and $297 billion in total assets under care as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and managed $31 billion and $29 billion in assets for individuals, corporations
and not-for-profit organizations as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Card and processing revenue

Card and processing revenue increased $17 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015
primarily driven by an increase in the number of actively used cards and customer spend volume.

Mortgage banking net revenue

Mortgage banking net revenue decreased $63 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31,
2015.

Origination fees and gains on loan sales increased $15 million for the year ended
December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 driven by an increase in saleable residential mortgage loan originations. Residential mortgage loan originations increased to $10.0 billion for the year ended December 31,
2016 from $8.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2015.

Net mortgage servicing revenue is comprised of
gross mortgage servicing fees and related MSR amortization as well as valuation adjustments on MSRs and mark-to-market adjustments on both settled and outstanding free-standing derivative financial instruments used to economically hedge the MSR
portfolio.

Third Bancorp


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Net mortgage servicing revenue decreased $78 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 driven primarily by a decrease of $63 million in
net valuation adjustments, as well as a decrease in gross mortgage servicing fees of $23 million. The decrease was partially

offset by a decrease in MSR amortization of $8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the prior year.

Mortgage rates increased during the year ended December 31, 2016 which caused modeled
prepayment speeds to decrease, leading to a recovery of temporary impairment on the servicing rights during the year. Mortgage rates increased during the year ended December 31, 2015 which caused the modeled prepayment speeds to decrease, which
led to a recovery of temporary impairment on the servicing rights during the year.

Servicing rights are deemed impaired
when a borrower’s loan rate is distinctly higher than prevailing rates. Impairment on servicing rights is reversed when the prevailing rates return to a level commensurate with the borrower’s loan rate. Further detail on the valuation of
MSRs can be found in Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The Bancorp maintains a non-qualifying hedging strategy to manage a portion of the risk associated with changes in the valuation on the MSR portfolio.

Refer to Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the free-standing derivatives used to economically hedge the MSR portfolio.

In addition to the derivative positions used to economically hedge the MSR portfolio, the Bancorp may acquire various
securities as a component of its non-qualifying hedging strategy. The Bancorp did not hold or sell securities related to the non-qualifying hedging strategy during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.

The Bancorp’s total residential loans serviced at December 31, 2016 and 2015 were $69.3 billion and $73.4 billion,
respectively, with $53.6 billion and $59.0 billion, respectively, of residential mortgage loans serviced for others.

Other noninterest income decreased $291 million for the year ended December 31, 2016
compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease included the impact of a gain of $331 million on the sale of Vantiv, Inc. shares in the fourth quarter of 2015, decreases in positive valuation adjustments on the warrant associated
with Vantiv Holding, LLC, a decrease in the gain on the sale and exercise of the warrant associated with Vantiv Holding, LLC, decreases in net gains on loan sales and private equity investment income, as well as an increase in the loss on the swap
associated with the sale of Visa, Inc. Class B shares. These decreases were partially offset by increases in the income from the

TRA associated with Vantiv, Inc. and a decrease in the net losses on disposition and impairment of bank premises and equipment as well as gains on sales of certain retail branch operations and an
increase in operating lease income.

The Bancorp recognized positive valuation adjustments
on the stock warrant associated with Vantiv Holding, LLC of $64 million and $236 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The fair value of the stock warrant was calculated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing
model, which utilizes several key inputs (Vantiv, Inc. stock price, strike price of the warrant and several unobservable inputs).

46  Fifth Third Bancorp


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The positive valuation adjustments for years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 were primarily due to increases of 24% and 40%, respectively, in Vantiv, Inc.’s share price from
December 31, 2015 to November 22, 2016 and from December 31, 2014 to December 31, 2015, respectively. In addition to valuation adjustments, during the fourth quarter of 2015, the Bancorp recognized a gain of $89 million on both
the sale and exercise of a portion of the warrant associated with Vantiv Holding, LLC. During the fourth quarter of 2016, the Bancorp recognized a gain of $9 million on the exercise of the remaining warrant in Vantiv Holding, LLC. For additional
information on the valuation of the warrant, refer to Note 27 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Net
gains on loan sales decreased $28 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in the prior year as the prior period included the impact of a $37 million gain on the sale of residential mortgage loans classified as
TDRs during the first quarter of 2015 which was partially offset by the $11 million gain on the sale of the agent bankcard loan portfolio during the second quarter of 2016.

Private equity investment income decreased $17 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to same period in
the prior year primarily driven by the recognition of $9 million of OTTI on certain private equity investments in the third quarter of 2016. Refer to Note 27 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Bancorp recognized $56 million of negative valuation adjustments related
to the Visa total return swap compared to $37 million during same period in the prior year. The adjustments for the year ended December 31, 2016 were primarily attributable to the decision of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit to
vacate and reverse the district court’s approval of the settlement of an interchange antitrust class action litigation matter on June 30, 2016. For additional information on the valuation of the swap associated with the sale of Visa, Inc.
Class B Shares and the

related litigation matters, refer to Note 17, Note 18 and Note 27 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Income from the TRAs associated with Vantiv, Inc. increased $233 million during the year ended December 31, 2016
compared to the same period in the prior year. This increase was primarily driven by a $280 million gain recognized in the third quarter of 2016 from the termination and settlement of gross cash flows from existing Vantiv, Inc. TRAs and the expected
obligation to terminate and settle the remaining Vantiv, Inc. TRA cash flows upon the exercise of put or call options. During the fourth quarter of 2015, the Bancorp recognized a $49 million gain from the payment from Vantiv, Inc. to terminate a
portion of the TRA. Additionally, the Bancorp recognized a gain of $33 million associated with the annual TRA payment during the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to a $31 million gain during the same period in the prior year.

Net losses on disposition and impairment of bank premises and equipment decreased $88 million during the year ended
December 31, 2016 compared with the same period in the prior year. This decrease was driven by impairment charges of $32 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to impairment charges of $109 million recognized during the
year ended December 31, 2015. The impairment charges for the year ended December 31, 2016 were partially offset by a gain of $11 million on the sale-leaseback of an office complex during the third quarter of 2016. For further information,
refer to Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Gains on sales of certain retail branch operations
of $19 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 included an $11 million gain on the sale of the Bancorp’s retail operations in the Pittsburgh MSA to First National Bank of Pennsylvania during the second quarter of 2016 and an $8
million gain on the sale of the Bancorp’s retail operations in the St. Louis MSA to Great Southern Bank during the first quarter of 2016.

Operating lease income increased $13 million primarily as a result of an increase in syndication and participation
origination activity.

Noninterest Expense

Noninterest expense increased $128 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015,
primarily due to increases in personnel costs (salaries, wages and incentives plus employee benefits), technology and communications and other noninterest expense partially offset by decreases in net occupancy expense and card and processing
expense. The following table presents the components of noninterest expense:

Personnel costs increased $103 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to
the year ended December 31, 2015 driven by an increase in base compensation, primarily due to personnel additions in risk and compliance and information technology, and increased variable compensation, as well as higher retirement and severance
costs related to the Bancorp’s voluntary early retirement program. Full-time equivalent employees totaled 17,844 at December 31, 2016 compared to 18,261 at December 31, 2015.

Technology and communications expense increased
$10 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 driven primarily by increased investment in information technology associated with regulatory and compliance initiatives, system maintenance and
other growth initiatives.

Net occupancy expense decreased $22 million for the year ended December 31, 2016
compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily due to a decrease in rent expense driven by a reduction in the number of full-service banking centers and ATM locations.

Other noninterest expense increased $64 million for the year ended December 31, 2016
compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily due to increases in FDIC insurance and other taxes, impairment on affordable housing investments, the provision for the reserve for unfunded commitments, losses and adjustments and
operating lease expense partially offset by decreases in travel expense, professional service fees and loan and lease expense.

FDIC insurance and other taxes increased $27 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended
December 31, 2015 primarily due to the implementation of the FDIC surcharge in the third quarter of 2016 as well as an increase in the FDIC insurance assessment base and a favorable settlement of a tax liability related to prior years during
the first quarter of 2015. Impairment on affordable housing investments increased $23 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily due to incremental losses resulting from previous
growth in the portfolio. For further information, refer to Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The provision for the reserve for unfunded commitments increased $19 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to
the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily due to an increase in estimated loss rates related to unfunded

commitments. Losses and adjustments increased $18 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily due to the impact of favorable
legal settlements for the year ended December 31, 2015 partially offset by a decrease in legal settlements and reserve expense for the year ended December 31, 2016. Operating lease expense increased $12 million for the year ended
December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily due to an increase in the volume of leases. Travel expense and professional service fees both decreased $9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared
to the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily due to overall expense control. Loan and lease expense decreased $8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily due to lower loan
closing and appraisal costs driven by a decline in automobile loan originations.

The Bancorp continues to focus on
efficiency initiatives as part of its core emphasis on operating leverage and expense control. The efficiency ratio on an FTE basis was 61.6% for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to 57.6% for the year ended December 31, 2015. The
efficiency ratio on an FTE basis is a non-GAAP measure. For further information, refer to the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section of MD&A.

Applicable Income Taxes

Applicable income tax expense for all periods includes the benefit from tax-exempt income, tax-advantaged investments, certain gains on sales
of leveraged leases that are exempt from federal taxation and tax credits, partially offset by the effect of certain nondeductible expenses. The tax credits are associated with the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit program established under
Section 42 of the IRC, the New Markets Tax Credit program established under Section 45D of the IRC, the Rehabilitation Investment Tax Credit program established under Section 47 of the IRC and the Qualified Zone Academy Bond program
established under Section 1397E of the IRC.

The effective tax rates for the years
ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 were primarily impacted by $182 million and $178 million, respectively, in tax credits and $56 million and $39 million of tax benefits from tax exempt income in 2016 and 2015, respectively.

The decrease in the effective tax rate from the year ended December 31, 2015 to the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily related to a decrease in income before taxes, the increase
in tax exempt income, and a change in the estimated deductibility of a prior expense.

During 2016, the Bancorp adopted ASU 2016-09, “Improvements to Employee Share-Based
Payment Accounting”, effective as of January 1, 2016. Consistent with existing U.S. GAAP and ASU 2016-09, the Bancorp establishes a deferred tax asset and recognizes a corresponding deferred tax benefit for stock-based awards granted to
its employees and directors based on enacted tax rates and the expense recorded for financial reporting purposes. The actual tax deduction for these stock-based awards is determined when the stock-based awards are settled or expired and the tax
deductions will typically be greater than or less than the expense previously recognized for financial reporting.

48  Fifth Third Bancorp


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Among other requirements, ASU 2016-09 requires that the tax consequences for
the difference between the expense recognized for financial reporting and the Bancorp’s actual tax deduction for the stock-based awards be recognized through income tax expense in the interim periods in which they occur. Prior to the adoption
of ASU 2016-09, the tax consequences for the difference between the expense recognized for financial reporting and the actual tax deduction for stock-based awards was recognized either through additional paid-in-capital when the Bancorp accumulated
“excess tax benefits” from stock based

awards or through income tax expense when the Bancorp depleted its accumulated “excess tax benefits” from stock-based awards.

The Bancorp cannot predict its stock price or whether and when its employees will exercise stock-based awards in the future.
As of December 31, 2016, the Bancorp does not believe it will be necessary to recognize a material impact to tax expense over the next twelve months related to the settlement of stock-based awards. However, the amount of income tax expense or
benefit recognized upon settlement may vary significantly from expectations based on the Bancorp’s stock price and the number of SARs exercised by employees.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

BUSINESS SEGMENT REVIEW

The Bancorp reports on four business segments: Commercial Banking, Branch Banking, Consumer
Lending and Wealth and Asset Management (formerly Investment Advisors). Additional information on each business segment is included in Note 30 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Results of the Bancorp’s business segments are
presented based on its management structure and management accounting practices. The structure and accounting practices are specific to the Bancorp; therefore, the financial results of the Bancorp’s business segments are not necessarily
comparable with similar information for other financial institutions. The Bancorp refines its methodologies from time to time as management’s accounting practices or businesses change. In the second quarter of 2016, the Investment Advisors
segment name was changed to Wealth and Asset Management to better reflect the services provided by the business segment.

The Bancorp manages interest rate risk centrally at the corporate level. By employing an FTP methodology, the business
segments are insulated from most benchmark interest rate volatility, enabling them to focus on serving customers through the origination of loans and acceptance of deposits. The FTP methodology assigns charge rates and credit rates to classes of
assets and liabilities, respectively, based on the estimated amount and timing of cash flows for each transaction. Assigning the FTP rate based on matching the duration of cash flows allocates interest income and interest expense to each business
segment so its resulting net interest income is insulated from future changes in benchmark interest rates. The Bancorp’s FTP methodology also allocates the contribution to net interest income of the asset-generating and deposit-providing
businesses on a duration-adjusted basis to better attribute the driver of the performance. As the asset and liability durations are not perfectly matched, the residual impact of the FTP methodology is captured in General Corporate and Other. The
charge and credit rates are determined using the FTP rate curve, which is based on an estimate of Fifth Third’s marginal borrowing cost in the wholesale funding markets. The FTP curve is constructed using the U.S. swap curve, brokered CD
pricing and unsecured debt pricing.

The Bancorp adjusts the FTP charge and credit rates as dictated by changes in
interest rates for various interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and by the review of behavioural assumptions, such as prepayment rates on interest-earning assets and the estimated durations for indeterminate-lived deposits. Key
assumptions, including the credit rates provided for deposit accounts, are reviewed annually. Credit rates for deposit products and charge rates for loan products may be reset more frequently in response to changes in market conditions. The credit
rates for several deposit products were reset January 1, 2016 to reflect the current market rates and updated market assumptions. These rates were generally higher than those in place during 2015, thus net interest income for deposit-providing
business segments was positively impacted during 2016. FTP charge rates on assets were affected by the prevailing level of interest rates and by the duration and repricing characteristics of the portfolio. As overall market rates increased, the FTP
charge increased for asset-generating business segments during 2016.

During the first quarter of 2016, the Bancorp
refined its methodology for allocating provision expense to the business segments to include charges or benefits associated with changes in criticized commercial loan levels in addition to actual net charge-offs experienced by the loans and leases
owned by each business segment. The results of operations and financial position for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 were adjusted to reflect this change. Provision expense attributable to loan and lease growth and changes in ALLL
factors are captured in General Corporate and Other. The financial results of the business segments include allocations for shared services and headquarters expenses. Additionally, the business segments form synergies by taking advantage of
cross-sell opportunities and when funding operations by accessing the capital markets as a collective unit.

The results
of operations and financial position for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 were adjusted to reflect changes in internal expense allocation methodologies.

Comparison of the year ended 2016 with 2015

Net income was $995 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to net income of $718 million for the year ended
December 31, 2015. The increase in net income was driven by increases in net interest income and noninterest income and a decrease in the provision for loan and lease losses partially offset by an increase in noninterest expense.

Net interest income on an FTE basis increased $193 million from the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily driven by an
increase in FTP credit rates on core deposits and an increase in average commercial loan and lease balances as well as an increase in their yields of 17 bps for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the prior year. These increases in net
interest income for the year ended December 31, 2016 were partially offset by an increase in FTP charge rates on loans and leases.

Provision for loan and lease losses decreased $222 million from the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease was
primarily due to a decrease in criticized commercial loans during the year ended December 31, 2016 as well as a $102 million charge-off during the third quarter of 2015 associated with the restructuring of a student loan backed commercial
credit originated in 2007. Net charge-offs as a percent of average portfolio loans and leases decreased to 33 bps for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to 45 bps for the year ended December 31, 2015.

Noninterest income increased $54 million from the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily driven by an increase in
corporate banking revenue of $52 million driven by increases in lease remarketing fees and syndication fees partially offset by decreases in letter of credit fees and foreign exchange fees.

Noninterest expense increased $57 million from the year ended
December 31, 2015 primarily as a result of an increase in other noninterest expense. The increase in other noninterest expense was primarily driven by increases in corporate overhead allocations, impairment on affordable housing investments and
operating lease expense partially offset by a decrease in loan and lease expense.

Average commercial loans increased
$1.6 billion from the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily due to increases in average commercial and industrial loans, average commercial construction loans and average commercial leases partially offset by a decrease in average commercial
mortgage loans. Average commercial and industrial loans increased $657 million from the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily as a result of an increase in new origination activity resulting from an increase in demand and line utilization in
the first half of the year. Average commercial construction loans increased $926 million from the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily as a result of increased demand and draw levels continuing to outpace attrition. Average commercial leases
increased $121 million from the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily as a result of an increase in syndication and participation origination activity. Average commercial mortgage loans decreased $117 million from the year ended
December 31, 2015 primarily due to a decline in new loan origination activity driven by increased competition and an increase in paydowns.

Average core deposits decreased $717 million from the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease was primarily driven
by decreases in average interest checking deposits and average foreign deposits which decreased $487 million and $317 million, respectively, from the year ended December 31, 2015.

Net income was $718 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to net income of $884 million for the year ended
December 31, 2014. The decrease in net income was the result of increases in the provision for loan and leases losses and noninterest expense coupled with a decrease in noninterest income.

Net interest income decreased $2 million from the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily driven by a decline in yields
of 19 bps on average commercial loans and leases and increases in FTP charges on loans and leases driven by an increase in average balances. These decreases for the year ended December 31, 2015 were partially offset by increases in FTP credits
on core deposits driven by increases in average balances.

Provision for loan and lease losses increased $157 million
from the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily due to an increase in criticized commercial loans. The increase also included a $102 million charge-off during the third quarter of 2015 associated with the restructuring of a student loan backed
commercial credit originated in 2007. The year ended December 31, 2014 included net charge-offs related to certain impaired commercial and industrial loans in the first and third quarters of 2014. Net charge-offs as a percent of average
portfolio loans and leases decreased to 45 bps for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 46 bps for the year ended December 31, 2014.

Noninterest income decreased $27 million from the year ended December 31, 2014 due primarily to a decrease in corporate
banking revenue partially offset by an increase in other noninterest income. Corporate banking revenue decreased $51 million from the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily driven by decreases in syndication fees and lease remarketing fees. The
decrease in syndication fees was the result of decreased activity in the market and the Bancorp’s reduced leveraged loan appetite. The decrease in lease remarketing fees included the impact of impairment charges of $36 million related to
certain operating lease equipment that was recognized during the year ended December 31, 2015. Refer to Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. The decrease in corporate banking revenue for the year
ended December 31, 2015 was partially offset by higher institutional sales revenue. Other noninterest income

increased $20 million from the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily driven by increases in gains on loan sales.

Noninterest expense increased $88 million from the year ended December 31, 2014 driven by an increase in other
noninterest expense. The increase in other noninterest expense was primarily driven by increases in corporate overhead allocations, operating lease expense and impairment on affordable housing investments.

Average commercial loans increased $2.3 billion from the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily due to increases in
average commercial and industrial loans and average commercial construction loans partially offset by a decrease in average commercial mortgage loans. Average commercial and industrial loans and average commercial construction loans increased $1.4
billion and $1.2 billion, respectively, from the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily as a result of an increase in new loan origination activity resulting from an increase in demand and targeted marketing efforts. Average commercial mortgage
loans decreased $552 million from the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily due to a decline in new loan origination activity driven by increased competition and an increase in paydowns.

Average core deposits increased $3.2 billion from the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase was the result of
growth in average demand deposits, average interest checking deposits and average savings and money market deposits which increased $2.3 billion, $1.1 billion and $860 million, respectively, from the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase
was partially offset by a decrease in average foreign deposits of $1.0 billion from the year ended December 31, 2014.

Net interest income increased $114 million from the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily driven by an increase in the
benefits from FTP credits on core deposits partially offset by a decrease in interest income on residential mortgage loans, home equity loans, credit card loans and other consumer loans driven by a decline in average balances. Additionally, net
interest income was negatively impacted by an increase in FTP charge rates on loans and leases.

$17 million from the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily due to the impact of renegotiated service contracts. Net occupancy and equipment expense decreased $14 million from the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily due to a decrease in
rent expense driven by a reduction in the number of full-service banking centers and ATM locations.

Average consumer
loans decreased $802 million from the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily driven by a decrease in average home equity loans and average residential mortgage loans of $488 million and $262 million, respectively, as payoffs exceeded new loan
production. Average commercial loans decreased $151 million from the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily due to a decrease in average commercial mortgage loans and average commercial and industrial loans of $100 million and $46 million,
respectively, as payoffs exceeded new loan production.

December 31, 2015 primarily driven by growth in average savings and money market deposits of $632 million, growth in average demand deposits of $617 million and growth in average interest checking deposits of $531 million. The growth in average
savings and money market deposits, average demand deposits and average interest checking deposits was driven by an increase in average balances per customer account and acquisition of new customers.

fraud prevention related expenses. Personnel costs decreased $15 million from the year ended December 31, 2014 driven by a decrease in employee benefits expense due to changes in the Bancorp’s employee benefit plan implemented in 2015 as
well as a decrease in base compensation due to a decline in the number of full-time equivalent employees.

included an $87 million charge-off related to the transfer of

certain residential mortgage loans from the portfolio to held for sale in the fourth quarter of 2014. The decrease was also due to improved delinquency metrics on residential mortgage loans and

Net interest income increased $40 million from the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily due to an increase in FTP
credit rates on core deposits and an increase in interest income on loans and leases driven by an increase in average balances on average residential mortgage loans and average other consumer loans and leases as well as higher yields on average
commercial and industrial loans and average other consumer loans and leases. This increase was partially offset by an increase in FTP charges on loans and leases driven by an increase in average balances.

Provision for loan and leases losses decreased $2 million from the year ended December 31, 2015.

Noninterest income decreased $19 million from the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily due to a $15 million decrease

Noninterest expense decreased $33 million from the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily driven by a $31 million
decrease in other noninterest expense primarily due to a decrease in corporate overhead allocations partially offset by an increase in operational losses.

average residential mortgage loans and average other consumer loans driven by increases in new loan origination activity.

Average core deposits decreased $803 million from the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily due to a decline in average
interest checking balances partially offset by an increase in average savings and money market deposits.

Comparison of the year ended 2015 with 2014

Net income was $58 million for both the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.

Net interest income increased $7 million from the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily due to increases in interest
income on loans and leases and FTP credits on demand deposits both due to increases in average balances as well as an increase in FTP credits on

interest checking deposits due to an increase in FTP credit rates. These increases were partially offset by increases in FTP charges on loans and leases driven by increases in average balances.

Provision for loan and leases losses increased $2 million from the year ended December 31, 2015.

Noninterest income increased $8 million from the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily due to a $9 million increase in

Comparison of the year ended 2016 with 2015

Net interest income decreased $260 million from the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily driven by an increase in FTP credits on
deposits allocated to business segments primarily due to an increase in FTP credit rates as well as an increase in interest expense on long-term debt. This decrease in net interest income was partially offset by an increase in interest income on
taxable securities and an increase in the benefit related to the FTP charges on loans and leases. The provision for loan and leases losses was $84 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to a benefit of $100 million for the year
ended December 31, 2015 primarily due to decreases in the allocation of provision expense to the business segments.

56  Fifth Third Bancorp


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Noninterest income decreased $359 million from December 31, 2015. The
decrease included the impact of a gain of $331 million on the sale of Vantiv, Inc. shares and a gain of $89 million on both the sale and exercise of a portion of the warrant associated with Vantiv Holding, LLC, both of which were recognized in the
fourth quarter of 2015. In 2016, the Bancorp recognized a gain of $9 million on the exercise of the remaining warrant with Vantiv Holding, LLC. The decrease was also due to the negative valuation adjustment related to the Visa total return swap of
$56 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared with $37 million for the prior year. In addition, the positive valuation adjustments on the stock warrant associated with Vantiv Holding, LLC were $64 million for the year ended
December 31, 2016 compared to the positive valuation adjustments of $236 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in noninterest income was partially offset by a $280 million gain recognized during the third quarter of
2016 from the termination and settlement of gross cash flows from existing Vantiv, Inc. TRAs and the expected obligation to terminate and settle the remaining Vantiv, Inc. TRA cash flows upon the exercise of put or call options compared with a $49
million gain recognized by the Bancorp in 2015 for the payment from Vantiv, Inc. to terminate a portion of the Vantiv, Inc. TRA. Noninterest income for the year ended December 31, 2016 also included a gain of $11 million on the sale-leaseback
of an office complex during the third quarter of 2016 and a gain of $33 million associated with the annual TRA payment during the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to a $31 million gain during the prior year. Additionally, equity method earnings from
the Bancorp’s interest in Vantiv Holding, LLC increased $3 million from December 31, 2015.

Noninterest
expense was $90 million and $62 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase was primarily due to increases in personnel costs and the provision for the reserve for unfunded commitments partially offset by
an increase in corporate overhead allocations from General Corporate and Other to the other business segments.

Comparison of the year ended 2015 with

Net interest income decreased $24 million from the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily due to increases in FTP credits
on deposits allocated to business segments driven by increases in average deposits. The remaining decrease in net interest income was due to an increase in interest expense on long-term debt and a

decrease in the benefit related to the FTP charges on loans and leases partially offset by an increase in interest income on taxable securities. The provision for loan and leases losses was a
benefit of $100 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to a benefit of $154 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 due to decreases in the allocation of provision expense to the business segments and reductions in the
ALLL.

Noninterest income was $822 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $253 million for the
year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in noninterest income included the impact of a gain of $331 million on the sale of Vantiv, Inc. shares in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to a gain of $125 million in 2014. The positive valuation
adjustments on the stock warrant associated with Vantiv Holding, LLC were $236 million and $31 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. During the fourth quarter of 2015, the Bancorp recognized a gain of $89 million
on both the sale and exercise of a portion of the warrant associated with Vantiv Holding, LLC. Additionally, the Bancorp recognized a gain of $49 million from the payment from Vantiv, Inc. to terminate a portion of a TRA and also recognized a gain
of $31 million associated with the annual TRA payment during the fourth quarter of 2015. The Bancorp recognized a gain of $23 million associated with the TRA during the fourth quarter of 2014. Equity method earnings from the Bancorp’s interest
in Vantiv Holding, LLC increased $15 million from the year ended December 31, 2014. Noninterest income also included $37 million in negative valuation adjustments related to the Visa total return swap for the year ended December 31, 2015
compared to $38 million for the year ended December 31, 2014.

Noninterest expense for the year ended
December 31, 2015 was an expense of $62 million compared to a benefit of $14 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase was primarily due to an increase in personnel costs and an increase in the provision for the reserve
for unfunded commitments as well as increases in FDIC insurance and other taxes, donations expense, technology and communications expense and marketing expense. The increase was partially offset by decreased litigation and regulatory activity and
increased corporate overhead allocations from General Corporate and Other to the other business segments.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

FOURTH QUARTER REVIEW

The Bancorp’s 2016 fourth quarter net income available to common shareholders was $372
million, or $0.49 per diluted share, compared to net income available to common shareholders of $501 million, or $0.65 per diluted share, for the third quarter of 2016 and net income available to common shareholders of $634 million, or $0.79 per
diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2015.

Net interest income on an FTE basis was $909 million during the fourth
quarter of 2016 and decreased $4 million from the third quarter of 2016 and increased $5 million from the fourth quarter of 2015. The decrease from the third quarter of 2016 was primarily driven by the impact of refunds to be offered to certain
bankcard customers during the fourth quarter of 2016, partially offset by increased short-term market rates and higher investment securities balances. The increase in net interest income in comparison to the fourth quarter of 2015 was driven by
higher investment securities balances and increased short-term market rates, partially offset by the aforementioned bankcard refunds.

Fourth quarter 2016 noninterest income of $620 million decreased $220 million compared to the third quarter of 2016 and
decreased $484 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. The decrease from the third quarter of 2016 was primarily due to a decrease in other noninterest income and corporate banking revenue. The year-over-year decrease was primarily the
result of decreases in other noninterest income and mortgage banking net revenue.

Service charges on deposits of $141
million decreased $2 million from the previous quarter and decreased $3 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. The decrease from the third quarter of 2016 was primarily due to a decreases in commercial service charges and retail service
charges. The decrease from the fourth quarter of 2015 was driven by a decrease in retail service charges due to lower consumer checking fees.

Corporate banking revenue of $101 million decreased $10 million compared to the previous quarter and decreased $3 million
from the fourth quarter of 2015. The decrease compared to the third quarter was driven by decreases in institutional sales revenue and lease remarketing fees, partially offset by an increase in foreign exchange fees. The year-over-year decrease was
driven by lower lease remarketing fees and letter of credit fees, partially offset by higher foreign exchange fees and institutional sales revenue.

Mortgage banking net revenue was $65 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to $66
million in the third quarter of 2016 and $74 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. The decrease in mortgage banking net revenue compared to the third quarter of 2016 was driven by lower production gains, partially offset by positive valuation
adjustments. The decrease from the prior year was due to lower margins during the fourth quarter of 2016. Fourth quarter 2016 originations were $2.7 billion, compared with $2.9 billion in the previous quarter and $1.8 billion in the fourth quarter
of 2015. Fourth quarter 2016 originations resulted in gains of $30 million on mortgages sold, compared with gains of $61 million during the previous quarter and $37 million during the fourth quarter of 2015. Gross mortgage servicing fees were $48
million in the fourth quarter of 2016, $49 million in the third quarter of 2016 and $53 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. Mortgage banking net revenue is also affected by net servicing asset valuation adjustments, which include MSR amortization
and MSR valuation adjustments, including mark-to-market adjustments on free-standing derivatives used to economically hedge the MSR portfolio. MSR amortization was $35 million during both the fourth and third quarters of 2016, compared to $29
million during the fourth quarter of 2015. Net servicing asset valuation adjustments were positive $23 million and negative $9 million in the fourth and third quarters of 2016, respectively, and positive $13 million in the fourth quarter of 2015.

Wealth and asset management revenue of $100 million decreased $1 million from
the previous quarter and decreased $2 million from the fourth quarter of 2015. The decline from the third quarter of 2016 was due to a decrease in private client service fees. The year-over-year decrease was due to a decrease in securities and
brokerage fees.

Card and processing revenue of $79 million was flat compared to the third quarter of 2016 and increased
$2 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. The increase from the prior year was driven by an increase in the number of actively used cards and an increase in customer spend volume.

Other noninterest income of $137 million decreased $199 million compared to the third quarter of 2016 and decreased $465
million from the fourth quarter of 2015. Fourth quarter of 2016 results included a gain of $9 million on the exercise of the remaining warrant in Vantiv Holding, LLC and a $33 million gain pursuant to Fifth Third’s TRA with Vantiv, Inc. Third
quarter of 2016 results included a $280 million gain from the termination and settlement of certain gross cash flows from the existing Vantiv, Inc. TRA and the expected obligation to terminate and settle certain remaining Vantiv, Inc. TRA cash flows
upon the exercise of put or call options and a gain of $11 million on the sale-leaseback of an office complex, partially offset by $28 million in losses on disposition and impairment of bank premises and equipment and the recognition of $9 million
of OTTI on certain private equity investments. Fourth quarter 2015 results included a $331 million gain on the sale of Vantiv, Inc. shares, an $89 million gain on both the sale and exercise of a portion of the warrant associated with Vantiv,
Holding, LLC, a $49 million gain from a payment received from Vantiv, Inc. to terminate a portion of the TRA and a $31 million gain pursuant to Fifth Third’s TRA with Vantiv, Inc. Fourth quarter of 2015 also included a positive warrant
valuation adjustment of $21 million compared to a negative warrant valuation adjustment of $2 million during the third quarter of 2016. Quarterly results also included valuation adjustments on the Visa total return swap which was a benefit of $6
million in the fourth quarter of 2016 and a charge of $12 million and $10 million in the third quarter of 2016 and the fourth quarter of 2015, respectively.

The net losses on investment securities were $3 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to net gains of $4 million in
the third quarter of 2016 and $1 million in the fourth quarter of 2015.

Noninterest expense of $960 million decreased
$13 million from the previous quarter and decreased $3 million from the fourth quarter of 2015. The decrease in noninterest expense compared to the third quarter of 2016 was driven by lower technology and communications expense and seasonally lower
marketing expense. The decrease in noninterest expense from the fourth quarter of 2015 was primarily due to lower card and processing expense due to the impact of renegotiated service contracts and lower net occupancy expense due to a decrease in
rent expense driven by a reduction in the number of full-service banking centers and ATM locations, partially offset by higher personnel costs.

The ALLL as a percentage of portfolio loans and leases was 1.36% as of December 31, 2016,
compared to 1.37% as of both September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. The provision for loan and lease losses was $54 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to $80 million in the third quarter of 2016 and $91 million in the fourth
quarter of 2015. Net charge-offs were $73 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, or 31 bps of average portfolio loans and leases on an annualized basis, compared with net charge-offs of $107 million in the third quarter of 2016 and $80 million in
the fourth quarter of 2015.

COMPARISON OF THE YEAR ENDED 2015 WITH 2014

The Bancorp’s net income available to common shareholders for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $1.6 billion, or $2.01 per
diluted share, which was net of $75 million in preferred stock dividends. The Bancorp’s net income available to common shareholders for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $1.4 billion, or $1.66 per diluted share, which was net of $67
million in preferred stock dividends. The provision for loan and lease losses increased to $396 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $315 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 as the result of the
restructuring of a student loan backed commercial credit originated in 2007, a broadening global economic slowdown, stress on capital markets and the prolonged softness in commodity prices. Net charge-offs as a percent of average portfolio loans and
leases decreased to 0.48% during 2014 compared to 0.64% during the year ended December 31, 2014.

Net interest
income on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) was $3.6 billion for both of the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. For the year ended December 31, 2015, net interest income was negatively impacted by a decrease in the net interest rate spread,
changes made to the Bancorp’s deposit advance product beginning January 1, 2015 and an increase in average long-term debt of $1.8 billion compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. These negative impacts were partially offset by
increases in average taxable securities and average loans and leases of $5.2 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014.

Noninterest income increased $530 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended
December 31, 2014 primarily due to increases in other noninterest income and mortgage banking net revenue, partially offset by a decrease in corporate banking revenue. Other noninterest income increased $529 million compared to the year ended
December 31, 2014. The increase included the impact of a gain of $331 million on the sale of Vantiv, Inc. shares in the fourth quarter of 2015, compared to a gain of $125 million during the second quarter of 2014. Other noninterest income also
increased for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014 due to positive valuation adjustments on the stock warrant associated with Vantiv Holding, LLC of $236 million during 2015 compared to positive valuation adjustments of $31 million
during 2014. During the fourth quarter

of 2015, the Bancorp recognized a gain of $89 million on both the sale and exercise of a portion of the warrant associated with Vantiv Holding, LLC. Additionally, the Bancorp recognized a gain of
$49 million from the payment from Vantiv, Inc. to terminate a portion of the TRA and also recognized a gain of $31 million associated with the annual TRA payment during the fourth quarter of 2015. The Bancorp recognized a gain of $23 million
associated with the TRA during the fourth quarter of 2014. Mortgage banking net revenue increased $38 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to increases in net mortgage servicing revenue and origination
fees and gains on loan sales. Corporate banking revenue decreased $46 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily driven by decreases in syndication fees and lease remarketing fees.

Noninterest expense increased $66 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to
increases in total personnel costs, technology and communications expense and card and processing expense partially offset by a decrease in other noninterest expense. Personnel costs increased $65 million for the year ended December 31, 2015
compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 driven by higher executive retirement and severance costs as well as an increase in base compensation and an increase in incentive compensation, primarily in the mortgage business. Technology and
communications expense increased $12 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 driven primarily by increased investment in information technology associated with regulatory and compliance
initiatives, system maintenance, and other growth initiatives. Card and processing expense increased $12 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 driven primarily by increased fraud
prevention related expenses. Other noninterest expense decreased $34 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily due to a decrease in losses and adjustments partially offset by
increases in the provision for the reserve for unfunded commitments, marketing expense, donations expense, impairment on affordable housing investments, FDIC insurance and other taxes and operating lease expense.

Loans and leases, including loans held for sale, decreased $636 million, or 1%, from
December 31, 2015. The decrease from December 31, 2015 was the result of a $943 million, or 3%, decrease in consumer loans and leases, partially offset by a $307 million, or 1%, increase in commercial loans and leases.

Consumer loans and leases decreased from December 31, 2015 primarily due to decreases in automobile loans, home equity
and credit card, partially offset by an increase in residential mortgage loans. Automobile loans decreased $1.5 billion, or 13%, from December 31, 2015 and home equity decreased $641 million, or 8%, from December 31, 2015 as payoffs
exceeded new loan production. Credit card decreased $123 million, or 5%, from December 31, 2015 primarily due to the sale of the agent bankcard loan portfolio during the second quarter of 2016 and a decrease in the average balance per active
customer. Residential mortgage loans increased $1.3 billion, or 9%, from December 31, 2015 primarily due to the continued retention of certain agency conforming ARMs and certain other fixed-rate loans originated during the year ended
December 31, 2016.

Commercial loans and leases increased from December 31, 2015 primarily
due to increases in commercial construction loans and commercial leases, partially offset by decreases in commercial and industrial loans and commercial mortgage loans. Commercial construction loans increased $689 million, or 21%, from
December 31, 2015 primarily as a result of increased demand and draw levels continuing to outpace attrition. Commercial leases increased $120 million, or 3%, from December 31, 2015 primarily as a result of an increase in syndication and
participation origination activity. Commercial and industrial loans decreased $415 million, or 1%, from December 31, 2015 primarily as a result of a decline in new origination activity due to increased competition and an increase in attrition
from deliberate credit exits in the second half of the year. Commercial mortgage loans decreased $87 million, or 1%, from December 31, 2015 primarily due to a decline in new loan origination activity driven by increased competition and an
increase in paydowns.

60  Fifth Third Bancorp


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Average commercial loans and leases increased from December 31, 2015
primarily due to increases in average commercial construction loans, average commercial and industrial loans and average commercial leases, partially offset by a decrease in average commercial mortgage loans. Average commercial construction loans
increased $931 million, or 34%, from December 31, 2015 primarily as a result of increased demand and draw levels continuing to outpace attrition. Average commercial and industrial loans increased $590 million, or 1%, from December 31, 2015
primarily as a result of an increase in new origination activity resulting from an increase in demand and line utilization in the first half of the year. Average commercial leases increased $120 million, or 3%, from December 31, 2015 primarily
as a result of an increase in syndication and participation origination activity. Average commercial mortgage loans decreased $222 million, or 3%, from December 31, 2015 primarily due to a decline in new loan origination activity driven by
increased competition and an increase in paydowns.

Average consumer loans and leases decreased from December 31, 2015
primarily due to decreases in average automobile loans, average home equity and average credit card, partially offset by an increase in average residential mortgage loans. Average automobile loans decreased $1.1 billion, or 10%, from
December 31, 2015 and average home equity decreased $594 million, or 7%, from December 31, 2015 as payoffs exceeded new loan production. Average credit card decreased $98 million, or 4%, primarily due to the sale of the agent bankcard loan
portfolio during the second quarter of 2016 and a decrease in average balance per active customer. Average residential mortgage loans increased $1.3 billion, or 9%, from December 31, 2015 primarily driven by the continued retention of certain
agency conforming ARMs and certain other fixed-rate loans.

Investment Securities

The Bancorp uses investment securities as a means of managing interest rate risk, providing liquidity support and providing collateral for
pledging purposes. Total investment securities were $31.6 billion and $29.5 billion at December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. The taxable investment securities portfolio had an effective duration of 4.9 years at December 31, 2016
compared to 5.1 years at December 31, 2015.

Securities are classified as available-for-sale when, in management’s
judgment, they may be sold in response to, or in anticipation of, changes in market conditions. Securities that management has the intent and ability to hold to maturity
are

classified as held-to-maturity and reported at amortized cost. Securities are classified as trading when bought and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term. At
December 31, 2016, the Bancorp’s investment portfolio consisted primarily of AAA-rated available-for-sale securities. Securities classified as below investment grade were immaterial at both December 31, 2016 and 2015. The
Bancorp’s management has evaluated the securities in an unrealized loss position in the available-for-sale and held-to-maturity portfolios for OTTI. Refer to Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the Bancorp’s
methodology for both classifying investment securities and management’s evaluation of securities in an unrealized loss position for OTTI.

(b)

Equity securities consist of FHLB, FRB and DTCC restricted stock holdings that are carried at cost, FHLMC
and FNMA preferred stock holdings and certain mutual fund holdings and equity security holdings.

On an amortized cost basis, available-for-sale and other securities increased $2.3 billion, or
8%, from December 31, 2015 primarily due to increases in agency residential and agency commercial mortgage-backed securities and asset-backed securities and other debt securities, partially offset by a decrease in U.S. Treasury and federal
agencies securities.

On an amortized cost basis, available-for-sale and other securities were 24% and 23% of total
interest-earning assets at December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. The estimated weighted-average life of the debt securities in the available-for-sale and other securities portfolio was 6.7 years at December 31, 2016
compared to 6.4 years at December 31, 2015. In addition, at both December 31, 2016 and 2015 the available-for-sale and other securities portfolio had a weighted-average yield of 3.19%.

Information presented in Table 29 is on a weighted-average life basis,
anticipating future prepayments. Yield information is presented on an FTE basis and is computed using amortized cost balances. Maturity and yield calculations for the total available-for-sale and other securities portfolio exclude equity securities
that have no stated yield or maturity. Total net unrealized gains on the available-for-sale and other securities portfolio were $159 million at December 31, 2016 compared to $366 million at December 31, 2015. The decrease from
December 31, 2015 was primarily due to an increase in interest rates during the year ended December 31, 2016. The fair value of investment securities is impacted by interest rates, credit spreads, market volatility and liquidity
conditions. The fair value of investment securities generally increases when interest rates decrease or when credit spreads contract.

The Bancorp’s deposit balances represent an important source of funding and revenue growth opportunity. The Bancorp continues to focus on
core deposit growth in its retail and commercial franchises

by improving customer satisfaction, building full relationships and offering competitive rates. Core deposits represented 71% of the Bancorp’s average asset funding base for both of the
years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.

of $983 million in transaction deposits.

Transaction deposits increased from December 31, 2015 primarily due to an increase in money market deposits, partially offset by decreases in savings deposits and demand deposits.

63  Fifth
Third Bancorp


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Money market deposits increased $2.3 billion, or 12%, from December 31, 2015 primarily due
to competitive pricing related to a promotional product offering during 2016 which drove customer acquisition and balance migration from savings deposits from December 31, 2015. Savings deposits decreased $660 million, or 5%, from
December 31, 2015. Demand deposits decreased $485 million, or 1%, from December 31, 2015 primarily due to lower balances per customer account. Interest checking deposits included a decrease due to lower balances per account for commercial
customers, partially offset by the benefit from a shift from the excess cash in trust accounts managed by Fifth Third to interest checking deposit accounts as a result of the recent enactment of

new money market reform. The increase in core deposits from December 31, 2015 included the impact of the sale of $511 million of deposits as part of the branches sold in the St. Louis MSA
and Pittsburgh MSA during 2016.

Certificates $100,000 and over decreased $214 million, or 8%, from December 31,
2015 primarily due to the maturity and run-off of retail and institutional certificates of deposit since December 31, 2015.

On an average basis, core deposits increased $86 million from December 31, 2015 primarily
due to an increase of $127 million in average transaction deposits. The increase in average transaction deposits was driven by increases in average money market deposits and average demand deposits, partially offset by decreases in average interest
checking deposits, average savings deposits and average foreign office deposits. Average money market deposits increased $1.4 billion, or 8%, primarily due to competitive pricing related to a promotional product offering during 2016 which drove
customer acquisition and balance migration from average savings deposits. Average savings deposits decreased $605 million, or 4%, compared to December 31, 2015. Average demand deposits increased $698 million, or 2%, from December 31, 2015
due to higher average customer balances per commercial customer account. Average

interest checking deposits and average foreign office deposits decreased $1.0 billion, or 4%, and $320 million, or 39%, respectively, from December 31, 2015 primarily due to a decrease in
average commercial customer balances per account. The increase in average core deposits from December 31, 2015 included the sale of deposits as part of the St. Louis MSA and Pittsburgh MSA during 2016, which impacted average core deposits by
approximately $200 million. Average other deposits increased $276 million from December 31, 2015 primarily due to an increase in Eurodollar trade deposits. Average certificates $100,000 and over decreased $134 million, or 5%, from
December 31, 2015 due primarily to the maturity and run-off of retail and institutional certificates of deposit since December 31, 2015.

Borrowings

The Bancorp accesses a variety of other short-term and long-term funding sources. Borrowings with original maturities of one year or less are
classified as short-term and include federal funds purchased and other short-term borrowings. Table 34 summarizes

the end of period components of total borrowings. Total borrowings as a percentage of average interest-bearing liabilities were 21% at both December 31, 2016 and 2015.

Consolidated Financial Statements.

Total borrowings increased $587 million, or 3%, from December 31, 2015 primarily due to an
increase in other short-term borrowings partially offset by a decrease in long-term debt. Other short-term borrowings increased $2.0 billion, from December 31, 2015 driven by an increase of $2.5 billion in FHLB short-term borrowings partially
offset by a $264 million decrease in securities sold under repurchase agreements. The level of other short-term borrowings can fluctuate significantly from period to period depending on funding needs and which sources are used to satisfy those
needs. For further information on the components of other short-term borrowings, refer to Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Long-term debt decreased

$1.4 billion, or 9%, from December 31, 2015 primarily driven by the maturity of $3.5 billion of unsecured senior bank notes, the maturity of $250 million of unsecured subordinated bank notes
and $1.4 billion of pay downs on long-term debt associated with automobile loan securitizations. The decrease was partially offset by debt issuances during the year ended December 31, 2016 of $2.8 billion of unsecured senior fixed-rate bank
notes, $750 million of unsecured subordinated fixed-rate bank notes, and $250 million of unsecured senior floating-rate bank notes. For additional information regarding automobile securitizations and long-term debt, refer to Note 11 and Note 16,

to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Total average borrowings increased $1.5 billion, or 8%, compared to December 31, 2015, due
to increases in average long-term debt and average other short-term borrowings partially offset by a decrease in average federal funds purchased. The increase in average long-term debt of $750 million, or 5%, was driven primarily by the issuances of
certain long-term debt as discussed above in the second and third quarter of 2016, partially offset by certain maturities, as previously mentioned, in the fourth quarter of 2016. The level of average federal funds purchased and average other
short-term borrowings can fluctuate significantly from period to period depending on funding needs and which sources

are used to satisfy those needs. The increase in average other short-term borrowings, compared to December 31, 2015, of $1.1 billion was primarily due to an increase in FHLB short-term
advances. Information on the average rates paid on borrowings is presented in the Net Interest Income subsection of the Statements of Income Analysis section of MD&A. In addition, refer to the Liquidity Risk Management subsection of the Risk

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

RISK MANAGEMENT - OVERVIEW

Managing risk is an essential component of successfully operating a financial services company.
The Bancorp’s risk management approach includes processes for identifying, assessing, managing, monitoring and reporting risks. The ERM division, led by the Bancorp’s Chief Risk Officer, ensures the consistency and adequacy of the
Bancorp’s risk management approach within the structure of the Bancorp’s operating model. Management within the lines of business and support functions assess and manage risks associated with their activities and determine if actions need
to be taken to strengthen risk management or reduce risk given their risk profile. They are responsible for considering risk when making business decisions and for integrating risk management into business processes. In addition, the Internal Audit
division provides an independent assessment of the Bancorp’s internal control structure and related systems and processes.

The assumption of risk requires robust and active risk management practices that comprise an integrated and comprehensive
set of activities, measures and strategies that apply to the entire organization. The Bancorp has established a Risk Appetite Framework, approved by the Board, that provides the foundations of corporate risk capacity, risk appetite and risk
tolerances. The Bancorp’s risk capacity is represented by its available financial resources. Risk capacity sets an absolute limit on risk-assumption in the Bancorp’s annual and strategic plans. The Bancorp understands that not all
financial resources may persist as viable loss buffers over time. Further, consideration must be given to regulatory capital buffers required per Capital Policy Targets that would reduce risk capacity. Those factors take the form of capacity
adjustments to arrive at an Operating Risk Capacity which represents the operating risk level the Bancorp can assume while maintaining its solvency standard. The Bancorp’s policy currently discounts its Operating Risk Capacity by a minimum of
5% to provide a buffer; as a result, the Bancorp’s risk appetite is limited by policy to, at most, 95% of its Operating Risk Capacity.

Economic capital is the amount of unencumbered financial resources required to support the Bancorp’s risks. The Bancorp
measures economic capital under the assumption that it expects to maintain debt ratings at strong investment grade levels over time. The Bancorp’s capital policies require that the Operating Risk Capacity less the aforementioned buffer exceed
the calculated economic capital required in its business.

Risk appetite is the aggregate
amount of risk the Bancorp is willing to accept in pursuit of its strategic and financial objectives. By establishing boundaries around risk taking and business decisions, and by incorporating the expectations and goals of its shareholders,
regulators, rating agencies and customers, the Bancorp’s risk appetite is aligned with its priorities and goals. Risk tolerance is the maximum amount of risk applicable to each of the eight specific risk categories included in its Enterprise
Risk Management Framework. This is expressed primarily in qualitative terms; however certain risk types also have quantitative metrics that are used to measure the Bancorp’s level of risk against its risk tolerances. The Bancorp’s risk
appetite and risk tolerances are supported by risk limits and key risk indicator thresholds. Those limits and thresholds are used to monitor the amount of risk assumed at a granular level. On a quarterly basis, the Risk and Compliance Committee of
the Board reviews current assessments of each of the eight risk types relative to the established tolerance. Information supporting these assessments, including policy limits, key risk indicators and qualitative factors, is also reported to the Risk
and Compliance Committee of the Board. Any results outside of tolerance require the development of an action plan that describes actions to be taken to return the measure to within the tolerance.

The risks faced by the Bancorp include, but are not limited to, credit,
market, liquidity, operational, regulatory compliance, legal, reputational and strategic. Each of these risks is managed through the Bancorp’s risk program which includes the following key functions:

•

ERM is responsible for developing and overseeing the implementation of risk programs and reporting that
facilitate a broad integrated view of risk. The department also leads the continual fostering of a strong risk management culture and the framework, policies and committees that support effective risk governance;

•

Credit Risk Management is responsible for overseeing the safety and soundness of the commercial and consumer
loan portfolio within an independent portfolio management framework that supports the Bancorp’s loan growth strategies and underwriting practices, ensuring portfolio optimization and appropriate risk controls. Treasury is responsible for the
economic capital program. Credit Risk Management is responsible for the quantitative analytics to support the consumer and commercial portfolio and risk rating models, ALLL methodology and analytics needed to assess credit risk and develop
mitigation strategies related to that risk. Credit Risk Management also provides oversight, reporting and monitoring of commercial and consumer underwriting and credit administration processes;

•

Operational Risk Management works with lines of business and regional management to maintain processes to
monitor and manage all aspects of operational risk, including vendors and information security to ensure consistency in application of operational risk programs;

•

Bank Protection oversees and manages fraud prevention and detection and provides investigative and recovery
services for the Bancorp;

•

Capital Markets Risk Management is responsible for instituting, monitoring, and reporting appropriate trading
limits within the Capital Markets groups and monitoring liquidity, interest rate risk and risk tolerances resulting from management of Fifth Third’s overall balance sheet;

•

Compliance Risk Management provides independent oversight to ensure that an enterprise-wide framework,
including processes and procedures, are in place to comply with applicable laws, regulations, rules and other regulatory requirements; internal policies and procedures; and principles of integrity and fair dealing applicable to the Bancorp’s
activities and functions. The Bancorp focuses on managing regulatory compliance risk in accordance with the Bancorp’s integrated risk management framework, which ensures consistent processes for identifying, assessing, managing, monitoring and
reporting risks; and

•

The ERM division creates and maintains other functions, committees or processes as are necessary to
effectively oversee risk management throughout the Bancorp.

Risk
management oversight and governance is provided by the Risk and Compliance Committee of the Board of Directors and through multiple management committees whose membership includes a broad cross-section of line-of-business, regional market and
support representatives. The Risk and Compliance Committee of the Board of Directors consists of six outside directors and has the responsibility for the oversight of risk management for the Bancorp, as well as for the Bancorp’s overall
aggregate risk profile. The Risk and Compliance Committee of the Board of Directors has approved the formation of key management governance committees that are responsible for evaluating risks and controls.

66  Fifth Third Bancorp


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The primary committee responsible for the oversight of risk management is the ERMC. Committees accountable to the ERMC, which support the core risk programs, are the Corporate Credit Committee,
the Operational Risk Committee, the Management Compliance Committee, the Asset/Liability Committee and the Enterprise Marketing Committee. Other committees accountable to the ERMC oversee the ALLL, capital, model risk and regulatory change
management functions. There is also a risk assessment process applicable to every line of business to ensure an appropriate standard readiness assessment is performed before launching a new or changing product or initiative. Significant risk
policies approved by the management governance committees are also reviewed and approved by the Risk and Compliance Committee of the Board of Directors.

Credit Risk Review is an independent function responsible for evaluating the
sufficiency of underwriting, documentation and approval processes for consumer and commercial credits, the accuracy of risk grades assigned to commercial credit exposure, nonaccrual status, specific reserves and monitoring for charge-offs. Credit
Risk Review reports directly to the Risk and Compliance Committee of the Board of Directors and administratively to the Chief Auditor.

CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT

The objective of the Bancorp’s credit risk management strategy is to quantify and manage credit risk on an aggregate portfolio basis, as
well as to limit the risk of loss resulting from the failure of a borrower or counterparty to honor its financial or contractual obligations to the Bancorp. The Bancorp’s credit risk management strategy is based on three core principles:
conservatism, diversification and monitoring. The Bancorp believes that effective credit risk management begins with conservative lending practices. These practices include conservative exposure and counterparty limits and conservative underwriting,
documentation and collection standards. The Bancorp’s credit risk management strategy also emphasizes diversification on a geographic, industry and customer level as well as ongoing portfolio monitoring and timely management reviews of large
credit exposures and credits experiencing deterioration of credit quality. Credit officers with the authority to extend credit are delegated specific authority amounts, the utilization of which is closely monitored. Underwriting activities are
centrally managed, and ERM manages the policy and the authority

delegation process directly. The Credit Risk Review function provides independent and objective assessments of the quality of underwriting and documentation, the accuracy of risk grades and the
charge-off, nonaccrual and reserve analysis process. The Bancorp’s credit review process and overall assessment of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses is based on quarterly assessments of the probable estimated losses inherent in
the loan and lease portfolio. The Bancorp uses these assessments to promptly identify potential problem loans or leases within the portfolio, maintain an adequate ALLL and take any necessary charge-offs. The Bancorp defines potential problem loans
and leases as those rated substandard that do not meet the definition of a nonaccrual loan or a restructured loan. Refer to Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the Bancorp’s credit grade
categories, which are derived from standard regulatory rating definitions. In addition, stress testing is performed on various commercial portfolios using the CCAR model and for certain portfolios, such as Real Estate and Leveraged Lending, the
stress testing is performed at the individual loan level during credit underwriting.

The following tables

In addition to the individual review of larger commercial loans that exhibit probable or
observed credit weaknesses, the commercial credit review process includes the use of two risk grading systems. The risk grading system currently utilized for allowance for credit loss analysis purposes encompasses ten categories. The Bancorp also
maintains a dual risk rating system for credit approval and pricing, portfolio monitoring and capital allocation that includes a “through-the-cycle” rating philosophy for assessing a borrower’s creditworthiness. The dual

risk rating system includes thirteen probabilities of default grade categories and an additional eleven grade categories for estimating losses given an event of default. The probability of
default and loss given default evaluations are not separated in the ten-category risk rating system. The Bancorp has completed significant validation and testing of the dual risk rating system as a commercial credit risk management tool.

67  Fifth
Third Bancorp


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The Bancorp is assessing the necessary modifications to the dual risk rating system outputs to develop a U.S. GAAP compliant ALLL model and will evaluate the use of modified dual risk ratings for
purposes of determining the Bancorp’s ALLL as part of the Bancorp’s adoption of ASU 2016-13 “

Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments

,” which will be effective for the Bancorp on January 1, 2020. Scoring
systems, various analytical tools and portfolio performance monitoring are used to assess the credit risk in the Bancorp’s homogenous consumer and small business loan portfolios.

Overview

Economic growth
continues to improve as data has been broadly positive. There have been steady gains in the job market and real GDP is expected to expand at a moderate pace in 2017. Household spending continues to be the strongest driver of the U.S. economy.
Inflation continues to run below the FRB’s stated objective, but has increased over the past several months and could rise further if unemployment continues to fall. Improving global conditions are supporting U.S. manufacturing activity and
housing prices continue to increase across the country. With regard to commercial real estate, the credit market has become somewhat more selective even though market data and vacancies remain positive.

Commercial Portfolio

The
Bancorp’s credit risk management strategy seeks to minimize concentrations of risk through diversification. The Bancorp has commercial loan concentration limits based on industry, lines of business within the commercial segment, geography and
credit product type. The risk within the commercial loan and lease portfolio is managed and monitored through an underwriting process utilizing detailed origination policies, continuous loan level reviews, monitoring of industry concentration and
product type limits and continuous portfolio risk management reporting.

The Bancorp provides loans to a variety of
customers ranging from large multi-national firms to middle market businesses, sole

proprietors and high net worth individuals. The origination policies for commercial and industrial loans outline the risks and underwriting requirements for loans to businesses in various
industries. Included in the policies are maturity and amortization terms, collateral and leverage requirements, cash flow coverage measures and hold limits. The Bancorp aligns credit and sales teams with specific industry expertise to better monitor
and manage different industry segments of the portfolio.

The origination policies for commercial real estate outline
the risks and underwriting requirements for owner and nonowner-occupied and construction lending. Included in the policies are maturity and amortization terms, maximum LTVs, minimum debt service coverage ratios, construction loan monitoring
procedures, appraisal requirements, pre-leasing requirements (as applicable), sensitivity and pro-forma analysis requirements and interest rate sensitivity. The Bancorp requires a valuation of real estate collateral, which may include third-party
appraisals, be performed at the time of origination and renewal in accordance with regulatory requirements and on an as needed basis when market conditions justify. Although the Bancorp does not back test these collateral value assumptions, the
Bancorp maintains an appraisal review department to order and review third-party appraisals in accordance with regulatory requirements. Collateral values on criticized assets with relationships exceeding $1 million are reviewed quarterly to assess
the appropriateness of the value ascribed in the assessment of charge-offs and specific reserves.

The Bancorp assesses
all real estate and non-real estate collateral securing a loan and considers all cross-collateralized loans in the calculation of the LTV ratio. The following tables provide detail on the most recent LTV ratios for commercial mortgage loans greater
than $1 million, excluding impaired commercial mortgage loans individually evaluated. The Bancorp does not typically aggregate the LTV ratios for commercial mortgage loans less than $1 million.

The Bancorp’s non-power producing energy and nonowner-occupied commercial real estate
portfolios have been identified by the Bancorp as loans which it believes represent a higher level of risk compared to the rest of the Bancorp’s commercial loan portfolio due to economic or market conditions within the Bancorp’s key
lending areas.

Due to the sensitivity of the non-power producing energy portfolio to downward movements in oil prices,
the Bancorp saw a

migration into criticized classifications during 2015 through the second quarter of 2016. However, in the third and fourth quarters of 2016, this portfolio has stabilized with signs of
improvement. The reserve-based energy loans that the Bancorp holds are senior secured loans with a borrowing base that is re-determined on a semi-annual basis.

Consumer Portfolio

Consumer credit risk management utilizes a framework that encompasses consistent processes for identifying, assessing, managing,

monitoring, and reporting credit risk. These processes are supported by a credit risk governance structure that includes Board oversight, policies, risk limits, and risk committees.

The Bancorp’s consumer portfolio is materially comprised of four categories of loans: residential mortgage loans, home
equity loans, automobile loans and credit card.

70  Fifth Third Bancorp


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The Bancorp has identified certain categories within these four categories of loans which it
believes represent a higher level of risk compared to the rest of the consumer loan portfolio due to high loan amount to collateral value. The Bancorp does not update LTV ratios for the consumer portfolio subsequent to origination except as part of
the charge-off process for real estate secured loans. Among consumer portfolios, legacy underwritten residential mortgage and brokered home equity portfolios exhibited the most stress during the credit crisis. As of December 31, 2016, consumer
real estate loans, consisting of residential mortgage loans and home equity loans, originated from 2005 through 2008 represent approximately 17% of the consumer real estate portfolio. These loans accounted for 54% of total consumer real estate
secured losses for the year ended December 31, 2016. Current loss rates in the residential mortgage and home equity portfolios are below pre-crisis levels. In addition to the consumer real estate portfolio, credit risk management continues to
closely monitor the automobile portfolio performance. Increased competition in the marketplace has led to industry-wide loosening of underwriting guidelines. Fifth Third actively manages the automobile portfolio through concentration limits, which
mitigates credit risk through limiting the exposure to lower FICO scores, higher advance rates and extended term originations.

Residential mortgage portfolio

The Bancorp manages credit risk in the residential mortgage portfolio through conservative underwriting and documentation standards and
geographic and product diversification. The Bancorp may also package and sell loans in the portfolio.

The Bancorp does
not originate mortgage loans that permit customers to defer principal payments or make payments that are less than the accruing interest. The Bancorp originates both fixed-rate and ARM loans. Resets of rates on ARMs are not expected to have a
material impact on credit costs in the current interest rate environment, as approximately $758 million of ARM loans will have rate resets during the next twelve months. Of these resets, 98% are expected to experience an increase in rate, with an
average increase of approximately one half of a percent.

Certain residential mortgage products have contractual
features that may increase credit exposure to the Bancorp in the event of a decline in housing values. These types of mortgage products offered by the Bancorp include loans with high LTV ratios, multiple loans on the same collateral that when
combined result in a LTV greater than 80% and interest-only loans. The Bancorp has deemed residential mortgage loans with greater than 80% LTV ratios and no mortgage insurance as loans that represent a higher level of risk.

Portfolio residential mortgage loans from 2010 and later vintages represented 88% of the portfolio as of December 31,
2016 and had a weighted-average LTV of 71% and a weighted-average origination FICO of 759.

of the residential mortgage portfolio loans outstanding by LTV at origination:

Home equity portfolio

The Bancorp’s home equity portfolio is primarily comprised of home equity lines of credit. Beginning in the first quarter of 2013, the
Bancorp’s newly originated home equity lines of credit have a 10-year interest-only draw period followed by a 20-year amortization period. The home equity line of credit previously offered by the Bancorp was a revolving facility with a 20-year
term, minimum payments of interest-only and a balloon payment of principal at maturity. Peak maturity years for the balloon home equity lines of credit are 2025 to 2028 and approximately 26% of the balances mature before 2025.

The aging of 2008 and prior vintages of home equity loans has contributed to declining losses over the past twelve months.
These vintages represented 68% of the balances at December 31, 2016 and 95% of the losses during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to 73% of the balances at December 31, 2015 and 97% of the losses during the year ended
December 31, 2015.

The ALLL provides coverage for probable and estimable losses in the home equity portfolio. The
allowance attributable to the portion of the home equity portfolio that has not been restructured in a TDR is calculated on a pooled basis with senior lien and junior lien categories segmented in the determination of the probable credit losses in
the home equity portfolio. The modeled loss factor for the home equity portfolio is based on the trailing twelve month historical loss rate for each category, as adjusted for certain prescriptive loss rate factors and certain qualitative adjustment
factors to reflect risks associated with current conditions and trends. The prescriptive loss rate factors include adjustments for delinquency trends, LTV trends and refreshed FICO score trends. The qualitative factors include adjustments for
changes in policies or procedures in underwriting, monitoring or collections, economic conditions, portfolio mix, lending and risk management personnel, results of internal audit and quality control reviews, collateral values and geographic
concentrations. The Bancorp considers home price index trends when determining the collateral value qualitative factor.

The home equity portfolio is managed in two primary groups: loans outstanding with a combined LTV greater than 80% and

those loans with a LTV 80% or less based upon appraisals at origination. The carrying value of the greater than 80% LTV home equity loans and 80% or less LTV home equity loans were $2.4 billion
and $5.3 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2016. Of the total $7.7 billion of outstanding home equity loans:

●

86% reside within the Bancorp’s Midwest footprint of Ohio, Michigan, Kentucky, Indiana and Illinois as
of December 31, 2016;

●

36% are in senior lien positions and 64% are in junior lien positions at December 31, 2016;

●

79% of non-delinquent borrowers made at least one payment greater than the minimum payment during the year
ended December 31, 2016; and

●

The portfolio had an average refreshed FICO score of 743 at December 31, 2016.

The Bancorp actively manages lines of credit and makes reductions in lending limits when it believes it is necessary based
on FICO score deterioration and property devaluation. The Bancorp does not routinely obtain appraisals on performing loans to update LTV ratios after origination. However, the Bancorp monitors the local housing markets by reviewing various home
price indices and incorporates the impact of the changing market conditions in its ongoing credit monitoring processes. For junior lien home equity loans which become 60 days or more past due, the Bancorp tracks the performance of the senior lien
loans in which the Bancorp is the servicer and utilizes consumer credit bureau attributes to monitor the status of the senior lien loans that the Bancorp does not service. If the senior lien loan is found to be 120 days or more past due, the junior
lien home equity loan is placed on nonaccrual status unless both loans are well-secured and in the process of collection. Additionally, if the junior lien home equity loan becomes 120 days or more past due and the senior lien loan is also 120 days
or more past due, the junior lien home equity loan is assessed for charge-off. Refer to the Analysis of Nonperforming Assets subsection of the Risk Management section of MD&A for more information.

Automobile portfolio

The Bancorp’s automobile portfolio balances have declined since December 31, 2015 through targeting more profitable risk-adjusted

returns. As a result, the concentration of lower FICO (<690) origination balances have increased with overall credit quality remaining within targeted credit risk tolerance. All concentration
and guideline changes are monitored monthly to ensure alignment with original credit performance and return projections.

The automobile portfolio is characterized by direct and indirect lending products to consumers.
As of December 31, 2016, 47% of the automobile loan portfolio is comprised of loans collateralized by new

automobiles. It is a common industry practice to advance on automobile loans an amount in excess of the automobile value due to the inclusion of taxes, title and other fees paid at closing. The
Bancorp monitors its exposure to these higher risk loans.

HAMP and HARP Programs

For residential mortgage loans serviced for FHLMC and FNMA, the Bancorp participates in the HAMP and HARP programs. For loans refinanced under
the HARP program, the Bancorp strictly adheres to the underwriting requirements of the program. Loan restructuring under the HAMP program is performed on behalf of FHLMC or FNMA and the Bancorp does not take possession of these loans during the
modification process. Therefore, participation in these programs does not significantly impact the Bancorp’s credit quality statistics and these loans are not included in the Bancorp’s TDRs as they are not assets of the Bancorp. In the
event there is a representation and warranty violation on loans sold through the programs, the Bancorp may be required to repurchase the sold loans. As of December 31, 2016, repurchased loans restructured or refinanced under these programs were
immaterial to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Additionally, as of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, $12 million and $14 million, respectively, of loans refinanced under HARP were included in loans held for sale in the
Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Bancorp recognized $6 million of noninterest income in mortgage banking net revenue in the Consolidated Statements of Income related to the sale of loans restructured or refinanced under the HAMP and HARP programs
for both periods ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.

European Exposure

The Bancorp has no direct sovereign exposure to any European government as of December 31, 2016. In providing services to our customers,
the Bancorp routinely enters into financial transactions with foreign domiciled and U.S. subsidiaries of foreign businesses as well as foreign financial institutions. These financial transactions are in the form of loans, loan commitments, letters
of credit, derivatives, guarantees, banker’s acceptances and securities. The Bancorp’s risk appetite for foreign country exposure is managed by having established country exposure limits. The Bancorp’s total exposure to European
domiciled or owned businesses and European financial institutions was $2.8 billion and funded exposure was $1.3 billion as of December 31, 2016. Additionally, the Bancorp was within its established country exposure limits for all European
countries.

The Bancorp has been closely monitoring the Brexit situation and its potential impact on the Bancorp. The
Bancorp’s United Kingdom exposure is shown in the following table.

Analysis of Nonperforming Assets

Nonperforming assets include nonaccrual loans and leases for which ultimate collectability of the full amount of the principal and/or interest
is uncertain; restructured commercial and credit card loans which have not yet met the requirements to be classified as a performing asset; restructured consumer loans which are 90 days past due based on the restructured terms unless the loan is
both well-secured and in the process of collection; and certain other assets, including OREO and other repossessed property. A summary of nonperforming assets is included in Table 57. For further information on the Bancorp’s policies related to
accounting for delinquent and nonperforming loans and leases, refer to the

Nonaccrual Loans and Leases section of Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Nonperforming assets were $751 million at December 31, 2016 compared to $659 million at December 31, 2015. At
December 31, 2016, $13 million of nonaccrual loans were held for sale, compared to $12 million at December 31, 2015.

Nonperforming portfolio assets as a percent of total loans and leases and OREO were 0.80% as
of December 31, 2016 compared to 0.70% as of December 31, 2015. Nonaccrual loans and leases secured by real estate were 25% of total nonaccrual loans and leases as of December 31, 2016 compared to 43% as of December 31, 2015.

75  Fifth
Third Bancorp


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Commercial portfolio nonaccrual loans and leases were $523 million at
December 31, 2016, an increase of $182 million from December 31, 2015 primarily due to increases of $170 million in the reserve-based lending energy portfolio and the impact of low oil prices during the year ended 2016.

Consumer portfolio nonaccrual loans and leases were $137 million at December 31, 2016, a decrease of $28 million from

repossessed property was $78 million at December 31, 2016, compared to $141 million at December 31,

2015. The Bancorp recognized $17 million and $24 million in losses on the sale or write-down of OREO properties during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, approximately $41 million and $35 million, respectively, of interest
income would have been recognized if the nonaccrual and renegotiated loans and leases on nonaccrual status had been current in accordance with their original terms. Although these values help demonstrate the costs of carrying nonaccrual credits, the
Bancorp does not expect to recover the full amount of interest as nonaccrual loans and leases are generally carried below their principal balance.

Troubled Debt Restructurings

If a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty, the Bancorp may consider, in certain circumstances, modifying the terms of their loan to
maximize collection of amounts due. Typically, these modifications reduce the loan interest rate, extend the loan term, reduce the accrued interest or in limited circumstances, reduce the principal balance of the loan. These modifications are
classified as TDRs.

At the time of modification, the Bancorp maintains certain consumer loan TDRs (including
residential mortgage loans, home equity loans, and other consumer loans) on accrual status, provided there is reasonable assurance of repayment and performance according to the modified terms based upon a current, well-documented credit evaluation.
Commercial loans

modified as part of a TDR are maintained on accrual status provided there is a sustained payment history of six months or greater prior to the modification in accordance with the modified terms
and all remaining contractual payments under the modified terms are reasonably assured of collection. TDRs of commercial loans and credit card loans that do not have a sustained payment history of six months or greater in accordance with the
modified terms remain on nonaccrual status until a six-month payment history is sustained.

Consumer restructured loans
on accrual status totaled $958 million and $979 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. As of December 31, 2016, the percentage of restructured residential mortgage loans, home equity loans, and credit card loans that are past
due 30 days or more were 30%, 12% and 30%, respectively.

Analysis of Net Loan Charge-offs

Net charge-offs were 39 bps and 48 bps of average portfolio loans and leases for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015,
respectively. Table 61 provides a summary of credit loss experience and net charge-offs as a percentage of average portfolio loans and leases outstanding by loan category.

Commercial net charge-offs decreased to $190 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $261 million for
the year ended December 31, 2015. The year ended December 31, 2015 included a charge-off associated with the restructuring of a student loan backed commercial credit originated in 2007, included in net charge-offs on commercial and
industrial loans. The ratio of commercial loan and lease net charge-offs to average portfolio commercial loans and leases decreased to 33 bps during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to 46 bps in the same period in the prior year.

The ratio of consumer loan and lease net charge-offs to average consumer loans and leases decreased to 48 bps for the year
ended December 31, 2016 compared to 51 bps for the year ended December 31, 2015. Residential mortgage loan net charge-offs, which typically involve partial charge-offs based upon

appraised values of underlying collateral, decreased $7 million from December 31, 2015, driven by improvements in delinquencies and loss severities.

Home equity net charge-offs decreased $12 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to
improvements in loss severities. Management actively manages lines of credit and makes reductions in lending limits when it believes it is necessary based on FICO score deterioration and property devaluation.

Automobile loan net charge-offs increased $7 million compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to a
strategic shift focusing on improving risk adjusted return along with a modest decline in used car values at auction.

Credit card and other consumer loans and leases net charge-offs remained relatively flat compared to the prior year. The
Bancorp utilizes a risk-adjusted pricing methodology to ensure adequate compensation is received for those products that have higher credit costs.

Allowance for Credit Losses

The allowance for credit losses is comprised of the ALLL and the reserve for unfunded commitments. The ALLL provides coverage for probable and
estimable losses in the loan and lease portfolio. The Bancorp evaluates the ALLL each quarter to determine its adequacy to cover inherent losses. Several factors are taken into consideration in the determination of the overall ALLL, including an
unallocated component. These factors include, but are not limited to, the overall risk profile of the loan and lease portfolios, net charge-off experience, the extent of impaired loans and leases, the level of nonaccrual loans and leases, the level
of 90 days past due loans and leases and the overall level of the ALLL as a percent of portfolio loans and leases. The Bancorp also considers overall asset quality trends, credit administration and portfolio management practices, risk identification
practices, credit policy and underwriting practices, overall portfolio growth, portfolio concentrations and current national and local

economic conditions that might impact the portfolio. Refer to the Critical Accounting Policies section of MD&A for more information.

During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Bancorp refined certain estimation techniques associated with the ALLL.
Such refinements included the introduction of individual loss rate migration analyses for several commercial loan portfolio stratifications as contrasted to the single composite loss rate migration analysis for the entire commercial loan portfolio
which was used in prior periods. These refinements did not substantively change any material aspect of the Bancorp’s overall approach in the determination of the ALLL and there have been no material changes in assumptions as compared to prior
periods that impacted the determination of the current period allowance. In addition to the ALLL, the Bancorp maintains a reserve for unfunded commitments recorded in other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

79  Fifth
Third Bancorp


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The methodology used to determine the adequacy of this reserve is similar to the Bancorp’s methodology for determining the ALLL. The provision for unfunded commitments is included in other
noninterest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

The ALLL attributable to the portion of the residential
mortgage and consumer loan and lease portfolio that has not been restructured is determined on a pooled basis with the segmentation based on the similarity of credit risk characteristics. Loss factors for consumer loans are developed for each pool
based on the trailing twelve month historical loss rate, as adjusted for certain prescriptive loss rate factors and certain qualitative adjustment factors. The prescriptive loss rate factors and qualitative adjustments are designed to reflect risks
associated with current conditions and trends which are not believed to be fully reflected in the trailing twelve month historical loss rate. For real estate backed consumer loans, the prescriptive loss rate factors include adjustments for
delinquency trends, LTV trends, refreshed FICO score trends and product mix, and the qualitative factors include adjustments for changes in policies or procedures in underwriting, monitoring or collections, economic conditions, portfolio mix,
lending and risk management personnel, results of internal audit and quality control reviews, collateral values and geographic concentrations. The Bancorp considers home price index trends in

its footprint and the volatility of collateral valuation trends when determining the collateral value qualitative factor.

The Bancorp’s determination of the ALLL for commercial loans is sensitive to the risk grades it assigns to these loans.
In the event that 10% of commercial loans in each risk category would experience a downgrade of one risk category, the allowance for commercial loans would increase by approximately $190 million at December 31, 2016. In addition, the
Bancorp’s determination of the ALLL for residential mortgage and consumer loans and leases is sensitive to changes in estimated loss rates. In the event that estimated loss rates would increase by 10%, the ALLL for residential mortgage and
consumer loans and leases would increase by approximately $31 million at December 31, 2016. As several qualitative and quantitative factors are considered in determining the ALLL, these sensitivity analyses do not necessarily reflect the nature
and extent of future changes in the ALLL. They are intended to provide insights into the impact of adverse changes to risk grades and estimated loss rates and do not imply any expectation of future deterioration in the risk ratings or loss rates.
Given current processes employed by the Bancorp, management believes the risk grades and estimated loss rates currently assigned are appropriate.

Certain inherent but unconfirmed losses are probable within the loan and lease portfolio. The
Bancorp’s current methodology for determining the level of losses is based on historical loss rates, current credit grades, specific allocation on impaired commercial credits above specified thresholds and restructured loans and other
qualitative adjustments. Due to the heavy reliance on realized historical losses and the credit grade rating process, the model-derived estimate of ALLL tends to slightly lag behind the deterioration in the portfolio in a stable or deteriorating
credit environment, and tends not to be as responsive when improved conditions have presented themselves. Given these model limitations, the qualitative adjustment factors may be incremental or decremental to the quantitative model results.

An unallocated component of the ALLL is maintained to recognize the
imprecision in estimating and measuring loss. The unallocated allowance as a percent of total portfolio loans and leases at both December 31, 2016 and 2015 was 0.12%. The unallocated allowance was 9% of the total allowance as of both
December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015.

As shown in Table 63, the ALLL as a percent of portfolio loans and
leases was 1.36% at December 31, 2016, compared to 1.37% at December 31, 2015. The ALLL was $1.3 billion at both December 31, 2016 and 2015.

MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT

Market risk is the day-to-day potential for the value of a financial instrument to increase or decrease due to movements in market
factors. The Bancorp’s market risk includes risks resulting from movements in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices and commodity prices. Interest rate risk, a component of market risk, primarily impacts the Bancorp’s
NII and interest sensitive fee income categories through changes in interest income on earning assets and cost of interest bearing liabilities, and through fee items that are related to interest sensitive activities such as mortgage origination and
servicing income. Management considers interest rate risk a prominent market risk in terms of its potential impact on earnings. Interest rate risk may occur for any one or more of the following reasons:

●

Assets and liabilities mature or reprice at different times;

●

Short-term and long-term market interest rates change by different amounts; or

●

The expected maturities of various assets or liabilities shorten or lengthen as interest rates change.

In addition to the direct impact of interest rate changes on NII, interest rates can indirectly
impact earnings through their effect on loan and deposit demand, credit losses, mortgage originations, the value of servicing rights and other sources of the Bancorp’s earnings. Stability of the Bancorp’s net income is largely dependent
upon the effective management of interest rate risk. Management continually reviews

the Bancorp’s balance sheet composition and earnings flows and models the interest rate risk, and possible actions to reduce this risk, given numerous possible future interest rate
scenarios. A series of Policy Limits and Key Risk Indicators are employed to ensure that this risk is managed within the Bancorp’s risk tolerance.

Interest Rate Risk Management Oversight

The Bancorp’s ALCO, which includes senior management representatives and is accountable to the ERMC, monitors and manages interest rate
risk within Board approved policy limits. In addition to the risk management activities of ALCO, the Bancorp has a Market Risk Management function as part of ERM that provides independent oversight of market risk activities.

Net Interest Income Sensitivity

The Bancorp employs a variety of measurement techniques to identify and manage its interest rate risk, including the use of an NII simulation
model to analyze the sensitivity of NII to changes in interest rates. The model is based on contractual and assumed cash flows and repricing characteristics for all of the Bancorp’s assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet exposures and
incorporates market-based assumptions regarding the effect of changing interest rates on the prepayment rates of certain assets and attrition rates of certain liabilities. The model also includes senior management’s projections of the future
volume and pricing of each of the product lines offered by the Bancorp as well as other pertinent assumptions. Actual results may differ from simulated results due to timing, magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes, deviations from
projected assumptions, as well as changes in market conditions and management strategies.

Third Bancorp


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The Bancorp’s interest rate risk exposure is evaluated by measuring the
anticipated change in NII over 12-month and 24-month horizons assuming 100 bps and 200 bps parallel ramped increases and a 75 bps parallel ramped decrease in interest rates. The analysis would typically include 100 bps and 200 bps parallel ramped
decreases in interest rates; however, this analysis is currently omitted due to the current levels of certain interest rates. Applying the ramps would result in certain interest rates becoming negative in the parallel ramped decrease scenarios.

In this economic cycle, banks have experienced significant growth in deposit balances, particularly in noninterest-bearing
demand deposits. The Bancorp, like other banks, is exposed to deposit balance run-off in a rising interest rate environment. In consideration of this risk, the Bancorp’s NII sensitivity modeling assumes that approximately $2.5 billion of
noninterest-bearing demand deposit balances run-off above what is included in senior management’s baseline projections for each 100 bps increase in

short-term market interest rates. These noninterest-bearing demand deposit balances are modeled to flow into funding products that reprice in conjunction with market rate increases.

Another important deposit modeling assumption is the amount by which interest-bearing deposit rates will increase when
market rates increase. This deposit repricing sensitivity is known as the beta, and it represents the expected amount by which Bancorp deposit rates will increase for a given increase in short-term market rates. The Bancorp’s NII sensitivity
modeling assumes a weighted-average interest-bearing deposit beta of 69% at December 31, 2016, which is approximately 20 percentage points higher than the beta that the Bancorp experienced in the last FRB tightening cycle from June 2004 to June
2006.

The Bancorp continually evaluates the sensitivity of its interest rate risk measures to these important deposit
modeling assumptions. The Bancorp also evaluates the sensitivity of other important modeling assumptions, such as loan and security prepayments and early withdrawals on fixed-rate customer liabilities.

The following table shows
the Bancorp’s estimated NII sensitivity profile and ALCO policy limits as of December 31:

At December 31, 2016, the Bancorp’s NII would benefit in both year one and year two
under the parallel rate ramp increases. The Bancorp’s NII would decline in both year one and year two under the parallel 75 bps ramped decrease in interest rates. The NII sensitivity profile is attributable to the combination of floating-rate
assets, including the predominantly floating-rate commercial loan portfolio, and certain intermediate-term fixed-rate liabilities. The change in the sensitivity as of December 31, 2016 for the first 12 months compared to December 31, 2015
is primarily attributable to fixed-rate mortgage asset growth, partially offset by runoff in the indirect automobile loan portfolio. The change in the sensitivity as of December 31, 2016 for the 13-24 month horizon

compared to December 31, 2015 is also attributable to fixed-rate mortgage asset growth, partially offset by runoff in the indirect automobile loan portfolio, but sensitivity is modestly
improved from December 31, 2015 due to projected core deposit growth.

Tables 65 and 66 provide information on the
Bancorp’s estimated NII sensitivity profile given changes to certain key deposit modeling assumptions.

Economic Value of Equity Sensitivity

The Bancorp also uses EVE as a measurement tool in managing interest rate risk. Whereas the NII sensitivity analysis highlights the impact on
forecasted NII on an FTE (non-GAAP) basis over one and two year time horizons, EVE is a point in time analysis of the economic sensitivity of current positions that incorporates all cash flows over their estimated remaining lives. The EVE of the
balance sheet is defined as the discounted present value of all asset and net derivative cash flows less the discounted value of all liability cash flows. Due to this longer

horizon, the sensitivity of EVE to changes in the level of interest rates is a measure of longer-term interest rate risk. EVE values only the current balance sheet and does not incorporate the
balance growth assumptions used in the NII sensitivity analysis. As with the NII simulation model, assumptions about the timing and variability of existing balance sheet cash flows are critical in the EVE analysis. Particularly important are
assumptions driving loan and security prepayments and the expected balance attrition and pricing of transaction deposits.

The following table shows the
Bancorp’s estimated EVE sensitivity profile as of December 31:

The EVE sensitivity to the +200 bps rising rate scenario is moderately negative at
December 31, 2016, and is also slightly negative to a 75 bps decline in market rates. The +100 and +200 bps rising rate sensitivities are down slightly from the sensitivities at December 31, 2015. The decrease in risk is related to
long-term debt issuances, run-off of indirect automobile loan balances and a shorter average life of certain fixed-rate commercial loans and leases. These items were partially offset by growth in the investment portfolio and fixed-rate mortgage loan
balances.

While an instantaneous shift in interest rates is used in this analysis to provide an estimate of exposure,
the Bancorp believes that a gradual shift in interest rates would have a much more modest impact. Since EVE measures the discounted present value of cash flows over the estimated lives of instruments, the change in EVE does not directly correlate to
the degree that earnings would be impacted over a shorter time horizon (e.g., the current fiscal year). Further, EVE does not take into account factors such as future balance sheet growth, changes in product mix, changes in yield curve relationships
and changing product spreads that could

mitigate or exacerbate the impact of changes in interest rates. The NII simulations and EVE analyses do not necessarily include certain actions that management may undertake to manage risk in
response to actual changes in interest rates.

The Bancorp regularly evaluates its exposures to a static balance sheet
forecast, LIBOR, Prime Rate and other basis risks, yield curve twist risks and embedded options risks. In addition, the impact on NII on an FTE basis and EVE of extreme changes in interest rates is modeled, wherein the Bancorp employs the use of
yield curve shocks and environment-specific scenarios.

Use of Derivatives to Manage Interest Rate Risk

An integral component of the Bancorp’s interest rate risk management strategy is its use of derivative instruments to minimize
significant fluctuations in earnings caused by changes in market interest rates. Examples of derivative instruments that the Bancorp may use as part of its interest rate risk management strategy include interest rate swaps, interest rate floors,
interest rate caps, forward contracts, forward starting interest rate swaps, options, swaptions and TBA securities.

83  Fifth
Third Bancorp


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

As part of its overall risk management strategy relative to its mortgage
banking activities, the Bancorp enters into forward contracts accounted for as free-standing derivatives to economically hedge IRLCs that are also considered free-standing derivatives. Additionally, the Bancorp economically hedges its exposure to
mortgage loans held for sale through the use of forward contracts and mortgage options.

The Bancorp also enters into
derivative contracts with major financial institutions to economically hedge market risks assumed in interest rate derivative contracts with commercial customers. Generally, these contracts have similar terms in order to protect the Bancorp from
market volatility. Credit risk arises from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts, which

the Bancorp minimizes through collateral arrangements, approvals, limits and monitoring procedures. For further information including the notional amount and fair values of these derivatives,
refer to Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Portfolio Loans and Leases and Interest Rate Risk

Although the Bancorp’s portfolio loans and leases contain both fixed and floating/adjustable-rate products, the rates of interest earned
by the Bancorp on the outstanding balances are generally established for a period of time. The interest rate sensitivity of loans and leases is directly related to the length of time the rate earned is established.

The following table
summarizes the carrying value of the Bancorp’s portfolio loans and leases expected cash flows, excluding interest receivable, as of December 31, 2016:

Residential Mortgage Servicing Rights and Interest Rate Risk

The net carrying amount of the residential MSR portfolio was $744 million and $784 million as of December 31, 2016 and 2015,
respectively. The value of servicing rights can fluctuate sharply depending on changes in interest rates and other factors. Generally, as interest rates decline and loans are prepaid to take advantage of refinancing, the total value of existing
servicing rights declines because no further servicing fees are collected on repaid loans. The Bancorp maintains a non-qualifying hedging strategy relative to its mortgage banking activity in order to manage a portion of the risk associated with
changes in the value of its MSR portfolio as a result of changing interest rates.

Mortgage rates increased during the year ended
December 31, 2016 which caused modeled prepayment speeds to decrease, leading to a recovery of temporary impairment on the servicing rights during the year. Servicing rights are deemed temporarily impaired when a borrower’s loan rate is
distinctly higher than prevailing rates. Temporary impairment on servicing rights is reversed when the prevailing rates return to a level commensurate with the borrower’s loan rate. In addition to the MSR valuation, the Bancorp recognized net
gains of $24 million and $90 million on derivatives associated with its non-qualifying hedging strategy during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

84  Fifth Third Bancorp


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The Bancorp may adjust its hedging strategy to reflect its assessment of the composition of its MSR portfolio, the cost of hedging and the anticipated effectiveness of the hedges given the
economic environment. Refer to Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on servicing rights and the instruments used to hedge interest rate risk on MSRs.

Foreign Currency Risk

The
Bancorp may enter into foreign exchange derivative contracts to economically hedge certain foreign currency denominated loans. The derivatives are classified as free-standing instruments with the revaluation gain or loss being recorded in other
noninterest income in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The balance of the Bancorp’s foreign denominated loans at December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 was $827 million and $812 million, respectively. The Bancorp also enters
into foreign exchange contracts for the benefit of commercial customers to hedge their exposure to foreign currency fluctuations. Similar to the hedging of interest rate risk from interest rate derivative contracts, the Bancorp also enters into
foreign exchange contracts with major financial institutions to economically hedge a substantial portion of the exposure from client driven foreign exchange activity. The Bancorp has risk limits and internal controls in place to help ensure
excessive

risk is not being taken in providing this service to customers. These controls include an independent determination of currency volatility and credit equivalent exposure on these contracts,
counterparty credit approvals and country limits performed by the Capital Markets Credit Department and Capital Markets Risk Department.

Commodity
Risk

The Bancorp also enters into commodity contracts for the benefit of commercial customers to hedge their exposure to
commodity price fluctuations. Similar to the hedging of foreign exchange and interest rate risk from interest rate derivative contracts, the Bancorp also enters into commodity contracts with major financial institutions to economically hedge a
substantial portion of the exposure from client driven commodity activity. The Bancorp may also offset this risk with exchange traded commodity contracts. The Bancorp has risk limits and internal controls in place to help ensure excessive risk
is not taken in providing this service to customers. These controls include an independent determination of commodity volatility and credit equivalent exposure on these contracts and counterparty credit approvals performed by the Capital Markets
Credit Department and Capital Markets Risk Department.

LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT

The goal of liquidity management is to provide adequate funds to meet changes in loan and lease demand, unexpected levels of deposit
withdrawals and other contractual obligations. Mitigating liquidity risk is accomplished by maintaining liquid assets in the form of cash, investment securities, maintaining sufficient unused borrowing capacity in the debt markets and delivering
consistent growth in core deposits. A summary of certain obligations and commitments to make future payments under contracts is included in Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

The Bancorp maintains a contingency funding plan that assesses the liquidity needs under various scenarios of market
conditions, asset growth and credit rating downgrades. The plan includes liquidity stress testing which measures various sources and uses of funds under the different scenarios. The contingency plan provides for ongoing monitoring of unused
borrowing capacity and available sources of contingent liquidity to prepare for unexpected liquidity needs and to cover unanticipated events that could affect liquidity.

Sources of Funds

The
Bancorp’s primary sources of funds relate to cash flows from loan and lease repayments, payments from securities related to sales and maturities, the sale or securitization of loans and leases and funds generated by core deposits, in addition
to the use of public and private debt offerings.

Table 68 of the Market Risk Management subsection of the Risk
Management section of MD&A illustrates the expected maturities from loan and lease repayments. Of the $31.2 billion of securities in the Bancorp’s available-for-sale and other portfolio at December 31, 2016, $4.1 billion in principal
and interest is expected to be received in the next 12 months and an additional $3.3 billion is expected to be received in the next 13 to 24 months. For further information on the Bancorp’s securities portfolio, refer to the Investment
Securities subsection of the Balance Sheet Analysis section of MD&A.

Asset-driven liquidity is provided by the
Bancorp’s ability to sell or securitize loans and leases. In order to reduce the exposure to interest rate fluctuations and to manage liquidity, the Bancorp has developed securitization and sale procedures for several types of
interest-sensitive

assets. A majority of the long-term, fixed-rate single-family residential mortgage loans underwritten according to FHLMC or FNMA guidelines are sold for cash upon origination. Additional assets
such as certain other residential mortgage loans, certain commercial loans, home equity loans, automobile loans and other consumer loans are also capable of being securitized or sold. The Bancorp sold or securitized loans totaling $7.4 billion
during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $6.4 billion during the year ended December 31, 2015. For further information on the transfer of financial assets, refer to Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Core deposits have historically provided the Bancorp with a sizeable source of relatively stable and low cost funds.
The Bancorp’s average core deposits and average shareholders’ equity funded 82% of its average total assets for both years ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015. In addition to core deposit funding, the Bancorp also
accesses a variety of other short-term and long-term funding sources, which include securitized advances from the FHLB system. Certificates of deposit $100,000 and over and deposits in the Bancorp’s foreign branch located in the Cayman Islands
are wholesale funding tools utilized to fund asset growth. Management does not rely on any one source of liquidity and manages availability in response to changing balance sheet needs.

As of December 31, 2016, $8.9 billion of debt or other securities were available for issuance under the current
Bancorp’s Board of Directors’ authorizations and the Bancorp is authorized to file any necessary registration statements with the SEC to permit ready access to the public securities markets; however, access to these markets may depend on
market conditions. At December 31, 2016, the Bancorp has approximately $42.3 billion of borrowing capacity available through secured borrowing sources including the FHLB and FRB.

The Bank’s global bank note program has a borrowing capacity of $25.0 billion, of which $17.1 billion is available for
issuance as of December 31, 2016. On March 15, 2016, the Bank issued and sold $1.5 billion in aggregate principal amount of unsecured bank notes. On June 14, 2016, the Bank issued and sold $1.3 billion of unsecured bank notes. On
September 27, 2016, the Bank issued and sold $1.0 billion of unsecured bank notes.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Liquidity Coverage Ratio and Net Stable Funding Ratio

A key reform within the Basel III framework to strengthen international liquidity standards was the BCBS’ introduction of the LCR and
NSFR. On January 7, 2013, the BCBS issued a final standard for the LCR applicable to large internationally active banking organizations. The BCBS issued a final NSFR standard in the fourth quarter of 2014 and disclosure requirements in the
second quarter of 2015 which are applicable to internationally active banks. The NSFR will become a minimum standard by January 1, 2018.

Section 165 of the DFA requires the FRB to establish enhanced liquidity standards in the U.S. for BHCs with total
assets of $50 billion or greater. On October 10, 2014, the U.S. banking agencies published final rules implementing a quantitative liquidity requirement consistent with the LCR standard established by the BCBS for large internationally active
banking organizations, generally those with $250 billion or more in total consolidated assets or $10 billion or more in on-balance sheet foreign exposure. In addition, a Modified LCR requirement was finalized for BHCs with $50 billion or more in
total consolidated assets that are not internationally active, such as the Bancorp. The Modified LCR requires BHCs to maintain HQLA equal to its calculated net cash outflows over a 30 calendar-day stress period multiplied by a factor of 0.7. The
Modified LCR became effective January 1, 2016 and requires BHCs to calculate its LCR on a monthly basis. The final rule includes a transition period for the Modified LCR in which BHCs must maintain HQLA of 90% of its calculated net cash
outflows for 2016 and then 100% beginning in 2017. The Bancorp’s Modified LCR was 128% at December 31, 2016 calculated under the LCR final rule.

The U.S. banking agencies have issued a notice of proposed rulemaking to implement a modified NSFR for certain bank holding
companies with at least $50 billion but less than $250 billion in total consolidated assets and with less than $10 billion in on-balance sheet foreign exposures, including the Bancorp. The NSFR is designed to promote medium- and long-term stable
funding of the assets and off-balance-sheet activities of banks and bank holding companies over a one-year time horizon. Generally consistent with the BCBS’ framework, under the proposed rule banking organizations would be required to hold an
amount of ASF over a one-year time horizon that equals or exceeds the institution’s amount of RSF, with the ASF representing the numerator and the RSF representing the denominator of the NSFR. Banking

organizations subject to the modified NSFR would multiply the RSF amount by 70%, such that the RSF amount required for these institutions would be equivalent to 70% of the RSF amount that would
be required pursuant to the full NSFR generally applicable to institutions with at least $250 billion in total consolidated assets or $10 billion or more in on-balance sheet foreign exposures under the proposed rule. The proposed rule includes
detailed descriptions of the items that would comprise ASF and RSF and standardized factors that would apply to ASF and RSF items, and would require any institution whose applicable modified NSFR falls under 100% to notify the appropriate federal
regulator and develop a remediation plan.

If ultimately adopted as currently proposed, the implementation of the NSFR
could impact the Bancorp’s liquidity and funding requirements and practices in the future, including by incentivizing increased use of long-term debt as a funding source. Under the proposal, the NSFR becomes effective January 1, 2018 with
public disclosure requirements beginning for the calendar quarter that ends on March 31, 2018. The comment period for this proposal ended on August 5, 2016. The Bancorp is currently evaluating the impact of the U.S. banking agencies’
NSFR framework.

Credit Ratings

The cost and availability of financing to the Bancorp and Bank are impacted by its credit ratings. A downgrade to the Bancorp’s or
Bank’s credit ratings could affect its ability to access the credit markets and increase its borrowing costs, thereby adversely impacting the Bancorp’s or Bank’s financial condition and liquidity. Key factors in maintaining high
credit ratings include a stable and diverse earnings stream, strong credit quality, strong capital ratios and diverse funding sources, in addition to disciplined liquidity monitoring procedures.

The Bancorp’s and Bank’s credit ratings are summarized in Table 70. The ratings reflect the ratings agency’s
view on the Bancorp’s and Bank’s capacity to meet financial commitments.*

* As an investor, you should be
aware that a security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities, that it may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and that each rating should be evaluated independently of any
other rating. Additional information on the credit rating ranking within the overall classification system is located on the website of each credit rating agency.

OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT

Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed processes or systems or due to external events that are neither
market nor credit-related. Operational risk is inherent in the Bancorp’s activities and can manifest itself in various ways including fraudulent acts, business interruptions, inappropriate behavior of employees, unintentional failure to comply
with applicable laws and regulations, cyber-security incidents and privacy breaches or failure of vendors to perform in accordance

with their arrangements. These events could result in financial losses, litigation and regulatory fines, as well as other damage to the Bancorp. The Bancorp’s risk management goal is to keep
operational risk at appropriate levels consistent with the Bancorp’s risk appetite, financial strength, the characteristics of its businesses, the markets in which it operates and the competitive and regulatory environment to which it is
subject.

86  Fifth Third Bancorp


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

To control, monitor and govern operational risk, the Bancorp maintains an
overall Risk Management Framework which comprises governance oversight, risk assessment, capital measurement, monitoring and reporting as well as a formal three lines of defense approach. ERM is responsible for prescribing the framework to the lines
of business and corporate functions, and to provide independent oversight of its implementation (second line of defense). Business Controls groups are in place in each of the lines of business to ensure consistent implementation and execution of
managing day to day operational risk (first line of defense).

The Bancorp’s risk management framework consists of
five integrated components, including identifying, assessing, managing, monitoring and independent governance reporting of risk. The corporate Operational Risk Management function within Enterprise Risk is responsible for developing and overseeing
the implementation of the Bancorp’s approach to managing operational risk. This includes providing governance, awareness and training, tools, guidance and oversight to support

implementation of key risk programs and systems as they relate to operational risk management, such as risk and control self-assessments, new product/initiative risk reviews, key risk indicators,
Vendor Risk Management and operational losses. The function is also responsible for developing reports that support the proactive management of operational risk across the enterprise. The lines of business and corporate functions are responsible for
managing the operational risks associated with their areas in accordance with the risk management framework. The framework is intended to enable the Bancorp to function with a sound and well-controlled operational environment. These processes
support the Bancorp’s goals to minimize future operational losses and strengthen the Bancorp’s performance by maintaining sufficient capital to absorb operational losses that are incurred.

COMPLIANCE RISK MANAGEMENT

Regulatory compliance risk is defined as the risk of legal or regulatory sanctions, financial loss, or damage to reputation as a result of
noncompliance with (i) applicable laws, regulations, rules and other regulatory requirements (including but not limited to the risk of consumers experiencing economic loss or other legal harm as a result of noncompliance with consumer
protection laws, regulations and requirements); (ii) internal policies and procedures, standards of best practice or codes of conduct; and (iii) principles of integrity and fair dealing applicable to Fifth Third’s activities and
functions. Fifth Third focuses on managing regulatory compliance risk in accordance with the Bancorp’s integrated risk management framework, which ensures consistent processes for identifying, assessing, managing, monitoring and reporting
risks. The Bancorp’s risk management goal is to keep compliance risk at appropriate levels consistent with the Bancorp’s risk appetite.

The current regulatory environment, including heightened regulatory expectations and material changes in laws and
regulations, increases compliance risk. To mitigate compliance risk, Compliance Risk Management provides independent oversight to ensure consistency and sufficiency in the execution of the program and ensures that lines of business, regions and
support functions are adequately identifying, assessing and monitoring

compliance risks and adopting proper mitigation strategies. The lines of business and enterprise functions are responsible for managing the compliance risks associated with their areas.
Additionally, Compliance Risk Management implements key compliance programs and processes including but not limited to risk assessments, key risk indicators, issues tracking, regulatory compliance testing and monitoring, anti-money laundering,
privacy and oversees the Bancorp’s compliance with the Community Reinvestment Act.

Fifth Third also focuses on the
reporting and escalation of compliance issues to senior management and the Board of Directors. The Management Compliance Committee is the key committee that oversees and supports Fifth Third in the management of compliance risk across the
enterprise. The Management Compliance Committee oversees Fifth Third-wide compliance issues, industry best practices, legislative developments (in coordination with the Regulatory Change Management Committee), regulatory concerns and other leading
indicators of compliance risk. The Management Compliance Committee reports to the ERMC, which reports to the Risk and Compliance Committee of the Board of Directors.

CAPITAL MANAGEMENT

Management regularly reviews the Bancorp’s capital levels to help ensure it is appropriately positioned under various operating
environments. The Bancorp has established a Capital Committee which is responsible for making capital plan recommendations to management. These recommendations are reviewed by the ERMC and the annual capital plan is approved by the Board of
Directors. The Capital Committee is responsible for execution oversight of the capital actions of the capital plan.

Regulatory Capital Ratios

The Basel III Final Rule was effective for the Bancorp on January 1, 2015, subject to phase-in periods for certain of its
components and other provisions. It established quantitative measures that assign risk weightings to assets and off-balance sheet items and also defined and set minimum regulatory capital requirements. The minimum capital ratios established under
the Basel III Final Rule are 4.5% for the CET1 capital ratio, 6% for the Tier I risk-based capital ratio, 8% for the Total risk-based capital ratio and 4% for the Tier I Leverage ratio (Tier I capital to quarterly average consolidated assets). The
PCA provisions adopted by the U.S. banking agencies define “well-capitalized” ratios for CET1 capital, Tier I risk-based capital, Total risk-based

capital and Tier I leverage greater than or equal to 6.5%, 8%, 10% and 5%, respectively.

On January 1, 2016, the Bancorp became subject to a capital conservation buffer which will be phased in over a
three-year period ending January 1, 2019. Once fully phased-in, the capital conservation buffer will be 2.5% in addition to the minimum capital requirements, in order to avoid limitations on certain capital distributions and discretionary bonus
payments to executive officers. The capital conservation buffer is 0.625% in 2016. The Bancorp exceeded these “well-capitalized” and “capital conservation buffer” ratios for all periods presented.

The Bancorp made a one-time permanent election to not include AOCI in regulatory capital in
the March 31, 2015 FFIEC 031 and FR Y-9C filings. The Basel III Final Rule phases out the inclusion of certain TruPS as a component of Tier I capital. Under these provisions, these TruPS would qualify as a component of Tier II capital. At
December 31, 2016, the Bancorp’s TruPS no longer qualified for Tier I capital, compared to $13 million, or 1 bp of risk-weighted assets, which qualified as Tier I capital at December 31, 2015.

to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Stress Tests and CCAR

In 2011 the FRB adopted the capital plan rule, which requires BHCs with consolidated assets of $50 billion or more to submit annual capital
plans to the FRB for review. Under the rule, these capital plans must include detailed descriptions of the following: the BHC’s internal processes for assessing capital adequacy; the policies governing capital actions such as common stock
issuances, dividends and share repurchases; and all planned capital actions over a nine-quarter planning horizon. Further, each BHC must also report to the FRB the results of stress tests conducted by the BHC under a number of scenarios that assess
the sources and uses of capital under baseline and stressed economic scenarios. The FRB launched the 2016 stress testing program and CCAR on January 28, 2016, with submissions of stress test results and capital plans to the FRB due on
April 5, 2016, which the Bancorp submitted as required. Refer to Note 3 and Note 23 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion on the FRB’s review of the capital plan, the FRB’s non-objection to the
Bancorp’s proposed capital actions and the Bancorp’s capital actions taken in 2016.

Dividend Policy and Stock Repurchase Program

The Bancorp’s common stock dividend policy and stock repurchase program reflect its earnings outlook, desired payout ratios, the need to
maintain adequate capital levels, the ability of its subsidiaries to pay dividends, the need to comply with safe and sound banking practices as well as meet regulatory requirements and expectations. The Bancorp declared dividends per common share of
$0.53 and $0.52 during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The Bancorp entered into or settled a number of accelerated share repurchase transactions during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. Refer to Note 23
of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the accelerated share repurchases.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

OFF-BALANCE

SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

In the ordinary course of business, the Bancorp enters into financial transactions that are
considered

off-balance

sheet arrangements as they involve varying elements of market, credit and liquidity risk in excess of the amounts recognized in the Bancorp’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. The
Bancorp’s

off-balance

sheet arrangements include commitments, contingent liabilities, guarantees and transactions with

non-consolidated

VIEs. A brief discussion of
these transactions is as follows:

Commitments

The Bancorp has certain commitments to make future payments under contracts, including commitments to extend credit, letters of credit,
forward contracts related to residential mortgage loans held for sale, noncancelable operating lease obligations, capital commitments for private equity investments, purchase obligations, capital expenditures, and capital lease obligations. Refer to
Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on commitments.

Guarantees and Contingent Liabilities

For certain mortgage loans originated by the Bancorp, borrowers are required to obtain PMI provided by third-party insurers. In
some instances, these insurers ceded a portion of the PMI premiums to the Bancorp, and the Bancorp provided reinsurance coverage within a specified range of the total PMI coverage. The Bancorp’s reinsurance coverage typically ranged from 5% to
10% of the total PMI coverage. The Bancorp’s maximum exposure in the event of nonperformance by the underlying borrowers is equivalent to the Bancorp’s total outstanding reinsurance coverage, which was $27 million at December 31,
2015. As of December 31, 2015 the Bancorp maintained a reserve of $2 million related to exposures within the reinsurance portfolio which was included in other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. In the second quarter of 2016,
the Bancorp allowed one of

its third-party insurers to terminate its reinsurance agreement with the Bancorp, resulting in the Bancorp releasing collateral to the insurer in the form of investment securities and other
assets with a carrying value of $6 million, and the insurer assuming the Bancorp’s obligations under the reinsurance agreement, resulting in a decrease to the Bancorp’s reserve liability of $2 million and a decrease in the
Bancorp’s maximum exposure of $26 million. In addition, the Bancorp received a payment of $4 million related to the difference between the release of the assets and the reserve liability assumed. During the fourth quarter of 2016, the
final policies under the reinsurance agreement were terminated and as of December 31, 2016 the Bancorp no longer had any remaining exposure or reserves related to exposure within the reinsurance portfolio.

The Bancorp has performance obligations upon the occurrence of certain events provided in certain contractual arrangements,
including residential mortgage loans sold with representation and warranty provisions or credit recourse. Refer to Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on guarantees and contingent liabilities.

Transactions with

Non-consolidated

VIEs

The Bancorp engages in a variety of activities that involve VIEs, which are legal entities that lack sufficient equity to finance their
activities, or the equity investors of the entities as a group lack any of the characteristics of a controlling interest. The investments in those entities in which the Bancorp was determined not to be the primary beneficiary but holds a variable
interest in the entity are accounted for under the equity method of accounting or other accounting standards as appropriate and not consolidated. Refer to Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on

non-consolidated

VIEs.

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND OTHER COMMITMENTS

The Bancorp has certain obligations and commitments to make future payments under contracts.
The aggregate contractual obligations and commitments at December 31, 2016 are shown in Table 73. As of December 31, 2016, the Bancorp has unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would impact the

effective tax rate in future periods. Due to the uncertainty of the amounts to be ultimately paid as well as the timing of such payments, all uncertain tax liabilities that have not been paid
have been excluded from the following table. For further detail on the impact of income taxes, refer to Note 20 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

MANAGEMENT’S ASSESSMENT AS TO THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL
REPORTING

EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

The Bancorp conducted an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Bancorp’s management, including the
Bancorp’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Bancorp’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules

13a-15(e)

and

15d-15(e)

under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). The disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports the Bancorp files and submits under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported as and when required and information is accumulated and communicated to management on a timely basis. Based on the evaluation, as of the end of the period covered by
this report, the Bancorp’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Bancorp’s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective, because of deficiencies in the Bancorp’s policies and procedures
relating to the registration of, and prospectus delivery with respect to, the Bancorp’s employee benefit plans as described in Part II, Item 5 (Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of
Equity Securities).

MANAGEMENT’S ASSESSMENT AS TO THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL
REPORTING

The management of Fifth Third Bancorp is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control, designed
to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The
Bancorp’s management assessed the effectiveness of the Bancorp’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016. Management’s assessment is based on the criteria established in the

Internal Control —
Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and was designed to provide reasonable assurance that the Bancorp maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as
of December 31, 2016. Based on this assessment, management believes that the Bancorp maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016. The Bancorp’s independent registered public accounting firm,
that audited the Bancorp’s consolidated financial statements included in this annual report, has issued an audit report on our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016. This report appears on page 93 of the annual
report.

CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROLS

The Bancorp’s management also conducted an evaluation of internal control over financial reporting to determine whether any changes
occurred during the year covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Bancorp’s internal control over financial reporting. Based on this evaluation, there has been no such change
during the year covered by this report.

REPORTS OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of Fifth Third Bancorp:

We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Fifth Third Bancorp and subsidiaries (the “Bancorp”) as of
December 31, 2016, based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Bancorp’s management is responsible for
maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Assessment as to the Effectiveness of Internal
Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Bancorp’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control
over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered
necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control
over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company’s board of directors,
management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the
assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of
the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal
control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any
evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies
or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, the Bancorp maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2016, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control— Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated
financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2016 of the Bancorp and our report dated February 24, 2017 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

REPORTS OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of Fifth Third Bancorp:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Fifth Third Bancorp and subsidiaries (the “Bancorp”) as of
December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2016. These consolidated financial
statements are the responsibility of the Bancorp’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable
basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of Fifth Third Bancorp and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2016, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Bancorp’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework
(2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 24, 2017 expressed an unqualified opinion on the Bancorp’s internal control over financial reporting.

Third Bancorp


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING
POLICIES

Nature of Operations

Fifth Third Bancorp, an Ohio corporation, conducts its principal lending, deposit gathering, transaction processing and service advisory
activities through its banking and

non-banking

subsidiaries from banking centers located throughout the Midwestern and Southeastern regions of the United States.

Basis of Presentation

The
Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Bancorp and its majority-owned subsidiaries and VIEs in which the Bancorp has been determined to be the primary beneficiary. Other entities, including certain joint ventures, in which the
Bancorp has the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies of the investee, but upon which the Bancorp does not possess control, are accounted for by the equity method of accounting and not consolidated. The
investments in those entities in which the Bancorp does not have the ability to exercise significant influence are generally carried at the lower of cost or fair value. Intercompany transactions and balances among consolidated entities have been
eliminated.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Cash and Due From Banks

Cash and due from banks consist of currency and coin, cash items in the process of collection and due from banks. Currency and
coin includes both U.S. and foreign currency owned and held at Fifth Third offices and that is

in-transit

to the FRB. Cash items in the process of collection include checks and drafts that are drawn on another
depository institution or the FRB that are payable immediately upon presentation in the U.S. Balances due from banks include noninterest-bearing balances that are funds on deposit at other depository institutions or the FRB.

Securities

Securities are
classified as

held-to-maturity,

available-for-sale

or trading on the date of purchase.
Only those securities which management has the intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as

held-to-maturity

and reported at amortized cost. Securities are
classified as

available-for-sale

when, in management’s judgment, they may be sold in response to, or in anticipation of, changes in market conditions. Securities
are classified as trading when bought and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term.

Available-for-sale

securities are reported at fair value
with unrealized gains and losses, net of related deferred income taxes, included in OCI. Trading securities are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in noninterest income. The fair value of a security is determined based
on quoted market prices. If quoted market prices are not available, fair value is determined based on quoted prices of similar instruments or DCF models that incorporate market inputs and assumptions including discount rates, prepayment speeds and
loss rates. Realized securities gains or losses are reported within noninterest income in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method.

Available-for-sale

and

held-to-maturity

securities with unrealized losses are reviewed quarterly for possible OTTI. For debt securities, if the Bancorp intends to sell the debt security or will more
likely than not be required to sell the debt security before recovery of the entire amortized cost basis, then an OTTI

has occurred. However, even if the Bancorp does not intend to sell the debt security and will not likely be required to sell the debt security before recovery of its entire amortized cost basis,
the Bancorp must evaluate expected cash flows to be received and determine if a credit loss has occurred. In the event of a credit loss, the credit component of the impairment is recognized within noninterest income and the

non-credit

component is recognized through OCI. For equity securities, the Bancorp’s management evaluates the securities in an unrealized loss position in the

available-for-sale

portfolio for OTTI on the basis of the duration of the decline in value of the security and severity of that decline as well as the Bancorp’s intent and ability to hold these
securities for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in the market value. If it is determined that the impairment on an equity security is other-than-temporary, an impairment loss equal to the difference between the
amortized cost of the security and its fair value is recognized within noninterest income.

Portfolio Loans and Leases

Basis of Accounting

Portfolio loans and
leases are generally reported at the principal amount outstanding, net of unearned income, deferred direct loan origination fees and costs and any direct principal charge-offs. Direct loan origination fees and costs are deferred and the net amount
is amortized over the estimated life of the related loans as a yield adjustment. Interest income is recognized based on the principal balance outstanding computed using the effective interest method.

Loans acquired by the Bancorp through a purchase business combination are recorded at fair value as of the acquisition date.
The Bancorp does not carry over the acquired company’s ALLL, nor does the Bancorp add to its existing ALLL as part of purchase accounting.

Purchased loans are evaluated for evidence of credit deterioration at acquisition and recorded
at their initial fair value. For loans acquired with no evidence of credit deterioration, the fair value discount or premium is amortized over the contractual life of the loan as an adjustment to yield. For loans acquired with evidence of credit
deterioration, the Bancorp determines at the acquisition date the excess of the loan’s contractually required payments over all cash flows expected to be collected as an amount that should not be accreted into interest income (nonaccretable
difference). The remaining amount representing the difference in the expected cash flows of acquired loans and the initial investment in the acquired loans is accreted into interest income over the remaining life of the loan or pool of loans
(accretable yield). Subsequent to the acquisition date, increases in expected cash flows over those expected at the acquisition date are recognized prospectively as interest income over the remaining life of the loan. The present value of any
decreases in expected cash flows resulting directly from a change in the contractual interest rate are recognized prospectively as a reduction of the accretable yield. The present value of any decreases in expected cash flows after the acquisition
date as a result of credit deterioration is recognized by recording an ALLL or a direct

charge-off.

Subsequent to the acquisition date, the methods utilized to estimate the required ALLL are similar to
originated loans. This method of accounting for loans acquired with deteriorated credit quality does not apply to loans carried at fair value, residential mortgage loans held for sale and loans under revolving credit agreements.

The Bancorp’s lease portfolio consists of both direct financing and leveraged leases.
Direct financing leases are carried at the aggregate of lease payments plus estimated residual value of the leased property, less unearned income. Interest income on direct financing leases is recognized over the term of the lease to achieve a
constant periodic rate of return on the outstanding investment.

100  Fifth Third Bancorp


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Leveraged leases are carried at the aggregate of lease payments (less
nonrecourse debt payments) plus estimated residual value of the leased property, less unearned income. Interest income on leveraged leases is recognized over the term of the lease to achieve a constant rate of return on the outstanding investment in
the lease, net of the related deferred income tax liability, in the years in which the net investment is positive.

Nonaccrual Loans and Leases

When a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, the accrual of interest, amortization of loan premium, accretion of loan discount and
amortization/accretion of deferred net direct loan origination fees are discontinued and all previously accrued and unpaid interest is charged against income. Commercial loans are placed on nonaccrual status when there is a clear indication that the
borrower’s cash flows may not be sufficient to meet payments as they become due. Such loans are also placed on nonaccrual status when the principal or interest is past due 90 days or more, unless the loan is both well-secured and in the process
of collection. The Bancorp classifies residential mortgage loans that have principal and interest payments that have become past due 150 days as nonaccrual unless the loan is both well-secured and in the process of collection. Residential mortgage
loans may stay on nonaccrual status for an extended time as the foreclosure process typically lasts longer than 180 days. Home equity loans and lines of credit are reported on nonaccrual status if principal or interest has been in default for 90
days or more unless the loan is both well-secured and in the process of collection. Home equity loans and lines of credit that have been in default for 60 days or more are also reported on nonaccrual status if the senior lien has been in default 120
days or more, unless the loan is both well secured and in the process of collection. Residential mortgage, home equity, automobile and other consumer loans and leases that have been modified in a TDR and subsequently become past due 90 days are
placed on nonaccrual status unless the loan is both well-secured and in the process of collection. Commercial and credit card loans that have been modified in a TDR are classified as nonaccrual unless such loans have sustained repayment performance
of six months or more and are reasonably assured of repayment in accordance with the restructured terms. Well-secured loans are collateralized by perfected security interests in real and/or personal property for which the Bancorp estimates proceeds
from the sale would be sufficient to recover the outstanding principal and accrued interest balance of the loan and pay all costs to sell the collateral. The Bancorp considers a loan in the process of collection if collection efforts or legal action
is proceeding and the Bancorp expects to collect funds sufficient to bring the loan current or recover the entire outstanding principal and accrued interest balance.

Nonaccrual commercial loans and nonaccrual credit card loans are generally accounted for on
the cost recovery method. The Bancorp believes the cost recovery method is appropriate for nonaccrual commercial loans and nonaccrual credit card loans because the assessment of collectability of the remaining recorded investment of these loans
involves a high degree of subjectivity and uncertainty due to the nature or absence of underlying collateral. Under the cost recovery method, any payments received are applied to reduce principal. Once the entire recorded investment is collected,
additional payments received are treated as recoveries of amounts previously

charged-off

until recovered in full, and any subsequent payments are treated as interest income. Nonaccrual residential mortgage
loans and other nonaccrual consumer loans are generally accounted for on the cash basis method. The Bancorp believes the cash basis method is

appropriate for nonaccrual residential mortgage and other nonaccrual consumer loans because such loans have generally been written down to estimated collateral values and the collectability of
the remaining investment involves only an assessment of the fair value of the underlying collateral, which can be measured more objectively with a lesser degree of uncertainty than assessments of typical commercial loan collateral. Under the cash
basis method, interest income is recognized when cash is received, to the extent such income would have been accrued on the loan’s remaining balance at the contractual rate. Nonaccrual loans may be returned to accrual status when all delinquent
interest and principal payments become current in accordance with the loan agreement and are reasonably assured of repayment in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan agreement, or when the loan is both well-secured and in the process of
collection.

Commercial loans on nonaccrual status, including those modified in a TDR, as well as criticized commercial
loans with aggregate borrower relationships exceeding $1 million, are subject to an individual review to identify charge-offs. The Bancorp does not have an established delinquency threshold for partially or fully charging off commercial loans.
Residential mortgage loans, home equity loans and lines of credit and credit card loans that have principal and interest payments that have become past due 180 days are assessed for a

charge-off

to the ALLL,
unless such loans are both well-secured and in the process of collection. Home equity loans and lines of credit are also assessed for

charge-off

to the ALLL when such loans or lines of credit have become past
due 120 days if the senior lien is also 120 days past due, unless such loans are both well-secured and in the process of collection. Automobile and other consumer loans and leases that have principal and interest payments that have become past due
120 days are assessed for a

charge-off

to the ALLL, unless such loans are both well-secured and in the process of collection.

Restructured Loans and Leases

A loan
is accounted for as a TDR if the Bancorp, for economic or legal reasons related to the borrower’s financial difficulties, grants a concession to the borrower that it would not otherwise consider. A TDR typically involves a modification of terms
such as a reduction of the stated interest rate or remaining principal amount of the loan, a reduction of accrued interest or an extension of the maturity date at a stated interest rate lower than the current market rate for a new loan with similar
risk. In 2012, the OCC, a national bank regulatory agency, issued interpretive guidance that requires

non-reaffirmed

loans included in Chapter 7 bankruptcy filings to be accounted for as nonperforming TDRs and
collateral dependent loans regardless of their payment history and capacity to pay in the future. The Bancorp’s banking subsidiary is a state chartered bank which therefore is not subject to guidance of the OCC. The Bancorp does not consider
the bankruptcy court’s discharge of the borrower’s debt a concession when the discharged debt is not reaffirmed and as such, these loans are classified as TDRs only if one or more of the previously mentioned concessions are granted.

The Bancorp measures the impairment loss of a TDR based on the difference between the original
loan’s carrying amount and the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the original, effective yield of the loan. Residential mortgage loans, home equity loans, automobile loans and other consumer loans modified as part of a
TDR are maintained on accrual status, provided there is reasonable assurance of repayment and of performance according to the modified terms based upon a current, well-documented credit evaluation. Commercial loans and credit card loans modified as
part of a TDR are maintained on accrual status provided there is a sustained payment history of six months or more prior to the modification in accordance with the modified terms and collectability is reasonably assured for all remaining contractual
payments under the modified terms.

101  Fifth
Third Bancorp


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

TDRs of commercial loans and credit cards that do not have a sustained payment history of six months or more in accordance with their modified terms remain on nonaccrual status until a six month
payment history is sustained. In certain cases, commercial TDRs on nonaccrual status may be accounted for using the cash basis method for income recognition, provided that full repayment of principal under the modified terms of the loan is
reasonably assured.

Impaired Loans and Leases

A loan is considered to be impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Bancorp will be unable to collect
all amounts due (including both principal and interest) according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Impaired loans generally consist of nonaccrual loans and leases, loans modified in a TDR and loans over $1 million that are
currently on accrual status and not yet modified in a TDR, but for which the Bancorp has determined that it is probable that it will grant a payment concession in the near term due to the borrower’s financial difficulties. For loans modified in
a TDR, the contractual terms of the loan agreement refer to the terms specified in the original loan agreement. A loan restructured in a TDR is no longer considered impaired in years after the restructuring if the restructuring agreement specifies a
rate equal to or greater than the rate the Bancorp was willing to accept at the time of the restructuring for a new loan with comparable risk and the loan is not impaired based on the terms specified by the restructuring agreement. Refer to the ALLL
section for discussion regarding the Bancorp’s methodology for identifying impaired loans and determination of the need for a loss accrual.

Loans Held for Sale

Loans held
for sale primarily represent conforming fixed-rate residential mortgage loans originated or acquired with the intent to sell in the secondary market and jumbo residential mortgage loans, commercial loans, other residential mortgage loans and other
consumer loans that management has the intent to sell. Loans held for sale may be carried at the lower of cost or fair value, or carried at fair value where the Bancorp has elected the fair value option of accounting under U.S. GAAP. The Bancorp has
elected to measure certain residential mortgage loans originated as held for sale under the fair value option. For loans in which the Bancorp has not elected the fair value option, the lower of cost or fair value is determined at the individual loan
level.

The fair value of residential mortgage loans held for sale for which the fair value election has been made is
estimated based upon mortgage-backed securities prices and spreads to those prices or, for certain ARM loans, DCF models that may incorporate the anticipated portfolio composition, credit spreads of asset-backed securities with similar collateral
and market conditions. The anticipated portfolio composition includes the effects of interest rate spreads and discount rates due to loan characteristics such as the state in which the loan was originated, the loan amount and the ARM margin. These
fair value marks are recorded as a component of noninterest income in mortgage banking net revenue. The Bancorp generally has commitments to sell residential mortgage loans held for sale in the secondary market. Gains or losses on sales are
recognized in mortgage banking net revenue.

Management’s intent to sell residential
mortgage loans classified as held for sale may change over time due to such factors as changes in the overall liquidity in markets or changes in characteristics specific to certain loans held for sale. Consequently, these loans may be reclassified
to loans held for investment and, thereafter, reported within the Bancorp’s residential mortgage

class of portfolio loans and leases. In such cases, the residential mortgage loans will continue to be measured at fair value, which is based on mortgage-backed securities prices, interest rate
risk and an internally developed credit component.

Loans held for sale are placed on nonaccrual status consistent with
the Bancorp’s nonaccrual policy for portfolio loans and leases.

OREO, which is included in other assets, represents property acquired through foreclosure or other proceedings and is carried at the lower of
cost or fair value, less costs to sell. All OREO property is periodically evaluated for impairment and decreases in carrying value are recognized as reductions in other noninterest income in the Consolidated Statements of Income. For
government-guaranteed mortgage loans, upon foreclosure, a separate other receivable is recognized if certain conditions are met for the amount of the loan balance (principal and interest) expected to be recovered from the guarantor. This receivable
is also included in other assets, separate from OREO, in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

ALLL

The Bancorp disaggregates its portfolio loans and leases into portfolio segments for purposes of determining the ALLL. The Bancorp’s
portfolio segments include commercial, residential mortgage and consumer. The Bancorp further disaggregates its portfolio segments into classes for purposes of monitoring and assessing credit quality based on certain risk characteristics. Classes
within the commercial portfolio segment include commercial and industrial, commercial mortgage owner-occupied, commercial mortgage nonowner-occupied, commercial construction and commercial leasing. The residential mortgage portfolio segment is also
considered a class. Classes within the consumer portfolio segment include home equity, automobile, credit card and other consumer loans and leases. For an analysis of the Bancorp’s ALLL by portfolio segment and credit quality information by
class, refer to Note 6.

The Bancorp maintains the ALLL to absorb probable loan and lease losses inherent in its
portfolio segments. The ALLL is maintained at a level the Bancorp considers to be adequate and is based on ongoing quarterly assessments and evaluations of the collectability and historical loss experience of loans and leases. Credit losses are
charged and recoveries are credited to the ALLL. Provisions for loan and lease losses are based on the Bancorp’s review of the historical credit loss experience and such factors that, in management’s judgment, deserve consideration under
existing economic conditions in estimating probable credit losses. The Bancorp’s strategy for credit risk management includes a combination of conservative exposure limits significantly below legal lending limits and conservative underwriting,
documentation and collections standards. The strategy also emphasizes diversification on a geographic, industry and customer level, regular credit examinations and quarterly management reviews of large credit exposures and loans experiencing
deterioration of credit quality.

The Bancorp’s methodology for determining the ALLL
is based on historical loss rates, current credit grades, specific allocation on loans modified in a TDR and impaired commercial credits above specified thresholds and other qualitative adjustments. Allowances on individual commercial loans, TDRs
and historical loss rates are reviewed quarterly and adjusted as necessary based on changing borrower and/or collateral conditions and actual collection and

charge-off

experience. An unallocated allowance is
maintained to recognize the imprecision in estimating and measuring losses when evaluating allowances for pools of loans.

102  Fifth Third Bancorp


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Larger commercial loans included within aggregate borrower relationship
balances exceeding $1 million that exhibit probable or observed credit weaknesses, as well as loans that have been modified in a TDR, are subject to individual review for impairment. The Bancorp considers the current value of collateral, credit
quality of any guarantees, the guarantor’s liquidity and willingness to cooperate, the loan structure and other factors when evaluating whether an individual loan is impaired. Other factors may include the industry and geographic region of the
borrower, size and financial condition of the borrower, cash flow and leverage of the borrower and the Bancorp’s evaluation of the borrower’s management. When individual loans are impaired, allowances are determined based on
management’s estimate of the borrower’s ability to repay the loan given the availability of collateral and other sources of cash flow, as well as an evaluation of legal options available to the Bancorp. Allowances for impaired loans are
measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s effective interest rate, fair value of the underlying collateral or readily observable secondary market values. The Bancorp evaluates the collectability
of both principal and interest when assessing the need for a loss accrual.

Historical credit loss rates are applied to
commercial loans that are not impaired or are impaired, but smaller than the established threshold of $1 million and thus not subject to specific allowance allocations. The loss rates are derived from migration analyses for several portfolio
stratifications, which track the historical net

charge-off

experience sustained on loans according to their internal risk grade. The risk grading system utilized for allowance analysis purposes encompasses ten
categories.

During 2016, the Bancorp refined its estimation techniques for the ALLL to introduce individual loss rate
migration analyses for several commercial loan portfolio stratifications as contrasted to the single composite loss rate migration analysis for the entire commercial loan portfolio which was used in prior periods. These refinements did not
substantively change any material aspect of the Bancorp’s overall approach in the determination of the ALLL and there have been no material changes in assumptions as compared to prior periods that impacted the determination of the current
period allowance.

Homogenous loans and leases in the residential mortgage and consumer portfolio segments are not
individually risk graded. Rather, standard credit scoring systems and delinquency monitoring are used to assess credit risks and allowances are established based on the expected net charge-offs. Loss rates are based on the trailing twelve month net

charge-off

history by loan category. Historical loss rates may be adjusted for certain prescriptive and qualitative factors that, in management’s judgment, are necessary to reflect losses inherent in the
portfolio. The prescriptive loss rate factors include adjustments for delinquency trends, LTV trends and refreshed FICO score trends.

The Bancorp also considers qualitative factors in determining the ALLL. These include adjustments for changes in policies or
procedures in underwriting, monitoring or collections, economic conditions, portfolio mix, lending and risk management personnel, results of internal audit and quality control reviews, collateral values and geographic concentrations. The Bancorp
considers home price index trends when determining the collateral value qualitative factor.

The Bancorp’s primary market areas for lending are the Midwestern and Southeastern
regions of the U.S. When evaluating the adequacy of allowances, consideration is given to these regional geographic concentrations and the closely associated effect changing economic conditions have on the Bancorp’s customers.

In the current year, the Bancorp has not substantively changed any material aspect to its overall approach to determining
its ALLL for any of its portfolio segments. There have been no material changes in criteria or estimation techniques as compared

to prior periods that impacted the determination of the current period ALLL for any of the Bancorp’s portfolio segments.

Reserve for Unfunded Commitments

The reserve for unfunded commitments is maintained at a level believed by management to be sufficient to absorb estimated probable losses
related to unfunded credit facilities and is included in other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The determination of the adequacy of the reserve is based upon an evaluation of the unfunded credit facilities, including an assessment of
historical commitment utilization experience, credit risk grading and historical loss rates based on credit grade migration. This process takes into consideration the same risk elements that are analyzed in the determination of the adequacy of the
Bancorp’s ALLL, as previously discussed. Net adjustments to the reserve for unfunded commitments are included in other noninterest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Loan Sales and Securitizations

The Bancorp periodically sells loans through either securitizations or individual loan sales in accordance with its investment policies. The
sold loans are removed from the balance sheet and a net gain or loss is recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements at the time of sale. The Bancorp typically isolates the loans through the use of a VIE and thus is required to assess whether
the entity holding the sold or securitized loans is a VIE and whether the Bancorp is the primary beneficiary and therefore consolidator of that VIE. If the Bancorp holds the power to direct activities most significant to the economic performance of
the VIE and has the obligation to absorb losses or right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE, then the Bancorp will generally be deemed the primary beneficiary of the VIE. If the Bancorp is determined not to be the
primary beneficiary of a VIE but holds a variable interest in the entity, such variable interests are accounted for under the equity method of accounting or other accounting standards as appropriate. Refer to Note 11 for further information on
consolidated and

non-consolidated

VIEs.

The
Bancorp’s loan sales and securitizations are generally structured with servicing retained. As a result, servicing rights resulting from residential mortgage loan sales are initially recorded at fair value and subsequently amortized in
proportion to and over the period of estimated net servicing revenues and are reported as a component of mortgage banking net revenue in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Servicing rights are assessed for impairment monthly, based on fair
value, with temporary impairment recognized through a valuation allowance and other-than-temporary impairment recognized through a

write-off

of the servicing asset and related valuation allowance. Key economic
assumptions used in measuring any potential impairment of the servicing rights include the prepayment speeds of the underlying loans, the weighted-average life and the OAS spread, as applicable. The primary risk of material changes to the value of
the servicing rights resides in the potential volatility in the economic assumptions used, particularly the prepayment speeds. The Bancorp monitors risk and adjusts its valuation allowance as necessary to adequately reserve for impairment in the
servicing portfolio. For purposes of measuring impairment, the mortgage servicing rights are stratified into classes based on the financial asset type (fixed-rate vs. adjustable-rate) and interest rates. Fees received for servicing loans owned by
investors are based on a percentage of the outstanding monthly principal balance of such loans and are included in noninterest income in the Consolidated Statements of Income as loan payments are received. Costs of servicing loans are charged to
expense as incurred.

103  Fifth Third Bancorp


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Reserve for Representation and Warranty Provisions

Conforming residential mortgage loans sold to unrelated third parties are generally sold with representation and warranty provisions. A
contractual liability arises only in the event of a breach of these representations and warranties and, in general, only when a loss results from the breach. The Bancorp may be required to repurchase any previously sold loan or indemnify (make
whole) the investor or insurer for which the representation or warranty of the Bancorp proves to be inaccurate, incomplete or misleading. The Bancorp establishes a residential mortgage repurchase reserve related to various representations and
warranties that reflects management’s estimate of losses based on a combination of factors.

The Bancorp’s
estimation process requires management to make subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain, such as future demand expectations, economic factors and the specific characteristics of the loans subject to repurchase.
Such factors incorporate historical investor audit and repurchase demand rates, appeals success rates, historical loss severity and any additional information obtained from the GSEs regarding future mortgage repurchase and file request criteria. At
the time of a loan sale, the Bancorp records a representation and warranty reserve at the estimated fair value of the Bancorp’s guarantee and continually updates the reserve during the life of the loan as losses in excess of the reserve become
probable and reasonably estimable. The provision for the estimated fair value of the representation and warranty guarantee arising from the loan sales is recorded as an adjustment to the gain on sale, which is included in other noninterest income at
the time of sale. Updates to the reserve are recorded in other noninterest expense.

Legal Contingencies

The Bancorp and its subsidiaries are parties to numerous claims and lawsuits as well as threatened or potential actions or claims concerning
matters arising from the conduct of its business activities. The outcome of claims or litigation and the timing of ultimate resolution are inherently difficult to predict and significant judgment may be required in the determination of both the
probability of loss and whether the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable. The Bancorp’s estimates are subjective and are based on the status of legal and regulatory proceedings, the merit of the Bancorp’s defenses and consultation
with internal and external legal counsel. An accrual for a potential litigation loss is established when information related to the loss contingency indicates both that a loss is probable and that the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. This
accrual is included in other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and is adjusted from time to time as appropriate to reflect changes in circumstances. Legal expenses are recorded in other noninterest expense in the Consolidated Statements
of Income.

Bank Premises and Equipment and Other Long-Lived Assets

Bank premises and equipment, including leasehold improvements, are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization.
Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method based on estimated useful lives of the assets for book purposes, while accelerated depreciation is used for income tax purposes. Amortization of leasehold improvements is computed using the
straight-line method over the lives of the related leases or useful lives of the related assets, whichever is shorter. Whenever events or changes in circumstances dictate, the Bancorp tests its long-lived assets for impairment by determining whether
the sum of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows attributable to a long-lived asset or asset group is less than the carrying amount of the long-lived asset or asset group through a probability-weighted approach.

In the event the carrying amount of the long-lived asset or asset group is not recoverable, an impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the long-lived asset or
asset group exceeds its fair value. Maintenance, repairs and minor improvements are charged to noninterest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income as incurred.

Derivative Financial Instruments

The Bancorp accounts for its derivatives as either assets or liabilities measured at fair value through adjustments to AOCI and/or current
earnings, as appropriate. On the date the Bancorp enters into a derivative contract, the Bancorp designates the derivative instrument as either a fair value hedge, cash flow hedge or as a free-standing derivative instrument. For a fair value hedge,
changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument and changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability attributable to the hedged risk are recorded in current period net income. For a cash flow hedge, changes in the fair value of the
derivative instrument, to the extent that it is effective, are recorded in AOCI and subsequently reclassified to net income in the same period(s) that the hedged transaction impacts net income. For free-standing derivative instruments, changes in
fair values are reported in current period net income.

Prior to entering into a hedge transaction, the Bancorp formally
documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item, as well as the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge transaction. This process includes linking the derivative instrument designated as a fair
value or cash flow hedge to a specific asset or liability on the balance sheet or to specific forecasted transactions and the risk being hedged, along with a formal assessment at both inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis as to the
effectiveness of the derivative instrument in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the hedged item. If it is determined that the derivative instrument is not highly effective as a hedge, hedge accounting is discontinued.

Tax Receivable Agreements

In
conjunction with Vantiv, Inc.’s IPO in 2012, the Bancorp entered into two TRAs with Vantiv, Inc. The TRAs provide for payments by Vantiv, Inc. to the Bancorp of 85% of the cash savings actually realized as a result of the increase in tax basis
that results from the historical or future purchase of equity in Vantiv Holding, LLC from the Bancorp or from the exchange of equity units in Vantiv Holding, LLC for cash or Class A Stock, as well as any tax benefits attributable to payments
made under the TRA. Any actual increase in tax basis, as well as the amount and timing of any payments made under the TRA depend on a number of uncertain factors, the most significant of which is the realization of the tax benefits by Vantiv, Inc.,
which depends on the amount and timing of Vantiv, Inc.’s reportable taxable income. The Bancorp accounts for these TRAs as gain contingencies and recognizes income when all uncertainties surrounding the realization of such amounts are resolved.

Income Taxes

The Bancorp
accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for expected future tax consequences. Under the asset and liability method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are
determined by applying the federal and state tax rates to the differences between financial statement carrying amounts and the corresponding tax bases of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are also recorded for any tax attributes, such as
tax credits and net operating loss carryforwards. The net balances of deferred tax assets and liabilities are reported in other assets and accrued taxes, interest and expenses in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

104  Fifth Third Bancorp


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Any effect of a change in federal or state tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income tax expense in the period that includes the enactment date. The Bancorp
reflects the expected amount of income tax to be paid or refunded during the year as current income tax expense or benefit. Accrued taxes represent the net expected amount due to and/or from taxing jurisdictions and are reported in accrued taxes,
interest and expenses in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

The Bancorp evaluates the realization of deferred tax assets
based on all positive and negative evidence available at the balance sheet date. Realization of deferred tax assets is based on the Bancorp’s judgment about relevant factors affecting their realization, including the taxable income within any
applicable carryback periods, future projected taxable income, the reversal of taxable temporary differences and

tax-planning

strategies. The Bancorp records a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets where
the Bancorp does not believe that it is

more-likely-than-not

that the deferred tax assets will be realized.

Income tax benefits from uncertain tax positions are recognized in the financial statements only if the Bancorp believes
that it is

more-likely-than-not

that the uncertain tax position will be sustained based solely on the technical merits of the tax position and consideration of the relevant taxing authority’s widely
understood administrative practices and precedents. If the Bancorp does not believe that it is

more-likely-than-not

that an uncertain tax position will be sustained, the Bancorp records a liability for the
uncertain tax position. If the Bancorp believes that it is more likely than not that an uncertain tax position will be sustained, the Bancorp only records a tax benefit for the portion of the uncertain tax position where the likelihood of
realization is greater than 50% upon settlement with the relevant taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. The Bancorp recognizes interest expense, interest income and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits
within current income tax expense. Refer to Note 20 for further discussion regarding income taxes.

Earnings Per Share

Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of
common stock outstanding during the period. Earnings per diluted share is computed by dividing adjusted net income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock and common stock equivalents outstanding
during the period. Dilutive common stock equivalents represent the assumed conversion of dilutive convertible preferred stock, the exercise of dilutive stock-based awards and warrants and the dilutive effect of the settlement of outstanding forward
contracts.

The Bancorp calculates earnings per share pursuant to the

two-class

method. The

two-class

method is an earnings allocation formula that determines earnings per share separately for common stock and participating securities according to dividends declared and participation
rights in undistributed earnings. For purposes of calculating earnings per share under the

two-class

method, restricted shares that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends are considered participating
securities until vested. While the dividends declared per share on such restricted shares are the same as dividends declared per common share outstanding, the dividends recognized on such restricted shares may be less because dividends paid on
restricted shares that are expected to be forfeited are reclassified to compensation expense during the period when forfeiture is expected.

Goodwill

Business combinations entered into by the Bancorp typically include the acquisition of goodwill. Goodwill is required to be tested for
impairment at the Bancorp’s reporting unit level on an annual basis, which for the Bancorp is September 30, and more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that there may be impairment. The Bancorp has determined that its segments
qualify as reporting units under U.S. GAAP.

Impairment exists when a reporting unit’s carrying amount of goodwill
exceeds its implied fair value. In testing goodwill for impairment, U.S. GAAP permits the Bancorp to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying
amount. In this qualitative assessment, the Bancorp evaluates events and circumstances which may include, but are not limited to, the general economic environment, banking industry and market conditions, the overall financial performance of the
Bancorp, the performance of the Bancorp’s common stock, the key financial performance metrics of the Bancorp’s reporting units and events affecting the reporting units. If, after assessing the totality of events and circumstances, the
Bancorp determines it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then performing the

two-step

impairment test would be unnecessary. However, if the
Bancorp concludes otherwise or elects to bypass the qualitative assessment, it would then be required to perform the first step (Step 1) of the goodwill impairment test, and continue to the second step (Step 2), if necessary. Step 1 of the goodwill
impairment test compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount
of impairment loss, if any.

The fair value of a reporting unit is the price that would be received to sell the unit as
a whole in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. As none of the Bancorp’s reporting units are publicly traded, individual reporting unit fair value determinations cannot be directly correlated to the
Bancorp’s stock price. To determine the fair value of a reporting unit, the Bancorp employs an income-based approach, utilizing the reporting unit’s forecasted cash flows (including a terminal value approach to estimate cash flows beyond
the final year of the forecast) and the reporting unit’s estimated cost of equity as the discount rate. Additionally, the Bancorp determines its market capitalization based on the average of the closing price of the Bancorp’s stock during
the month including the measurement date, incorporating an additional control premium, and compares this market-based fair value measurement to the aggregate fair value of the Bancorp’s reporting units in order to corroborate the results of the
income approach.

When required to perform Step 2, the Bancorp compares the implied fair value of a reporting
unit’s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount exceeds the implied fair value, an impairment loss equal to that excess amount is recognized. A recognized impairment loss cannot exceed the carrying amount of
that goodwill and cannot be reversed in future periods even if the fair value of the reporting unit subsequently recovers.

During Step 2, the Bancorp determines the implied fair value of goodwill for a reporting unit by assigning the fair value of
the reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit (including any unrecognized intangible assets) as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination. The excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the
amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill. This assignment process is only performed for purposes of testing goodwill for impairment.

105  Fifth
Third Bancorp


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The Bancorp does not adjust the carrying values of recognized assets or liabilities (other than goodwill, if appropriate), nor does it recognize previously unrecognized intangible assets in the
Consolidated Financial Statements as a result of this assignment process. Refer to Note 9 for further information regarding the Bancorp’s goodwill.

Fair Value Measurements

The
Bancorp measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between
market participants at the measurement date. Valuation techniques the Bancorp uses to measure fair value include the market approach, income approach and cost approach. The market approach uses prices or relevant information generated by market
transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities. The income approach involves discounting future amounts to a single present amount and is based on current market expectations about those future amounts. The cost approach is
based on the amount that currently would be required to replace the service capacity of the asset.

U.S. GAAP
establishes a fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets
or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). A financial instrument’s categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the instrument’s fair
value measurement. The three levels within the fair value hierarchy are described as follows:

Level


– Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
that the Bancorp has the ability to access at the measurement date.

Level


– Inputs
other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 2 inputs include: quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for
identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability; and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by
correlation or other means.

Level


– Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability
for which there is little, if any, market activity at the measurement date. Unobservable inputs reflect the Bancorp’s own assumptions about what market participants would use to price the asset or liability. The inputs are developed based on
the best information available in the circumstances, which might include the Bancorp’s own financial data such as internally developed pricing models and DCF methodologies, as well as instruments for which the fair value determination requires
significant management judgment.

The Bancorp’s fair value measurements involve various valuation techniques and
models, which involve inputs that are observable, when available. Valuation techniques and parameters used for measuring assets and liabilities are reviewed and validated by the Bancorp on a quarterly basis. Additionally, the Bancorp monitors the
fair values of significant assets and liabilities using a variety of methods including the evaluation of pricing runs and exception reports based on certain analytical criteria, comparison to previous trades and overall review and assessments for
reasonableness. The Bancorp may, as a practical expedient, measure the

fair value of certain investments on the basis of the net asset value per share of the investment, or its equivalent. Any investments which are valued using this practical expedient are not
classified in the fair value hierarchy. Refer to Note 27 for further information on fair value measurements.

Stock-Based Compensation

The Bancorp recognizes compensation expense for the grant-date fair value of stock-based awards that are expected to vest over the requisite
service period. All awards, both those with cliff vesting and graded vesting, are expensed on a straight-line basis. Awards to employees that meet eligible retirement status are expensed immediately. As compensation expense is recognized, a deferred
tax asset is recorded that represents an estimate of the future tax deduction from exercise or release of restrictions. At the time awards are exercised, cancelled, expire or restrictions are released, the Bancorp recognizes an adjustment to income
tax expense for the difference between the previously estimated tax deduction and the actual tax deduction realized. For further information on the Bancorp’s stock-based compensation plans, refer to Note 24.

Pension Plans

The Bancorp uses
an expected long-term rate of return applied to the fair market value of assets as of the beginning of the year and the expected cash flow during the year for calculating the expected investment return on all pension plan assets. Amortization of the
net gain or loss resulting from experience different from that assumed and from changes in assumptions (excluding asset gains and losses not yet reflected in market-related value) is included as a component of net periodic benefit cost. If, as of
the beginning of the year, that net gain or loss exceeds 10% of the greater of the projected benefit obligation and the market-related value of plan assets, the amortization is that excess divided by the average remaining service period of
participating employees expected to receive benefits under the plan. The Bancorp uses a third-party actuary to compute the remaining service period of participating employees. This period reflects expected turnover,

pre-retirement

mortality and other applicable employee demographics.

Other

Securities and other property held by Fifth Third Wealth and Asset Management, a division of the Bancorp’s banking subsidiary, in a
fiduciary or agency capacity are not included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets because such items are not assets of the subsidiaries. Wealth and asset management revenue in the Consolidated Statements of Income is recognized on the accrual basis.
Wealth and asset management service revenues are recognized monthly based on a fee charged per transaction processed and/or a fee charged on the market value of average account balances associated with individual contracts.

The Bancorp recognizes revenue from its card and processing services on an accrual basis as such services are performed,
recording revenues net of certain costs (primarily interchange fees charged by credit card associations) not controlled by the Bancorp.

The Bancorp purchases life insurance policies on the lives of certain directors, officers and employees and is the owner and
beneficiary of the policies. The Bancorp invests in these policies, known as BOLI, to provide an efficient form of funding for long-term retirement and other employee benefits costs. The Bancorp records these BOLI policies within other assets in the
Consolidated Balance Sheets at each policy’s respective cash surrender value, with changes recorded in other noninterest income in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Other intangible assets consist of core deposit intangibles, customer lists,

non-compete

agreements and cardholder relationships.

106  Fifth Third Bancorp


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Other intangible assets are amortized on either a straight-line or an accelerated basis over their estimated useful lives. The Bancorp reviews other intangible assets for impairment whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate that carrying amounts may not be recoverable.

Securities sold under
repurchase agreements are accounted for as secured borrowings and included in other short-term borrowings in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at the amounts at which the securities were sold plus accrued interest.

Acquisitions of treasury stock are carried at cost. Reissuance of shares in treasury for acquisitions, exercises of
stock-based awards or other corporate purposes is recorded based on the specific identification method.

Advertising
costs are generally expensed as incurred.

ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING DEVELOPMENTS

Standards Adopted in 2016

The
Bancorp adopted the following new accounting standards effective January 1, 2016:

ASU

2014-12

– Compensation—Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Accounting for Share-Based Payments When the Terms of an Award Provide That a Performance Target Could Be Achieved after the Requisite Service
Period

In June 2014, the FASB issued ASU

2014-12

which clarifies that a performance target
that affects vesting and can be achieved after the requisite service period be treated as a performance condition. The amended guidance provides that an entity should apply existing guidance as it relates to awards with performance conditions that
affect vesting to account for such awards. As such, the performance target should not be reflected in estimating the grant-date fair value of the award. Compensation cost should be recognized in the period in which it becomes probable that the
performance target will be achieved and should represent the compensation cost attributable to the period(s) for which the requisite service has already been rendered. If the performance target becomes probable of being achieved before the end of
the requisite service period, the remaining unrecognized compensation cost should be recognized prospectively over the remaining requisite service period. The total amount of compensation cost recognized during and after the requisite service period
should reflect the number of awards that are expected to vest and should be adjusted to reflect those awards that ultimately vest. The requisite service period ends when the employee can cease rendering service and still be eligible to vest in the
award if the performance target is achieved. The Bancorp adopted the amended guidance prospectively and the adoption did not have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements.

ASU

2014-13

– Consolidation (Topic 810): Measuring the Financial Assets and the Financial
Liabilities of a Consolidated Collateralized Financing Entity

In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU

2014-13

which provides an alternative to ASC Topic 820: Fair Value Measurement for measuring the financial assets and financial liabilities of a CFE, such as a collateralized debt obligation or a
collateralized loan obligation entity consolidated as a VIE when a) all of the financial assets and the financial liabilities of that CFE are measured at fair value in the Consolidated Financial Statements and b) the changes in the fair values of
those financial assets and financial liabilities are reflected in earnings. If elected, the measurement alternative would allow the Bancorp to measure both the financial assets and the financial liabilities of the CFE by using the more observable of
the fair value of the financial assets or the fair value of the financial liabilities and to eliminate any measurement difference. When the measurement alternative is not elected for a consolidated

CFE within the scope of this amended guidance, the amendments clarify that 1) the fair value of the financial assets and the fair value of the financial liabilities of the consolidated CFE should
be measured using the requirements of Topic 820 and 2) any difference in the fair value of the financial assets and the fair value of the financial liabilities of that consolidated CFE should be reflected in earnings and attributed to the Bancorp in
the Consolidated Statements of Income. The Bancorp adopted the amended guidance retrospectively and the adoption did not have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements.

ASU

2014-16

– Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Determining Whether the Host Contract in a
Hybrid Financial Instrument Issued in the Form of a Share Is More Akin to Debt or to Equity

In November 2014, the FASB issued ASU

2014-16

which clarifies how current U.S. GAAP should be interpreted in evaluating the economic characteristics and risks of a host contract in a hybrid financial instrument that is issued in the form of a share.
Specifically, the amendments clarify that an entity should consider all relevant terms and features, including the embedded derivative features being evaluated for bifurcation, in evaluating the nature of the host contract. Furthermore, the
amendments clarify that no single term or feature would necessarily determine the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract. Rather, the nature of the host contract depends upon the economic characteristics and risks of the entire
hybrid financial instrument. The Bancorp adopted the amended guidance on a modified retrospective basis and the adoption did not have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements.

ASU

2015-01

– Income Statement—Extraordinary and Unusual Items (Subtopic

225-20):

Simplifying Income Statement Presentation by Eliminating the Concept of Extraordinary Items

In January 2015, the FASB issued ASU

2015-01

which eliminates the concept of extraordinary items from
U.S. GAAP. Previously, an event or transaction was presumed to be an ordinary and usual activity of a reporting entity unless evidence clearly supported its classification as an extraordinary item, which had to be both unusual in nature and
infrequent in occurrence. An entity was required to segregate the extraordinary item from the results of ordinary operations and show the item separately in the income statement, net of tax, after income from continuing operations. An entity was
also required to disclose applicable income taxes and either present or disclose earnings per share data applicable to the extraordinary item. The presentation and disclosure guidance for items that are unusual in nature or occur infrequently will
be retained and will be expanded to include items that are both unusual in nature and infrequently occurring. The Bancorp adopted the amended guidance prospectively and the adoption did not have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial
Statements.

ASU

2015-02

– Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation
Analysis

In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU

2015-02

which changes the analysis a reporting
entity must perform to determine whether it should consolidate certain types of legal entities. The amended guidance 1) modifies the evaluation of whether limited partnerships and similar legal entities are VIEs or voting interest entities; 2)
eliminates the presumption that a general partner should consolidate a limited partnership; 3) affects the consolidation analysis of reporting entities that are involved with VIEs, particularly those that have fee arrangements and related party
relationships; and 4) provides a scope exception from consolidation guidance for reporting entities that are required to comply with or operate in accordance with requirements that are similar to those in

Rule 2a-7

of the Investment Company Act of 1940 for registered money market funds.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The Bancorp adopted the amended guidance on a modified retrospective basis and the adoption did not have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements.

ASU

2015-03

– Interest—Imputation of Interest (Subtopic

835-30):

Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs

In April 2015, the FASB issued
ASU

2015-03

which requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent
with debt discounts. The recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs are not affected by the amended guidance. Subsequent to issuance of ASU

2015-03,

the FASB also issued ASU

2015-15

to incorporate comments from the SEC that its staff would not object to an entity deferring and presenting debt issuance costs for

line-of-credit

arrangements as an asset and subsequently amortizing these costs ratably over the term of the line of credit arrangement, regardless of whether there were
any outstanding borrowings on the line of credit arrangement. The Bancorp adopted the amended guidance in ASU

2015-03

and ASU

2015-15

retrospectively. Upon adoption, the
Bancorp reclassified approximately $34 million of debt issuance costs from other assets to a direct deduction from long-term debt in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

ASU

2015-04

– Practical Expedient for the Measurement Date of an Employer’s Defined
Benefit Obligation and Plan Assets

In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU

2015-04

which
simplifies an entity’s measurement of the fair value of plan assets of a defined benefit pension or other postretirement benefit plan when the fiscal

year-end

does not coincide with a month end. For an
entity with a fiscal

year-end

that does not coincide with a

month-end,

the amended guidance provides a practical expedient that permits the entity to measure defined
benefit plan assets and obligations using the

month-end

that is closest to the entity’s fiscal

year-end

and apply that practical expedient consistently from year to
year. The Bancorp adopted the amended guidance prospectively on January 1, 2016 and the adoption did not have an impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements as the Bancorp’s fiscal

year-end

coincides with a

month-end.

ASU

–
Intangibles—Goodwill and

Other—Internal-Use

Software (Subtopic

350-40):

Customer’s Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement

In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU

2015-05

which amended guidance on a customer’s accounting for
fees paid in a cloud computing arrangement. Under the amended guidance, if a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license, then the customer should account for the software license element of the arrangement consistent with the
acquisition of other software licenses. If a cloud computing arrangement does not include a software license, the customer should account for the arrangement as a service contract. The Bancorp adopted the amended guidance prospectively to all
arrangements entered into or materially modified after the effective date. The adoption did not have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements.

ASU

2015-07

– Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosures for Investments in Certain
Entities That Calculate Net Asset Value per Share (or Its Equivalent)

In May 2015, the FASB issued ASU

2015-07

which removes the requirement to categorize within the fair value hierarchy all investments for which fair value is measured using the net asset value per share practical expedient. The amended
guidance also

removes the requirement to make certain disclosures for all investments that are eligible to be measured at fair value using the net asset value per share practical expedient. Rather, those
disclosures are limited to investments for which the entity has elected to measure the fair value using that practical expedient. The Bancorp adopted the amended guidance retrospectively and the adoption did not have a material impact on the
Consolidated Financial Statements.

ASU

2015-16

– Business Combinations (Topic 805):
Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments

In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU

2015-16

to simplify the accounting for adjustments made to provisional amounts recognized in a business combination. The amended guidance eliminates the requirement to retrospectively account for those
adjustments and requires that an acquirer recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. The acquirer shall record, in the same
period’s financial statements, the effect on earnings of changes in depreciation, amortization or other income effects, if any, as a result of the change to the provisional amounts, calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the
acquisition date. The amended guidance requires an entity to present separately on the face of the income statement or disclose in the notes the portion of the amount recorded in current-period earnings by line item that would have been recorded in
previous reporting periods if the adjustment to the provisional amounts had been recognized as of the acquisition date. The Bancorp adopted the amended guidance prospectively and the adoption did not have a material impact on the Consolidated
Financial Statements.

ASU

2016-09

– Compensation—Stock Compensation (Topic 718):
Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU

2016-09

to simplify the accounting for share-based compensation paid to employees. The amended guidance 1) requires excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies on share-based payments to employees to be
recognized directly to income tax expense or benefit in the Consolidated Income Statements; 2) requires excess tax benefits to be included as operating activities on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows; 3) provides entities with the option of
making an accounting policy election to account for forfeitures of share-based payments as they occur instead of estimating the awards expected to be forfeited; and 4) changes the threshold to qualify for equity classification to permit withholdings
up to the maximum statutory tax rate in the applicable jurisdiction. In addition, excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies are considered discrete items in the reporting period they occur and are not included in the estimate of an entity’s
annual effective tax rate.

As permitted, the Bancorp elected to early adopt the amended
guidance during the fourth quarter of 2016 with an effective date of January 1, 2016. The changes to the recognition of excess tax benefits were applied prospectively beginning January 1, 2016, resulting in a reclassification from capital
surplus to income tax expense for the excess tax benefits originally recorded to capital surplus during 2016. This reclassification did not materially impact the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2016 but the
reclassification did affect previously reported results for interim periods. Net tax deficiencies of $1 million, $5 million and $0 were reclassified from capital surplus to applicable income tax expense during the three months ended
March 31, 2016, June 30, 2016 and September 30, 2016, respectively, related to the adoption. The Bancorp adopted the amendments to presentation requirements for the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows on a prospective basis and the
impact of adopting these amendments was not material.

108  Fifth Third Bancorp


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The Bancorp elected to continue estimating awards expected to be forfeited, and therefore this amended guidance did not have an impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements. The amended
guidance also contained other provisions which either did not apply to the Bancorp or did not have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements upon adoption.

Standards Issued but Not Yet Adopted

The following accounting standards were issued but not yet adopted by the Bancorp as of December 31, 2016:

ASU

2014-09

– Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU

2014-09

which outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to
use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most contract revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance. The core principle of the amended guidance is that an entity should recognize
revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Subsequent to the issuance of ASU

2014-09,

the FASB has issued additional guidance to clarify certain implementation issues, including ASUs

2016-08

(Principal versus Agent Considerations),

2016-10

(Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing),

2016-12

(Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients), and

2016-20

(Technical Corrections and Improvements) in March, April, May and December 2016, respectively. These amendments do not change the core principles in ASU

2014-09

and the effective date and transition
requirements are consistent with those in the original ASU. The Bancorp plans to adopt the amended guidance on its required effective date of January 1, 2018, using a modified retrospective approach, with the cumulative effect of initially
applying the amendments recognized at the date of initial application. Because the amended guidance does not apply to revenue associated with financial instruments, including loans and securities that are accounted for under other U.S. GAAP, the
Bancorp’s preliminary analysis suggests that the adoption of this amended guidance is not expected to have a material impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements, although the Bancorp will also be subject to expanded disclosure requirements
upon adoption and the Bancorp’s revenue recognition processes for wealth and asset management revenue, corporate banking revenue, and card and processing revenue may be affected. However, there are certain areas of the amended guidance, such as
credit card interchange fees and related rewards programs, which are subject to interpretation and for which the Bancorp has not made final conclusions regarding the applicability and the related impact, if any. Accordingly, the results of the
Bancorp’s materiality analysis, as well as its selected adoption method, may change as these conclusions are reached.

ASU

2016-01

– Financial Instruments—Overall (Subtopic

825-10):

Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities

In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU

2016-01

which revises an entity’s accounting related to 1)
the classification and measurement of investments in equity securities, 2) the presentation of certain fair value changes for financial liabilities measured at fair value, and 3) certain disclosure requirements associated with the fair value of
financial instruments. The amendments require equity investments (except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation of the investee) to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value
recognized in net income. However, an entity may choose to measure equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes as a result of an observable price change. The amendments
also simplify the impairment assessment of equity

investments for which fair value is not readily determinable by requiring an entity to perform a qualitative assessment to identify impairment. If qualitative indicators are identified, the
entity will be required to measure the investment at fair value. For financial liabilities that an entity has elected to measure at fair value, the amendments require an entity to present separately in other comprehensive income the portion of the
change in fair value that results from a change in instrument-specific credit risk. For public business entities, the amendments 1) eliminate the requirement to disclose the method(s) and significant assumptions used to estimate fair value for
financial instruments measured at amortized cost and 2) require, for disclosure purposes, the use of an exit price notion in the determination of the fair value of financial instruments. The Bancorp plans to adopt the amended guidance on its
required effective date of January 1, 2018. Upon adoption, the Bancorp will be required to make a cumulative-effect adjustment to the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. The guidance on equity
securities without a readily determinable fair value will be applied prospectively to all equity investments that exist as of the date of adoption. Early adoption of the amendments is not permitted with the exception of the presentation of certain
fair value changes for financial liabilities measured at fair value for which early application is permitted. The Bancorp is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the amended guidance on its Consolidated Financial Statements.

ASU

2016-02

– Leases (Topic 842)

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU

2016-02

which establishes a new accounting model for leases. The
amended guidance requires lessees to record lease liabilities on the lessees’ balance sheets along with corresponding

right-of-use

assets for all leases with terms
longer than twelve months. Leases will be classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the lessee’s statements of income. From a lessor perspective, the accounting model is
largely unchanged, except that the amended guidance includes certain targeted improvements to align, where necessary, lessor accounting with the lessee accounting model and the revenue recognition guidance in ASC Topic 606. The amendments also
modify disclosure requirements for an entity’s lease arrangements. The amended guidance is effective for the Bancorp on January 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted. The amendments should be applied to each prior reporting period
presented using a modified retrospective approach, although the amended guidance contains certain transition relief provisions that, among other things, permit an entity to elect not to reassess the classification of leases which existed or expired
as of the date the amendments are effective. The Bancorp is currently in the process of developing an inventory of all leases and accumulating the lease data necessary to apply the amended guidance. The Bancorp is continuing to evaluate the impact
of the amended guidance on its Consolidated Financial Statements, but the effects of recognizing most operating leases on the Consolidated Balance Sheets are expected to be material. The Bancorp expects to recognize

right-of-use

assets and lease liabilities for substantially all of its operating lease commitments disclosed in Note 7 based on the present value of unpaid lease payments as of the date of adoption.

ASU

2016-04

– Liabilities—Extinguishments of Liabilities (Subtopic

405-20):

Recognition of Breakage for Certain Prepaid Stored-Value Products

In March 2016, the FASB
issued ASU

2016-04

which permits proportional derecognition of the liability for unused funds on certain prepaid stored-value products (known as breakage) to the extent that it is probable that a significant
reversal of the recognized breakage amount will not subsequently occur.

109  Fifth Third Bancorp


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The amendments do not apply to any prepaid stored-value products that are attached to a segregated customer deposit account, or products for which unused funds are subject to unclaimed property
remittance laws. The amended guidance may be applied retrospectively to all comparable periods presented in the year of adoption or applied on a modified retrospective basis by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the
beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. The Bancorp plans to adopt the amended guidance on its required effective date of January 1, 2018 and is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the amended guidance on its Consolidated
Financial Statements. However, the Bancorp’s preliminary analysis suggests that most of its prepaid stored-value products will not be affected by the amended guidance.

ASU

2016-05

– Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Effect of Derivative Contract Novations on
Existing Hedge Accounting Relationships

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU

2016-05

which
clarifies that a change in counterparty in a derivative contract does not, in and of itself, represent a change in critical terms that would require discontinuation of hedge accounting provided that other hedge accounting criteria continue to be
met. The Bancorp adopted the amended guidance prospectively on January 1, 2017. The adoption did not have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements.

ASU

2016-06

– Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Contingent Put and Call Options in Debt
Instruments

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU

2016-06

which clarifies the requirements for
determining when contingent put and call options embedded in debt instruments should be bifurcated from the debt instrument and accounted for separately as derivatives. A four-step decision sequence should be followed in determining whether such
options are clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of the debt instrument, which determines whether bifurcation is necessary. The Bancorp adopted the amended guidance on January 1, 2017 on a modified retrospective
basis. The adoption did not have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements.

ASU

2016-07

– Investments—Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323): Simplifying the Transition to the Equity Method of Accounting

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU

2016-07

to eliminate the requirement that when an investment
qualifies for use of the equity method as a result of an increase in the level of ownership interest or degree of influence, an investor must adjust the investment, results of operations and retained earnings retroactively on a

step-by-step

basis as if the equity method had been in effect during all previous periods that the investment had been held. The amendments require that the equity method
investor add the cost of acquiring the additional interest in the investee to the current basis of the investor’s previously held interest and adopt the equity method of accounting as of the date the investment becomes qualified for equity
method accounting, eliminating the requirement to retrospectively apply the equity method of accounting back to the date of the initial investment. The Bancorp adopted the amended guidance prospectively on January 1, 2017. The adoption did not
have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements.

ASU

2016-13

– Financial
Instruments—Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments

In June 2016, the FASB issued
ASU

2016-13

which establishes a new approach to estimate credit losses on certain types of financial instruments. The new approach changes the impairment model for most financial assets, and will require the
use of an “expected credit loss” model for financial instruments measured at amortized cost and certain other instruments, including trade and other

receivables, loans, debt securities, net investments in leases, and

off-balance-sheet

credit exposures (such as loan commitments, standby letters of
credit, and financial guarantees not accounted for as insurance). This model requires entities to estimate the lifetime expected credit loss on such instruments and record an allowance that represents the portion of the amortized cost basis that the
entity does not expect to collect. This allowance is deducted from the financial asset’s amortized cost basis to present the net amount expected to be collected. The new expected credit loss model will also apply to purchased financial assets
with credit deterioration, superseding current accounting guidance for such assets. The amended guidance also amends the impairment model for

available-for-sale

debt
securities, requiring entities to determine whether all or a portion of the unrealized loss on such securities is a credit loss, and also eliminating the option for management to consider the length of time a security has been in an unrealized loss
position as a factor in concluding whether or not a credit loss exists. The amended model states that an entity will recognize an allowance for credit losses on

available-for-sale

debt securities as a contra account to the amortized cost basis, instead of a direct reduction of the amortized cost basis of the investment, as under
current guidance. As a result, entities will recognize improvements to estimated credit losses on

available-for-sale

debt securities immediately in earnings as opposed
to interest income over time. There are also additional disclosure requirements included in this guidance. The amended guidance is effective for the Bancorp on January 1, 2020, with early adoption permitted as early as January 1, 2019. The
amended guidance is to be applied on a modified retrospective basis with the cumulative effect of initially applying the amendments recognized in retained earnings at the date of initial application. However, certain provisions of the guidance are
only required to be applied on a prospective basis. While the Bancorp is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the amended guidance on its Consolidated Financial Statements, it currently expects the ALLL to increase upon adoption
given that the allowance will be required to cover the full remaining expected life of the portfolio upon adoption, rather than the incurred loss model under current U.S. GAAP. The extent of this increase is still being evaluated and will depend on
economic conditions and the composition of the Bancorp’s loan and lease portfolio at the time of adoption.

ASU

2016-15

– Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments

In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU

2016-15

to clarify the guidance for classification of certain cash
receipts and payments within an entity’s statements of cash flows. These items include debt prepayment or extinguishment costs, settlement of

zero-coupon

debt instruments, contingent consideration
payments made after a business combination, proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims, proceeds from the settlement of BOLI policies, distributions received from equity method investees, and beneficial interests in securitization
transactions. The amended guidance also specifies how to address classification of cash receipts and payments that have aspects of more than one class of cash flows. The amended guidance is effective for the Bancorp on January 1, 2018, with
early adoption permitted, and is to be applied on a retrospective basis unless it is impractical to do so. The Bancorp is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the amended guidance on its Consolidated Financial Statements.

ASU

2016-16

– Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory

In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU

2016-16

which requires an entity to recognize the income
tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs.

110  Fifth Third Bancorp


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Current U.S. GAAP prohibits the recognition of current and deferred income taxes for an intra-entity asset transfer until the asset has been sold to an outside party. The amended guidance is
effective for the Bancorp on January 1, 2018, with early adoption permitted, and is applied on a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative-effect adjustment directly to retained earnings as of the beginning of the fiscal year in which
the guidance is effective. The Bancorp is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the amended guidance on its Consolidated Financial Statements.

ASU

2016-17

– Consolidation (Topic 810): Interests Held Through Related Parties That Are
Under Common Control

In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU

2016-17

which changes the
accounting for the consolidation of VIEs in certain situations involving entities under common control. Specifically, the amendments change how the indirect interests held through related parties that are under common control should be included in a
reporting entity’s evaluation of whether it is a primary beneficiary of a VIE. Under the amended guidance, the reporting entity is only required to include the indirect interests held through related parties that are under common control in a
VIE on a proportionate basis. Currently, the indirect interests held by the related parties that are under common control are considered to be the equivalent of direct interests in their entirety. The Bancorp adopted the amended guidance
retrospectively on January 1, 2017. The adoption did not have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements.

ASU

2016-18

– Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash

In November 2016, the FASB
issued ASU

2016-18

to provide clarifying guidance on the classification and presentation of changes in restricted cash on an entity’s statements of cash flows. The guidance requires that restricted cash
be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the

beginning-of-period

and

end-of-period

total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows. The amended guidance is effective for the Bancorp on January 1, 2018, with early adoption
permitted, and is to be

applied retrospectively to all periods presented. The Bancorp is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the amended guidance on its Consolidated Financial Statements.

ASU

2017-01

– Business Combinations (Topic 805): Clarifying the Definition of a Business

In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU

2017-01

which clarifies the definition of a business in
order to assist entities with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions (or disposals) of assets or businesses. The amended guidance provides a screen which states that when substantially all of the fair value of assets
acquired (or disposed) is concentrated in a single asset or group of similar assets, then the set of assets and activities would not be considered a business. The amended guidance is effective for the Bancorp on January 1, 2018, and is to be
applied prospectively. The Bancorp is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the amended guidance on its Consolidated Financial Statements.

ASU

2017-04

– Intangibles—Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for
Goodwill Impairment

In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU

2017-04

which simplifies the test
for goodwill impairment by removing the second step, which measures the amount of impairment loss, if any. Instead, the amended guidance states that an entity should recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds
the reporting unit’s fair value, except that the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. This would apply to all reporting units, including those with zero or negative carrying amounts of
net assets. The amended guidance is effective for the Bancorp on January 1, 2020, and is to be applied prospectively. Early adoption is permitted. The Bancorp is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the amended guidance on its
Consolidated Financial Statements.

3. RESTRICTIONS ON CASH, DIVIDENDS AND OTHER CAPITAL ACTIONS

Reserve Requirement

The FRB, under Regulation D, requires that banks hold cash in reserve against deposit liabilities when total reservable deposit liabilities
are greater than the regulatory exemption, known as the reserve requirement. The reserve requirement is calculated based on a

two-week

average of daily net transaction account deposits as defined by the FRB
and may be satisfied with average vault cash during the following

two-week

maintenance period. When vault cash is not sufficient to meet the reserve requirement, the remaining amount must be satisfied with
average funds held at the FRB. The noninterest-bearing portion of the Bancorp’s deposit at

the FRB is held in cash and due from banks in the Consolidated Balance Sheets while the interest-bearing portion is held in other short-term investments in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. At
December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Bancorp’s banking subsidiary reserve requirement was $1.6 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively. Additionally, the Bancorp’s banking subsidiary average reserve requirement was
$1.6 billion and $1.8 billion in 2016 and 2015, respectively.

111  Fifth Third Bancorp


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Restrictions on Cash Dividends

The principal source of income and funds for the Bancorp (parent company) are dividends from its subsidiaries. The dividends paid by the
Bancorp’s banking subsidiary are subject to regulations and limitations prescribed by state and federal supervisory agencies. The Bancorp’s banking subsidiary paid the Bancorp’s nonbank subsidiary holding company, which in turn paid
the Bancorp $1.9 billion and $1.0 billion in dividends during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The Bancorp’s nonbank-subsidiaries are also limited by certain federal and state statutory provisions and
regulations covering the amount of dividends that may be paid in any given year.

Capital Actions

In 2011, the FRB adopted the capital plan rule, which requires BHCs with consolidated assets of $50 billion or more to submit annual
capital plans to the FRB for review. Under the rule, these capital plans must include detailed descriptions of the following: the BHC’s internal processes for assessing capital adequacy; the policies governing capital actions such as common
stock issuances, dividends and share repurchases; and all planned capital actions over a nine-quarter planning horizon. Further, each BHC must also report to the FRB the results of stress tests conducted by the BHC under a number of scenarios that
assess the sources and uses of capital under baseline and stressed economic scenarios. The FRB launched the 2016 stress testing program and CCAR on January 28, 2016, with firm submissions of stress test results and capital plans due to the FRB
on April 5, 2016, which the Bancorp submitted as required.

The FRB’s review of the capital plan assessed the
comprehensiveness of the capital plan, the reasonableness of the assumptions and the analysis underlying the capital plan. Additionally, the FRB reviewed the robustness of the capital adequacy process, the capital policy and the Bancorp’s
ability to maintain capital above each minimum regulatory capital ratio on a pro forma basis under expected and stressful conditions throughout the planning horizon.

On June 29, 2016, the Bancorp announced the results of its capital plan submitted to the FRB as part of the 2016 CCAR.
For BHCs that proposed capital distributions in their plans, the FRB either objected to the plan or provided a

non-objection

whereby the FRB permitted the proposed capital distributions. The FRB indicated to
the Bancorp that it did not object to the following capital actions for the period beginning July 1, 2016 and ending June 30, 2017:

●

The potential increase in the quarterly common stock dividend to $0.14 in the fourth quarter of 2016;

●

The potential repurchase of common shares in an amount up to $660 million, which includes
$84 million in repurchases related to share issuances under employee benefit plans;

●

The additional ability to repurchase shares in the amount of any realized

after-tax

gains from the sale of Vantiv, Inc. common stock, if executed;

●

The additional ability to repurchase shares in the amount of any realized

after-tax

gains from the termination and settlement of any portion of the TRA with Vantiv, Inc., if executed.

As contemplated by the 2015 CCAR, during the first quarter of 2016, the Bancorp entered into a $240 million
accelerated share repurchase transaction and during the second quarter of 2016, the Bancorp repurchased approximately $26 million of its outstanding common stock through open market share repurchase transactions. Additionally, as contemplated
by the 2016 CCAR, the Bancorp entered into $240 million and $155 million accelerated share repurchase transactions during the third and fourth quarters of 2016, respectively. For further information, refer to Note 23. In the fourth quarter
of 2016, the Bancorp increased the quarterly common stock dividend to $0.14.

Additionally, as a CCAR institution, the
Bancorp is required to disclose the results of its

company-run

stress test under the supervisory severely adverse scenario and to provide information related to the types of risk included in its stress
testing; a general description of the methodologies used; estimates of certain financial results and pro forma capital ratios; and an explanation of the most significant causes of changes in regulatory capital ratios. On June 23, 2016 the
Bancorp publicly disclosed the results of its

company-run

stress test as required by the DFA stress testing rules in a press release.

The BHCs that participated in the 2016 CCAR, including the Bancorp, were required to also conduct

mid-cycle

company-run

stress tests using data as of June 30, 2016. The stress tests must be based on three BHC defined scenarios – baseline, adverse and severely
adverse. The Bancorp reported its

mid-cycle

stress test results to the FRB by the required October 5, 2016 submission date. In addition, the Bancorp published a Form

8-K

providing a summary of the results under the severely adverse scenario on October 27, 2016. These results represented estimates of the Bancorp’s results from the third quarter of 2016 through the
third quarter of 2018 under the severely adverse scenario, which is considered highly unlikely to occur.

5. LOANS AND LEASES

The Bancorp diversifies its loan and lease portfolio by offering a variety of loan and lease
products with various payment terms and rate structures. Lending activities are generally concentrated within those states in which the Bancorp has banking centers and are primarily located in the Midwestern and Southeastern regions of the U.S. The
Bancorp’s commercial loan portfolio consists of

lending to various industry types. Management periodically reviews the performance of its loan and lease products to evaluate whether they are performing within acceptable interest rate and
credit risk levels and changes are made to underwriting policies and procedures as needed. The Bancorp maintains an allowance to absorb loan and lease losses inherent in the portfolio. For further information on credit quality and the ALLL, refer to
Note 6.

Third Bancorp


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

CREDIT RISK PROFILE

Commercial Portfolio Segment

For
purposes of analyzing historic loss rates used in the determination of the ALLL and monitoring the credit quality and risk characteristics of its commercial portfolio segment, the Bancorp disaggregates the segment into the following classes:
commercial and industrial, commercial mortgage owner-occupied, commercial mortgage nonowner-occupied, commercial construction and commercial leases.

To facilitate the monitoring of credit quality within the commercial portfolio segment, and for purposes of analyzing
historical loss rates used in the determination of the ALLL for the commercial portfolio segment, the Bancorp utilizes the following categories of credit grades: pass, special mention, substandard, doubtful and loss. The five categories, which are
derived from standard regulatory rating definitions, are assigned upon initial approval of credit to borrowers and updated periodically thereafter.

Pass ratings, which are assigned to those borrowers that do not have identified potential or well defined weaknesses and for
which there is a high likelihood of orderly repayment, are updated at least annually based on the size and credit characteristics of the borrower. All other categories are updated on a quarterly basis during the month preceding the end of the
calendar quarter.

The Bancorp assigns a special mention rating to loans and leases that have potential weaknesses that
deserve management’s close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses

may, at some future date, result in the deterioration of the repayment prospects for the loan or lease or the Bancorp’s credit position.

The Bancorp assigns a substandard rating to loans and leases that are inadequately protected by the current sound worth and
paying capacity of the borrower or of the collateral pledged. Substandard loans and leases have well defined weaknesses or weaknesses that could jeopardize the orderly repayment of the debt. Loans and leases in this grade also are characterized by
the distinct possibility that the Bancorp will sustain some loss if the deficiencies noted are not addressed and corrected.

The Bancorp assigns a doubtful rating to loans and leases that have all the attributes of a substandard rating with the
added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable. The possibility of loss is extremely high, but because of certain
important and reasonable specific pending factors that may work to the advantage of and strengthen the credit quality of the loan or lease, its classification as an estimated loss is deferred until its more exact status may be determined. Pending
factors may include a proposed merger or acquisition, liquidation proceeding, capital injection, perfecting liens on additional collateral or refinancing plans.

Loans and leases classified as loss are considered uncollectible and are

charged-off

in the period in which they are determined to be uncollectible. Because loans and leases in this category are fully

charged-off,

they are not included in the following tables.

Residential Mortgage and Consumer Portfolio Segments

For purposes of monitoring the credit quality and risk characteristics of its consumer portfolio segment, the Bancorp disaggregates the
segment into the following classes: home equity, automobile loans, credit card and other consumer loans and leases. The Bancorp’s residential mortgage portfolio segment is also a separate class.

The Bancorp considers repayment performance as the best indicator of credit quality for residential mortgage and consumer

loans, which includes both the delinquency status and performing versus nonperforming status of the loans. The delinquency status of all residential mortgage and consumer loans is presented by
class in the age analysis section while the performing versus nonperforming status is presented in the following table. Refer to the nonaccrual loans and leases section of Note 1 for additional information on delinquency and nonperforming loan

Impaired Portfolio Loans and Leases

Larger commercial loans and leases included within aggregate borrower relationship balances exceeding $1 million that exhibit probable or
observed credit weaknesses are subject to individual review for impairment. The Bancorp also performs an individual review on loans and leases that are restructured in a TDR. The

Bancorp considers the current value of collateral, credit quality of any guarantees, the loan structure and other factors when evaluating whether an individual loan or lease is impaired. Other
factors may include the geography and industry of the borrower, size and financial condition of the borrower, cash flow and leverage of the borrower and the Bancorp’s evaluation of the borrower’s management. Smaller-balance homogenous
loans or leases that are collectively evaluated for impairment are not included in the following tables.

Troubled Debt Restructurings

If
a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty, the Bancorp may consider, in certain circumstances, modifying the terms of their loan to maximize collection of amounts due. Within each of the Bancorp’s loan classes, TDRs typically involve
either a reduction of the stated interest rate of the loan, an extension of the loan’s maturity date with a stated rate lower than the current market rate for a new loan with similar risk, or in limited circumstances, a reduction of the
principal balance of the loan or the loan’s accrued interest. Modifying the terms of a loan may result in an increase or decrease to the ALLL depending upon the terms modified, the method used to measure the ALLL for a loan prior to
modification, and whether any charge-offs were recorded on the loan before or at the time of modification. Refer to the ALLL section of Note 1 for information on the Bancorp’s ALLL methodology. Upon modification of a loan, the Bancorp measures

the related impairment as the difference between the estimated future cash flows expected to be collected on the modified loan, discounted at the original effective yield of the loan, and the
carrying value of the loan. The resulting measurement may result in the need for minimal or no valuation allowance because it is probable that all cash flows will be collected under the modified terms of the loan. In addition, if the stated interest
rate was increased in a TDR, the cash flows on the modified loan, using the

pre-modification

interest rate as the discount rate, often exceed the recorded investment of the loan. Conversely, upon a
modification that reduces the stated interest rate on a loan, the Bancorp recognizes an impairment loss as an increase to the ALLL. If a TDR involves a reduction of the principal balance of the loan or the loan’s accrued interest, that amount
is

charged-off

to the ALLL.

As of December 31, 2016, the Bancorp had
$82 million and $57 million in line of credit and letter of credit commitments, respectively, compared to $39 million and $23 million in line of credit and letter of credit commitments as of December 31, 2015, respectively,
to lend additional funds to borrowers whose terms have been modified in a TDR.

The Bancorp considers TDRs that become 90 days or more past due under the modified terms as
subsequently defaulted. For commercial loans not subject to individual review for impairment, loss rates that are applied for purposes of determining the ALLL include historical losses associated with subsequent defaults on loans previously modified
in a TDR. For consumer loans, the Bancorp performs a qualitative assessment of the adequacy of the consumer ALLL by comparing the consumer ALLL to forecasted consumer losses over the projected loss emergence period (the forecasted losses include the
impact of subsequent defaults of

consumer TDRs). When a residential mortgage, home equity, automobile or other consumer loan
that has been modified in a TDR subsequently defaults, the present value of expected cash flows used in the measurement of the potential impairment loss is generally limited to the expected net proceeds from the sale of the loan’s underlying
collateral and any resulting impairment loss is reflected as a

charge-off

or an increase in ALLL. The Bancorp recognizes ALLL for the entire balance of the credit card loans modified in a TDR that subsequently
default.

The Bancorp monitors changing customer preferences associated with the channels it uses for banking transactions to evaluate
the efficiency, competitiveness and quality of the customer service experience in its consumer distribution network. As part of this ongoing assessment, the Bancorp may determine that it is no longer fully committed to maintaining full-service
branches at certain of its existing banking center locations. Similarly, the Bancorp may also determine that it is no longer fully committed to building banking centers on certain parcels of land which had previously been held for future branch
expansion.

On June 16, 2015, the Bancorp’s Board of Directors authorized management to pursue a plan to
further develop its distribution strategy, including a plan to consolidate and/or sell certain operating branch locations and certain parcels of undeveloped land that had been acquired by the Bancorp for future branch expansion (the “Branch
Consolidation and Sales Plan”). In addition, the Bancorp announced on September 13, 2016 that it had identified an additional 44 branch locations and 5 parcels of undeveloped land that it planned to consolidate or sell.

On January 29, 2016, the Bancorp closed the previously announced sale in the St. Louis MSA to Great Southern Bank and
recorded a gain on the sale of $8 million in other noninterest income in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Additionally, on April 22, 2016, the Bancorp closed the previously announced sale in the Pittsburgh MSA to First National Bank
of Pennsylvania and recorded a gain on the sale of $11 million in other noninterest income in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Both transactions were part of the Branch Consolidation and Sales Plan.

As of December 31, 2016, the Bancorp had 64 branch locations and 35 parcels of undeveloped land that had been acquired
for future branch expansion that it intended to consolidate or sell. These branch locations and parcels of undeveloped land, which include unsold properties from the Branch Consolidation and Sales Plan as well as properties included in the
September 13,

2016 announcement, represent $39 million, $16 million and $1 million of land and improvements, buildings and equipment, respectively, included in bank premises and equipment in the
Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2016, of which $29 million, $9 million and $1 million, respectively, were classified as held for sale.

The Bancorp performs assessments of the recoverability of long-lived assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate
that their carrying values may not be recoverable. Impairment losses associated with such assessments and lower of cost or market adjustments were $32 million, $109 million and $20 million for the years ended December 31, 2016,
2015 and 2014, respectively. The recognized impairment losses were recorded in other noninterest income in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

On September 29, 2016, the Bancorp closed on the sale of an office complex. The sale also included all of the
Bancorp’s rights, title and interest as a landlord under existing leases in the complex. Under the terms of the transaction, the Bancorp received proceeds of approximately $31 million and entered into a lease agreement whereby the Bancorp
leased-back approximately 25% of the office complex. In conjunction with the transaction, which qualified as a sale-leaseback under U.S. GAAP, the Bancorp retired assets with a net book value of approximately $10 million, recognized a deferred
gain of $10 million, which is being amortized as a reduction of rent expense over the 15 year lease term, and recorded a gain on the transaction of $11 million in other noninterest income in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Gross occupancy expense for cancelable and noncancelable leases, which is included in net occupancy expense in the
Consolidated Statements of Income, was $100 million, $110 million and $100 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, which was reduced by rental income from leased premises of $16 million,
$18 million and $17 million during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The Bancorp’s subsidiaries have entered into a number of noncancelable operating and capital lease agreements with respect to bank
premises and equipment.

were $20 million and $36 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The recognized impairment losses were recorded in corporate banking revenue in the
Consolidated Statements of Income.

9. GOODWILL

Business combinations entered into by the Bancorp typically include the acquisition of
goodwill. Acquisition activity includes acquisitions in the respective period in addition to purchase accounting adjustments related to previous acquisitions. The Bancorp completed its annual goodwill impairment test as of September 30, 2016 by
performing a qualitative assessment of goodwill at the reporting unit level to determine whether any indicators of impairment existed. In performing this qualitative assessment, the Bancorp evaluated events and circumstances since

the last impairment analysis, macroeconomic conditions, banking industry and market conditions and key financial metrics of the Bancorp as well as reporting unit and overall Bancorp financial
performance. After assessing the totality of the events and circumstances, the Bancorp determined that it was not more likely than not that the fair values of the Commercial Banking, Branch Banking and Wealth and Asset Management reporting units
were less than their respective carrying amounts and, therefore, the first and second steps of the quantitative goodwill impairment test were deemed unnecessary.

Changes in the net

11. VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES

The Bancorp, in the normal course of business, engages in a variety of activities that involve
VIEs, which are legal entities that lack sufficient equity at risk to finance their activities without additional subordinated financial support or the equity investors of the entities as a group lack any of the characteristics of a controlling
interest. The Bancorp evaluates its interest in certain entities to determine if these entities meet the definition of a VIE and whether the Bancorp is the primary beneficiary and should consolidate the entity based on the variable interests it held
both at

inception and when there is a change in circumstances that requires a reconsideration. If the Bancorp is determined to be the primary beneficiary of a VIE, it must account for the VIE as a
consolidated subsidiary. If the Bancorp is determined not to be the primary beneficiary of a VIE but holds a variable interest in the entity, such variable interests are accounted for under the equity method of accounting or other accounting
standards as appropriate.

Automobile loan securitizations

In securitization transactions that occurred during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Bancorp transferred an aggregate
amount of $750 million and $3.8 billion, respectively, in consumer automobile loans to bankruptcy remote trusts which were deemed to be VIEs. The primary purposes of the VIEs were

to issue asset-backed securities with varying levels of credit subordination and payment priority, as well as residual interests, and to provide the Bancorp with access to liquidity for its
originated loans. The Bancorp retained residual interests in the VIEs and, therefore, has an obligation to absorb losses and a right to receive benefits from the VIEs that could potentially be significant to the VIEs.

In addition, the Bancorp retained servicing rights for the underlying loans and, therefore, holds the power to direct the activities of the VIEs that most significantly impact the economic
performance of the VIEs. As a result, the Bancorp concluded that it is the primary beneficiary of the VIEs and, therefore, has consolidated these VIEs. The assets of the VIEs are restricted to the settlement of the asset-backed securities and other
obligations of the VIEs. Third-party holders of the notes do not have recourse to the general assets of the Bancorp.

The economic performance of the VIEs is most significantly impacted by the performance of the underlying loans. The
principal risks to which the VIEs are exposed include credit risk and prepayment risk. The credit and prepayment risks are managed through credit enhancements in the form of reserve accounts, overcollateralization, excess interest on the loans and
the subordination of certain classes of asset-backed securities to other classes.

CDC investments

CDC, a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of the Bancorp, was created to invest in projects to create affordable housing, revitalize business
and residential areas and preserve historic landmarks. CDC generally

co-invests

with other unrelated companies and/or individuals and typically makes investments in a separate legal entity that owns the
property under development. The entities are usually formed as limited partnerships and LLCs and CDC typically invests as a limited partner/investor member in the form of equity contributions. The economic performance of the VIEs is driven by the
performance of their underlying investment projects

as well as the VIEs’ ability to operate in compliance with the rules and regulations necessary for the qualification of tax credits generated by equity investments. The Bancorp’s
subsidiaries serve as the managing member of certain LLCs invested in business revitalization projects and have the right to make decisions that most significantly impact the economic performance of the LLCs. Additionally, the investor members do
not own substantive

kick-out

rights or substantive participating rights over the managing member. The Bancorp has provided an indemnification guarantee to the investor member of these LLCs related to the
qualification of tax credits generated by the investor members’ investment. Accordingly, the Bancorp concluded that it is the primary beneficiary and, therefore, has consolidated these VIEs. As a result, the investor members’ interests in
these VIEs are presented as noncontrolling interests in the Consolidated Financial Statements. This presentation includes reporting separately the equity attributable to the noncontrolling interests in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and
Consolidated Statements of Changes in Equity and reporting separately the comprehensive income attributable to the noncontrolling interests in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income and the net income attributable to the noncontrolling
interests in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The Bancorp’s maximum exposure related to these indemnifications at December 31, 2016 and 2015 was $31 million and $27 million, respectively, which is based on an amount
required to meet the investor member’s defined target rate of return.

Non-consolidated

VIEs

The following tables provide a summary of assets and liabilities carried on the Consolidated Balance Sheets related to

non-consolidated

VIEs for which the Bancorp holds an interest, but is not the primary beneficiary of the VIE, as well as the Bancorp’s maximum exposure to losses associated with its interests in the entities as

CDC investments

As noted previously, CDC typically invests in VIEs as a limited partner or investor member in the form of equity contributions and has no
substantive

kick-out

or substantive participating rights over the managing member. The Bancorp has determined that it is not the primary beneficiary of these VIEs because it lacks the power to direct the
activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the underlying project or the VIEs’ ability to operate in compliance with the rules and regulations necessary for the qualification of tax credits generated by equity
investments. This power is held by the managing members who exercise full and exclusive control of the operations of the VIEs. Accordingly, the Bancorp accounts for these investments under the equity method of accounting.

The Bancorp’s funding requirements are limited to its invested capital and any additional unfunded commitments for
future equity contributions. The Bancorp’s maximum exposure to loss as a result of its involvement with the VIEs is limited to the carrying amounts of the investments, including the unfunded

commitments. The carrying amounts of these investments, which are included in other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and the liabilities related to the unfunded commitments, which are
included in other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, are included in the previous tables for all periods presented. The Bancorp has no other liquidity arrangements or obligations to purchase assets of the VIEs that would expose the
Bancorp to a loss. In certain arrangements, the general partner/managing member of the VIE has guaranteed a level of projected tax credits to be received by the limited partners/investor members, thereby minimizing a portion of the Bancorp’s
risk.

At both December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Bancorp’s CDC investments
included $1.3 billion of investments in affordable housing tax credits recognized in other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The unfunded commitments related to these investments were $349 million and $356 million at
December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The unfunded commitments as of December 31, 2016 are expected to be funded from 2017 to 2033.

Private equity investments

The Bancorp, through Fifth Third Capital Holdings, a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of the Bancorp, invests as a limited partner in private
equity investments which provide the Bancorp an opportunity to obtain higher rates of return on invested capital, while also creating cross-selling opportunities for the Bancorp’s commercial products. Each of the limited partnerships has an
unrelated third-party general partner responsible for appointing the fund manager. The Bancorp has not been appointed fund manager for any of these private equity investments. The funds finance primarily all of their activities from the
partners’ capital contributions and investment returns. The Bancorp has determined that it is not the primary beneficiary of the funds because it does not have the obligation to absorb the funds’ expected losses or the right to receive the
funds’ expected residual returns that could potentially be significant to the funds and lacks the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the funds. The Bancorp, as a limited partner, does not
have substantive participating or substantive

kick-out

rights over the general partner. Therefore, the Bancorp accounts for its investments in these limited partnerships under the equity method of accounting.

The Bancorp is exposed to losses arising from the negative performance of the underlying investments in the private
equity investments. As a limited partner, the Bancorp’s maximum exposure to loss is limited to the carrying amounts of the investments plus unfunded commitments. The carrying amounts of these investments, which are included in other assets in
the Consolidated Balance Sheets, are included in the previous tables. Also, at December 31, 2016 and 2015, the unfunded commitment amounts to the funds were $56 million and $60 million, respectively. As part of previous commitments,
the Bancorp made capital contributions to private equity investments of $14 million and $30 million during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The Bancorp recognized $9 million and

$1 million of OTTI primarily associated with certain nonconforming investments affected by the Volcker Rule during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The Bancorp
did not recognize any OTTI during the year ended December 31, 2014. Refer to Note 27 for further information.

Loans provided to VIEs

The Bancorp has provided funding to certain unconsolidated VIEs sponsored by third parties. These VIEs are generally established to finance
certain consumer and small business loans originated by third parties. The entities are primarily funded through the issuance of a loan from the Bancorp or syndication through which the Bancorp is involved. The sponsor/administrator of the entities
is responsible for servicing the underlying assets in the VIEs. Because the sponsor/administrator, not the Bancorp, holds the servicing responsibilities, which include the establishment and employment of default mitigation policies and procedures,
the Bancorp does not hold the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the entity and, therefore, is not the primary beneficiary.

The principal risk to which these entities are exposed is credit risk related to the underlying assets. The Bancorp’s
maximum exposure to loss is equal to the carrying amounts of the loans and unfunded commitments to the VIEs. The Bancorp’s outstanding loans to these VIEs are included in commercial loans in Note 5. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the
Bancorp’s unfunded commitments to these entities were $937 million and $969 million, respectively. The loans and unfunded commitments to these VIEs are included in the Bancorp’s overall analysis of the ALLL and reserve for
unfunded commitments, respectively. The Bancorp does not provide any implicit or explicit liquidity guarantees or principal value guarantees to these VIEs.

12. SALES OF RECEIVABLES AND SERVICING RIGHTS

Residential Mortgage TDR Loan Sale

In March of 2015, the Bancorp recognized a $37 million gain, included in other noninterest income in the Consolidated Statements of
Income, on the sale of certain HFS residential mortgage loans with a carrying value of $568 million that were previously modified in a TDR. As part of this sale, the Bancorp provided certain standard representations and warranties which have
expired. Additionally, the Bancorp did not obtain servicing responsibilities on the sales of these loans and the investors have no credit recourse to the Bancorp’s other assets for failure of debtors to pay when due.

Residential Mortgage Loan Sales

The Bancorp sold fixed and adjustable-rate residential mortgage loans during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. In those
sales, the Bancorp obtained servicing responsibilities and provided certain standard representations and warranties, however the investors have no recourse to the Bancorp’s other assets for failure of debtors to pay when due. The Bancorp
receives annual servicing fees based on a percentage of the outstanding balance. The Bancorp identifies classes of servicing assets based on financial asset type and interest rates.

Information related to residential mortgage loan sales and the Bancorp’s mortgage banking
activity, which is included in mortgage banking net revenue in the Consolidated Statements of Income, for the years ended December 31 is as follows:

Temporary impairment or impairment recovery, effected through a change in the MSR valuation

valuation allowance is captured as a component of servicing rights on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Bancorp maintains a

non-qualifying

hedging strategy to manage a portion of the risk

associated with changes in the value of the MSR portfolio. This strategy includes the purchase of free-standing derivatives and various

available-for-sale

securities. The interest income,

mark-to-market

adjustments and gain or loss from sale activities associated
with these portfolios are expected to economically hedge a portion of the change in value of the MSR portfolio caused by fluctuating OAS spreads, earnings rates and prepayment speeds. The fair value of the servicing asset is based on the present
value of expected future cash flows.

Based on historical credit experience, expected credit losses for residential mortgage loan
servicing assets have been deemed immaterial, as the Bancorp sold the majority of the underlying loans without recourse. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Bancorp

serviced $53.6 billion and $59.0 billion, respectively, of residential mortgage loans for other investors. The value of MSRs that continue to be held by the Bancorp is subject to
credit, prepayment and interest rate risks on the sold financial assets.

At December 31, 2016,
the sensitivity of the current fair value of residual cash flows to immediate 10%, 20% and 50% adverse changes in prepayment speed assumptions and immediate 10% and 20% adverse changes in other assumptions are as follows:

The impact of the weighted-average default rate on the current fair value of residual cash flows for all
scenarios is immaterial.

These sensitivities are hypothetical and should be used with caution. As the figures indicate,
changes in fair value based on these variations in the assumptions typically cannot be extrapolated because the relationship of the change in assumption to the change in fair value may not be linear. The Bancorp believes variations of these levels
are reasonably possible; however, there is the potential that adverse changes in key assumptions could be even greater.

Also, in the previous table, the effect of a variation in a particular assumption on the fair value of the interests that continue to be held by the Bancorp is calculated without changing any
other assumption; in reality, changes in one factor may result in changes in another (for example, increases in market interest rates may result in lower prepayments), which might magnify or counteract these sensitivities.

Third Bancorp


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

13. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The Bancorp maintains an overall risk management strategy that incorporates the use of
derivative instruments to reduce certain risks related to interest rate, prepayment and foreign currency volatility. Additionally, the Bancorp holds derivative instruments for the benefit of its commercial customers and for other business purposes.
The Bancorp does not enter into unhedged speculative derivative positions.

The Bancorp’s interest rate risk
management strategy involves modifying the repricing characteristics of certain financial instruments so that changes in interest rates do not adversely affect the Bancorp’s net interest margin and cash flows. Derivative instruments that the
Bancorp may use as part of its interest rate risk management strategy include interest rate swaps, interest rate floors, interest rate caps, forward contracts, forward starting interest rate swaps, options and swaptions. Interest rate swap contracts
are exchanges of interest payments, such as fixed-rate payments for floating-rate payments, based on a stated notional amount and maturity date. Interest rate floors protect against declining rates, while interest rate caps protect against rising
interest rates. Forward contracts are contracts in which the buyer agrees to purchase, and the seller agrees to make delivery of, a specific financial instrument at a predetermined price or yield. Options provide the purchaser with the right, but
not the obligation, to purchase or sell a contracted item during a specified period at an agreed upon price. Swaptions are financial instruments granting the owner the right, but not the obligation, to enter into or cancel a swap.

Prepayment volatility arises mostly from changes in fair value of the largely fixed-rate MSR portfolio, mortgage loans and
mortgage-backed securities. The Bancorp may enter into various free-standing derivatives (principal-only swaps, interest rate swaptions, interest rate floors, mortgage options, TBAs and interest rate swaps) to economically hedge prepayment
volatility. Principal-only swaps are total return swaps based on changes in the value of the underlying mortgage principal-only trust.

TBAs are a forward purchase agreement for a mortgage-backed securities trade whereby the terms of the
security are undefined at the time the trade is made.

Foreign currency volatility occurs as the Bancorp enters into
certain loans denominated in foreign currencies. Derivative instruments that the Bancorp may use to economically hedge these foreign denominated loans include foreign exchange swaps and forward contracts.

The Bancorp also enters into derivative contracts (including foreign exchange contracts, commodity contracts and interest
rate contracts) for the benefit of commercial customers and other business purposes. The Bancorp economically hedges significant exposures related to these free-standing derivatives by entering into offsetting third-party contracts with approved,
reputable and independent counterparties with substantially matching terms and currencies. Credit risk arises from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts. The Bancorp’s exposure is limited to the
replacement value of the contracts rather than the notional, principal or contract amounts. Credit risk is minimized through credit approvals, limits, counterparty collateral and monitoring procedures.

The Bancorp’s derivative assets include certain contractual features in
which the Bancorp requires the counterparties to provide collateral in the form of cash and securities to offset changes in the fair value of the derivatives, including changes in the fair value due to credit risk of the counterparty. As of
December 31, 2016 and 2015, the balance of collateral held by the Bancorp for derivative assets was $444 million and $821 million, respectively. The credit component negatively impacting the fair value of derivative assets associated
with customer accommodation contracts as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 was $6 million and $9 million, respectively.

In measuring the fair value of derivative liabilities, the Bancorp considers its own credit risk, taking into consideration
collateral maintenance requirements of certain derivative counterparties and the duration of instruments with counterparties that do not require collateral maintenance. When necessary, the Bancorp posts collateral primarily in the form of cash and
securities to offset changes in fair value of the derivatives, including changes in fair value due to the Bancorp’s credit risk. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the balance of collateral posted by the Bancorp for derivative liabilities
was $399 million and $504 million, respectively. Certain of the Bancorp’s derivative liabilities contain credit-risk related contingent features that could result in the requirement to post additional collateral upon the occurrence of
specified events. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the fair value of the additional collateral that could be required to be posted as a result of the credit-risk related contingent features being triggered was immaterial to the Bancorp’s
Consolidated Financial Statements.

The posting of collateral has been determined to remove the need for further consideration of credit risk. As a result, the Bancorp determined that the impact of the Bancorp’s credit risk to the
valuation of its derivative liabilities was immaterial to the Bancorp’s Consolidated Financial Statements.

The
Bancorp holds certain derivative instruments that qualify for hedge accounting treatment and are designated as either fair value hedges or cash flow hedges. Derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, or for which
hedge accounting is not established, are held as free-standing derivatives. All customer accommodation derivatives are held as free-standing derivatives.

The fair value of derivative instruments is presented on a gross basis, even when the derivative instruments are subject to
master netting arrangements. Derivative instruments with a positive fair value are reported in other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets while derivative instruments with a negative fair value are reported in other liabilities in the
Consolidated Balance Sheets. Cash collateral payables and receivables associated with the derivative instruments are not added to or netted against the fair value amounts.

Fair Value Hedges

The Bancorp may enter into interest rate swaps to convert its fixed-rate funding to floating-rate. Decisions to convert fixed-rate funding to
floating are made primarily through consideration of the asset/liability mix of the Bancorp, the desired asset/liability sensitivity and interest rate levels. For all interest rate swaps as of December 31, 2016, an assessment of hedge
effectiveness using regression analysis was performed and such swaps were accounted for using the “long-haul”

method. The long-haul method requires a quarterly assessment of hedge effectiveness and measurement of ineffectiveness. For interest rate swaps accounted for as a fair value hedge using the
long-haul method, ineffectiveness is the difference between the changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap and changes in fair value of the related hedged item attributable to the risk being hedged. The ineffectiveness on interest rate
swaps hedging fixed-rate funding is reported within interest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Cash Flow Hedges

The Bancorp may enter into interest rate swaps to convert floating-rate assets and liabilities to fixed rates or to hedge certain forecasted
transactions. The assets or liabilities may be grouped in circumstances where they share the same risk exposure that the Bancorp desires to hedge. The Bancorp may also enter into interest rate caps and floors to limit cash flow variability of
floating-rate assets and liabilities. As of December 31, 2016, all hedges designated as cash flow hedges were assessed for effectiveness using regression analysis. Ineffectiveness is generally measured as the amount by which the cumulative
change in the fair value of the hedging instrument exceeds the present value of the cumulative change in the hedged item’s expected cash flows attributable to the risk being hedged. Ineffectiveness is reported within other noninterest income in
the Consolidated Statements of Income. The effective portion of the cumulative gains or losses on cash flow hedges are reported within AOCI and are reclassified from AOCI to current period earnings when the forecasted transaction affects earnings.
As of December 31, 2016, the maximum length of time

over which the Bancorp is hedging its exposure to the variability in future cash flows is 36 months.

Reclassified gains and losses on interest rate contracts related to commercial and industrial loans are recorded within
interest income in the Consolidated Statements of Income. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, $10 million and $22 million, respectively, of net deferred gains, net of tax, on cash flow hedges were recorded in AOCI in the Consolidated
Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2016, $15 million in net deferred gains, net of tax, recorded in AOCI are expected to be reclassified into earnings during the next twelve months. This amount could differ from amounts actually recognized
due to changes in interest rates, hedge

de-designations,

and the addition of other hedges subsequent to December 31, 2016.

During the years ended 2016 and 2015, there were no gains or losses reclassified from AOCI into earnings associated with the
discontinuance of cash flow hedges because it was probable that the original forecasted transaction would no longer occur by the end of the originally specified time period or within the additional period of time as defined by U.S. GAAP.

Free-Standing Derivative Instruments – Risk Management and Other Business Purposes

As part of its overall risk management strategy relative to its mortgage banking activity, the Bancorp may enter into various free-standing
derivatives (principal-only swaps, interest rate swaptions, interest rate floors, mortgage options, TBAs and interest rate swaps) to economically hedge changes in fair value of its largely fixed-rate MSR portfolio. Principal-only swaps hedge the
mortgage-LIBOR spread because these swaps appreciate in value as a result of tightening spreads. Principal-only swaps also provide prepayment protection by increasing in value when prepayment speeds increase, as opposed to MSRs that lose value in a
faster prepayment environment. Receive fixed/pay floating interest rate swaps and swaptions increase in value when interest rates do not increase as quickly as expected.

The Bancorp enters into forward contracts and mortgage options to economically hedge the change in fair value of certain
residential mortgage loans held for sale due to changes in interest rates. IRLCs issued on residential mortgage loan commitments that will be held for sale are also considered free-standing derivative instruments and the interest rate exposure on
these

commitments is economically hedged primarily with forward contracts. Revaluation gains and losses from free-standing derivatives related to mortgage banking activity are recorded as a component
of mortgage banking net revenue in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

In conjunction with the initial sale of the
Bancorp’s 51% interest in Vantiv Holding, LLC, the Bancorp received a warrant which is accounted for as a free-standing derivative. Refer to Note 27 for further discussion of significant inputs and assumptions used in the valuation of the
warrant. During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Bancorp both sold and exercised part of the warrant. During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Bancorp exercised the remaining portion of the warrant. For more information, refer to
Note 19.

Free-Standing Derivative Instruments – Customer Accommodation

The majority of the free-standing derivative instruments the Bancorp enters into are for the benefit of its commercial customers. These
derivative contracts are not designated against specific assets or liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets or to forecasted transactions and, therefore, do not qualify for hedge accounting. These instruments include foreign exchange
derivative contracts entered into for the benefit of commercial customers involved in international trade to hedge their exposure to foreign currency fluctuations and commodity contracts to hedge such items as natural gas and various other
derivative contracts. The Bancorp may economically hedge significant exposures related to these derivative contracts entered into for the benefit of customers by entering into offsetting contracts with approved, reputable, independent counterparties
with substantially matching terms. The Bancorp hedges its interest rate exposure on commercial customer transactions by executing offsetting swap agreements with primary dealers. Revaluation gains and losses on interest rate, foreign exchange,
commodity and other commercial customer derivative contracts are recorded as a component of corporate banking revenue in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

The Bancorp enters into risk participation agreements, under which the
Bancorp assumes credit exposure relating to certain underlying interest rate derivative contracts. The Bancorp only enters into these risk participation agreements in instances in which the Bancorp has participated in the loan that the underlying
interest rate derivative contract was designed to hedge. The Bancorp will make payments under these agreements if a customer defaults on its obligation to perform under the terms of the underlying interest rate derivative contract. As of
December 31, 2016 and 2015, the total notional amount of the risk participation agreements was $2.5 billion and $1.7 billion, respectively, and the fair value was a liability of $4 million at December 31, 2016 and
$3 million at December 31, 2015, which is included in other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2016, the risk participation agreements had a weighted-average remaining life of 3.1 years.

The Bancorp’s maximum exposure in the risk participation agreements is contingent on the fair value of the underlying
interest rate derivative contracts in an asset position at the time of default. The Bancorp monitors the credit risk associated with the underlying customers in the risk participation agreements through the same risk grading system currently
utilized for establishing loss reserves in its loan and lease portfolio.

Risk ratings of the
notional amount of risk participation agreements under this risk rating system are summarized in the following table:

Offsetting Derivative Financial Instruments

The Bancorp’s derivative transactions are generally governed by ISDA Master Agreements and similar arrangements, which include provisions
governing the setoff of assets and liabilities between the parties. When the Bancorp has more than one outstanding derivative transaction with a single counterparty, the setoff provisions contained within these agreements generally allow the

non-defaulting

party the right to reduce its liability to the defaulting

party by amounts eligible for setoff, including the collateral received as well as eligible offsetting transactions with that counterparty, irrespective of the currency, place of payment or
booking office. The Bancorp’s policy is to present its derivative assets and derivative liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets on a gross basis, even when provisions allowing for setoff are in place.

Collateral amounts included in the tables below consist primarily of cash and highly-rated government-backed securities.

CDC, a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of the Bancorp, was created to invest in projects to
create affordable housing, revitalize business and residential areas and preserve historic landmarks, which are included above in partnership investments. In addition, Fifth Third Capital Holdings, a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of the
Bancorp, invests as a direct private equity investor and as a limited partner in private equity funds, which are included above as partnership investments. The Bancorp has determined that these partnership investments are VIEs and the Bancorp’s

policy’s underlying investments. Refer to Note 1 for further information.

The Bancorp utilizes derivative instruments as part of its overall risk
management strategy to reduce certain risks related to interest rate, prepayment and foreign currency volatility. The Bancorp also holds derivatives instruments for the benefit of its commercial customers and for other business purposes. For further
information on derivative instruments, refer to Note 13.

In 2009, the Bancorp sold an approximate 51% interest in its

accounted for under the equity method of accounting. Refer to Note 19 for further information.

During 2016 the Bancorp
entered into an agreement with Vantiv, Inc. in which Vantiv, Inc. may be obligated to pay a total of approximately $171 million to the Bancorp to terminate and settle certain remaining TRA cash flows, totaling an estimated $394 million,
upon the exercise of certain call options by Vantiv, Inc. or certain put options by the Bancorp.

The Bancorp, in the normal course of business, enters into financial instruments and various
agreements to meet the financing needs of its customers. The Bancorp also enters into certain transactions and agreements to manage its interest rate and prepayment risks, provide funding, equipment and locations for its operations and invest in its
communities. These instruments and agreements involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit risk, counterparty risk and market risk in excess of the amounts recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

The creditworthiness of counterparties for all instruments and agreements is evaluated on a

case-by-case

basis in
accordance with the Bancorp’s credit policies. The Bancorp’s significant commitments, contingent liabilities and guarantees in excess of the amounts recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheets are discussed in further detail below:

Commitments to extend credit

Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend, typically having fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses that may require
payment of a fee. Since many of the commitments to extend credit may expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash flow requirements. The Bancorp is exposed to credit risk in the event of
nonperformance by the counterparty for the amount of the contract. Fixed-rate commitments are also

subject to market risk resulting from fluctuations in interest rates and the Bancorp’s exposure is limited to the replacement value of those commitments. As of December 31, 2016 and
2015, the Bancorp had a reserve for unfunded commitments, including letters of credit, totaling $161 million and $138 million, respectively, included in other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Bancorp monitors the credit
risk associated with commitments to extend credit using the same risk rating system utilized within its loan and lease portfolio.

Standby letters of credit accounted for 99% of total letters of credit at both
December 31, 2016 and 2015, and are considered guarantees in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Approximately 62% and 65% of the total standby letters of credit were collateralized as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. In the event of
nonperformance by the customers, the Bancorp has rights to the underlying collateral, which can include

commercial real estate, physical plant and property, inventory, receivables, cash and marketable securities. The reserve related to these standby letters of credit, which is included in the total
reserve for unfunded commitments, was $3 million at December 31, 2016 and immaterial at December 31, 2015. The Bancorp monitors the credit risk associated with letters of credit using the same risk rating system utilized within its
loan and lease portfolio.

At December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Bancorp had outstanding letters of credit that were
supporting certain securities issued as VRDNs. The Bancorp facilitates financing for its commercial customers, which consist of companies and municipalities, by marketing the VRDNs to investors. The VRDNs pay interest to holders at a rate of
interest that fluctuates based upon market demand. The VRDNs generally have long-term maturity dates, but can be tendered by the holder for purchase at par value upon proper advance notice. When the VRDNs are tendered, a remarketing agent generally
finds another investor to purchase the VRDNs to keep the securities outstanding in the market. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, total VRDNs in which the Bancorp was the remarketing agent or were supported by a Bancorp letter of credit were
$929 million and $1.3 billion, respectively, of which FTS acted as the remarketing agent to issuers on $784 million and $1.1 billion, respectively. As remarketing agent, FTS is responsible for finding purchasers for VRDNs that
are put by investors. The Bancorp issued letters of credit, as a credit enhancement, to $609 million and $921 million of the VRDNs remarketed by FTS, in addition to $145 million and $187 million in VRDNs remarketed by third
parties at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. These letters of credit are included in the total letters of credit balance provided in the previous table. The Bancorp held $6 million and an immaterial amount of these VRDNs in its
portfolio and classified them as trading securities at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Forward contracts related to residential
mortgage loans held for sale

The Bancorp enters into forward contracts to economically hedge the change in fair value of certain
residential mortgage loans held for sale due to changes in interest rates. The outstanding notional amounts of these forward contracts are included in the summary of significant commitments table for all periods presented.

Noncancelable lease obligations and other commitments

The Bancorp’s subsidiaries have entered into a number of noncancelable lease agreements. The minimum rental commitments under
noncancelable lease agreements are shown in the summary of significant commitments table. The Bancorp has also entered into a limited number of agreements for work related to banking center construction and to purchase goods or services.

Contingent Liabilities

Private mortgage
reinsurance

For certain mortgage loans originated by the Bancorp, borrowers are required to obtain PMI provided by third-party
insurers. In some instances, these insurers ceded a portion of the PMI premiums to the Bancorp, and the Bancorp provided reinsurance coverage within a specified range of the total PMI coverage. The Bancorp’s reinsurance coverage typically
ranged from 5% to 10% of the total PMI coverage. The Bancorp’s maximum exposure in the event of nonperformance by the underlying borrowers was equivalent to the Bancorp’s total outstanding reinsurance coverage, which was $27 million
at December 31, 2015. As of December 31, 2015, the Bancorp maintained a reserve of $2 million related to exposures within the reinsurance portfolio which was included in other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance

Sheets. In the second quarter of 2016, the Bancorp allowed one of its third-party insurers to terminate its reinsurance agreement with the Bancorp, resulting in the Bancorp releasing collateral
to the insurer in the form of investment securities and other assets with a carrying value of $6 million, and the insurer assuming the Bancorp’s obligations under the reinsurance agreement, resulting in a decrease to the Bancorp’s
reserve liability of $2 million and a decrease in the Bancorp’s maximum exposure of $26 million. In addition, the Bancorp received a payment of $4 million related to the difference between the release of the assets and the
reserve liability assumed. During the fourth quarter of 2016, the final policies under the reinsurance agreement were terminated and as of December 31, 2016 the Bancorp no longer had any remaining exposure or reserves related to exposure within
the reinsurance portfolio.

Legal claims

There are legal claims pending against the Bancorp and its subsidiaries that have arisen in the normal course of business. Refer to Note 18
for additional information regarding these proceedings.

Guarantees

The Bancorp has performance obligations upon the occurrence of certain events under financial guarantees provided in certain contractual
arrangements as discussed in the following sections.

Residential mortgage loans sold with representation and warranty provisions

Conforming residential mortgage loans sold to unrelated third parties are generally sold with representation and warranty provisions. A
contractual liability arises only in the event of a breach of these representations and warranties and, in general, only when a loss results from the breach. The Bancorp may be required to repurchase any previously sold loan or indemnify (make
whole) the investor or insurer for which the representation or warranty of the Bancorp proves to be inaccurate, incomplete or misleading. For more information on how the Bancorp establishes the residential mortgage repurchase reserve, refer to Note
1.

During the fourth quarter of 2013, the Bancorp settled certain repurchase claims related to residential mortgage
loans originated and sold to FHLMC prior to January 1, 2009 for $25 million, after paid claim credits and other adjustments. The settlement removes the Bancorp’s responsibility to repurchase or indemnify FHLMC for representation and
warranty violations on any loan sold prior to January 1, 2009 except in limited circumstances.

As of
December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Bancorp maintained reserves related to loans sold with representation and warranty provisions totaling $13 million and $25 million, respectively, included in other liabilities in the Consolidated
Balance Sheets.

The Bancorp uses the best information available when estimating its
mortgage representation and warranty reserve; however, the estimation process is inherently uncertain and imprecise and, accordingly, losses in excess of the amounts reserved as of December 31, 2016, are reasonably possible. The Bancorp
currently estimates that it is reasonably possible that it could incur losses related to mortgage representation and warranty provisions in an amount up to approximately $21 million in excess of amounts reserved.

143  Fifth
Third Bancorp


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

This estimate was derived by modifying the key assumptions previously discussed to reflect management’s judgment regarding reasonably possible adverse changes to those assumptions. The
actual repurchase losses could vary significantly from the recorded mortgage representation and warranty reserve or this estimate of reasonably possibly losses, depending on the outcome of various factors, including those previously discussed.

During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Bancorp paid $1 million and $2 million, respectively,
in the form

of make whole payments and repurchased $17 million and $74 million, respectively, in outstanding principal of loans to satisfy investor demands. Total repurchase demand requests during
the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 were $22 million and $75 million, respectively. Total outstanding repurchase demand inventory was $2 million at December 31, 2016 compared to $4 million at December 31,
2015.

Residential mortgage loans sold with credit recourse

The Bancorp sold certain residential mortgage loans in the secondary market with credit recourse. In the event of any customer default,
pursuant to the credit recourse provided, the Bancorp is required to reimburse the third party. The maximum amount of credit risk in the event of nonperformance by the underlying borrowers is equivalent to the total outstanding balance. In the event
of nonperformance, the Bancorp has rights to the underlying collateral value securing the loan. The outstanding balances on these loans sold with credit recourse were $374 million and $465 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015,
respectively, and the delinquency rates were 3.2% at December 31, 2016 and 3.0% at December 31, 2015. The Bancorp maintained an estimated credit loss reserve on these loans sold with credit recourse of $7 million and $9 million
at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, recorded in other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. To determine the credit loss reserve, the Bancorp used an approach that is consistent with its overall approach in estimating credit
losses for various categories of residential mortgage loans held in its loan portfolio.

Margin accounts

FTS, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Bancorp, guarantees the collection of all margin account balances held by its brokerage
clearing agent for the benefit of its customers. FTS is responsible for payment to its brokerage clearing agent for any loss, liability, damage, cost or expense incurred as a result of customers failing to comply with margin or margin maintenance
calls on all margin accounts. The margin account balance held by the brokerage clearing agent was $15 million at December 31, 2016 and $10 million at December 31, 2015. In the event of any

customer default, FTS has rights to the underlying collateral provided. Given the existence of the underlying collateral provided and negligible historical credit losses, the Bancorp does not
maintain a loss reserve related to the margin accounts.

Long-term borrowing obligations

The Bancorp had certain fully and unconditionally guaranteed long-term borrowing obligations issued by wholly-owned issuing trust entities of
$62 million at both December 31, 2016 and 2015.

Visa litigation

The Bancorp, as a member bank of Visa prior to Visa’s reorganization and IPO (the “IPO”) of its Class A common shares (the
“Class A Shares”) in 2008, had certain indemnification obligations pursuant to Visa’s certificate of incorporation and

by-laws

and in accordance with their membership agreements. In
accordance with Visa’s

by-laws

prior to the IPO, the Bancorp could have been required to indemnify Visa for the Bancorp’s proportional share of losses based on the

pre-IPO

membership interests. As part of its reorganization and IPO, the Bancorp’s indemnification obligation was modified to include only certain known or anticipated litigation (the “Covered
Litigation”) as of the date of the restructuring. This modification triggered a requirement for the Bancorp to recognize a liability equal to the fair value of the indemnification liability.

In conjunction with the IPO, the Bancorp received 10.1 million of Visa’s Class B common shares (the
“Class B Shares”) based on the Bancorp’s membership percentage in Visa prior to the IPO.

144  Fifth Third Bancorp


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The Class B Shares are not transferable (other than to another member bank) until the later of the third anniversary of the IPO closing or the date which the Covered Litigation has been
resolved; therefore, the Bancorp’s Class B Shares were classified in other assets and accounted for at their carryover basis of $0. Visa deposited $3 billion of the proceeds from the IPO into a litigation escrow account, established
for the purpose of funding judgments in, or settlements of, the Covered Litigation. Since then, when Visa’s litigation committee determined that the escrow account was insufficient, Visa issued additional Class A Shares and deposited the
proceeds from the sale of the Class A Shares into the litigation escrow account. When Visa funded the litigation escrow account, the Class B Shares were subjected to dilution through an adjustment in the conversion rate of Class B
Shares into Class A Shares.

In 2009, the Bancorp completed the sale of Visa, Inc. Class B Shares and entered
into a total return swap in which the Bancorp will make or receive payments based on subsequent changes in the conversion rate of the Class B Shares into Class A Shares. The swap terminates on the later of the third anniversary of
Visa’s IPO or the date on which the Covered Litigation is settled. Refer to Note 27 for additional information on the valuation of the swap. The counterparty to the swap as a result of its ownership of the Class B Shares will be impacted
by dilutive adjustments to the conversion rate of the Class B Shares into Class A Shares caused by any Covered Litigation losses in excess of the litigation escrow account. If actual judgments in, or settlements of, the Covered Litigation
significantly exceed current expectations, then additional funding by Visa of the litigation escrow account and the resulting dilution of the Class B Shares could result in a scenario

where the Bancorp’s ultimate exposure associated with the Covered Litigation (the “Visa Litigation Exposure”) exceeds the value of the Class B Shares owned by the swap
counterparty (the “Class B Value”). In the event the Bancorp concludes that it is probable that the Visa Litigation Exposure exceeds the Class B Value, the Bancorp would record a litigation reserve liability and a corresponding
amount of other noninterest expense for the amount of the excess. Any such litigation reserve liability would be separate and distinct from the fair value derivative liability associated with the total return swap.

As of the date of the Bancorp’s sale of the Visa Class B Shares and through December 31, 2016, the Bancorp
has concluded that it is not probable that the Visa Litigation Exposure will exceed the Class B Value. Based on this determination, upon the sale of the Class B Shares, the Bancorp reversed its net Visa litigation reserve liability and
recognized a free-standing derivative liability associated with the total return swap. The fair value of the swap liability was $91 million and $61 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Refer to Note 13 and Note 27 for
further information.

After the Bancorp’s sale of the Class B Shares, Visa has funded additional amounts into
the litigation escrow account which have resulted in further dilutive adjustments to the conversion of Class B Shares into Class A Shares, and along with other terms of the total return swap, required the Bancorp to make cash payments in
varying amounts to the swap counterparty as follows:

18. LEGAL AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS

Litigation

Visa/Mastercard Merchant Interchange Litigation

In April 2006, the Bancorp was added as a defendant in a consolidated antitrust class action lawsuit originally filed against Visa®,
MasterCard® and several other major financial institutions in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York. The plaintiffs, merchants operating commercial businesses throughout the U.S. and trade associations, claimed
that the interchange fees charged by card-issuing banks were unreasonable and sought injunctive relief and unspecified damages. In addition to being a named defendant, the Bancorp is also subject to a possible indemnification obligation of Visa as
discussed in Note 16 and has also entered into judgment and loss sharing agreements with Visa, MasterCard and certain other named defendants. In October 2012, the parties to the litigation entered into a settlement agreement. On January 14,
2014, the trial court entered a final order approving the class settlement. A number of merchants filed appeals from that approval. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit held a hearing on those appeals and on June 30, 2016, reversed
the district court’s approval of the class settlement, remanding the case to the district court for further proceedings. In rejecting the settlement, the appellate court found that counsel for plaintiffs was conflicted and thus could not
adequately represent the plaintiff-class members of the separate monetary and injunctive relief settlement classes. The appellate court decertified the settlement classes, ordered that the case return to the trial court and directed the trial court
to appoint separate counsel for the separate plaintiff classes. Pursuant to the terms of the overturned settlement agreement, the Bancorp previously paid $46 million into a class settlement escrow account. Because the appellate court ruling
remands the case to the district court for further proceedings, the ultimate outcome in this matter is uncertain. Approximately 8,000 merchants requested exclusion from the class settlement, and therefore, pursuant to the terms of the settlement
agreement, 25% of the funds paid into the class settlement escrow account were already returned to the control of the defendants. More than 460 of the merchants who requested exclusion from the class filed separate federal lawsuits against Visa,
MasterCard and certain other defendants alleging similar antitrust violations. These

“opt-out”

federal lawsuits were transferred to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New
York. The Bancorp was not named as a defendant in any of the

opt-out

federal lawsuits, but may have obligations pursuant to indemnification arrangements and/or the judgment or loss sharing agreements noted
above. On July 18, 2015, the court in which all the remaining

opt-out

federal lawsuits have been consolidated denied defendants’ motion to dismiss the complaints. Refer to Note 17 for further
information.

Dudenhoeffer v. Fifth Third Bancorp

On March 29, 2016, the court in two class action lawsuits consolidated as Dudenhoeffer v. Fifth Third Bancorp et al. filed in 2008 in the
United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio preliminarily approved a settlement in which the Bancorp agreed to pay $6 million and make certain changes to the Bancorp’s profit sharing plan. The complaints alleged that the
Bancorp and certain officers violated ERISA by continuing to offer Fifth Third stock in the Bancorp’s profit sharing plan when it was no longer a prudent investment. On July 11, 2016, the court issued a Final Approval Order and Judgment
approving the settlement in all respects and ordering that the settlement agreement be implemented in accordance with its terms.

Klopfenstein v. Fifth Third Bank

On August 3, 2012, William Klopfenstein and Adam McKinney filed a lawsuit against Fifth Third Bank in the United States District Court
for the Northern District of Ohio (Klopfenstein et al. v. Fifth Third Bank), alleging that the 120% APR that Fifth Third disclosed on its Early Access program was misleading. Early Access is a deposit-advance program offered to eligible customers
with checking accounts. The plaintiffs sought to represent a nationwide class of customers who used the Early Access program and repaid their cash advances within 30 days. On October 31, 2012, the case was transferred to the United States
District Court for the Southern District of Ohio. In 2013, four similar putative class actions were filed against Fifth Third Bank in federal courts throughout the country (Lori and Danielle Laskaris v. Fifth Third Bank, Janet Fyock v. Fifth Third
Bank, Jesse McQuillen v. Fifth Third Bank, and Brian Harrison v. Fifth Third Bank). Those four lawsuits were transferred to the Southern District of Ohio and consolidated with the original lawsuit as In re: Fifth Third Early Access Cash Advance
Litigation. On behalf of a putative class, the plaintiffs seek unspecified monetary and statutory damages, injunctive relief, punitive damages, attorney’s fees, and

pre-

and post-judgment interest. On
March 30, 2015, the court dismissed all claims alleged in the consolidated lawsuit except a claim under the TILA. The parties are currently engaged in

pre-trial

proceedings. No trial date has been
scheduled.

Nina Investments, LLC v. Fifth Third Bank

On July 5, 2012, Nina Investments, LLC (“Nina”) filed a lawsuit against Fifth Third Bank (Nina Investments, LLC. v. Fifth Third
Bank, et al.) in the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois, alleging fraud and conspiracy to commit fraud related to a credit facility established by Fifth Third Bank in 2007 to finance life insurance premiums. Nina invested funds in an entity
related to the borrower under the credit facility and is claiming over $70 million in damages based on its alleged loss of these funds. Nina alleges that it would have made different investment decisions if Fifth Third had disclosed fraud
committed by the borrower with the alleged knowledge of Fifth Third employees. Nina filed this lawsuit in response to a lawsuit filed by Fifth Third Bank in the same court on June 11, 2010 against Nina and other defendants (Fifth Third Bank v.
Concord Capital Management, LLC, et al.) alleging fraud and breach of contract. In 2015, the court dismissed Fifth Third’s contract and fraud claims against certain defendants. Fifth Third currently has claims pending against other defendants,
including a claim for fraudulent conveyance against Nina. On October 20, 2016, the court denied Fifth Third’s motion to assert a new claim against Nina and other investors for fraudulent inducement of a guarantee related to the credit
facility and to reassert claims for breach of guarantee against certain of the investors who also acted as guarantors. The trial has been scheduled in these consolidated actions for April 24, 2017.

Helton v. Fifth Third Bank

On
August 31, 2015, trust beneficiaries filed an action against Fifth Third Bank, as trustee, in the Probate Court for Hamilton County, Ohio (Helen Clarke Helton, et al. v. Fifth Third Bank). The plaintiffs allege breach of the duty to diversify,
breach of the duty of impartiality, breach of trust/fiduciary duty, and unjust enrichment, based on Fifth Third’s alleged failure to diversify assets held in two trusts held for the plaintiffs’ benefit. The lawsuit seeks unspecified
monetary damages, attorney’s fees, removal of Fifth Third as trustee, and injunctive relief. On January 5, 2016, the Court denied Fifth Third’s motion to dismiss. The parties are currently engaged in

pre-trial

proceedings. Trial is currently scheduled for September 18, 2017.

Upsher-Smith Laboratories, Inc. v. Fifth Third Bank

On February 2, 2012, Upsher-Smith Laboratories, Inc. (“Upsher-Smith”) filed suit against Fifth Third Bank in the Fourth
Judicial District, Hennepin County, Minnesota (Upsher-Smith Laboratories Inc. v. Fifth Third Bank), alleging that Fifth Third improperly implemented foreign exchange (“FX”) transactions requested by plaintiff’s authorized employee who
allegedly was the victim of fraud by a third party. Plaintiff asserts claims for breach of contract and the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing and under Article

4A-202

of the Uniform Commercial
Code, with losses allegedly totalling almost $40 million. On March 3, 2016, Fifth Third removed the case to the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota. Fifth Third filed a motion to transfer venue to the United States
District Court for the Southern District of Ohio on April 7, 2016, which was denied on December 29, 2016. Discovery was stayed pending the Court’s ruling on the motion to transfer. No trial date has been scheduled.

The Champions Home Owners Association, Inc. v. Jeffrey D. Quammen, et al.

On September 12, 2013 Fifth Third Bank was named as a defendant in a cross-complaint filed by Royce Pulliam, P&P Real Estate, LLC and
Global Fitness Holdings, LLC (“Plaintiffs”) in the Jessamine Circuit Court in Jessamine County, Kentucky. The Plaintiffs allege that Fifth Third Bank breached a contract to provide commercial funding for Plaintiffs’ national fitness
franchise. The Plaintiffs claim to have sustained over $50 million in damages from the alleged contract breach. Fifth Third Bank denies that any breach of contract occurred, and further asserts that Plaintiffs executed multiple releases waiving
the claims at issue in the litigation. Fifth Third Bank has asserted a $1.5 million claim against Plaintiff Royce Pulliam for breach of guaranty. On February 3, 2017 the Jessamine Circuit Court ruled in favor of Fifth Third Bank granting
summary judgment on Fifth Third’s claim for breach of guaranty. The Court denied Fifth Third Bank’s motion for summary judgment seeking dismissal of the Plaintiffs’ claims. The case is set for a bench trial beginning February 27,
2017.

Other Litigation

The
Bancorp and its subsidiaries are not parties to any other material litigation. However, there are other litigation matters that arise in the normal course of business. While it is impossible to ascertain the ultimate resolution or range of financial
liability with respect to these contingent matters, management believes that the resulting liability, if any, from these other actions would not have a material effect upon the Bancorp’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or
cash flows.

Governmental Investigations and Proceedings

The Bancorp and/or its affiliates are involved in information-gathering requests, reviews, investigations and proceedings (both formal and
informal) by various governmental regulatory agencies and law enforcement authorities, including but not limited to the CFPB, FINRA, etc., as well as self-regulatory bodies regarding their respective businesses. Additional matters will likely arise
from time to time. Any of these matters may result in material adverse consequences to the Bancorp, its affiliates and/or their respective directors, officers and other personnel, including adverse judgments, findings, settlements, fines, penalties,
orders, injunctions or other actions, amendments and/or restatements of the Bancorp’s SEC

filings and/or financial statements, as applicable, and/or determinations of material weaknesses in our disclosure controls and procedures. Investigations by regulatory authorities may from time
to time result in civil or criminal referrals to law enforcement.

Reasonably Possible Losses in Excess of Accruals

The Bancorp and its subsidiaries are parties to numerous claims and lawsuits as well as threatened or potential actions or claims concerning
matters arising from the conduct of its business activities. The outcome of claims or litigation and the timing of ultimate resolution are inherently difficult to predict. The following factors, among others, contribute to this lack of
predictability: claims often include significant legal uncertainties, damages alleged by plaintiffs are often unspecified or overstated, discovery may not have started or may not be complete and material facts may be disputed or unsubstantiated. As
a result of these factors, the Bancorp is not always able to provide an estimate of the range of reasonably possible outcomes for each claim. An accrual for a potential litigation loss is established when information related to the loss contingency
indicates both that a loss is probable and that the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Any such accrual is adjusted from time to time thereafter as appropriate to reflect changes in circumstances. The Bancorp also determines, when possible
(due to the uncertainties described above), estimates of reasonably possible losses or ranges of reasonably possible losses, in excess of amounts accrued. Under U.S. GAAP, an event is “reasonably possible” if “the chance of the future
event or events occurring is more than remote but less than likely” and an event is “remote” if “the chance of the future event or events occurring is slight.” Thus, references to the upper end of the range of reasonably
possible loss for cases in which the Bancorp is able to estimate a range of reasonably possible loss mean the upper end of the range of loss for cases for which the Bancorp believes the risk of loss is more than slight. For matters where the Bancorp
is able to estimate such possible losses or ranges of possible losses, the Bancorp currently estimates that it is reasonably possible that it could incur losses related to legal and regulatory proceedings in an aggregate amount up to approximately
$43 million in excess of amounts accrued, with it also being reasonably possible that no losses will be incurred in these matters. The estimates included in this amount are based on the Bancorp’s analysis of currently available
information, and as new information is obtained the Bancorp may change its estimates.

For these matters and others where
an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible but not probable, there may be a range of possible losses in excess of the established accrual that cannot be estimated. Based on information currently available, advice of counsel, available insurance
coverage and established accruals, the Bancorp believes that the eventual outcome of the actions against the Bancorp and/or its subsidiaries, including the matters described above, will not, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse
effect on the Bancorp’s consolidated financial position. However, in the event of unexpected future developments, it is possible that the ultimate resolution of those matters, if unfavorable, may be material to the Bancorp’s results of
operations for any particular period, depending, in part, upon the size of the loss or liability imposed and the operating results for the applicable period.

19. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

The Bancorp maintains written policies and procedures covering related party transactions with
principal shareholders, directors and executives of the Bancorp. These procedures cover transactions such as employee-stock purchase loans, personal lines of credit, residential secured loans, overdrafts, letters of credit and increases in
indebtedness. Such transactions are subject to the Bancorp’s normal underwriting and approval procedures. Prior to

approving a loan to a related party, Compliance Risk Management must review and determine whether the transaction requires approval from or a post notification to the Bancorp’s Board of
Directors. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, certain directors, executive officers, principal holders of Bancorp common stock and their related interests were indebted, including undrawn commitments to lend, to the Bancorp’s banking
subsidiary.

On June 30, 2009, the Bancorp completed the sale of a majority interest in its processing business, Vantiv Holding, LLC. Advent

International acquired an approximate 51% interest in Vantiv Holding, LLC for cash and a warrant. The Bancorp retained the remaining approximate 49% interest in Vantiv Holding, LLC.

During the first quarter of 2012, Vantiv, Inc. priced an IPO of its shares and contributed the net proceeds to Vantiv
Holding, LLC for additional ownership interests. As a result of this offering, the Bancorp’s ownership of Vantiv Holding, LLC was reduced to approximately 39%. The impact of the capital contributions to Vantiv Holding, LLC and the resulting
dilution in the Bancorp’s interest resulted in a gain of $115 million recognized by the Bancorp in the first quarter of 2012.

The following table
provides a summary of the sales transactions that impacted the Bancorp’s ownership interest in Vantiv Holding, LLC after the initial IPO:

as of

December

was accounted for as an equity method investment in the Bancorp’s Consolidated Financial Statements.

The Bancorp agreed during the fourth quarter of 2015 to cancel rights to purchase approximately
4.8 million Class C Units in Vantiv Holding, LLC, the wholly-owned principal operating subsidiary of Vantiv, Inc., underlying the warrant in exchange for a cash payment of $200 million. Subsequent to this cancellation, the Bancorp
exercised its right to purchase approximately 7.8 million Class C Units underlying the warrant at the $15.98 strike price. This exercise was settled on a net basis for approximately 5.4 million Class C Units, which were then
exchanged for approximately 5.4 million shares of Vantiv, Inc. Class A Common Stock that were sold in the secondary offering. The Bancorp recognized a gain of $89 million in other noninterest income on the 62% of the warrant that was
settled or net exercised. Additionally, during the fourth quarter of 2015, the Bancorp exchanged 8 million Class B Units of Vantiv Holding, LLC for 8 million Class A Shares in Vantiv, Inc., which were also sold in the secondary
offering and on which the Bancorp recognized a gain of $331 million in other noninterest income.

During the fourth
quarter of 2016, the Bancorp exercised its right to purchase approximately 7.8 million Class C Units

underlying the warrant at the $15.98 strike price. This exercise was settled on a net basis for approximately 5.7 million Class C Units, which were then exchanged for approximately
5.7 million shares of Vantiv, Inc. Class A Common Stock of which 4.8 million shares were sold in a secondary offering and 0.9 million shares were repurchased by Vantiv, Inc. The Bancorp recognized a gain of $9 million in
other noninterest income in the Consolidated Statements of Income in 2016 on the exercise of the remaining warrant in Vantiv Holding, LLC.

As of December 31, 2016, the Bancorp continued to hold approximately 35 million
Class B Units of Vantiv Holding, LLC which may be exchanged for Class A Common Stock of Vantiv, Inc. on a

one-for-one

basis or at Vantiv, Inc.’s option
for cash which represents approximately 17.9% ownership of Vantiv, Holding, LLC. In addition, the Bancorp holds approximately 35 million Class B Common Shares of Vantiv, Inc. The Class B Common Shares give the Bancorp voting rights,
but no economic interest in Vantiv, Inc.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

At any time, other than in connection with a stockholder vote with respect to a change in control in Vantiv, Inc., the voting rights attributable to the Class B Common Shares are limited to
the lesser of 18.5% or the Bancorp’s ownership percentage of Vantiv Holding, LLC, currently 17.9%. These securities are subject to certain terms and restrictions.

The Bancorp recognized $66 million, $63 million and $48 million, respectively, in other noninterest income as
part of its equity method investment in Vantiv Holding, LLC for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 and received cash distributions totaling $9 million, $11 million and $23 million during the years ended
December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The Bancorp’s remaining investment in Vantiv Holding, LLC continues to be accounted for under the equity method of accounting as of December 31, 2016.

During the fourth quarter of 2015, the Bancorp entered into an agreement with Vantiv, Inc. under which a portion of its TRA
with Vantiv, Inc. was terminated and settled in full for a cash payment of approximately $49 million from Vantiv, Inc. Under the agreement, the Bancorp sold certain TRA cash flows it expected to receive from 2017 to 2030, totaling an estimated
$140 million. Approximately half of the sold TRA cash flows related to 2025 and later. This sale did not impact the TRA payment recognized during the fourth quarter of 2015.

During the third quarter of 2016, the Bancorp entered into an agreement with Vantiv, Inc. under which a portion of its TRA
with

Vantiv, Inc. was terminated and settled in full for consideration of a cash payment in the amount of $116 million from Vantiv, Inc. Under the agreement, the Bancorp terminated and settled
certain TRA cash flows it expected to receive in the years 2019 to 2035, totaling an estimated $331 million. The Bancorp recognized a gain of $116 million in other noninterest income from this settlement. Additionally, the agreement
provides that Vantiv, Inc. may be obligated to pay up to a total of approximately $171 million to the Bancorp to terminate and settle certain remaining TRA cash flows, totaling an estimated $394 million, upon the exercise of certain call
options by Vantiv, Inc. or certain put options by the Bancorp. If the associated call options or put options are exercised, 10% of the obligations would be settled with respect to each quarter in 2017 and 15% of the obligations would be settled with
respect to each quarter in 2018. The Bancorp recognized a gain of $164 million in other noninterest income associated with these options. This agreement did not impact the TRA payments recognized in the fourth quarter of 2016 and is not
expected to impact the TRA payment expected in the fourth quarter of 2017.

In addition to the impact of the TRA
terminations discussed above, the Bancorp recognized $33 million, $31 million and $23 million in noninterest income in the Consolidated Statements of Income associated with the TRA during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015
and 2014, respectively.

Holding, LLC units in the fourth quarter of 2016) will be recognized in future periods when the related uncertainties are resolved.

(b)

As part of the agreement the Bancorp entered into with Vantiv, Inc. on July 27, 2016, Vantiv, Inc. may
be obligated to pay a total of approximately $171 to the Bancorp to terminate certain remaining TRA cash flows, totaling an estimated $394, upon the exercise of certain call options by Vantiv, Inc. or certain put options by the Bancorp.

The Bancorp and Vantiv Holding, LLC have various agreements in place covering services relating
to the operations of Vantiv Holding, LLC. The services provided by the Bancorp to Vantiv Holding, LLC were initially required to support Vantiv Holding, LLC as a standalone entity during the deconversion period. The majority of services previously
provided by the Bancorp to support Vantiv Holding, LLC as a standalone entity are no longer necessary and are now limited to certain general business resources. Vantiv Holding, LLC paid the Bancorp $1 million for these services for each of the
years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. Other services provided to Vantiv Holding, LLC by the Bancorp, have continued beyond the deconversion period, include interchange clearing, settlement and sponsorship. Vantiv Holding, LLC paid the
Bancorp $58 million, $47 million and $44 million for these services for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. In addition to the previously mentioned services, the Bancorp previously entered into an

agreement under which Vantiv Holding, LLC will provide processing services to the Bancorp. The total amount of fees relating to the processing services provided to the Bancorp by Vantiv Holding,
LLC totaled $76 million, $89 million and $83 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. These fees are reported as a component of card and processing expense in the Consolidated Statements of
Income.

As part of the initial sale, Vantiv Holding, LLC assumed loans totaling
$1.25 billion owed to the Bancorp, which were refinanced in 2010 into a larger syndicated loan structure that included the Bancorp. The outstanding carrying value of loans to Vantiv Holding, LLC was $210 million and $191 million at
December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Interest income relating to the loans was $4 million, $4 million and $5 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 and is included in interest and
fees on loans and leases in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Vantiv Holding, LLC’s unused line of credit was $59 million and $46 million as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

The Bancorp’s unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014
primarily relate to state income tax exposures from taking tax positions where the Bancorp believes it is likely that, upon examination, a state will take a position contrary to the position taken by the Bancorp.

While it is reasonably possible that the amount of the unrecognized tax
benefits with respect to certain of the Bancorp’s uncertain tax positions could increase or decrease during the next twelve months, the Bancorp believes it is unlikely that its unrecognized tax benefits will change by a material amount during
the next twelve months.

At December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Bancorp recorded deferred tax assets of $9 million
and $10 million, respectively, related to state net operating loss carryforwards. The deferred tax assets relating to state net operating losses (primarily resulting from leasing operations) are presented net of specific valuation allowances of
$25 million and $22 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. If these carryforwards are not utilized, they will expire in varying amounts through 2035. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Bancorp recorded a deferred
tax asset of $3 million and $5 million, respectively related to a foreign tax credit carryforward. If not utilized, the majority of the deferred tax asset relating to the foreign tax credit carryforward will expire in 2025.

The Bancorp has determined that a valuation allowance is not needed against the remaining deferred tax assets as of
December 31, 2016 or 2015. The Bancorp considered all of the positive and negative evidence available to determine whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will ultimately be realized and, based upon that evidence, the
Bancorp believes it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets recorded at December 31, 2016 and 2015 will ultimately be realized. The Bancorp reached this conclusion as the Bancorp has taxable income in the carryback period and it is
expected that the Bancorp’s remaining deferred tax assets will be realized through the reversal of its existing taxable temporary differences and its projected future taxable income.

The IRS is currently examining the Bancorp’s 2012 and 2013 federal income tax returns. The statute of limitations for
the Bancorp’s federal income tax returns remains open for tax years 2012-2016. On occasion, as various state and local taxing jurisdictions examine the returns of the Bancorp and its subsidiaries, the Bancorp may agree to extend the statute of
limitations for a reasonable period of time. Otherwise, the statutes of limitations for state income tax returns remain open only for tax years in accordance with each state’s statutes.

Any interest and penalties incurred in connection with income taxes are recorded as a component of income tax expense in the
Consolidated Financial Statements. During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Bancorp recognized $1 million of interest

expense in connection with income taxes and an immaterial amount of interest expense/benefit for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Bancorp
had accrued interest liabilities, net of the related tax benefits, of $1 million. No material liabilities were recorded for penalties related to income taxes.

Retained earnings at December 31, 2016 and 2015 included $157 million in allocations of earnings for bad debt
deductions of former thrift subsidiaries for which no income tax has been provided. Under current tax law, if certain of the Bancorp’s subsidiaries use these bad debt reserves for purposes other than to absorb bad debt losses, they will be
subject to federal income tax at the current corporate tax rate.

During 2016, the Bancorp adopted ASU

2016-09,

Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, effective as of January 1, 2016. Consistent with existing U.S. GAAP and ASU

2016-09,

the Bancorp
establishes a deferred tax asset and recognizes a corresponding deferred tax benefit for stock-based awards granted to its employees and directors based on enacted tax rates and the expense recorded for financial reporting purposes. The actual
tax deduction for these stock-based awards is determined when the stock-based awards are settled or expired and the tax deductions will typically be greater than or less than the expense previously recognized for financial reporting.

Among other requirements, ASU

2016-09

requires that the tax consequences for the
difference between the expense recognized for financial reporting and the Bancorp’s actual tax deduction for the stock-based awards be recognized through income tax expense in the interim periods in which they occur. Prior to the adoption of
ASU

2016-09,

the tax consequences for the difference between the expense recognized for financial reporting and the actual tax deduction for stock-based awards was recognized either through additional

paid-in-capital

when the Bancorp accumulated “excess tax benefits” from stock based awards or through income tax expense when the Bancorp depleted its accumulated
“excess tax benefits” from stock-based awards.

21. RETIREMENT AND BENEFIT PLANS

The Bancorp’s qualified defined benefit plan’s benefits were frozen in 1998, except
for grandfathered employees. The Bancorp’s other retirement plans consist of

non-qualified,

defined benefit plans, which are frozen and funded on an as needed basis. A majority of these plans were
obtained in acquisitions from prior years and are included with the qualified defined benefit plan in the following tables (“the Plan”). The Bancorp recognizes the

overfunded and underfunded status of the Plan as an asset and liability, respectively, in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Plan had an underfunded projected benefit obligation at both
December 31, 2016 and 2015. The underfunded amounts recognized in other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets were $34 million and $54 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

The estimated net actuarial loss for the Plan that will be amortized from AOCI into net

The following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for instruments measured at
fair value, as well as the general classification of such instruments pursuant to the valuation hierarchy.

Equity securities

The Plan measures common stock using quoted prices which are available in an active market and classifies these investments within
Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy.

Mutual and exchange-traded funds

All of the Plan’s mutual and exchange-traded funds are publicly traded. The Plan measures the value of these investments using the
fund’s quoted prices which are available in an active market and classifies these investments within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. Level 1 securities

include money market funds, alternative strategies and commodity funds. Where quoted prices are not available, the Plan measures the fair value of these investments based on the redemption price
of units held, which is based on the current fair value of the fund’s underlying assets. Unit values are determined by dividing the fund’s net assets at fair value by its units outstanding at the valuation dates to obtain the
investment’s net asset value. Therefore, investments such as international funds, domestic funds, debt funds and alternative strategies are classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy.

Debt securities

Where quoted prices
are available in an active market, securities are classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. Level 1 securities include U.S. Treasury securities. If quoted market prices are not available, then fair values are estimated using
pricing models, quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics, or DCFs.

154  Fifth Third Bancorp


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Examples of such instruments, which are classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy, include federal agencies securities, agency residential mortgage-backed securities, agency
commercial mortgage-backed securities,

non-agency

commercial mortgage-backed securities and asset-backed securities and other debt securities.

Plan Assumptions

The
Plan’s assumptions are evaluated annually and are updated as necessary. The discount rate assumption reflects the yield on a

portfolio of high quality fixed-income instruments that have a similar duration to the Plan’s liabilities. The expected long-term rate of return assumption reflects the average return
expected on the assets invested to provide for the Plan’s liabilities. In determining the expected long-term rate of return, the Bancorp evaluated actuarial and economic inputs, including long-term inflation rate assumptions and broad equity
and bond indices long-term return projections, as well as actual long-term historical plan performance.

The following table summarizes the weighted-average plan assumptions for the years ended
December 31:

Since the Plan’s benefits were frozen, except for grandfathered employees, the rate of compensation
increase is no longer applicable beginning in 2014 since minimal grandfathered employees are still accruing benefits.

Lowering both the expected rate of return on the plan assets and the discount rate by 0.25%
would have increased the 2016 pension expense by approximately $1 million.

Based on the actuarial assumptions, the
Bancorp expects to contribute $3 million to the Plan in 2017. Estimated pension benefit payments are $18 million in 2017, $17 million in 2018, $16 million in 2019, $16 million in 2020 and $16 million in 2021. The total
estimated payments for the years 2022 through 2026 is $77 million.

Investment Policies and Strategies

The Bancorp’s policy for the investment of plan assets is to employ investment strategies that achieve a range of weighted-average target
asset allocations relating to equity securities (including the Bancorp’s common stock), fixed-income securities (including U.S. Treasury and federal agencies securities, mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities and corporate bonds),
alternative strategies (including traditional mutual funds, precious metals and commodities) and cash.

and 2015.

The risk tolerance for the Plan is determined by management to be “moderate to
aggressive”, recognizing that higher returns involve some volatility and that periodic declines in the portfolio’s value are tolerated in an effort to achieve real capital growth. There were no significant concentrations of risk associated
with the investments of the Plan at December 31, 2016 and 2015.

Permitted asset classes of the Plan include cash
and cash equivalents, fixed-income (domestic and

non-U.S.

bonds), equities (U.S.,

Treasury Stock

On March 15, 2016, the Board of Directors authorized the Bancorp to repurchase up to 100 million common shares in the open market or
in privately negotiated transactions and to utilize any derivative or similar instrument to effect share repurchase transactions. This share repurchase authorization replaced the Board’s previous authorization from March of 2014.

On March 26, 2014, the Bancorp announced the results of its capital plan submitted to the FRB as part of the 2014 CCAR.
The FRB indicated to the Bancorp that it did not object to the potential repurchase of $669 million of common shares with the additional ability to repurchase common shares in an amount equal to any

after-tax

gains realized by the Bancorp from the sale of Vantiv, Inc. common stock for the period beginning April 1, 2014 and ending March 31, 2015.

On March 11, 2015, the Bancorp announced the results of its capital plan submitted to the FRB as part of the 2015 CCAR.
The FRB indicated to the Bancorp that it did not object to the potential repurchase of $765 million of common shares with the additional ability to repurchase common shares in an amount equal to any

after-tax

gains realized by the Bancorp from the sale of Vantiv, Inc. common stock for the period beginning April 1, 2015 and ending June 30, 2016.

July 1, 2016 and ending June 30, 2017.

The Bancorp entered into a number of
accelerated share repurchase transactions during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2016. As part of these transactions, the Bancorp entered into forward contracts in which the final number of shares delivered at settlement was based
generally on a discount to the average daily volume weighted-average price of the Bancorp’s common stock during the term of these repurchase agreements.

Under the 2014 Incentive Compensation Plan, 36 million shares were authorized for issuance as SARs,
RSAs, RSUs, stock options, performance share or unit awards, dividend or dividend equivalent rights and stock awards.

(b)

The number of shares to be issued upon exercise will be determined at exercise based on the difference
between the grant price and the market price on the date of exercise and the calculation of taxes owed on the exercise.

(c)

Excludes 0.02 million outstanding options awarded under plans assumed by the Bancorp in connection with
certain mergers and acquisitions. The Bancorp has not made any awards under these plans and will make no additional awards under these plans. The weighted-average exercise price of these outstanding options is $14.05 per share.

(d)

The number of shares to be issued is dependent upon the Bancorp achieving certain predefined performance
targets and ranges from zero shares to approximately 2 million shares.

(e)

Represents remaining shares of Fifth Third common stock under the Bancorp’s 1993 Stock Purchase Plan,
as amended and restated, including an additional 1.5 million shares approved by shareholders on March 28, 2007 and an additional 12 million shares approved by shareholders on April 21, 2009.

(f)

Includes 4 million shares for Full Value Awards.

Stock-based awards are eligible for issuance under the Bancorp’s Incentive Compensation
Plan to executives, directors and key employees of the Bancorp and its subsidiaries. The Incentive Compensation Plan was approved by shareholders on April 15, 2014 and authorized the issuance of up to 36 million shares, including
16 million shares for Full Value Awards, as equity compensation and provides for SARs, RSAs, RSUs, stock options, performance share or unit awards, dividend or dividend equivalent rights and stock awards. Full Value Awards are defined as awards
with no cash outlay for the employee to obtain the full value. Based on total stock-based awards outstanding (including SARs, RSAs, RSUs, stock options and PSAs) and shares remaining for future grants under the 2014 Incentive Compensation Plan, the
potential dilution to which the Bancorp’s shareholders of common stock are exposed due to the potential that stock-based compensation will be awarded to executives, directors or key

employees of the Bancorp and its subsidiaries is 9%. SARs, RSAs, RSUs, stock options and PSAs outstanding represent 7% of the Bancorp’s issued shares at December 31, 2016.

All of the Bancorp’s stock-based awards are to be settled with stock. The Bancorp has
historically used treasury stock to settle stock-based awards, when available. SARs, issued at fair value based on the closing price of the Bancorp’s common stock on the date of grant, have up to ten year terms and vest and become exercisable
ratably over a four year period of continued employment. The Bancorp does not grant discounted SARs or stock options,

re-price

previously granted SARs or stock options or grant reload stock options. RSAs and
RSUs are released after three or four years or ratably over three or four years of continued employment. RSAs include dividend and voting rights while RSUs receive dividend equivalents only. Stock options were previously issued at fair value based
on the closing price of the Bancorp’s common stock on the date of grant, had up to ten year terms and vested and became fully exercisable ratably over a three or four year period of continued employment.

160  Fifth Third Bancorp


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

PSAs have three year cliff vesting terms with market conditions and/or performance conditions as defined by the plan. All of the Bancorp’s executive stock-based awards contain an annual
performance hurdle of 2% return on tangible common equity. If this threshold is not met, all PSAs that would vest in the next year are forfeited and all SARs and RSAs that would vest in the next year may also be forfeited at the discretion of the
Human Capital and Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. The Bancorp met this threshold as of December 31, 2016.

Stock-based compensation expense was $111 million, $100 million and
$83 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and is included in salaries, wages and incentives in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The total related income tax benefit recognized was
$39 million, $36 million and $30 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

Stock
Appreciation Rights

The Bancorp uses assumptions, which are evaluated and revised as necessary, in estimating the grant-date fair
value of each SAR grant.

The weighted-average
assumptions were as follows for the years ended December 31:




Expected life (in years)




Expected volatility


%



Expected dividend yield

3.1

2.7

2.4

Risk-free interest rate

1.5

1.6

2.0

The expected life is generally derived from historical exercise patterns and represents the
amount of time that SARs granted are expected to be outstanding. The expected volatility is based on a combination of historical and implied volatilities of the Bancorp’s common stock. The expected dividend yield is based on annual dividends
divided by the Bancorp’s stock price. Annual dividends are based on projected dividends, estimated using an expected long-term dividend payout ratio, over the estimated life of the awards. The risk-free interest rate for periods within the
contractual life of the SARs is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.

The grant-date fair value of SARs is measured using the Black-Scholes
option-pricing model.

The weighted-average grant-date fair value of SARs granted was $5.16, $5.52 and $6.53 per share for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The total grant-date fair value of SARs that vested
during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 was $32 million, $35 million and $34 million, respectively.

At December 31, 2016, there was $40 million of stock-based compensation expense related to outstanding SARs not
yet recognized. The expense is expected to be recognized over an estimated remaining weighted-average period at December 31, 2016 of 2.4 years.

Stock Options

The grant-date fair value of stock options is measured using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.

There were no stock options
granted during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.

The total intrinsic value of stock options
exercised was immaterial for the year ended December 31, 2016 and $1 million for both the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. Cash received from stock options exercised was $1 million, $2 million and $1 million for
the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014,

respectively. The tax benefit realized from exercised stock options was immaterial to the Bancorp’s Consolidated Financial Statements during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and
2014. All stock options were vested as of December 31, 2008, therefore, no stock options vested during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 or 2014. As of December 31, 2016, the aggregate intrinsic value of both outstanding stock
options and exercisable stock options was immaterial.

Other Stock-Based Compensation

PSAs are payable contingent upon the Bancorp achieving certain predefined performance targets over the three-year measurement period. Awards
granted during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 will be entirely settled in stock. The performance targets are based on the Bancorp’s performance relative to a defined peer group. During both 2016 and 2015, PSAs used a
performance-based metric based on return on tangible common equity in relation to peers, whereas during 2014, a market-based metric was used which assessed the stock price performance in relation to peers. During the years ended December 31,
2016, 2015 and 2014, 583,608, 458,355 and

322,567 PSAs, respectively, were granted by the Bancorp. These awards were granted at a weighted-average grant-date fair value of $14.87, $19.48 and $15.61 per unit during the years ended
December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

The Bancorp sponsors an employee stock purchase plan that allows
qualifying employees to purchase shares of the Bancorp’s common stock with a 15% match. During the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, there were 684,885, 617,829 and 599,101 shares, respectively, purchased by participants and
the Bancorp recognized stock-based compensation expense of $1 million in each of the respective years.

Shares are excluded from the computation of net income per diluted share when their inclusion

immaterial amount of stock options because their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive.

The diluted earnings per
share computation for the year ended December 31, 2016 excludes the impact of the forward contract related to the December 20, 2016 accelerated share repurchase transaction. Based upon the average daily volume weighted-average price of the
Bancorp’s common stock from the repurchase date through the fourth quarter of 2016, the counterparty to the transaction would have been required to deliver additional shares for the settlement of the forward contract as of December 31,
2016, and thus the impact of the forward contract related to the accelerated share repurchase transaction would have been anti-dilutive to earnings per share.

The diluted earnings per share computation for the year ended December 31, 2015 excludes the impact of the forward
contract related to the December 14, 2015 accelerated share repurchase

transaction. Based upon the average daily volume weighted-average price of the Bancorp’s common stock from the repurchase date through the fourth quarter of 2015, the counterparty to the
transaction would have been required to deliver additional shares for the settlement of the forward contract as of December 31, 2015, and thus the impact of the forward contract related to the accelerated share repurchase transaction would have
been anti-dilutive to earnings per share.

The diluted earnings per share computation for the year ended
December 31, 2014 excludes the impact of the forward contract related to the October 23, 2014 accelerated share repurchase transaction. Based upon the average daily volume weighted-average price of the Bancorp’s common stock from the
repurchase date through the fourth quarter of 2014, the counterparty to the transaction would have been required to deliver additional shares for the settlement of the forward contract as of December 31, 2014, and thus the impact of the forward

27. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

The Bancorp measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value in accordance with
U.S. GAAP, which defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. U.S. GAAP also establishes a fair value

hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels. For more information regarding the fair value hierarchy and how the Bancorp
measures fair value, refer to Note 1.

The following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for significant instruments
measured at fair value, as well as the general classification of such instruments pursuant to the valuation hierarchy.

Available-for-sale

and other securities and trading securities

Where quoted prices are available in an active market, securities are classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. Level 1
securities include U.S. Treasury securities and exchange-traded equities. If quoted market prices are not available, then fair values are estimated using pricing models, quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics or DCFs. Level 2
securities include federal agencies securities, obligations of states and political subdivisions securities, agency residential mortgage-backed securities, agency and

non-agency

commercial mortgage-backed
securities, asset-backed securities and other debt securities and equity securities. These securities are generally valued using a market approach based on observable prices of securities with similar characteristics.

Residential mortgage loans held for sale

For residential mortgage loans held for sale for which the fair value election has been made, fair value is estimated based upon
mortgage-backed securities prices and spreads to those prices or, for certain ARM loans, DCF models that may incorporate the anticipated portfolio composition, credit spreads of asset-backed securities with similar collateral and market conditions.
The anticipated portfolio composition includes the effect of interest rate spreads and discount rates due to loan characteristics such as the state in which the loan was originated, the loan amount and the ARM margin. Residential mortgage loans held
for sale that are valued based on mortgage-backed securities prices are classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy as the valuation is based on external pricing for similar instruments. ARM loans classified as held for sale are also
classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy due to the use of observable inputs in the DCF model. These observable inputs include interest rate spreads from agency mortgage-backed securities market rates and observable discount rates.

167  Fifth
Third Bancorp


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Residential mortgage loans

Residential mortgage loans held for sale that are reclassified to held for investment are transferred from Level 2 to Level 3 of the
fair value hierarchy. It is the Bancorp’s policy to value any transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy based on end of period fair values.

For residential mortgage loans for which the fair value election has been made, and that are reclassified from held for sale
to held for investment, the fair value estimation is based on mortgage-backed securities prices, interest rate risk and an internally developed credit component. Therefore, these loans are classified within Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy.
An adverse change in the loss rate or severity assumption would result in a decrease in fair value of the related loan. The Secondary Marketing department, which reports to the Bancorp’s Head of the Consumer Bank, in conjunction with the
Consumer Credit Risk department, which reports to the Bancorp’s Chief Risk Officer, are responsible for determining the valuation methodology for residential mortgage loans held for investment. The Secondary Marketing department reviews loss
severity assumptions quarterly to determine if adjustments are necessary based on decreases in observable housing market data. This group also reviews trades in comparable benchmark securities and adjusts the values of loans as necessary. Consumer
Credit Risk is responsible for the credit component of the fair value which is based on internally developed loss rate models that take into account historical loss rates and loss severities based on underlying collateral values.

Derivatives

Exchange-traded
derivatives valued using quoted prices and certain

over-the-counter

derivatives valued using active bids are classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy.
Most of the Bancorp’s derivative contracts are valued using DCF or other models that incorporate current market interest rates, credit spreads assigned to the derivative counterparties and other market parameters and, therefore, are classified
within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy. Such derivatives include basic and structured interest rate, foreign exchange and commodity swaps and options. Derivatives that are valued based upon models with significant unobservable market
parameters are classified within Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, derivatives classified as Level 3, which are valued using models containing unobservable inputs, consisted
primarily of a warrant associated with the initial sale of the Bancorp’s 51% interest in Vantiv Holding, LLC to Advent International and a total return swap associated with the Bancorp’s sale of Visa, Inc. Class B Shares. Level 3
derivatives also include IRLCs, which utilize internally generated loan closing rate assumptions as a significant unobservable input in the valuation process.

During the fourth quarter of 2016, the Bancorp exercised its right to purchase approximately 7.8 million Class C
Units underlying the warrant at the $15.98 strike price. This exercise was settled on a net basis for approximately 5.7 million Class C Units, which were then exchanged for approximately 5.7 million shares of Vantiv, Inc. Class A
Common Stock of which 4.8 million shares were sold in a secondary offering and 0.9 million shares were repurchased by Vantiv, Inc. For further information on the warrant transaction, refer to Note 19.

Prior to the aforementioned warrant transaction, the fair value of the warrant was calculated in conjunction with a third
party valuation provider by applying Black-Scholes option-pricing models

using probability weighted scenarios which contained the following inputs: Vantiv, Inc. stock price, strike price per the Warrant Agreement and unobservable inputs, such as expected term and
expected volatility.

For the warrant, an increase in the expected term (years) and the expected volatility assumptions
would result in an increase in the fair value; conversely, a decrease in these assumptions would result in a decrease in the fair value. The Accounting and Treasury departments, both of which report to the Bancorp’s Chief Financial Officer,
determined the valuation methodology for the warrant. Accounting and Treasury reviewed changes in fair value on a quarterly basis for reasonableness based on changes in historical and implied volatilities, expected terms, probability weightings of
the related scenarios and other assumptions.

Under the terms of the total return swap, the Bancorp will make or receive
payments based on subsequent changes in the conversion rate of the Visa, Inc. Class B Shares into Class A Shares. Additionally, the Bancorp will make a quarterly payment based on Visa’s stock price and the conversion rate of the Visa,
Inc. Class B Shares into Class A Shares until the date on which the Covered Litigation is settled. The fair value of the total return swap was calculated using a DCF model based on unobservable inputs consisting of management’s
estimate of the probability of certain litigation scenarios, the timing of the resolution of the Covered Litigation and Visa litigation loss estimates in excess, or shortfall, of the Bancorp’s proportional share of escrow funds.

An increase in the loss estimate or a delay in the resolution of the Covered Litigation would result in an increase in fair
value; conversely, a decrease in the loss estimate or an acceleration of the resolution of the Covered Litigation would result in a decrease in fair value. The Accounting and Treasury departments determined the valuation methodology for the total
return swap. Accounting and Treasury review the changes in fair value on a quarterly basis for reasonableness based on Visa stock price changes, litigation contingencies, and escrow funding.

The net fair value asset of the IRLCs at December 31, 2016 was $12 million. Immediate decreases in current
interest rates of 25 bps and 50 bps would result in increases in fair value of the IRLCs of approximately $6 million and $11 million, respectively. Immediate increases of current interest rates of 25 bps and 50 bps would result in
decreases in fair value of the IRLCs of approximately $6 million and $13 million, respectively. The decrease in fair value of IRLCs due to immediate 10% and 20% adverse changes in the assumed loan closing rates would be approximately
$1 million and $2 million, respectively, and the increase in fair value due to immediate 10% and 20% favorable changes in the assumed loan closing rates would be approximately $1 million and $2 million, respectively. These
sensitivities are hypothetical and should be used with caution, as changes in fair value based on a variation in assumptions typically cannot be extrapolated because the relationship of the change in assumptions to the change in fair value may not
be linear.

The Consumer Line of Business Finance department, which reports to the Bancorp’s Chief Financial
Officer, and the aforementioned Secondary Marketing department are responsible for determining the valuation methodology for IRLCs. Secondary Marketing, in conjunction with a third party valuation provider, periodically review loan closing rate
assumptions and recent loan sales to determine if adjustments are needed for current market conditions not reflected in historical data.

Commercial loans held for sale

During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Bancorp transferred $140 million and $37 million, respectively, of
commercial loans from the portfolio to loans held for sale that upon transfer were measured at the lower of cost or fair value. These loans had fair value adjustments during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 totaling $30 million
and $1 million, respectively, and were generally based on either appraisals of the underlying collateral or were estimated by discounting future cash flows using the current market rates of loans to borrowers with similar credit
characteristics, similar remaining maturities, prepayment speeds and loss severities and were, therefore, classified within Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. Additionally, during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 there were fair
value adjustments on existing loans held for sale of $2 million and $1 million, respectively. The fair value adjustments were also based on appraisals of the underlying collateral. The Bancorp recognized an immaterial amount of net gains
on the sale of certain commercial loans held for sale during the year ended December 31, 2016 and $5 million in gains on the sale of certain commercial loans held for sale during the year ended December 31, 2015.

The Accounting department determines the procedures for the valuation of commercial loans held for sale using appraised
value which may include a comparison to recently executed transactions of similar type loans. A monthly review of the portfolio is performed for reasonableness. Quarterly, appraisals approaching a year old are updated and the Real Estate Valuation
group, which reports to the Bancorp’s Chief Risk Officer, in conjunction with the Commercial Line of Business reviews the third party appraisals for reasonableness. Additionally, the Commercial Line of Business Finance department, which reports
to the Bancorp’s Chief Financial Officer, in conjunction with the Accounting department reviews all loan appraisal values, carry values and vintages. The Treasury department, which reports to the Bancorp’s Chief Financial Officer, is
responsible for the estimate of fair value adjustments when a discounted future cash flow valuation technique is employed.

Residential mortgage loans
held for sale

During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Bancorp did not transfer any residential mortgage loans from the
portfolio to loans held for sale. During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Bancorp transferred $233 million of residential mortgage loans

from the portfolio to loans held for sale that upon transfer were measured at the lower of cost or fair value using significant unobservable inputs. Fair values were estimated based on
mortgage-backed securities prices, interest rate risk and an internally developed credit component. These loans had $2 million of fair value adjustments during the year ended December 31, 2015. The Secondary Marketing department, which
reports to the Bancorp’s Head of the Consumer Bank, in conjunction with the Consumer Credit Risk department, which reports to the Bancorp’s Chief Risk Officer, is responsible for determining the valuation methodology for residential
mortgage loans held for investment. The Secondary Marketing department reviews loss severity assumptions quarterly to determine if adjustments are necessary based on decreases in observable housing market data. This group also reviews trades in
comparable benchmark securities and adjusts the values of loans as necessary. Consumer Credit Risk is responsible for the credit component of the fair value which is based on internally developed loss rate models that take into account historical
loss rates and loss severities based on underlying collateral values.

Commercial loans held for investment

During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Bancorp recorded nonrecurring impairment adjustments to certain commercial and
industrial loans, commercial mortgage loans, commercial construction loans and commercial leases held for investment. Larger commercial loans included within aggregate borrower relationship balances exceeding $1 million that exhibit probable or
observed credit weaknesses are subject to individual review for impairment. The Bancorp considers the current value of collateral, credit quality of any guarantees, the guarantor’s liquidity and willingness to cooperate, the loan structure and
other factors when evaluating whether an individual loan is impaired. When the loan is collateral dependent, the fair value of the loan is generally based on the fair value of the underlying collateral supporting the loan and therefore these loans
are classified within Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. In cases where the carrying value exceeds the fair value, an impairment loss is recognized. The fair values and recognized impairment losses are reflected in the previous tables.
Commercial Credit Risk, which reports to the Bancorp’s Chief Risk Officer, is responsible for preparing and reviewing the fair value estimates for commercial loans held for investment.

172  Fifth Third Bancorp


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Residential mortgage loans

During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Bancorp transferred approximately $55 million of restructured residential mortgage
loans from held for sale to the portfolio as the Bancorp no longer had the intent to sell the loans. Upon transfer, the Bancorp recognized a nonrecurring fair value adjustment of $1 million on these loans, which had previously been transferred
to held for sale in the fourth quarter of 2014.

MSRs

Mortgage interest rates increased during both the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 and the Bancorp recognized a recovery of
temporary impairment in certain classes of the MSR portfolio and the carrying value was adjusted to the fair value. MSRs do not trade in an active, open market with readily observable prices. While sales of MSRs do occur, the precise terms and
conditions typically are not readily available. Accordingly, the Bancorp estimates the fair value of MSRs using internal OAS models with certain unobservable inputs, primarily prepayment speed assumptions, OAS and weighted-average lives, resulting
in a classification within Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. Refer to Note 12 for further information on the assumptions used in the valuation of the Bancorp’s MSRs. The Secondary Marketing department and Treasury department are
responsible for determining the valuation methodology for MSRs. Representatives from Secondary Marketing, Treasury, Accounting and Risk Management are responsible for reviewing key assumptions used in the internal OAS model. Two external valuations
of the MSR portfolio are obtained from third parties that use valuation models in order to assess the reasonableness of the internal OAS model. Additionally, the Bancorp participates in peer surveys that provide additional confirmation of the
reasonableness of key assumptions utilized in the MSR valuation process and the resulting MSR prices.

OREO

During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Bancorp recorded nonrecurring adjustments to certain commercial and residential
real estate properties classified as OREO and measured at the lower of carrying amount or fair value. These nonrecurring losses were primarily due to declines in real estate values of the properties recorded in OREO. For the years ended
December 31, 2016 and 2015, these losses include $8 million and $14 million, respectively, recorded as charge-offs, on new OREO properties transferred from loans during the respective periods and $9 million and $10 million,
respectively, recorded as negative fair value adjustments on OREO in other noninterest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income subsequent to their transfer from loans. As discussed in the following paragraphs, the fair value amounts are
generally based on appraisals of the property values, resulting in a classification within Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. In cases where the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, less costs to sell, an impairment loss is recognized. The
previous tables reflect the fair value measurements of the properties before deducting the estimated costs to sell.

The
Real Estate Valuation department, which reports to the Bancorp’s Chief Risk Officer, is solely responsible for managing the appraisal process and evaluating the appraisal for commercial properties transferred to OREO. All appraisals on
commercial OREO properties are updated on at least an annual basis.

The Real Estate
Valuation department reviews the BPO data and internal market information to determine the initial

charge-off

on residential real estate loans transferred to OREO. Once the foreclosure process is completed,
the Bancorp performs an interior inspection to update the initial fair value of the property. These properties are reviewed at least every 30 days after the initial

interior inspections are completed. The Asset Manager receives a monthly status report for each property which includes the number of showings, recently sold properties, current comparable
listings and overall market conditions.

Bank premises and equipment

The Bancorp performs assessments of the recoverability of long-lived assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their
carrying values may not be recoverable. These properties are written down to their lower of cost or market values. At least annually thereafter, the Bancorp will review these properties for market fluctuations. The fair value amounts are generally
based on appraisals of the property values, resulting in a classification within Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. Corporate Facilities, which reports to the Bancorp’s Chief Administrative Officer, in conjunction with Accounting, are
responsible for preparing and reviewing the fair value estimates for bank premises. For further information on bank premises and equipment and discussion on changes to the branch network, refer to Note 7.

Operating lease equipment

During the
years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Bancorp recorded nonrecurring impairment adjustments to certain operating lease equipment. When evaluating whether an individual asset is impaired, the Bancorp considers the current fair value of the
asset, the changes in overall market demand for the asset and the rate of change in advancements associated with technological improvements that impact the demand for the specific asset under review. As part of this ongoing assessment, the Bancorp
determined that the carrying values of certain operating lease equipment were not recoverable and as a result, the Bancorp recorded an impairment loss equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeded the fair value. The fair
value amounts were generally based on appraised values of the assets, resulting in a classification within Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Bancorp recorded net losses of
$9 million and $33 million, respectively, as a reduction to corporate banking revenue in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The Commercial Leasing department, which reports to the Bancorp’s Chief Operating Officer, is responsible
for preparing and reviewing the fair value estimates for operating lease equipment. Refer to Note 8 for further information on impairment charges related to certain operating lease equipment.

Private equity investments

In December
2013, the U.S. banking agencies issued final rules to implement section 619 of the DFA, known as the Volcker Rule, which places limitations on banking organizations’ ability to own, sponsor or have certain relationships with certain private
equity funds. The Bancorp recognized $9 million and $1 million of OTTI primarily associated with certain nonconforming investments affected by the Volcker Rule during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The
Bancorp performed nonrecurring fair value measurements on a fund by fund basis to determine whether OTTI existed. The Bancorp estimated the fair value of a fund by applying an estimated market discount to the reported net asset value of the fund.
Because the length of time until the investment will become redeemable is generally not certain, these funds were classified within Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. An adverse change in the reported net asset values or estimated market
discounts, where applicable, would result in a decrease in the fair value estimate. In cases where the carrying value exceeds the fair value, an impairment loss is recognized. The Bancorp’s Private Equity department, which reports to the Chief
Strategy Officer, in conjunction with Accounting, is responsible for preparing and reviewing the fair value estimates.

173  Fifth
Third Bancorp


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Fair Value Option

The Bancorp elected to measure certain residential mortgage loans held for sale under the fair value option as allowed under U.S. GAAP.
Electing to measure residential mortgage loans held for sale at fair value reduces certain timing differences and better matches changes in the value of these assets with changes in the value of derivatives used as economic hedges for these assets.
Management’s intent to sell residential mortgage loans classified as held for sale may change over time due to such factors as changes in the overall liquidity in markets or changes in characteristics specific to certain loans held for sale.
Consequently, these loans may be reclassified to loans held for investment and maintained in the Bancorp’s loan portfolio. In such cases, the loans will continue to be measured at fair value.

Fair value changes recognized in earnings for instruments held at
December 31, 2016 and 2015 for which the fair value option was elected, as well as the changes in fair value of the underlying IRLCs, included gains of $6 million and $17 million, respectively. These gains are reported in mortgage
banking net revenue in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Valuation adjustments related to instrument-specific
credit risk for residential mortgage loans measured at fair value negatively impacted the fair value of those loans by $2 million at both December 31, 2016 and 2015. Interest on residential mortgage loans measured at fair value is accrued
as it is earned using the effective interest method and is reported as interest income in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Cash and due from banks, other securities, other short-term investments, deposits, federal funds purchased
and other short-term borrowings

For financial instruments with a short-term or no stated maturity, prevailing market rates and
limited credit risk, carrying amounts approximate fair value. Those financial instruments include cash and due from banks, other securities consisting of FHLB, FRB and DTCC restricted stock, other short-term investments, certain deposits (demand,
interest checking, savings, money market, foreign office

deposits and other deposits), federal funds purchased and other short-term borrowings excluding
FHLB borrowings. Fair values for other time deposits, certificates of deposit $100,000 and over and FHLB borrowings were estimated using a DCF calculation that applies prevailing LIBOR/swap interest rates and a spread for new issuances with similar
terms.

175  Fifth
Third Bancorp


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Held-to-maturity

securities

The Bancorp’s

held-to-maturity

securities are
primarily composed of instruments that provide income tax credits as the economic return on the investment. The fair value of these instruments is estimated based on current U.S. Treasury tax credit rates.

Loans held for sale

Fair values for
commercial loans held for sale were valued based on executable bids when available, or on DCF models incorporating appraisals of the underlying collateral, as well as assumptions about investor return requirements and amounts and timing of expected
cash flows. Fair values for residential mortgage loans held for sale were valued based on estimated third-party valuations utilizing recent sales data from similar transactions. Broker opinion statements were also obtained as additional evidence to
support the third-party valuations. Fair values for other consumer loans held for sale were based on contractual values upon which the loans may be sold to a third party, and approximate their carrying value.

Portfolio loans and leases, net

Fair values were estimated based on either appraisals of the underlying collateral or by discounting future cash flows using the current market
rates of loans to borrowers with similar credit characteristics, similar remaining maturities, prepayment speeds and loss severities. The Bancorp estimates fair values at the transaction level whenever possible. For certain products with a large
number of homogenous transactions, the Bancorp employs a pool approach. This approach involves stratifying and sorting the entire population of transactions into a smaller number of pools with like characteristics. Characteristics may include
maturity date, coupon, origination date and principal amortization method.

Long-term debt

Fair value of long-term debt was based on quoted market prices, when available, or a DCF calculation using LIBOR/swap interest rates and, in
some cases, Fifth Third credit and/or debt instrument spreads for new issuances with similar terms.

pursuant to which it assesses the adequacy of capital in examining and supervising a BHC and in analyzing applications to it under the BHCA of 1956, as amended. These guidelines include quantitative measures that assign risk weightings to assets and

off-balance

sheet items, as well as define and set minimum regulatory capital requirements. The regulatory capital requirements were revised by the Basel III Final Rule which was effective for the Bancorp on
January 1, 2015, subject to

phase-in

periods for certain of its components and other provisions. It established quantitative measures that assign risk weightings to assets and

off-balance

sheet items and also defined and set minimum regulatory capital requirements. The minimum capital ratios established under the Basel III Final Rule are Common equity Tier 1 capital of at least 4.5% (CET1
ratio), Tier I capital (core capital) of at least 6% of risk-weighted assets (Tier I risk-based capital ratio), Total regulatory capital (Tier I plus Tier II capital) of at least 8% of risk-weighted assets (Total risk-based capital ratio) and Tier I
capital of at least 4% of adjusted quarterly average assets (Tier I leverage ratio). Failure to meet the minimum capital requirements can initiate certain actions by regulators that could have a direct material effect on the Consolidated Financial
Statements of the Bancorp. Additionally, when fully

phased-in

in 2019, the Basel III Final Rule will include a capital conservation buffer requirement of 2.5% in addition to the minimum capital requirements of
the CET1, Tier I capital and Total risk-based capital ratios in order to avoid limitations on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments to executive officers.

The Basel III Final Rule provided for certain BHCs, including the Bancorp, to opt out of including AOCI in regulatory
capital and also retained the treatment of residential mortgage exposures consistent with the prior Basel I capital rules. Fifth Third made a

one-time

permanent election to not include AOCI in regulatory
capital in the March 31, 2015 FFIEC 031 for its banking subsidiary and FR

Y-9C

filing for the Bancorp. The Basel III Final Rule phases out the inclusion of certain TruPS as a component of Tier I capital.
Under these provisions, these TruPS would qualify as a component of Tier II capital. At December 31,

2016, the Bancorp’s TruPS no longer qualified for Tier I capital, compared to $13 million of TruPS, or 1 bp of risk-weighted assets, which qualified as Tier I capital at
December 31, 2015. The Bancorp’s Tier II capital consists principally of term subordinated debt and, subject to limitations, allowances for credit losses.

The Bancorp’s assets and credit equivalent amounts of

off-balance

sheet items
are assigned to one of several broad risk categories according to the Standardized Approach for risk-weighting assets as defined in the Basel III Final Rule. The aggregate dollar value of the amount of each category is multiplied by the associated
risk weighting. The resulting weighted values from each of the risk categories in sum is the total risk-weighted assets. Quarterly average assets are a component of the Tier I leverage ratio and for this purpose do not include goodwill and any other
intangible assets and other investments that the FRB determines should be deducted from Tier I capital.

The Board of
Governors of the Federal Reserve System issued capital adequacy guidelines for banking subsidiaries substantially similar to those adopted for BHCs, as described previously. In addition, the U.S. banking agencies have issued substantially similar
regulations to implement the system of prompt corrective action established by Section 38 of the FDIA. Under the regulations, a bank generally shall be deemed to be well-capitalized if it has a CET1 ratio of 6.5% or more, a Tier I risk-based
capital ratio of 8% or more, a Total risk-based capital ratio of 10% or more, a Tier I leverage ratio of 5% or more and is not subject to any written capital order or directive. If an institution becomes undercapitalized, it would become subject to
significant additional oversight, regulations and requirements as mandated by the FDIA.

The Bancorp and its banking
subsidiary, Fifth Third Bank, had CET1 capital, Tier I risk-based capital, Total risk-based capital and Tier I leverage ratios above the well-capitalized levels at December 31, 2016 and 2015. To continue to qualify for financial holding company
status pursuant to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999, the Bancorp’s banking subsidiary must, among other things, maintain “well-capitalized” capital ratios. In addition, the Bancorp exceeded the “capital conservation
buffer” ratio for all periods presented.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

30. BUSINESS SEGMENTS

The Bancorp reports on four business segments: Commercial Banking, Branch Banking, Consumer
Lending and Wealth and Asset Management (formerly Investment Advisors). Results of the Bancorp’s business segments are presented based on its management structure and management accounting practices. The structure and accounting practices are
specific to the Bancorp; therefore, the financial results of the Bancorp’s business segments are not necessarily comparable with similar information for other financial institutions. The Bancorp refines its methodologies from time to time as
management’s accounting practices and businesses change.

The Bancorp manages interest rate risk centrally at the
corporate level. By employing an FTP methodology, the business segments are insulated from most benchmark interest rate volatility, enabling them to focus on serving customers through the origination of loans and acceptance of deposits. The FTP
methodology assigns charge rates and credit rates to classes of assets and liabilities, respectively, based on the estimated amount and timing of cash flows for each transaction. Assigning the FTP rate based on matching the duration of cash flows
allocates interest income and interest expense to each business segment so its resulting net interest income is insulated from future changes in benchmark interest rates. The Bancorp’s FTP methodology also allocates the contribution to net
interest income of the asset-generating and deposit-providing businesses on a duration-adjusted basis to better attribute the driver of the performance. As the asset and liability durations are not perfectly matched, the residual impact of the FTP
methodology is captured in General Corporate and Other. The charge and credit rates are determined using the FTP rate curve, which is based on an estimate of Fifth Third’s marginal borrowing cost in the wholesale funding markets. The FTP curve
is constructed using the U.S. swap curve, brokered CD pricing and unsecured debt pricing.

The Bancorp adjusts the FTP
charge and credit rates as dictated by changes in interest rates for various interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and by the review of behavioural assumptions, such as prepayment rates on interest-earning assets and the estimated
durations for indeterminate-lived deposits. Key assumptions, including the credit rates provided for deposit accounts, are reviewed annually. Credit rates for deposit products and charge rates for loan products may be reset more frequently in
response to changes in market conditions. The credit rates for several deposit products were reset January 1, 2016 to reflect the current market rates and updated market assumptions. These rates were generally higher than those in place during
2015, thus net interest income for deposit-providing business segments was positively impacted during 2016. FTP charge rates on assets were affected by the prevailing level of interest rates and by the duration and repricing characteristics of the
portfolio. As overall market rates increased, the FTP charge increased for asset-generating business segments during 2016.

During the first quarter of 2016, the Bancorp refined its methodology for allocating provision for loan and lease losses
expense to the business segments to include charges or benefits associated with changes in criticized commercial loan levels in addition to actual net charge-offs experienced by the loans and leases owned by each business segment. The results of
operations

and financial position for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 were adjusted to reflect this change. Provision for loan and lease losses expense attributable to loan and lease growth
and changes in ALLL factors are captured in General Corporate and Other. The financial results of the business segments include allocations for shared services and headquarters expenses. Additionally, the business segments form synergies by taking
advantage of cross-sell opportunities and when funding operations by accessing the capital markets as a collective unit.

The results of operations and financial position for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 were adjusted to
reflect changes in internal expense allocation methodologies.

The following is a description of each of the
Bancorp’s business segments and the products and services they provide to their respective client bases.

Commercial Banking

offers credit intermediation, cash management and financial services to large and middle-market
businesses and government and professional customers. In addition to the traditional lending and depository offerings, Commercial Banking products and services include global cash management, foreign exchange and international trade finance,
derivatives and capital markets services, asset-based lending, real estate finance, public finance, commercial leasing and syndicated finance.

Branch Banking

provides a full range of deposit and loan and lease products to individuals and small businesses
through 1,191 full-service banking centers. Branch Banking offers depository and loan products, such as checking and savings accounts, home equity loans and lines of credit, credit cards and loans for automobiles and other personal financing needs,
as well as products designed to meet the specific needs of small businesses, including cash management services.

Consumer Lending

includes the Bancorp’s residential mortgage, home equity, automobile and other indirect lending
activities. Direct lending activities include the origination, retention and servicing of residential mortgage and home equity loans or lines of credit, sales and securitizations of those loans, pools of loans or lines of credit, and all associated
hedging activities. Indirect lending activities include extending loans to consumers through correspondent lenders and automobile dealers.

Wealth and Asset Management

provides a full range of investment alternatives for individuals, companies and

not-for-profit

organizations. In the second quarter of 2016, the Investment Advisors segment name was changed to Wealth and Asset Management to better reflect the services
provided by the business segment. Wealth and Asset Management is made up of four main businesses: FTS, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Bancorp; ClearArc Capital, Inc., an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Bancorp; Fifth Third
Private Bank; and Fifth Third Institutional Services. FTS offers full service retail brokerage services to individual clients and broker-dealer services to the institutional marketplace. ClearArc Capital, Inc. provides asset management services.
Fifth Third Private Bank offers holistic strategies to affluent clients in wealth planning, investing, insurance and wealth protection. Fifth Third Institutional Services provides advisory services for institutional clients including states and
municipalities.

Competition

The Bancorp competes for
deposits, loans and other banking services in its principal geographic markets as well as in selected national markets as opportunities arise. In addition to traditional financial institutions, the Bancorp competes with securities dealers, brokers,
mortgage bankers, investment advisors and insurance companies as well as financial technology companies. These companies compete across geographic boundaries and provide customers with meaningful alternatives to traditional banking services in
nearly all significant products. The increasingly competitive environment is a result primarily of changes in regulation, changes in technology, product delivery systems and the accelerating pace of consolidation among financial service providers.
These competitive trends are likely to continue.

Acquisitions and Investments

The Bancorp’s strategy for growth includes strengthening its presence in core markets, expanding into contiguous markets and broadening
its product offerings while taking into account the integration and other risks of growth. The Bancorp evaluates strategic acquisition and investment opportunities and conducts due diligence activities in connection with possible transactions. As a
result, discussions, and in some cases, negotiations may take place and future acquisitions involving cash, debt or equity securities may occur. These typically involve the payment of a premium over book value and current market price, and
therefore, some dilution of book value and net income per share may occur with any future transactions.

Regulation and Supervision

In addition to the generally applicable state and federal laws governing businesses and employers, the Bancorp and its banking subsidiary are
subject to extensive regulation by federal and state laws and regulations applicable to financial institutions and their parent companies. Virtually all aspects of the business of the Bancorp and its banking subsidiary are subject to specific
requirements or restrictions and general regulatory oversight. The principal objectives of state and federal banking laws and regulations and the supervision, regulation and examination of banks and their parent companies (such as the Bancorp) by
bank regulatory agencies are the maintenance of the safety and soundness of financial institutions, maintenance of the federal deposit insurance system and the protection of consumers or classes of consumers, rather than the specific protection of
shareholders of a bank or the parent company of a bank. The Bancorp and its subsidiaries are subject to an extensive regulatory framework of complex and comprehensive federal and state laws and regulations addressing the provision of banking and
other financial services and other aspects of the Bancorp’s businesses and operations. Regulation and regulatory oversight have increased significantly since 2010 as a result of the passage of The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer
Protection Act (the “DFA”).

184  Fifth Third Bancorp


The DFA imposes regulatory requirements and oversight over banks and other financial institutions in a number of ways, among which are (i) creating the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau
(the “CFPB”) to regulate consumer financial products and services; (ii) creating the Financial Stability Oversight Council to identify and impose additional regulatory oversight on large financial firms; (iii) granting orderly
liquidation authority to the FDIC for the liquidation of financial corporations that pose a risk to the financial system of the U.S.; (iv) requiring financial institutions to draft a resolution plan that contemplates the dissolution of the
enterprise and submit that resolution plan to both the Federal Reserve and the FDIC; (v) limiting debit card interchange fees; (vi) adopting certain changes to shareholder rights and responsibilities, including a shareholder “say on
pay” vote on executive compensation; (vii) strengthening the SEC’s powers to regulate securities markets; (viii) regulating OTC derivative markets; (ix) restricting variable-rate lending by requiring the ability to repay to
be determined for variable-rate loans by using the maximum rate that will apply during the first five years of a variable-rate loan term, and making more loans subject to provisions for higher cost loans, new disclosures, and certain other
revisions; (x) changing the base upon which the deposit insurance assessment is assessed from deposits to, substantially, average consolidated assets minus equity; and (xi) amending the Truth in Lending Act with respect to mortgage
originations, including originator compensation, minimum repayment standards, and prepayment considerations. To the extent the following material describes statutory or regulatory provisions, it is qualified in its entirety by reference to the
particular statute or regulation. In addition, due to the volume of regulations required by the DFA, not all proposed or final regulations that may have an impact on the Bancorp or its banking subsidiary are necessarily discussed.

Regulators

The Bancorp and/or its
banking subsidiary are subject to regulation and supervision primarily by the FRB, the CFPB and the Ohio Division of Financial Institutions (the “Division”) and additionally by certain other functional regulators and self-regulatory
organizations. The Bancorp is also subject to regulation by the SEC by virtue of its status as a public company and due to the nature of some of its businesses. The Bancorp’s banking subsidiary is subject to regulation by the FDIC, which
insures the bank’s deposits as permitted by law.

The federal and state laws and regulations that are applicable to
banks and to BHCs regulate, among other matters, the scope of their business, their activities, their investments, their capital and liquidity levels, their reserves against deposits, the timing of the availability of deposited funds, the amount of
loans to individual and related borrowers and the nature, the amount of and collateral for certain loans, and the amount of interest that may be charged on loans as applicable. Various federal and state consumer laws and regulations also affect the
services provided to consumers.

The Bancorp and/or its banking subsidiary are required to file various reports with,
and is subject to examination by regulators, including the FRB and the Division. The FRB, the Division and the CFPB have the authority to issue orders for BHCs and/or banks to cease and desist from certain banking practices and violations of
conditions imposed by, or violations of agreements with, the FRB, the Division and the CFPB. Certain of the Bancorp’s and/or its banking subsidiary regulators are also empowered to assess civil money penalties against companies or individuals
in certain situations, such as when there is a violation of a law or regulation.

Applicable state and federal laws also grant certain regulators the authority to impose additional requirements and restrictions on the activities of the Bancorp and or its banking subsidiary
and, in some situations, the imposition of such additional requirements and restrictions will not be publicly available information.

Acquisitions

The BHCA requires the prior approval of the FRB for a BHC to acquire substantially all the assets of a bank or to acquire direct or
indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of any class of the voting shares of any bank, BHC or savings association, or to increase any such

non-majority

ownership or control of any bank, BHC or savings
association, or to merge or consolidate with any BHC.

The BHCA prohibits a BHC from acquiring a direct or indirect
interest in or control of more than 5% of any class of the voting shares of a company that is not a bank or a BHC and from engaging directly or indirectly in activities other than those of banking, managing or controlling banks or furnishing
services to its banking subsidiaries, except that it may engage in and may own shares of companies engaged in certain activities the FRB has determined to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be proper incident
thereto.

Financial Holding Companies

The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (“GLBA”) permits a qualifying BHC to become a financial holding company (“FHC”) and
thereby to engage directly or indirectly in a broader range of activities than those permitted for a BHC under the BHCA. Permitted activities for a FHC include securities underwriting and dealing, insurance underwriting and brokerage, merchant
banking and other activities that are declared by the FRB, in cooperation with the Treasury Department, to be “financial in nature or incidental thereto” or are declared by the FRB unilaterally to be “complementary” to financial
activities. In addition, a FHC is allowed to conduct permissible new financial activities or acquire permissible

non-bank

financial companies with

after-the-fact

notice to the FRB. A BHC may elect to become a FHC if each of its banking subsidiaries is well capitalized, is well managed and has at least a “Satisfactory” rating under the
Community Reinvestment Act (“CRA”). The DFA also extended the well capitalized and well managed requirement to the BHC. In 2000, the Bancorp elected and qualified for FHC status under the GLBA. To maintain FHC status, a holding company
must continue to meet certain requirements. The failure to meet such requirements could result in material restrictions on the activities of the FHC and may also adversely affect the FHC’s ability to enter into certain transactions or obtain
necessary approvals in connection therewith, as well as loss of FHC status. If restrictions are imposed on the activities of an FHC, such information may not necessarily be available to the public.

Dividends

The Bancorp depends in part
upon dividends received from its direct and indirect subsidiaries, including its indirect banking subsidiary, to fund its activities, including the payment of dividends. The Bancorp and its banking subsidiary are subject to various federal and state
restrictions on their ability to pay dividends. The FRB has authority to prohibit BHCs from paying dividends if such payment is deemed to be an unsafe or unsound practice.

185  Fifth
Third Bancorp


The FRB has indicated generally that it may be an unsafe or unsound practice for BHCs to pay dividends unless a BHC’s net income is sufficient to fund the dividends and the expected rate of
earnings retention is consistent with the organization’s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. The ability to pay dividends may be further limited by provisions of the DFA and implanting regulations (see Systematically
Significant Companies and Capital).

Source of Strength

Under long-standing FRB policy and now as codified in the DFA, a BHC is expected to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to
each of its banking subsidiaries and to commit resources to their support. This support may be required at times when the BHC may not have the resources to provide it.

FDIC Assessments

Pursuant to the DFA,
in 2011 the FDIC revised the framework by which insured depository institutions with more than $10 billion in assets (“large IDIs”) are assessed for purposes of payments to the Deposit Insurance Fund (the “DIF”).

Prior to the passage of the DFA, a large IDI’s DIF premiums principally were based on the size of an IDI’s
domestic deposit base. The DFA changed the assessment base from a large IDI’s domestic deposit base to its total assets less tangible equity. In addition to potentially greatly increasing the size of a large IDI’s assessment base, the
expansion of the assessment base affords the FDIC much greater flexibility to vary its assessment system based upon the different asset classes that large IDIs normally hold on their balance sheets.

To implement this provision, the FDIC created an assessment scheme vastly different from the deposit-based system. Under the
new system, large IDIs are assessed under a complex “scorecard” methodology that seeks to capture both the probability that an individual large IDI will fail and the magnitude of the impact on the DIF if such a failure occurs.

During the first quarter of 2016, the FDIC issued a final rule implementing a 4.5 bps surcharge on the quarterly FDIC
insurance assessments of insured depository institutions with total consolidated assets of $10 billion or more. The Bancorp became subject to the FDIC surcharge and reduced regular FDIC insurance assessments on July 1, 2016. The surcharges
will continue through the quarter that the DIF reserve ratio first reaches or exceeds 1.35% of insured deposits, but not later than December 31, 2018. If the reserve ratio does not reach 1.35% by December 31, 2018, the FDIC will impose a
shortfall assessment on March 31, 2019, on insured depository institutions with total consolidated assets of $10 billion or more.

Transactions with Affiliates

Sections
23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act, restrict transactions between a bank and its affiliates (as defined in Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act), including a parent BHC. The Bancorp’s banking subsidiary is subject to certain
restrictions, including but not limited to restrictions on loans to its affiliates, on investments in the stock or securities thereof, on the taking of such stock or securities as collateral for loans to any borrower, and on the issuance of a
guarantee or letter of credit on their behalf. Among other things, these restrictions limit the amount of such transactions, require collateral in prescribed amounts for extensions of credit, prohibit the purchase of low quality assets and require
that the terms of such transactions be substantially equivalent to terms of comparable transactions with

non-affiliates.

Generally, the Bancorp’s banking subsidiary is limited in its extension of credit
to any affiliate to 10% of the banking subsidiary’s capital stock and surplus and its extension of credit to all affiliates to 20% of the banking subsidiary’s capital stock and surplus.

Community Reinvestment Act

The CRA generally requires insured depository institutions, including the Bank, to identify the communities they serve and to make loans and
investments and provide services that meet the credit needs of those communities and the CRA requires the FRB to evaluate the performance of such depository institutions with respect to these CRA obligations. Depository institutions must maintain
comprehensive records of their CRA activities for purposes of these examinations. The FRB must take into account the record of performance of depository institutions in meeting the credit needs of the entire community served, including

low-

and moderate-income neighborhoods. For purposes of CRA examinations, the FRB rates such institutions’ compliance with the CRA as “Outstanding,” “Satisfactory,” “Needs to
Improve” or “Substantial Noncompliance.” The Bank must be well-capitalized, well-managed and maintain at least a “Satisfactory” CRA rating for the Bancorp to retain its status as a financial holding company. Failure to meet
these requirements could result in the FRB placing limitations or conditions on the Bancorp’s activities (and the commencement of new activities, including merger with or acquisitions of other financial institutions) and could ultimately result
in the loss of financial holding company status. The FRB conducted a regularly scheduled examination covering 2011 through 2013 to determine the Bancorp’s banking subsidiary’s compliance with the CRA. This CRA examination resulted in a
rating of “Needs to Improve”. The Bank believes that the “Needs to Improve” rating reflects legacy issues that have been remediated during the intervening three years. While the Bank’s CRA rating is “Needs to
Improve” the Bancorp and the Bank face limitations and conditions on certain activities, including the commencement of new activities and merger with or acquisitions of other financial institutions. The Bank’s next CRA examination
commenced during the fourth quarter of 2016.

Capital Generally

The FRB has established capital guidelines for BHCs and FHCs. The FRB, the Division and the FDIC have also issued regulations establishing
capital requirements for banks. Failure to meet capital requirements could subject the Bancorp and its banking subsidiary to a variety of restrictions and enforcement actions. In addition, as discussed previously, the Bancorp and its banking
subsidiary must remain well capitalized and well managed for the Bancorp to retain its status as a FHC.

Systemically Significant Companies and
Capital

Title I of the DFA created a new regulatory regime for large BHCs. U.S. BHCs with $50 billion or more in total
consolidated assets, including Fifth Third, are subject to enhanced prudential standards and early remediation requirements under Title I. Title I of the DFA established a broad framework for identifying, applying heightened supervision and
regulation to, and (as necessary) limiting the size and activities of systemically significant financial companies.

The
DFA required the FRB to impose enhanced capital and risk-management standards on these firms and mandated the FRB to conduct annual stress tests on all BHCs with $50 billion or more in assets to determine whether they have adequate capital
available to absorb losses in baseline, adverse, or severely adverse economic conditions. In November 2011, the FRB adopted final rules requiring BHCs with $50 billion or more in consolidated assets to submit capital plans to the FRB on an
annual basis.

186  Fifth Third Bancorp


Under the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) process, the FRB annually evaluates an institution’s capital adequacy, internal capital adequacy, assessment processes and capital
distribution plans such as dividend payments and stock repurchases. Banks are also required to report certain data to the FRB on a quarterly basis to allow the FRB to monitor progress against the approved capital plans.

The CCAR process is intended to help ensure that BHCs have robust, forward-looking capital planning processes that account
for each company’s unique risks and that permit continued operations during times of economic and financial stress. The mandatory elements of the capital plan are an assessment of the expected uses and sources of capital over a nine-quarter
planning horizon, a description of all planned capital actions over the planning horizon, a discussion of any expected changes to the Bancorp’s business plan that are likely to have a material impact on its capital adequacy or liquidity, a
detailed description of the Bancorp’s process for assessing capital adequacy and the Bancorp’s capital policy. The stress tests require increased involvement by boards of directors in stress testing and public disclosure of the results of
both the FRB’s annual stress tests and a BHC’s annual supervisory stress tests, and semi-annual internal stress tests.

In 2014, the FRB amended its capital planning and stress testing rules to, among other things, generally limit a BHC’s
ability to make quarterly capital distributions – that is, dividends and share repurchases – commencing April 1, 2015 if the amount of the bank’s actual cumulative quarterly capital issuances of instruments that qualify as
regulatory capital are less than the bank had indicated in its submitted capital plan as to which it received a

non-objection

from the FRB. For example, if the BHC issued a smaller amount of additional common
stock than it had stated in its capital plan, it would be required to reduce common dividends and/or the amount of common stock repurchases so that the dollar amount of capital distributions, net of the dollar amount of additional common stock
issued (“net distributions”), is no greater than the dollar amount of net distributions relating to its common stock included in its capital plan, as measured on an aggregate basis beginning in the third quarter of the nine-quarter
planning horizon through the end of the then current quarter. However, not raising sufficient amounts of common stock as planned would not affect distributions related to Additional Tier I Capital instruments and/ or Tier II Capital. These
limitations also contain several important qualifications and exceptions, including that scheduled dividend payments on (as opposed to repurchases of) a BHC’s Additional Tier I Capital and Tier II Capital instruments are not restricted if the
BHC fails to issue a sufficient amount of such instruments as planned, as well as provisions for certain de minimis excess distributions. BHCs with consolidated assets of $50 billion or more are required to submit their 2017 capital plan to the
FRB by April 5, 2017.

In December of 2010 and revised in June of 2011, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision
(the “Basel Committee”) issued Basel III, a global regulatory framework, to enhance international capital standards. Basel III is designed to materially improve the quality of regulatory capital and introduces a new minimum common equity
requirement. Basel III also raises the minimum capital requirements and introduces capital conservation and countercyclical buffers to induce banking organizations to hold capital in excess of regulatory minimums. In addition, Basel III establishes
an international leverage standard for internationally active banks.

In July of 2013, U.S. banking regulators approved the final enhanced
regulatory capital rules (“Final Capital Rules”). The Final Capital Rules substantially revise the risk-based capital requirements applicable to BHCs and their depository institution subsidiaries as compared to the previous U.S. risk-based
capital and leverage ratio rules, and thereby implement certain provisions of the DFA.

The Final Capital Rules, among
other things, (i) introduce a new capital measure “Common Equity Tier I” (“CET1”), (ii) specify that Tier I capital consists of CET1 and “Additional Tier I capital” instruments meeting specified requirements,
(iii) define CET1 narrowly by requiring that most adjustments to regulatory capital measures be made to CET1 and not to the other components of capital and (iv) expand the scope of the adjustments as compared to existing regulations. CET1
capital consists of common stock instruments that meet the eligibility criteria in the final rules, including; common stock and related surplus, net of treasury stock and retained earnings, certain minority interests and accumulated other
comprehensive income (“AOCI”), if elected.

When fully

phased-in

on
January 1, 2019, the Final Capital Rules require banking organizations to maintain (i) a minimum ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 4.5%, plus a 2.5% “capital conservation buffer” (which is added to the 4.5% CET1
ratio as that buffer is

phased-in,

effectively resulting in a minimum ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 7.0% upon full implementation), (ii) a minimum ratio of Tier I capital to
risk-weighted assets of at least 6.0%, plus the capital conservation buffer (which is added to the 6.0% Tier I capital ratio as that buffer is

phased-in,

effectively resulting in a minimum Tier I capital ratio
of 8.5% upon full implementation), (iii) a minimum ratio of total capital (that is, Tier I plus Tier 2 capital) to risk-weighted assets of at least 8.0%, plus the capital conservation buffer (which is added to the 8.0% total capital ratio as
that buffer is

phased-in,

effectively resulting in a minimum total capital ratio of 10.5% upon full implementation) and (iv) a minimum Tier I leverage ratio of 4.0%, calculated as the ratio of Tier I
capital to adjusted average consolidated assets.

Banking institutions with a ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets
above the minimum but below the conservation buffer will face limitations on the payment of dividends, common stock repurchases and discretionary cash payments to executive officers based on the amount of the shortfall.

The Final Capital Rules provide for a number of deductions from and adjustments to CET1. These include, for example, the
requirement that mortgage servicing rights, deferred tax assets dependent upon future taxable income and significant investments in

non-consolidated

financial entities be deducted from CET1 to the extent that
any one such category exceeds 10% of CET1 or all such categories in the aggregate exceed 15% of CET1. Under the Final Capital Rules, the Bancorp made a

one-time

election (the

“Opt-out

Election”) to filter certain AOCI components, comparable to the treatment under the current general risk-based capital rule.

The Final Capital Rules were effective for the Bancorp on January 1, 2015, subject to

phase-in

periods for certain of their components and other provisions. Although not currently required, Fifth Third Bancorp believes the aforementioned capital ratios under the revised Final Capital Rules meet
or exceed the ratios on a fully

phased-in

basis. Refer to the

Non-GAAP

Financial Measures section of MD&A for an estimated CET1 capital ratio under the Basel III
Final Rule (fully

phased-in)

as of December 31, 2016.

187  Fifth
Third Bancorp


In February 2014, the FRB approved a final rule implementing several
heightened prudential requirements. The rules require BHCs with $10 billion or more in consolidated assets to establish risk committees and require BHCs with $50 billion or more in total consolidated assets to comply with enhanced
liquidity and overall risk management standards, including

company-run

liquidity stress testing and a buffer of highly liquid assets based on projected funding needs for various time horizons, including 30,
60, and 90 days. These liquidity-related provisions are designed to be complementary, and in addition to the Final LCR Rule applicable to BHCs (as discussed below). Rules to implement two other components of the DFA’s enhanced prudential
standards –single-counterparty credit limits and early remediation requirements– are still under consideration by the FRB. Fifth Third has conducted a self evaluation of all the requirements within the enhanced prudential standards, and
believe the necessary steps have been taken to ensure compliance with all requirements regarding liquidity, risk exposures, and early remediation.

Liquidity Regulation

Liquidity risk
management and supervision have become increasingly important since the financial crisis. On September 3, 2014, the FRB and other banking regulators adopted final rules (“Final LCR Rule”) implementing a U.S. version of the Basel
Committee’s Liquidity Coverage Ratio requirement (“LCR”), which is designed to ensure that the banking entity maintains an adequate level of unencumbered high-quality liquid assets (“HQLA”) equal to the entity’s
expected net cash outflow for a

30-day

time horizon (or, if greater, 25% of its expected total cash outflow) under an acute liquidity stress scenario. The rules apply in modified form to banking organizations,
such as the Bancorp, having $50 billion or more in total consolidated assets but less than $250 billion. The LCR is the ratio of an institution’s stock of HQLA (the numerator) over projected net cash

out-flows

over the

30-day

horizon (the denominator), in each case, as calculated pursuant to the Final LCR Rule. Once fully

phased-in,

a subject institution must maintain an LCR equal to at least 100% in order to satisfy this regulatory requirement. Only specific classes of assets, including U.S. Treasuries, other U.S. government
obligations and agency mortgaged-backed securities, qualify under the rule as HQLA, with classes of assets deemed relatively less liquid and/or subject to greater degree of credit risk subject to certain haircuts and caps for purposes of calculating
the numerator under the Final LCR Rule. The total net cash outflows amount is determined under the rule by applying certain hypothetical outflow and inflow rates, which reflect certain standardized stressed assumptions, against the balances of the
banking organization’s funding sources, obligations, transactions and assets over the

30-day

stress period. Inflows that can be included to offset outflows are limited to 75% of outflows (which
effectively means that banking organizations must hold high-quality liquid assets equal to 25% of outflows even if outflows perfectly match inflows over the stress period). The total net cash outflow amount for the modified LCR applicable to the
Bancorp is capped at 70% of the outflow rate that applies to the full LCR.

The initial compliance date for the modified
LCR was January 31, 2016, with the requirement fully

phased-in

on January 1, 2017. The LCR is a minimum requirement, and the FRB can impose additional liquidity requirements as a supervisory matter.

In addition, the Bancorp is also subject to the liquidity-related requirements of the enhanced prudential supervision
rules adopted by the FRB under Section 165 of the DFA, as described above. As of December 31, 2016, the Bancorp’s modified LCR complied with the fully

phased-in

LCR requirements which became
effective on January 1, 2017.

In addition to the LCR, the Basel III framework also included a second
standard, referred to as the net stable funding ratio (“NSFR”), which is designed to promote more

medium-and

long-term funding of the assets and activities of banks over a

one-year

time horizon. In May, 2016, the federal banking agencies proposed an NSFR Rule. As proposed the most stringent requirements would apply to firms with $250 billion or more in assets or $10 billion
or more in

on-balance

sheet foreign exposure. Holding companies with less than $250 billion, but more than $50 billion in assets and less than $10 billion in

on-balance

foreign exposure, such as the Bancorp, would be subject to a less stringent, modified NFSR requirement.

Privacy

The FRB, FDIC and other bank
regulatory agencies have adopted final guidelines (the “Guidelines) for safeguarding confidential, personal customer information. The Guidelines require each financial institution, under the supervision and ongoing oversight of its Board of
Directors or an appropriate committee thereof, to create, implement and maintain a comprehensive written information security program designed to ensure the security and confidentiality of customer information, protect against any anticipated
threats or hazards to the security or integrity of such information and protect against unauthorized access to or use of such information that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to any customer. The Bancorp has adopted a customer
information security program that has been approved by the Bancorp’s Board of Directors.

The GLBA requires
financial institutions to implement policies and procedures regarding the disclosure of nonpublic personal information about consumers to

non-affiliated

third parties. In general, the statute requires
explanations to consumers on policies and procedures regarding the disclosure of such nonpublic personal information, and, except as otherwise required by law, prohibits disclosing such information except as provided in the banking subsidiary’s
policies and procedures. The Bancorp’s banking subsidiary has implemented a privacy policy.

Anti-Money Laundering

The Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (the
“Patriot Act”), designed to deny terrorists and others the ability to obtain access to the United States financial system, has significant implications for depository institutions, brokers, dealers and other businesses involved in the
transfer of money. The Patriot Act, as implemented by various federal regulatory agencies, requires financial institutions, including the Bancorp and its subsidiaries, to implement new policies and procedures or amend existing policies and
procedures with respect to, among other matters, anti-money laundering, compliance, suspicious activity and currency transaction reporting and due diligence on customers. The Patriot Act and its underlying regulations also permit information sharing
for counter-terrorist purposes between federal law enforcement agencies and financial institutions, as well as among financial institutions, subject to certain conditions, and require the FRB (and other federal banking agencies) to evaluate the
effectiveness of an applicant in combating money laundering activities when considering applications filed under Section 3 of the BHCA or the Bank Merger Act. The Bancorp’s Board has approved policies and procedures that are believed to be
compliant with the Patriot Act.

188  Fifth Third Bancorp


Exempt Brokerage Activities

The GLBA amended the federal securities laws to eliminate the blanket exceptions that banks traditionally have had from the definition of
“broker” and “dealer.” The GLBA also required that there be certain transactional activities that would not be “brokerage” activities, which banks could effect without having to register as a broker. In September 2007,
the FRB and SEC approved Regulation R to govern bank securities activities. Various exemptions permit banks to conduct activities that would otherwise constitute brokerage activities under the securities laws. Those exemptions include conducting
brokerage activities related to trust, fiduciary and similar services, certain services and also conducting a de minimis number of riskless principal transactions, certain asset-backed transactions and certain securities lending transactions. The
Bancorp only conducts

non-exempt

brokerage activities through its affiliated registered broker-dealer.

Financial Stability Oversight Council

The DFA created the Financial Stability Oversight Council (“FSOC”), which is chaired by the Secretary of the Treasury and composed
of expertise from various financial services regulators. The FSOC has responsibility for identifying risks and responding to emerging threats to financial stability.

provides for a say on pay for shareholders of all public companies. Under the DFA, each company must give its shareholders the opportunity to vote on the compensation of its executives at least once every three years. The DFA also adds disclosure
and voting requirements for golden parachute compensation that is payable to named executive officers in connection with sale transactions. The SEC adopted rules finalizing these say on pay provisions in January 2011.

Pursuant to the DFA, in June 2012, the SEC adopted a final rule directing the stock exchanges to prohibit listing classes of
equity securities if a company’s compensation committee members are not independent. The rule also provides that a company’s compensation committee may only select a compensation consultant, legal counsel or other advisor after taking into
consideration factors to be identified by the SEC that affect the independence of a compensation consultant, legal counsel or other advisor.

The SEC is required under the DFA to issue rules obligating companies to disclose in proxy materials for annual meetings of
shareholders information that shows the relationship between executive compensation actually paid to their named executive officers and their financial performance, taking into account any change in the value of the shares of a company’s stock
and dividends or distributions. The DFA also requires the SEC to propose rules requiring companies to disclose the ratio of the compensation of its chief executive officer to the median compensation of its employees. The SEC adopted final rules
implementing the pay ratio provisions in August 2015. For a registrant with a fiscal year ending on December 31, such as Bancorp, the pay ratio will be required as part of its executive compensation disclosure in proxy statements or Form

10-Ks

filed starting in 2018.

The DFA provides that the SEC must issue rules directing the stock exchanges
to prohibit listing any security of a company unless the company develops and implements a policy providing for disclosure of the policy of the company on incentive-based compensation that is based on financial information required to be reported
under the securities laws and that, in the event the company is required to prepare an accounting restatement due to the material noncompliance of the company with any financial reporting requirement under the securities laws, the company will
recover from any current or former executive officer of the company who received incentive-based compensation during the three-year period preceding the date on which the company is required to prepare the restatement based on the erroneous data,
any exceptional compensation above what would have been paid under the restatement.

The DFA requires the SEC to adopt a
rule to require that each company disclose in the proxy materials for its annual meetings whether an employee or board member is permitted to purchase financial instruments designed to hedge or offset decreases in the market value of equity
securities granted as compensation or otherwise held by the employee or board member.

In June 2016, the SEC and the
federal banking agencies issued a proposed rule to implement the incentive-based compensation provisions of section 956 of the DFA. The proposal would establish new requirements for incentive-based compensation at institutions with assets of at
least $1 billion.

Corporate Governance

The DFA clarifies that the SEC may, but is not required to promulgate rules that would require that a company’s proxy materials include a
nominee for the board of directors submitted by a shareholder. Although the SEC promulgated rules to accomplish this, these rules were invalidated by a federal appeals court decision. The SEC has said that they will not challenge the ruling, but has
not ruled out the possibility that new rules could be proposed.

The DFA requires stock exchanges to have rules
prohibiting their members from voting securities that they do not beneficially own (unless they have received voting instructions from the beneficial owner) with respect to the election of a member of the board of directors (other than an
uncontested election of directors of an investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940), executive compensation or any other significant matter, as determined by the SEC by rule.

Debit Card Interchange Fees

The DFA
provides for a set of new rules requiring that interchange transaction fees for electric debit transactions be “reasonable” and proportional to certain costs associated with processing the transactions. The FRB was given authority to,
among other things, establish standards for assessing whether interchange fees are reasonable and proportional. In June 2011, the FRB issued a final rule establishing certain standards and prohibitions pursuant to the DFA, including establishing
standards for debit card interchange fees and allowing for an upward adjustment if the issuer develops and implements policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent fraud. The provisions regarding debit card interchange fees and the fraud
adjustment became effective October 1, 2011. The rules impose requirements on the Bancorp and its banking subsidiary and may negatively impact our revenues and results of operations.

Third Bancorp


On July 31, 2013, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia issued an order granting summary judgment to the plaintiffs in a case challenging certain provisions of the FRB’s
rule concerning electronic debit card transaction fees and network exclusivity arrangements (the “Current Rule”) that were adopted to implement Section 1075 of the DFA, known as the Durbin Amendment. The Court held that, in adopting
the Current Rule, the FRB violated the Durbin Amendment’s provisions concerning which costs are allowed to be taken into account for purposes of setting fees that are reasonable and proportional to the costs incurred by the issuer and therefore
the Current Rule’s maximum permissible fees were too high. In addition, the Court held that the Current Rule’s network

non-exclusivity

provisions concerning unaffiliated payment networks for debit
cards also violated the Durbin Amendment. The Court vacated the Current Rule, but stayed its ruling to provide the FRB an opportunity to replace the invalidated portions. The FRB appealed this decision and on March 21, 2014, the D.C. Circuit
Court of Appeals reversed the District Court’s grant of summary judgment and remanded the case for further proceedings in accordance with its opinion. The merchants have filed a petition for writ of certiorari to the U.S. Supreme Court.
However, on January 20, 2015, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal of the Circuit Court reversal, thereby largely upholding the Current Rule and substantially reducing uncertainty surrounding debit card interchange fees the Bancorp
is permitted to charge.

FDIC Matters and Resolution Planning

Title II of the DFA creates an orderly liquidation process that the FDIC can employ for failing systemically important financial companies.
Additionally, the DFA also codifies many of the temporary changes that had already been implemented, such as permanently increasing the amount of deposit insurance to $250,000.

In January 2012, the FDIC issued a final rule that requires an insured depository institution with $50 billion or more
in total assets to submit periodic contingency plans to the FDIC for resolution in the event of the institution’s failure. The Bancorp’s banking subsidiary is subject to this rule and submitted its most recent resolution plan pursuant to
this rule as of December 31, 2015.

In October 2011, the FRB and FDIC issued a final rule implementing the
resolution planning requirements of Section 165(d) of the DFA. The final rule requires BHCs with assets of $50 billion or more and nonbank financial firms designated by FSOC for supervision by the FRB to annually submit resolution plans to the
FDIC and FRB. Each plan shall describe the company’s strategy for rapid and orderly resolution in bankruptcy during times of financial distress.    Under the final rule, companies must submit their initial resolution plans
on a staggered basis. The Bancorp submitted its most recent resolution plan pursuant to this rule as of December 31, 2015. In August 2016, the FDIC and the FRB announced that 38 firms, including Fifth Third, will be required to submit their
next resolutions by December 31, 2017.

Proprietary Trading and Investing in Certain Funds

The DFA sets forth new restrictions on banking organizations’ ability to engage in proprietary trading and sponsors of or invest in
private equity and hedge funds (the “Volcker Rule”). The final regulations implementing the Volcker Rule (“Final Rules”) were adopted on December 10, 2013. The Volcker Rule generally prohibits any banking entity from
(i) engaging in short-term proprietary trading for its own account and (ii) sponsoring or

acquiring any ownership interest in a private equity or hedge fund. The Volcker Rule and Final Rules contain a number of exceptions. The Volcker Rule permits transactions in the securities of the
U.S. government and its agencies, certain government-sponsored enterprises and states and their political subdivisions, as well as certain investments in small business investment companies. Transactions on behalf of customers and in connection with
certain underwriting and market making activities, as well as risk-mitigating hedging activities and certain foreign banking activities are also permitted. The Final Rules exclude certain funds from the prohibition on fund ownership and sponsorship
including wholly-owned subsidiaries, joint ventures, and acquisitions vehicles, as well as SEC registered investment companies.

De minimis

ownership of private equity or hedge funds is also permitted under the Final Rules. In addition to the
general prohibition on sponsorship and investment, the Volcker rule contains additional requirements applicable to any private equity or hedge fund that is sponsored by the banking entity or for which it serves as investment manager or investment
advisor. The Bancorp is required under the Final Rules to demonstrate that it has a Volcker Rule compliance program. Further, with respect to covered funds that are “illiquid funds”, the FRB has the authority to grant up to five more years
for the Bancorp to conform to the final Volcker Rule with respect to such illiquid funds.

Derivatives

Title VII of the DFA includes measures to broaden the scope of derivative instruments subject to regulation by requiring clearing and exchange
trading of certain derivatives, imposing new capital and margin requirements for certain market participants and imposing position limits on certain

over-the-counter

derivatives. Fifth Third Bank is provisionally registered with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission as a swap dealer. As with the Volcker Rule, the Bank is required to demonstrate that it has a satisfactory compliance program to monitor its
activities under these regulations. Certain regulations implementing Title VII of the DFA have not been finalized. The ultimate impact of these regulations, and the time it will take to comply, continues to remain uncertain. The final regulations
may impose additional operational and compliance costs on us and may require us to restructure certain businesses and negatively impact our revenues and results of operations.

Future Legislative and Regulatory Initiatives

Federal and state legislators as well as regulatory agencies may introduce or enact new laws and rules, or amend existing laws and rules, that
may affect the regulation of financial institutions and their holding companies. The impact of any future legislative or regulatory changes cannot be predicted. However, such changes could affect Bancorp’s business, financial condition and
results of operations.

190  Fifth Third Bancorp


ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

The risks listed below present risks that could have a material impact on the Bancorp’s financial condition, the results of its
operations, or its business. Some of these risks are interrelated, and the occurrence of one or more of them may exacerbate the effect of others.

RISKS RELATING TO ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS

Weakness in the U.S. economy, including within Fifth Third’s geographic footprint, has adversely affected Fifth Third in the past
and may adversely affect Fifth Third in the future.

If the strength of the U.S. economy in general or the strength of the local
economies in which Fifth Third conducts operations declines, this could result in, among other things, a decreased demand for Fifth Third’s products and services, a deterioration in credit quality or a reduced demand for credit, including a
resultant effect on Fifth Third’s loan portfolio and ALLL and in the receipt of lower proceeds from the sale of loans and foreclosed properties. These factors could result in higher delinquencies, greater charge-offs and increased losses in
future periods, which could materially adversely affect Fifth Third’s financial condition and results of operations.

Global
financial conditions could hamper economic recovery or contribute to recessionary economic conditions and severe stress in the financial markets, including in the United States. Should the U.S. economy be adversely impacted by these factors, the
likelihood for loan and asset growth at U.S. financial institutions, like Fifth Third, may deteriorate.

The global financial
markets continue to be strained as a result of economic slowdowns, geopolitical concerns and the related path of commodity prices and interest rates. Divergence in economic growth in the U.S. and international economies and the resulting differences
in monetary policy are placing strains on financial markets and strengthening the U.S. dollar. The relative strength of the U.S. dollar may continue to negatively impact the U.S. manufacturing sector. These factors could negatively impact the U.S.
economy and affect the stability of global financial markets.

Changes in interest rates could affect Fifth Third’s income and
cash flows.

Fifth Third’s income and cash flows depend to a great extent on the difference between the interest rates earned
on interest-earning assets such as loans and investment securities, and the interest rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowings. These rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond Fifth Third’s
control, including general economic conditions in the U.S. or abroad and the policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies (in particular, the FRB). Changes in monetary policy, including changes in interest rates, will influence the
origination of loans, the prepayment speed of loans, the purchase of investments, the generation of deposits and the rates received on loans and investment securities and paid on deposits or other sources of funding. The impact of these changes may
be magnified if Fifth Third does not effectively manage the relative sensitivity of its assets and liabilities to changes in market interest rates. Fluctuations in these areas may adversely affect Fifth Third and its shareholders.

Changes and trends in the capital markets may affect Fifth Third’s income and cash flows.

Fifth Third enters into and maintains trading and investment positions in the capital markets on its own behalf and manages
investment positions on behalf of its customers. These investment positions include derivative financial instruments. The revenues and profits Fifth Third derives from managing proprietary and customer trading and investment positions are dependent
on market prices. Market changes and trends may result in a decline in wealth and asset management revenue or investment or trading losses that may impact Fifth Third. Losses on behalf of its customers could expose Fifth Third to litigation, credit
risks or loss of revenue from those clients and customers. Additionally, losses in Fifth Third’s trading and investment positions could lead to a loss with respect to those investments and may adversely affect Fifth Third’s income, cash
flows and funding costs.

Problems encountered by financial institutions larger than or similar to Fifth Third could adversely
affect financial markets generally and have direct and indirect adverse effects on Fifth Third.

Fifth Third has exposure to
counterparties in the financial services industry and other industries, and routinely executes transactions with such counterparties, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, mutual and hedge funds, and other institutional
clients. Many of Fifth Third’s transactions with other financial institutions expose Fifth Third to credit risk in the event of default of a counterparty or client. In addition, Fifth Third’s credit risk may be affected when the collateral
it holds cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure. The commercial soundness of many financial institutions may be closely interrelated as a result of credit, trading,
clearing or other relationships between the institutions. As a result, concerns about, or a default or threatened default by, one institution could lead to significant market-wide liquidity and credit problems, losses or defaults by other
institutions. This is sometimes referred to as “systemic risk” and may adversely affect financial intermediaries, such as clearing agencies, clearing houses, banks, securities firms and exchanges, with which the Bancorp interacts on a
daily basis, and therefore could adversely affect Fifth Third.

Fifth Third’s stock price is volatile.

Fifth Third’s stock price has been volatile in the past and several factors could cause the price to fluctuate substantially in the
future. These factors include, without limitation:

●

Actual or anticipated variations in earnings;

●

Changes in analysts’ recommendations or projections;

●

Fifth Third’s announcements of developments related to its businesses;

●

Operating and stock performance of other companies deemed to be peers;

●

Actions by government regulators and changes in the regulatory regime;

●

New technology used or services offered by traditional and

non-traditional

competitors;

●

News reports of trends, concerns and other issues related to the financial services industry;

●

U.S. and global economic conditions;

●

Natural disasters;

●

Geopolitical conditions such as acts or threats of terrorism, military conflicts and withdrawal from the EU
by the U.K. or other EU members.

191  Fifth
Third Bancorp


The price for shares of Fifth Third’s common stock may fluctuate
significantly in the future, and these fluctuations may be unrelated to Fifth Third’s performance. General market price declines or market volatility in the future could adversely affect the price for shares of Fifth Third’s common stock,
and the current market price of such shares may not be indicative of future market prices.

RISKS RELATING TO FIFTH THIRD’S GENERAL BUSINESS

Changes in retail distribution strategies and consumer behavior may adversely impact Fifth Third’s investments in its bank
premises and equipment and other assets and may lead to increased expenditures to change its retail distribution channel.

Fifth
Third has significant investments in bank premises and equipment for its branch network including its 1,191 full-service banking centers, 50 parcels of land held for the development of future banking centers and 10 properties that are developed or
in the process of being developed as branches, as well as its retail work force and other branch banking assets. Advances in technology such as

e-commerce,

telephone, internet and mobile banking, and

in-branch

self-service technologies including automatic teller machines and other equipment, as well as changing customer preferences for these other methods of accessing Fifth Third’s products and services,
could affect the value of Fifth Third’s branch network or other retail distribution assets and may cause it to change its retail distribution strategy, close and/or sell certain branches or parcels of land held for development and restructure
or reduce its remaining branches and work force. Further advances in technology and/or changes in customer preferences could have additional changes in Fifth Third’s retail distribution strategy and/or branch network. These actions could lead
to losses on these assets or could adversely impact the carrying value of other long-lived assets and may lead to increased expenditures to renovate and reconfigure remaining branches or to otherwise reform its retail distribution channel.

Deteriorating credit quality has adversely impacted Fifth Third in the past and may adversely impact Fifth Third in the future.

When Fifth Third lends money or commits to lend money the Bancorp incurs credit risk or the risk of loss if borrowers do not
repay their loans. The credit performance of the loan portfolios significantly affects the Bancorp’s financial results and condition. If the current economic environment were to deteriorate, more customers may have difficulty in repaying their
loans or other obligations which could result in a higher level of credit losses and reserves for credit losses. Fifth Third reserves for credit losses by establishing reserves through a charge to earnings. The amount of these reserves is based on
Fifth Third’s assessment of credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio including unfunded credit commitments. The process for determining the amount of the ALLL and the reserve for unfunded commitments is critical to Fifth Third’s
financial results and condition. It requires difficult, subjective and complex judgments about the environment, including analysis of economic or market conditions that might impair the ability of borrowers to repay their loans.

Fifth Third might underestimate the credit losses inherent in its loan portfolio and have credit losses in excess of the
amount reserved. Fifth Third might increase the reserve because of

changing economic conditions, including falling home prices or higher unemployment, or other factors such as changes in borrower’s behavior. As an example, borrowers may “strategically
default,” or discontinue making payments on their real estate-secured loans if the value of the real estate is less than what they owe, even if they are still financially able to make the payments.

Fifth Third believes that both the ALLL and the reserve for unfunded commitments are adequate to cover inherent losses at
December 31, 2016; however, there is no assurance that they will be sufficient to cover future credit losses, especially if housing and employment conditions decline. In the event of significant deterioration in economic conditions, Fifth Third
may be required to increase reserves in future periods, which would reduce earnings.

For more information, refer to the
Credit Risk Management subsection of the Risk Management section of MD&A and the Allowance for Loan and Losses and Reserve for Unfunded Commitments subsections of the Critical Accounting Policies section of MD&A.

Fifth Third must maintain adequate sources of funding and liquidity.

Fifth Third must maintain adequate funding sources in the normal course of business to support its operations and fund outstanding
liabilities, as well as meet regulatory expectations. Fifth Third primarily relies on bank deposits to be a low cost and stable source of funding for the loans Fifth Third makes and the operations of Fifth Third’s business. Core deposits, which
include transaction deposits and other time deposits, have historically provided Fifth Third with a sizeable source of relatively stable and

low-cost

funds (average core deposits funded 70% of average total
assets at December 31, 2016). In addition to customer deposits, sources of liquidity include investments in the securities portfolio, Fifth Third’s sale or securitization of loans in secondary markets and the pledging of loans and
investment securities to access secured borrowing facilities through the FHLB and the FRB, and Fifth Third’s ability to raise funds in domestic and international money and capital markets.

Fifth Third’s liquidity and ability to fund and run the business could be materially adversely affected by a variety of
conditions and factors, including financial and credit market disruptions and volatility or a lack of market or customer confidence in financial markets in general similar to what occurred during the financial crisis in 2008 and early 2009,
which may result in a loss of customer deposits or outflows of cash or collateral and/or ability to access capital markets on favorable terms.

Other conditions and factors that could materially adversely affect Fifth Third’s liquidity and funding include:

●

a lack of market or customer confidence in Fifth Third or negative news about Fifth Third or the financial
services industry generally, which also may result in a loss of deposits and/or negatively affect the ability to access the capital markets;

●

the loss of customer deposits to alternative investments;

●

inability to sell or securitize loans or other assets,

●

increased regulatory requirements,

●

and reductions in one or more of Fifth Third’s credit ratings.

192  Fifth Third Bancorp


A reduced credit rating could adversely affect Fifth Third’s ability to
borrow funds and raise the cost of borrowings substantially and could cause creditors and business counterparties to raise collateral requirements or take other actions that could adversely affect Fifth Third’s ability to raise capital. Many of
the above conditions and factors may be caused by events over which Fifth Third has little or no control such as what occurred during the financial crisis. While market conditions have stabilized and, in many cases, improved, there can be no
assurance that significant disruption and volatility in the financial markets will not occur in the future.

Recent
regulatory changes relating to liquidity and risk management may also negatively impact Fifth Third’s results of operations and competitive position. Various regulations recently adopted or proposed, and additional regulations under
consideration, impose or could impose more stringent liquidity requirements for large financial institutions, including Fifth Third. These regulations address, among other matters, liquidity stress testing, minimum liquidity requirements and
restrictions on short-term debt issued by

top-tier

holding companies. Given the overlap and complex interactions of these regulations with other regulatory changes, including the resolution and recovery
framework applicable to Fifth Third, the full impact of the adopted and proposed regulations will remain uncertain until their full implementation. It is also uncertain whether adopted and proposed regulations will ultimately be rolled back or
modified as a result of the change in administration in the U.S. Uncertainty about the timing and scope of any such changes as well as the cost of complying with a new regulatory regime may negatively impact Fifth Third’s business.

If Fifth Third is unable to continue to fund assets through customer bank deposits or access capital markets on favorable
terms or if Fifth Third suffers an increase in borrowing costs or otherwise fails to manage liquidity effectively, then Fifth Third’s liquidity, operating margins, and financial results and condition may be materially adversely affected. As
Fifth Third did during the financial crisis, it may also need to raise additional capital through the issuance of stock, which could dilute the ownership of existing stockholders, or reduce or even eliminate common stock dividends to preserve
capital.

Fifth Third may have more credit risk and higher credit losses to the extent loans are concentrated by location or
industry of the borrowers or collateral.

Fifth Third’s credit risk and credit losses can increase if its loans are
concentrated to borrowers engaged in the same or similar activities or to borrowers who as a group may be uniquely or disproportionately affected by economic or market conditions. Deterioration in economic conditions, housing conditions and
commodity and real estate values in certain states or locations could result in materially higher credit losses if loans are concentrated in those locations. Fifth Third has significant exposures to businesses in certain economic sectors such as
manufacturing, real estate, financial services and insurance and weaknesses in those businesses may adversely impact Fifth Third’s business, results of operations or financial condition. Additionally Fifth Third has a substantial portfolio of
commercial and residential real estate loans and weaknesses in residential or commercial real estate markets may adversely impact Fifth Third’s business, results of operations or financial condition.

Fifth Third may be required to repurchase residential mortgage loans or reimburse
investors and others as a result of breaches in contractual representations and warranties.

Fifth Third sells residential
mortgage loans to various parties, including GSEs and other financial institutions that purchase residential mortgage loans for investment or private label securitization. Fifth Third may be required to repurchase residential mortgage loans,
indemnify the securitization trust, investor or insurer, or reimburse the securitization trust, investor or insurer for credit losses incurred on loans in the event of a breach of contractual representations or warranties that is not remedied within
a specified period (usually 60 days or less) after Fifth Third receives notice of the breach. Contracts for residential mortgage loan sales to the GSEs include various types of specific remedies and penalties that could be applied to inadequate
responses to repurchase requests. If economic conditions and the housing market deteriorate or future investor repurchase demand and Fifth Third’s success at appealing repurchase requests differ from past experience, Fifth Third could have
increased repurchase obligations and increased loss severity on repurchases, requiring material additions to the repurchase reserve.

If Fifth Third does not respond to rapid changes in the financial services industry or otherwise adapt to changing customer
preferences, its financial performance may suffer.

Fifth Third’s ability to deliver strong financial performance and returns
on investment to shareholders will depend in part on its ability to expand the scope of available financial services to meet the needs and demands of its customers. In addition to the challenge of competing against other banks in attracting and
retaining customers for traditional banking services, Fifth Third’s competitors also include securities dealers, brokers, mortgage bankers, investment advisors, and specialty finance, telecommunications, technology and insurance companies who
seek to offer

one-stop

financial services that may include services that banks have not been able or allowed to offer to their customers in the past or may not be currently able or allowed to offer.

This increasingly competitive environment is primarily a result of changes in regulation, changes in technology and product
delivery systems, as well as the accelerating pace of consolidation among financial service providers. Rapidly changing technology and consumer preferences may require Fifth Third to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services
in order to compete and meet customer demands. Fifth Third may not be able to do so or be successful in marketing these products and services to its customers. As a result, Fifth Third’s ability to effectively compete to retain or acquire new
business may be impaired, and its business, financial condition or results of operations, may be adversely affected.

Fifth Third may make strategic investments and may expand an existing line of business or enter into new lines of business
to remain competitive. If Fifth Third’s chosen strategies, for example, the NorthStar Strategy initiatives, are not appropriate to effectively compete or Fifth Third does not execute them in an appropriate or timely manner, Fifth Third’s
business and results may suffer. Additionally, these strategies, products and lines of business may bring with them unforeseeable or unforeseen risks and may not generate the expected results or returns, which could adversely affect Fifth
Third’s results of operations or future growth prospects and cause Fifth Third to fail to meet its stated goals and expectations.

193  Fifth
Third Bancorp


Fifth Third may not be able to successfully implement future information technology
system enhancements, which could adversely affect Fifth Third’s business operations and profitability.

Fifth Third invests
significant resources in information technology system enhancements in order to provide functionality and security at an appropriate level. Fifth Third may not be able to successfully implement and integrate future system enhancements, which could
adversely impact the ability to provide timely and accurate financial information in compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, which could result in sanctions from regulatory authorities. Such sanctions could include fines and result in
reputational harm and have other negative effects. In addition, future system enhancements could have higher than expected costs and/or result in operating inefficiencies, which could increase the costs associated with the implementation as well as
ongoing operations. Failure to properly utilize system enhancements that are implemented in the future could result in impairment charges that adversely impact Fifth Third’s financial condition and results of operations and could result in
significant costs to remediate or replace the defective components. In addition, Fifth Third may incur significant training, licensing, maintenance, consulting and amortization expenses during and after systems implementations, and any such costs
may continue for an extended period of time.

If Fifth Third is unable to grow its deposits, it may be subject to paying higher
funding costs.

The total amount that Fifth Third pays for funding costs is dependent, in part, on Fifth Third’s ability to
grow its deposits. If Fifth Third is unable to sufficiently grow its deposits to meet liquidity objectives, it may be subject to paying higher funding costs. Fifth Third competes with banks and other financial services companies for deposits. If
competitors raise the rates they pay on deposits, Fifth Third’s funding costs may increase, either because Fifth Third raises rates to avoid losing deposits or because Fifth Third loses deposits and must rely on more expensive sources of
funding. Higher funding costs reduce Fifth Third’s net interest margin and net interest income. Fifth Third’s bank customers could take their money out of the Bank and put it in alternative investments, causing Fifth Third to lose a lower
cost source of funding. Checking and savings account balances and other forms of customer deposits may decrease when customers perceive alternative investments, such as the stock market, as providing a better risk/return tradeoff.

The Bancorp’s ability to receive dividends from its subsidiaries accounts for most of its revenue and could affect its liquidity
and ability to pay dividends.

Fifth Third Bancorp is a separate and distinct legal entity from its subsidiaries. Fifth Third
Bancorp typically receives substantially all of its revenue from dividends from its subsidiaries. These dividends are the principal source of funds to pay dividends on Fifth Third Bancorp’s stock and interest and principal on its debt. Various
federal and/or state laws and regulations, as well as regulatory expectations, limit the amount of dividends that the Bancorp’s banking subsidiary and certain nonbank subsidiaries may pay. Regulatory scrutiny of capital levels at bank holding
companies and insured depository institution subsidiaries has increased since the financial crisis and has resulted in increased regulatory focus on all aspects of capital planning, including dividends and other distributions to shareholders of
banks such as the parent bank

holding companies. Also, Fifth Third Bancorp’s right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiary’s liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of that
subsidiary’s creditors. Limitations on the Bancorp’s ability to receive dividends from its subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on its liquidity and ability to pay dividends on stock or interest and principal on its debt. For
further information refer to Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

The financial services industry is highly
competitive and creates competitive pressures that could adversely affect Fifth Third’s revenue and profitability.

The
financial services industry in which Fifth Third operates is highly competitive. Fifth Third competes not only with commercial banks, but also with insurance companies, mutual funds, hedge funds, telecommunications and technology and other companies
offering financial services in the U.S., globally and over the internet. Fifth Third competes on the basis of several factors, including capital, access to capital, revenue generation, products, services, transaction execution, innovation,
reputation and price. Over time, certain sectors of the financial services industry have become more concentrated, as institutions involved in a broad range of financial services have been acquired by or merged into other firms. These developments
could result in Fifth Third’s competitors gaining greater capital and other resources, such as a broader range of products and services and geographic diversity. Fifth Third may experience pricing pressures as a result of these factors and as
some of its competitors seek to increase market share by reducing prices.

Fifth Third and/or the holders of its securities could
be adversely affected by unfavorable ratings from rating agencies.

Fifth Third’s ability to access the capital markets is
important to its overall funding profile. This access is affected by the ratings assigned by rating agencies to Fifth Third, certain of its subsidiaries and particular classes of securities they issue. The interest rates that Fifth Third pays on its
securities are also influenced by, among other things, the credit ratings that it, its subsidiaries and/or its securities receive from recognized rating agencies. A downgrade to Fifth Third or its subsidiaries’ credit rating could affect its
ability to access the capital markets, increase its borrowing costs and negatively impact its profitability. A ratings downgrade to Fifth Third, its subsidiaries or their securities could also create obligations or liabilities of Fifth Third under
the terms of its outstanding securities that could increase Fifth Third’s costs or otherwise have a negative effect on its results of operations or financial condition. Additionally, a downgrade of the credit rating of any particular security
issued by Fifth Third or its subsidiaries could negatively affect the ability of the holders of that security to sell the securities and the prices at which any such securities may be sold.

Fifth Third could suffer if it fails to attract and retain skilled personnel.

Fifth Third’s success depends, in large part, on its ability to attract and retain key individuals. Competition for qualified candidates
in the activities and markets that Fifth Third serves is intense, which may increase Fifth Third’s expenses and may result in Fifth Third not being able to hire candidates or retain them. If Fifth Third is not able to hire qualified candidates
or retain its key personnel, Fifth Third may be unable to execute its business strategies and may suffer adverse consequences to its business, operations and financial condition.

194  Fifth Third Bancorp


Compensation paid by financial institutions such as Fifth Third has become
increasingly regulated, particularly under the DFA, which regulation affects the amount and form of compensation Fifth Third pays to hire and retain talented employees. If Fifth Third is unable to attract and retain qualified employees, or do so at
rates necessary to maintain its competitive position, or if compensation costs required to attract and retain employees become more expensive, Fifth Third’s performance, including its competitive position, could be materially adversely
affected.

Fifth Third’s mortgage banking revenue can be volatile from quarter to quarter.

Fifth Third earns revenue from the fees it receives for originating mortgage loans and for servicing mortgage loans. When rates rise, the
demand for mortgage loans tends to fall, reducing the revenue Fifth Third receives from loan originations. At the same time, revenue from MSRs can increase through increases in fair value. When rates fall, mortgage originations tend to increase and
the value of MSRs tends to decline, also with some offsetting revenue effect. Even though the origination of mortgage loans can act as a “natural hedge,” the hedge is not perfect, either in amount or timing. For example, the negative
effect on revenue from a decrease in the fair value of residential MSRs is immediate, but any offsetting revenue benefit from more originations and the MSRs relating to the new loans would accrue over time. It is also possible that even if interest
rates were to fall, mortgage originations may also fall or any increase in mortgage originations may not be enough to offset the decrease in the MSRs value caused by the lower rates.

Fifth Third typically uses derivatives and other instruments to hedge its mortgage banking interest rate risk. Fifth Third
generally does not hedge all of its risks, and the fact that Fifth Third attempts to hedge any of the risks does not mean Fifth Third will be successful. Hedging is a complex process, requiring sophisticated models and constant monitoring. Fifth
Third may use hedging instruments tied to U.S. Treasury rates, LIBOR or Eurodollars that may not perfectly correlate with the value or income being hedged. Fifth Third could incur significant losses from its hedging activities. There may be periods
where Fifth Third elects not to use derivatives and other instruments to hedge mortgage banking interest rate risk.

Fifth Third
uses models for business planning purposes that may not adequately predict future results.

Fifth Third uses financial models to
aid in its planning for various purposes including its capital and liquidity needs and other purposes. The models used may not accurately account for all variables and may fail to predict outcomes accurately and/or may overstate or understate
certain effects. As a result of these potential failures, Fifth Third may not adequately prepare for future events and may suffer losses or other setbacks due to these failures.

Also, information Fifth Third provides to the public or to its regulators based on models could be inaccurate or misleading
due to inadequate design or implementation, for example. Decisions that its regulators make, including those related to capital distributions to its shareholders, could be affected adversely due to the perception that the models used to generate the
relevant information are unreliable or inadequate.

Changes in interest rates could also reduce the value of MSRs.

Fifth Third acquires MSRs when it keeps the servicing rights after the sale or securitization of the loans that have been originated or when
it purchases the servicing rights to mortgage loans originated by other lenders. Fifth Third initially measures all residential MSRs at fair value and subsequently amortizes the MSRs in proportion to, and over the period of, estimated net servicing
income. Fair value is the present value of estimated future net servicing income, calculated based on a number of variables, including assumptions about the likelihood of prepayment by borrowers. Servicing rights are assessed for impairment monthly,
based on fair value, with temporary impairment recognized through a valuation allowance and other-than-temporary impairment recognized through a

write-off

of the servicing asset and related valuation
allowance.

Changes in interest rates can affect prepayment assumptions and thus fair value. When interest rates fall,
borrowers are usually more likely to prepay their mortgage loans by refinancing them at a lower rate. As the likelihood of prepayment increases, the fair value of MSRs can decrease. Each quarter Fifth Third evaluates the fair value of MSRs, and
decreases in fair value of MSRs below amortized cost reduce earnings in the period in which the decrease occurs.

The preparation
of financial statements requires Fifth Third to make subjective determinations and use estimates that may vary from actual results and materially impact its results of operations or financial position.

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make significant estimates that
affect the financial statements. If new information arises that results in a material change to a reserve amount, such a change could result in a change to previously announced financial results. Refer to the Critical Accounting Policies section of
MD&A for more information regarding management’s significant estimates.

Changes in accounting standards or interpretations
could impact Fifth Third’s reported earnings and financial condition.

The accounting standard setters, including the FASB,
the SEC and other regulatory agencies, periodically change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of Fifth Third’s consolidated financial statements. These changes can be hard to predict and can materially
impact how Fifth Third records and reports its financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, Fifth Third could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, which would result in the recasting of Fifth Third’s
prior period financial statements.

Future acquisitions may dilute current shareholders’ ownership of Fifth Third and may
cause Fifth Third to become more susceptible to adverse economic events.

Future business acquisitions could be material to Fifth
Third and it may issue additional shares of stock to pay for those acquisitions, which would dilute current shareholders’ ownership interests. Acquisitions also could require Fifth Third to use substantial cash or other liquid assets or to
incur debt. In those events, Fifth Third could become more susceptible to economic downturns and competitive pressures.

Third Bancorp


Difficulties in identifying suitable opportunities or combining the operations of
acquired entities or assets with Fifth Third’s own operations or assessing the effectiveness of businesses in which we make strategic investments or with which we enter into strategic contractual relationships may prevent Fifth Third from
achieving the expected benefits from these acquisitions, investments or relationships.

Inherent uncertainties exist when
assessing or integrating the operations of an acquired business or investment or relationship opportunity. Fifth Third may not be able to fully achieve its strategic objectives and planned operating efficiencies in an acquisition or strategic
relationship. In addition, the markets and industries in which Fifth Third and its potential acquisition and investment targets operate are highly competitive. Acquisition or investment targets may lose customers or otherwise perform poorly or
unprofitably, in the case of an acquired business or strategic relationship, cause Fifth Third to lose customers or perform poorly or unprofitably. Future acquisition and integration activities and efforts to monitor new investments or reap the
benefits of a new strategic relationship may require Fifth Third to devote substantial time and resources and may cause these acquisitions, investments and relationships to be unprofitable or cause Fifth Third to be unable to pursue other business
opportunities.

After completing an acquisition, Fifth Third may find certain items were not accounted for properly in
accordance with financial accounting and reporting standards. Fifth Third may also not realize the expected benefits of the acquisition due to lower financial results pertaining to the acquired entity or assets. For example, Fifth Third could
experience higher charge-offs than originally anticipated related to the acquired loan portfolio. Additionally, acquired companies or businesses may increase Fifth Third’s risk of regulatory action or restrictions related to the operations of
the acquired business.

Fifth Third may sell or consider selling one or more of its businesses. Should it determine to sell such a
business, it may not be able to generate gains on sale or related increase in shareholders’ equity commensurate with desirable levels. Moreover, if Fifth Third sold such businesses, the loss of income could have an adverse effect on its
earnings and future growth.

Fifth Third owns, or owns a minority stake in, as applicable, several

non-strategic

businesses and other assets that are not significantly synergistic with its core financial services businesses or may no longer be aligned with Fifth Third’s strategic plans. Fifth Third
has, from time to time, considered and undertaken (and, in the case of Vantiv, has announced its intention to continue) the sale of such businesses and/or interests, including, for example, portions of Fifth Third’s stake in Vantiv Holding,
LLC. If it were to determine to sell such businesses and/or interests, Fifth Third would be subject to market forces that may make completion of a sale unsuccessful or may not be able to do so within a desirable time frame. If Fifth Third were to
complete the sale of any of its businesses and/or interests in third parties, it would lose the income from the sold businesses and/or interests, including those accounted for under the equity method of accounting, and such loss of income could have
an adverse effect on its future earnings and growth. Additionally, Fifth Third may encounter difficulties in separating the operations of any businesses it sells, which may affect its business or results of operations.

Fifth Third relies on its systems and certain third party service providers, and certain
failures could materially adversely affect operations.

Fifth Third collects, processes and stores sensitive consumer data by
utilizing computer systems and telecommunications networks operated by both Fifth Third and third party service providers. Fifth Third has security, backup and recovery systems in place, as well as a business continuity plan to ensure the systems
will not be inoperable. Fifth Third also has security to prevent unauthorized access to the systems. In addition, Fifth Third requires its third party service providers to maintain similar controls. However, Fifth Third cannot be certain that the
measures will be successful. A security breach in the systems and loss of confidential information such as credit card numbers and related information could result in significant reputational harm and the loss of customers’ confidence in Fifth
Third. As a result, we may lose existing and new customers and incur significant costs, including privacy monitoring activities.

Fifth Third’s necessary dependence upon automated systems to record and process its transaction volume poses the risk
that technical system flaws or employee errors, tampering or manipulation of those systems will result in losses and may be difficult to detect. Fifth Third may also be subject to disruptions of its operating systems arising from events that are
beyond its control (for example, computer viruses or electrical or telecommunications outages).

Third parties with
which the Bancorp does business, as well as retailers and other third parties with which the Bancorp’s customers do business, can also be sources of operational risk to the Bancorp, particularly where activities of customers are beyond the
Bancorp’s security and control systems, such as through the use of the internet, personal computers, tablets, smart phones and other mobile services. Security breaches affecting the Bancorp’s customers, or systems breakdowns or failures,
security breaches or employee misconduct affecting such other third parties, may require the Bancorp to take steps to protect the integrity of its own operational systems or to safeguard confidential information of the Bancorp or its customers,
thereby increasing the Bancorp’s operational costs and potentially diminishing customer satisfaction. If personal, confidential or proprietary information of customers or clients in the Bancorp’s possession were to be mishandled or
misused, the Bancorp could suffer significant regulatory consequences, reputational damage and financial loss. Such mishandling or misuse could include circumstances where, for example, such information was erroneously provided to parties who are
not permitted to have the information, either through the fault of the Bancorp’s systems, employees or counterparties, or where such information was intercepted or otherwise compromised by third parties. The Bancorp may be subject to
disruptions of its operating systems arising from events that are wholly or partially beyond the Bancorp’s control, which may include, for example, security breaches; electrical or telecommunications outages; failures of computer servers or
other damage to the Bancorp’s property or assets; natural disasters or severe weather conditions; health emergencies; or events arising from local or larger-scale political events, including outbreaks of hostilities or terrorist acts. While the
Bancorp believes that its current resiliency plans are both sufficient and adequate, there can be no assurance that such plans will fully mitigate all potential business continuity risks to the Bancorp or its customers and clients.

196  Fifth Third Bancorp


Any failures or disruptions of the Bancorp’s systems or operations could give rise to losses in service to customers and clients, adversely affect the Bancorp’s business and results of
operations by subjecting the Bancorp to losses or liability, or require the Bancorp to expend significant resources to correct the failure or disruption, as well as by exposing the Bancorp to reputational harm, litigation, regulatory fines or
penalties or losses not covered by insurance.

Fifth Third is exposed to cyber-security risks, including denial of service,
hacking, and identity theft, which could result in the disclosure, theft or destruction of confidential information.

Fifth Third
relies heavily on communications and information systems to conduct its business. Any failure, interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in disruptions to its accounting, deposit, loan and other systems, and adversely affect
its customer relationships. While Fifth Third has policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of these possible events, there can be no assurance that any such failure, interruption or security breach will not occur or, if any
does occur, that it can be sufficiently remediated. There have been increasing efforts on the part of third parties, including through cyber-attacks, to breach data security at financial institutions or with respect to financial transactions. There
have been several recent instances involving financial services and consumer-based companies reporting the unauthorized disclosure of client or customer information or the destruction or theft of corporate data, by both private individuals and
foreign governments. In addition, because the techniques used to cause such security breaches change frequently, often are not recognized until launched against a target and may originate from less regulated and remote areas around the world, Fifth
Third may be unable to proactively address these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. Furthermore, there has been a well-publicized series of apparently related distributed denial of service attacks on large financial services
companies, including Fifth Third Bank, and “ransom” attacks where hackers have requested payments in exchange for not disclosing customer information. Distributed denial of service attacks are designed to saturate the targeted online
network with excessive amounts of network traffic, resulting in slow response times, or in some cases, causing the site to be temporarily unavailable. These events adversely affected the performance of Fifth Third’s website and in some
instances prevented customers from accessing Fifth Third’s website. Future cyber-attacks could be more disruptive and damaging. Cyber threats are rapidly evolving and Fifth Third may not be able to anticipate or prevent all such attacks. Fifth
Third may incur increasing costs in an effort to minimize these risks or in the investigation of such cyber-attacks or related to the protection of the Bancorp’s customers from identity theft as a result of such attacks. Despite this effort,
the occurrence of any failure, interruption or security breach of Fifth Third’s systems or third-party service providers, particularly if widespread or resulting in financial losses to customers, could also seriously damage Fifth Third’s
reputation, result in a loss of customer business, subject it to additional regulatory scrutiny, or expose it to civil litigation and financial liability.

Fifth Third is exposed to operational and reputational risk.

Fifth Third is exposed to many types of operational risk, including but not limited to, business continuity risk, information management risk,
fraud risk, model risk, third party service provider risk, human resources risk, and process risk.

Fifth Third’s
actual or alleged conduct in activities, such as lending practices, data security, corporate governance and acquisitions, may result in negative public opinion and may damage Fifth Third’s reputation. Actions taken by government regulators and
community

organizations may also damage Fifth Third’s reputation. Additionally, whereas negative public opinion once was primarily driven by adverse news coverage in traditional media, the advent and
expansion of social media facilitates the rapid dissemination of information. Though Fifth Third monitors social media channels, the potential remains for rapid and widespread dissemination of inaccurate, misleading or false information that could
damage Fifth Third’s reputation. Negative public opinion can adversely affect Fifth Third’s ability to attract and keep customers and can increase the risk that it will be a target of litigation and regulatory action.

Fifth Third’s framework for managing risks may not be effective in mitigating its risk and loss.

Fifth Third’s risk management framework seeks to mitigate risk and loss. Fifth Third has established processes and
procedures intended to identify, measure, monitor, report, and analyze the types of risk to which it is subject, including liquidity risk, credit risk, market risk, interest rate risk, compliance risk, strategic risk, reputational risk, and
operational risk related to its employees, systems and vendors, among others. Any system of control and any system to reduce risk exposure, however well designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable,
not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the system are met. A failure in Fifth Third’s internal controls could have a significant negative impact not only on its earnings, but also on the perception that customers, regulators and
investors may have of Fifth Third. Fifth Third continues to devote a significant amount of effort, time and resources to improving its controls and ensuring compliance with complex regulations.

Additionally, instruments, systems and strategies used to hedge or otherwise manage exposure to various types of market
compliance, credit, liquidity, operational and business risks and enterprise-wide risk could be less effective than anticipated. As a result, Fifth Third may not be able to effectively mitigate its risk exposures in particular market environments or
against particular types of risk. If Fifth Third’s risk management framework proves ineffective, Fifth Third could incur litigation, negative regulatory consequences, reputational damages among other adverse consequences and Fifth Third could
suffer unexpected losses that may affect its financial condition or results of operations.

The results of Vantiv Holding, LLC
could have a negative impact on Fifth Third’s operating results and financial condition.

In 2009, Fifth Third sold an
approximate 51% interest in its processing business, Vantiv Holding, LLC (formerly Fifth Third Processing Solutions). As a result of additional share sales completed by Fifth Third in 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016, the Bancorp ownership share in Vantiv
Holding, LLC as of December 31, 2016, is approximately 18%. The Bancorp’s investment in Vantiv Holding, LLC is currently accounted for under the equity method of accounting and is not consolidated based on Fifth Third’s remaining
ownership share in Vantiv Holding, LLC. Vantiv Holding, LLC’s operating results could be poor and could negatively affect the operating results of Fifth Third. In addition, Fifth Third participates in a multi-lender credit facility to Vantiv
Holding, LLC and repayment of these loans is contingent on the future cash flows of Vantiv Holding, LLC, which are subject to their own risks and uncertainties.

197  Fifth
Third Bancorp


Changes in Fifth Third’s ownership in Vantiv Holding, LLC could have an impact on
Fifth Third’s stock price, operating results, financial condition, and future outlook.

Fifth Third expects that it will
reduce its equity investments in Vantiv Holding, LLC and its publicly traded parent, Vantiv, Inc., in whole or in part, but there can be no assurance that such sales will occur or as to when they will occur or the value that might be received by
Fifth Third. A reduction in Fifth Third’s Vantiv ownership interest may result from a series of sale transactions similar to transactions in Vantiv securities engaged in by Fifth Third to date, or could occur as a result of one or more larger
transactions, depending on strategic considerations, market conditions, or other factors deemed important by Fifth Third. Additionally, Fifth Third’s ownership in Vantiv could be affected by transactions that Vantiv may undertake. The nature,
terms, and timing of transactions engaged in by Vantiv may not be entirely within Fifth Third’s control, if at all. If and when Fifth Third’s ownership in Vantiv is reduced, such changes in ownership could have a material impact, positive
or negative, on Fifth Third’s stock price, operating results, financial condition and future outlook.

Weather related events
or other natural disasters may have an effect on the performance of Fifth Third’s loan portfolios, especially in its coastal markets, thereby adversely impacting its results of operations.

Fifth Third’s footprint stretches from the upper Midwestern to lower Southeastern regions of the United States. These regions have
experienced weather events including hurricanes and other natural disasters. The nature and level of these events and the impact of global climate change upon their frequency and severity cannot be predicted. If large scale events occur, they may
significantly impact its loan portfolios by damaging properties pledged as collateral as well as impairing its borrowers’ ability to repay their loans.

RISKS RELATED TO THE LEGAL AND REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT

As a regulated entity, the Bancorp is subject to certain capital requirements that may limit its operations and potential growth.

The Bancorp is a bank holding company and a financial holding company. As such, it is subject to the comprehensive, consolidated
supervision and regulation of the FRB, including risk-based and leverage capital requirements, investment practices, dividend policy and growth. The Bancorp must maintain certain risk-based and leverage capital ratios as required by the FRB which
can change depending upon general economic conditions and the Bancorp’s particular condition, risk profile and growth plans. Compliance with the capital requirements, including leverage ratios, may limit operations that require the intensive
use of capital and could adversely affect the Bancorp’s ability to expand or maintain present business levels.

U.S. federal banking agencies’ capital rules implementing Basel III became effective for the Bancorp on January 1,
2015, subject to

phase-in

periods for certain components and other provisions. The need to maintain more and higher quality capital as well as greater liquidity could limit Fifth Third’s business
activities, including lending, and the ability to expand, either organically or through acquisitions. Moreover, although the capital requirements are being phased in over time, U.S. federal banking agencies take into account expectations regarding
the ability of banks to meet the capital requirements, including under stressed conditions, in approving actions that represent uses of capital, such as dividend increases and share repurchases.

Failure by the Bancorp’s banking subsidiary to meet applicable capital
requirements could subject the Bank to a variety of enforcement remedies available to the federal regulatory authorities. These include limitations on the ability to pay dividends, the issuance by the regulatory authority of a capital directive to
increase capital, and the termination of deposit insurance by the FDIC.

Fifth Third’s business, financial condition and
results of operations could be adversely affected by new or changed regulations and by the manner in which such regulations are applied by regulatory authorities.

Previous economic conditions, particularly in the financial markets, have resulted in government regulatory agencies placing increased focus
and scrutiny on the financial services industry. The U.S. government has intervened on an unprecedented scale, responding to what has been commonly referred to as the financial crisis, by introducing various actions and passing legislation such as
the DFA. Such programs and legislation subject Fifth Third and other financial institutions to restrictions, oversight and/or costs that may have an impact on Fifth Third’s business, financial condition, results of operations or the price of
its common stock.

Although there is uncertainty regarding whether the programs implemented and the legislation passed
following the financial crisis will remain in place or be modified or repealed under the new administration in the U.S., any new proposals for legislation and regulations introduced could further substantially increase compliance costs in the
financial services industry. In addition, changes to laws and regulations could have a negatively impact in the short term even if the longer-term impact of those changes may be expected to be positive for Fifth Third. Fifth Third cannot predict
whether any pending or future legislation will be adopted or the substance and impact of any such new legislation on Fifth Third. Changes in regulation could affect Fifth Third in a substantial way and could have an adverse effect on its business,
financial condition and results of operations.

Fifth Third is subject to various regulatory requirements that may limit its
operations and potential growth.

Under federal and state laws and regulations pertaining to the safety and soundness of insured
depository institutions and their holding companies, the FRB, the FDIC, the CFPB and the Ohio Division of Financial Institutions have the authority to compel or restrict certain actions by Fifth Third and its banking subsidiary, Fifth Third Bank.
Fifth Third and its banking subsidiary are subject to such supervisory authority and, more generally, must, in certain instances, obtain prior regulatory approval before engaging in certain activities or corporate decisions. There can be no
assurance that such approvals, if required, would be forthcoming or that such approvals would be granted in a timely manner. Failure to receive any such approval, if required, could limit or impair Fifth Third’s operations, restrict its growth
and/or affect its dividend policy. Such actions and activities subject to prior approval include, but are not limited to, increasing dividends paid by Fifth Third or its banking subsidiary, entering into a merger or acquisition transaction,
acquiring or establishing new branches, and entering into certain new businesses.

198  Fifth Third Bancorp


The Bancorp is a bank holding company and a financial holding company.
Failure by the Bancorp or Fifth Third Bank to meet the applicable eligibility requirements for financial holding company status (including capital and management requirements and that Fifth Third Bank maintain at least a “Satisfactory” CRA
rating) may result in restrictions on certain activities of the Bancorp, including the commencement of new activities and mergers with or acquisitions of other financial institutions, and could ultimately result in the loss of financial holding
company status.

In the wake of the most recent global financial crisis, Fifth Third and other financial institutions
more generally have been subjected to increased scrutiny from government authorities, including bank regulatory authorities, stemming from broader systemic regulatory concerns, including with respect to stress testing, capital levels, asset quality,
provisioning, AML/BSA, consumer compliance and other prudential matters and efforts to ensure that financial institutions take steps to improve their risk management and prevent future crises.

In this regard, government authorities, including the bank regulatory agencies, are also pursuing aggressive enforcement
actions with respect to compliance and other legal matters involving financial activities, which heightens the risks associated with actual and perceived compliance failures and may also adversely affect Fifth Third’s ability to enter into
certain transactions or engage in certain activities, or obtain necessary regulatory approvals in connection therewith.

In some cases, regulatory agencies may take supervisory actions that may not be publicly disclosed, which restrict or limit
a financial institution. Finally, as part of Fifth Third’s regular examination process, Fifth Third’s and its banking subsidiary’s respective regulators may advise it and its banking subsidiary to operate under various restrictions as
a prudential matter. Such supervisory actions or restrictions, if and in whatever manner imposed, could negatively affect Fifth Third’s ability to engage in new activities and certain transactions, as well as have a material adverse effect on
Fifth Third’s business and results of operations and may not be publicly disclosed.

In July 2016, the FRB
announced that Fifth Third Bank received a rating of “Needs to Improve” on its CRA examination for the period covering 2011-2013 following its periodic examination to determine Fifth Third Bank’s compliance with the CRA from 2011
through 2013. While Fifth Third Bank’s CRA rating is “Needs to Improve” the Bancorp and Fifth Third Bank face limitations and conditions on certain activities (including the commencement of new activities and merger with or
acquisitions of other financial institutions) and the potential loss of financial holding company status. As a result of these limitations and conditions, Fifth Third may be unable or may fail to pursue, evaluate or complete transactions that might
have been strategically or competitively significant. The Bank’s next CRA examination commenced during the fourth quarter of 2016.

Fifth Third and/or its affiliates are or may become involved from time to time in information-gathering requests, investigations and
proceedings by various governmental regulatory agencies and law enforcement authorities, as well as self-regulatory agencies which may lead to adverse consequences.

Fifth Third and/or its affiliates are or may become involved from time to time in information-gathering requests, reviews, investigations and
proceedings (both formal and informal) by governmental regulatory agencies and law enforcement authorities, as well as self-regulatory agencies, regarding their respective customers and businesses. In addition, the complexity of the federal and
state

regulatory and enforcement regimes in the U.S. means that a single event or topic may give rise to numerous and overlapping investigations and regulatory proceedings. Such matters may result in
material adverse consequences, including without limitation, adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions or other actions, amendments and/or restatements of Fifth Third’s SEC filings and/or financial statements, as applicable,
and/or determinations of material weaknesses in its disclosure controls and procedures.

There has been a trend of large
settlements with governmental agencies that may adversely affect the outcomes for other financial institutions, to the extent they are used as a template for other settlements in the future. The uncertain regulatory enforcement environment makes it
difficult to estimate probable losses, which can lead to substantial disparities between legal reserves and actual settlements or penalties.

Deposit insurance premiums levied against Fifth Third Bank may increase if the number of bank failures increase or the cost of
resolving failed banks increases.

The FDIC maintains a DIF to protect insured depositors in the event of bank failures. The DIF
is funded by fees assessed on insured depository institutions including Fifth Third Bank. Future deposit premiums paid by Fifth Third Bank depend on FDIC rules, which are subject to change, the level of the DIF and the magnitude and cost of future
bank failures. Fifth Third Bank may be required to pay significantly higher FDIC premiums if market developments change such that the DIF balance is reduced or the FDIC changes its rules to require higher premiums.

Fifth Third is subject to extensive governmental regulation which could adversely impact Fifth Third or the businesses in which Fifth
Third is engaged.

Fifth Third is subject to extensive state and federal regulation, supervision and legislation that govern
almost all aspects of its operations and limit the businesses in which Fifth Third may engage. These laws and regulations may change from time to time and are primarily intended for the protection of consumers and depositors and are not designed to
protect security-holders. The impact of any changes to laws and regulations or other actions by regulatory agencies may negatively impact Fifth Third or its ability to increase the value of its business. Additionally, actions by regulatory agencies
or significant litigation against Fifth Third could cause it to devote significant time and resources to defending itself and may lead to penalties that materially affect Fifth Third and its shareholders. Future changes in the laws, including tax
laws, or regulations or their interpretations or enforcement may also be materially adverse to Fifth Third and its shareholders or may require Fifth Third to expend significant time and resources to comply with such requirements.

The DFA, enacted in 2010, is complex and broad in scope and several of its provisions are still being implemented. The DFA
established the CFPB which has authority to regulate consumer financial products and services sold by banks and

non-bank

companies and to supervise banks with assets of more than $10 billion and their
affiliates for compliance with Federal consumer protection laws. Since its formation, the CFPB has finalized a number of significant rules that could have a significant impact on Fifth Third’s business and the financial services industry more
generally including integrated mortgage disclosures under the Truth in Lending Act and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act.

199  Fifth
Third Bancorp


Compliance with the rules and policies adopted by the CFPB may limit the products Fifth Third may permissibly offer to customers, or limit the terms on which those products may be issued, or may
adversely affect Fifth Third’s ability to conduct its business as previously conducted. Fifth Third may also be required to add additional compliance personnel or incur other significant compliance-related expenses. Fifth Third’s business,
results of operations or competitive position may be adversely affected as a result.

The reforms, both under the DFA
and otherwise, are having a significant effect on the entire financial industry. Fifth Third believes compliance with the DFA and implementing its regulations and other initiatives will likely continue to negatively impact revenue and increase the
cost of doing business, both in terms of transition expenses and on an ongoing basis, and may also limit Fifth Third’s ability to pursue certain desirable business opportunities. Any new regulatory requirements or changes to existing
requirements could require changes to Fifth Third’s businesses, result in increased compliance costs and affect the profitability of such businesses. Additionally, reform could affect the behaviors of third parties that Fifth Third deals with
in the course of business, such as rating agencies, insurance companies and investors. The extent to which Fifth Third can adjust its strategies to offset such adverse impacts also is not known at this time.

We may become subject to more stringent regulatory requirements and activity restrictions if the FRB and FDIC determine that Fifth
Third’s resolution plan is not credible.

The DFA and implementing regulations jointly issued by the FRB and FDIC require
bank holding companies with more than $50 billion in assets to annually submit a resolution plan to the FRB and the FDIC that, in the event of material financial distress or failure, establish the rapid, orderly resolution under the U.S.
Bankruptcy Code. If the FRB and the FDIC jointly determine that Fifth Third’s resolution plan is not “credible,” Fifth Third could become subjected to more stringent capital, leverage or liquidity requirements or restrictions, or
restrictions on Fifth Third’s growth, activities or operations, and could eventually be required to divest certain assets or operations in ways that could negatively impact its operations and strategy.

Conforming Covered Activities to the Volcker Rule may require the expenditure of resources and management attention and result in
forced sales of assets.

Among other restricted activities, the DFA “Volcker Rule” generally restricts banks and their
affiliates from sponsoring or retaining an interest in certain private equity and hedge funds. A forced sale of some or all (“Legacy Covered Funds”) could result in Fifth Third receiving less value than it would otherwise have received.

If an orderly liquidation of a systemically important bank holding company or

non-bank

financial company were triggered, Fifth Third could face assessments for the Orderly Liquidation Fund.

The DFA created authority
for the orderly liquidation of systemically important bank holding companies and

non-bank

financial companies and is based on the FDIC’s bank resolution model. The Secretary of the U.S. Treasury may
trigger liquidation under this authority only after consultation with the President of the United States and after receiving a recommendation from the

boards of the FDIC and the Federal Reserve upon a

two-thirds

vote. Liquidation proceedings will be funded by the Orderly Liquidation Fund established under
the DFA, which will borrow from the U.S. Treasury and impose risk-based assessments on covered financial companies. Risk-based assessments would be made, first, on entities that received more in the resolution than they would have received in the
liquidation to the extent of such excess, and second, if necessary, on, among others, bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more, such as Fifth Third. Any such assessments may adversely affect Fifth
Third’s business, financial condition or results of operations.

Regulation of Fifth Third by the CFTC imposes additional
operational and compliance costs.

Title VII of DFA imposes a new regulatory regime on the U.S. derivatives markets. While most of
the provisions related to derivatives markets are now in effect, several additional requirements await final regulations from the relevant regulatory agencies for derivatives, the CFTC and the SEC. One aspect of this new regulatory regime for
derivatives is that substantial oversight responsibility has been provided to the CFTC, which, as a result, now has a meaningful supervisory role with respect to some of Fifth Third’s businesses. In 2014, Fifth Third Bank provisionally
registered as a swap dealer with the CFTC and became subject to new substantive requirements, including real time trade reporting and robust record keeping requirements, business conduct requirements (including daily valuations, disclosure of
material risks associated with swaps and disclosure of material incentives and conflicts of interest), and mandatory clearing and exchange trading of all standardized swaps designated by the relevant regulatory agencies as required to be cleared.
Although the ultimate impact will depend on the promulgation of all final regulations, Fifth Third‘s derivatives activity will be subject to FRB margin requirements and may also be subject to capital requirements specific to this derivatives
activity. These requirements will collectively impose implementation and ongoing compliance burdens on Fifth Third and will introduce additional legal risk (including as a result of newly applicable antifraud and anti-manipulation provisions and
private rights of action). Once finalized, the rules may raise the costs and liquidity burden associated with Fifth Third’s derivatives activities and could have an adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations.

Fifth Third and/or its affiliates are or may become the subject of litigation or regulatory or other enforcement proceedings that
could result in substantial legal liability and damage to Fifth Third’s reputation.

Fifth Third and certain of its directors
and officers have been named from time to time as defendants in various class actions and other litigation relating to Fifth Third’s business and activities. Past, present and future litigation have included or could include claims for
substantial compensatory and/or punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages. Enforcement authorities may seek admissions of wrongdoing and, in some cases, criminal pleas as part of the resolutions of matters, and any such
resolution of a matter involving Fifth Third which could lead to increased exposure to private litigation, could adversely affect Fifth Third’s reputation, and could result in limitations on Fifth Third’s ability to do business in certain
jurisdictions. Legal, regulatory and other enforcement proceedings could also result in

200  Fifth Third Bancorp


material adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions or other relief, amendments and/or restatements of Fifth Third’s SEC filings and/or financial statements, as applicable
and/or determinations of material weaknesses in its disclosure controls and procedures. In addition, responding to inquiries, investigations, lawsuits and proceedings, regardless of the ultimate outcome of the matter, could be time-consuming and
expensive. Like other large financial institutions and companies, Fifth Third is also subject to risk from potential employee misconduct, including

non-compliance

with policies and improper use or disclosure
of confidential information. Substantial legal liability or significant regulatory or other enforcement action against Fifth Third could materially adversely affect its business, financial condition or results of operations and/or cause significant
reputational harm to its business. The outcome of lawsuits and regulatory proceedings may be difficult to predict or estimate. Although Fifth Third establishes accruals for legal proceedings when information related to the loss contingencies
represented by those matters indicates both that a loss is probable and that the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated, Fifth Third does not have accruals for all legal proceedings where it faces a risk of loss. In addition, due to the inherent
subjectivity of the assessments and unpredictability of the outcome of legal proceedings, amounts accrued may not represent the ultimate loss to Fifth Third from the legal proceedings in question. Thus, Fifth Third’s ultimate losses may be
higher, and possibly significantly so, than the amounts accrued for legal loss contingencies, which could adversely affect Fifth Third’s results of operations. Please see “Legal and Regulatory Proceedings” in Fifth Third’s Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on specific legal and regulatory proceedings.

Fifth Third’s ability to pay or increase dividends on its common stock or to
repurchase its capital stock is restricted.

Fifth Third’s ability to pay dividends or repurchase stock is subject to
regulatory requirements and the need to meet regulatory expectations. As part of CCAR, Fifth Third’s capital plan is subject to an annual assessment by the FRB, and the FRB may object to Fifth Third’s capital plan if Fifth Third does not
demonstrate an ability to maintain capital above the minimum regulatory capital ratios under baseline and stressful conditions throughout a nine-quarter planning horizon. If the FRB objects to Fifth Third’s capital plan, Fifth Third would be
subject to limitations on its ability to make capital distributions (including paying dividends and repurchasing stock).

The following performance graphs do not constitute soliciting material and should not be
deemed filed or incorporated by reference into any other Company filing under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, except to the extent the Bancorp specifically incorporates the performance graphs by reference therein.

Total Return Analysis

The graphs below summarize the cumulative return experienced by the Bancorp’s shareholders over the years 2011 through 2016, and 2006
through 2016, respectively, compared to the S&P 500 Stock and the S&P Banks indices.

FIFTH THIRD BANCORP VS. MARKET INDICES

Shares Issued Under Certain Employee Benefit Plans

As previously disclosed, during the fourth quarter of 2016, the Bancorp determined that a number of shares of Fifth Third Bancorp common stock
offered under our 401(k) Plan were previously inadvertently omitted from inclusion in the corresponding

S-8

registration statement. As a result, approximately 207,444 unregistered shares were sold through the
401(k) Plan during the fourth quarter of 2016.

The Bancorp filed the required Form

S-8

for the 401(k) Plan on November 10, 2016 and plans to make a voluntary rescission offer to eligible plan participants in order to remediate the registration defect during the first half of 2017. The
Bancorp also plans to make rescission offers to participants of other plans as well for previously disclosed registration and prospectus delivery failures. Based on the market price of Fifth Third Bancorp’s common stock in February 2017, the
Bancorp does not expect that the exercise of any applicable rescission rights will have a material impact on its results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity.
