ITEM 1.  BUSINESS

                                  ORGANIZATION

Registrant was organized in 1974 under the laws of the State of Ohio.  It began
operations in 1975 upon reorganization of its principal subsidiary, The Fifth
Third Bank.  The executive offices of the Registrant are located in Cincinnati,
Ohio.  The Registrant is a two-tiered, multi-bank holding company as defined in
the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, and is registered as such with
the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  The Registrant is also
a multi-savings-and-loan holding company and is registered with the Office of
Thrift Supervision.  Registrant has thirteen wholly-owned subsidiaries:  Fifth
Third Kentucky Bank Holding Company; The Fifth Third Bank; The Fifth Third Bank
of Columbus; The Fifth Third Bank of Northwestern Ohio, National Association;
The Fifth Third Bank of Southern Ohio; The Fifth Third Bank of Western Ohio; 
Fifth Third Trust Co. & Savings Bank, FSB; Fifth Third Bank of Northern
Kentucky, Inc.; The Fifth Third Bank of Central Indiana; The Fifth Third Bank
of Southeastern Indiana; Fifth Third Community Development Company; Fifth Third
Investment Company; and Fountain Square Insurance Company.  Unless the context
otherwise indicates the term "Company" as used herein means the Registrant and
the term "Bank" means its wholly-owned subsidiary, The Fifth Third Bank.

As of December 31, 1994, the Company's consolidated total assets were
$14,957,009,000 and stockholders' equity totalled $1,398,774,000.

Fifth Third Kentucky Bank Holding Company has two wholly-owned subsidiaries: 
Fifth Third Bank of Kentucky, Inc. and The Fifth Third Savings Bank of Western
Kentucky, FSB.  In addition, the Bank has four wholly-owned subsidiaries:
Midwest Payment Systems, Inc.; Fifth Third Securities, Inc.; The Fifth Third
Company; and The Fifth Third Leasing Company.


                               PRIOR ACQUISITIONS

The Company is the result of mergers and acquisitions over the years involving
27 financial institutions throughout Ohio, Indiana, Kentucky, and Florida.  The
Company made the following acquisitions during 1994:

On May 20, 1994, the Company purchased $294 million in deposits from Equitable
Savings Bank.  The seven offices were located in southern and central Ohio and
were acquired by the Bank, The Fifth Third Bank of Columbus and The Fifth Third
Bank of Southern Ohio.

On June 3, 1994, the Company acquired The National Bancorp of Kentucky, Inc.,
with consolidated assets of approximately $90 million, in a transaction
accounted for as a pooling of interests.  The Consolidated Financial Statements
for prior periods have not been restated for this acquisition due to
immateriality.  National Bancorp's subsidiaries, First National Bank of Falmouth
and National Bank of Cynthiana, were merged with Fifth Third Bank of Northern
Kentucky, Inc. and Fifth Third Bank of Kentucky, Inc. (formerly Fifth Third Bank
of Central Kentucky, Inc.), respectively.





                                    Page  3


On August 26, 1994, the Company acquired The Cumberland Federal Bancorporation,
Inc., with consolidated assets of approximately $1.1 billion, and its wholly-
owned subsidiary, The Cumberland Federal Savings Bank ("Cumberland FSB") in a
transaction accounted for as a pooling of interests.  Financial information for
all prior periods has been restated.  In concurrent transactions, Fifth Third
Bank of Kentucky, Inc. purchased substantially all of the assets and assumed
substantially all of the liabilities of The Cumberland FSB, and The Cumberland
FSB's main office was relocated to Mayfield, Kentucky and renamed The Fifth
Third Savings Bank of Western Kentucky, FSB.


                                  COMPETITION

There are hundreds of commercial banks, savings and loans and other financial
services providers in Ohio, Kentucky, Indiana, Florida and nationally, which
provide strong competition to the Company's banking subsidiaries.  As providers
of a full range of financial services, these subsidiaries compete with national
and state banks, savings and loan associations, securities dealers, brokers,
mortgage bankers, finance and insurance companies, and other financial service
companies.  With respect to data processing services, the Bank's data processing
subsidiary, Midwest Payment Systems, Inc., competes with other third party
service providers such as Deluxe Data Services, EDS and Electronic Payment
Systems.

The earnings of the Company are affected by general economic conditions as well
as by the monetary policies of the Federal Reserve Board.  Such policies, which
include regulating the national supply of bank reserves and bank credit, can
have a major effect upon the source and cost of funds and the rates of return
earned on loans and investments.  The Federal Reserve influences the size and
distribution of bank reserves through its open market operations and changes in
cash reserve requirements against member bank deposits.


                          REGULATION AND SUPERVISION

The Company, as a bank holding company, is subject to the restrictions of the
Bank Holding Company act of 1956, as amended.  This Act provides that the
acquisition of control of a bank is subject to the prior approval of the Board
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  The Company is required to obtain
the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board before it can acquire control
of more than 5% of the voting shares of another bank.  The Act does not permit
the Federal Reserve Board to approve an acquisition by the Company, or any of
its subsidiaries, of any bank located in a state other than Ohio, unless the
acquisition is specifically authorized by the law of the state in which such
bank is located.

On September 29, 1994, the Act was amended by The Interstate Banking and Branch
Efficiency Act of 1994 which authorizes interstate bank acquisitions anywhere
in the country effective one year after the date of enactment, and interstate
branching by acquisition and consolidation effective June 1, 1997, in those
states that have not opted out by that date.  The impact of this amendment on
the Company cannot be measured at this time.






                                    Page  4

The Company's subsidiary state banks are primarily subject to the laws of the
state in which each is located, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve
System and/or the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.  The subsidiary banks
which are organized under the laws of the United States are primarily subject
to regulation by the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation.  The Company and Fifth Third Kentucky Bank Holding
Company, as savings and loan holding companies, and their savings and loan
subsidiaries are subject to regulation by the Office of Thrift Supervision.

The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to certain restrictions on
intercompany loans and investments.  The Company and its subsidiaries are also
subject to certain restrictions with respect to engaging in the underwriting and
public sale and distribution of securities.  In addition, the Company and its
subsidiaries are subject to examination at the discretion of supervisory
authorities.

The Bank Holding Company Act limits the activities which may be engaged in by
the Company and its subsidiaries to ownership of banks and those activities
which the Federal Reserve Board has deemed or may in the future find to be so
closely related to banking as to be a proper incident thereto.

The Financial Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA) provides
that a holding company's controlled insured depository institutions are liable
for any loss incurred by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation in connection
with the default of, or any FDIC-assisted transaction involving, an affiliated
insured bank or savings association.

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (the "FDIC
Improvement Act") covers a wide expanse of banking regulatory issues.  The FDIC
Improvement Act deals with the recapitalization of the Bank Insurance Fund, with
deposit insurance reform, including requiring the FDIC to establish a risk-based
premium assessment system, and with a number of other regulatory and supervisory
matters.  The full effect of the FDIC Improvement Act generally on the financial
services industry, and specifically on the Company, is not determinable.

                               EMPLOYEES

As of December 31, 1994, there were no employees of the Company.  Subsidiaries
of the Company employed 6,045 employees--1,015 were officers and 1,237 were
part-time employees.

                           SECURITIES PORTFOLIO

The securities portfolio as of December 31 for each of the last five years, and
the maturity distribution and weighted average yield of securities as of
December 31, 1994, are incorporated herein by reference to the securities tables
on page 30 of the Company's 1994 Annual Report to Stockholders attached to this
filing as Exhibit 13.

The weighted average yields for the securities portfolio are yields to maturity
weighted by the par values of the securities.  The weighted average yields on
securities exempt from income taxes are computed on a taxable equivalent basis. 
The taxable equivalent yields are net after-tax yields to maturity divided by
the complement of the full corporate tax rate (35%).  In order to express yields
on a taxable equivalent basis, yields on obligations of states and political
subdivisions (municipal securities) have been increased as follows:

              Under 1 year                                  2.16%
              1 - 5 years                                   2.61%
              6 - 10 years                                  2.63%
              Over 10 years                                 2.74%
              Total municipal securities                    2.49%


                             AVERAGE BALANCE SHEETS

The average balance sheets are incorporated herein by reference to Table 1 on
pages 26 and 27 of the Company's 1994 Annual Report to Stockholders attached to
this filing as Exhibit 13.


           ANALYSIS OF NET INTEREST INCOME AND NET INTEREST INCOME CHANGES

related discussion on pages 26 through 28 of the Company's 1994 Annual Report
to Stockholders attached to this filing as Exhibit 13.

Reserve for Credit Losses
- -------------------------

The reserve for credit losses is established through charges to
operations by a provision for credit losses.  Loans and leases which
are determined to be uncollectible are charged against the reserve and
any subsequent recoveries are credited to the reserve.  The amount
charged to operations is based on several factors.  These include the
following:

    1.  Analytical reviews of the credit loss experience in relationship to
    outstanding loans and leases to determine an adequate reserve for
    credit losses required for loans and leases at risk.
    2.  A continuing review of problem or at risk loans and leases and the
    overall portfolio quality.
    3.  Regular examinations and appraisals of the loan and lease portfolio
    conducted by the Bank's examination staff and the banking supervisory
    authorities.
    4. Management's judgement with respect to the current and expected
    economic conditions and their impact on the existing loan and lease
    portfolio.

The amount provided for credit losses exceeded actual net charge-offs by
$18,306,000 in 1994, $20,963,000 in 1993 and $20,335,000 in 1992.

Management reviews the reserve on a quarterly basis to determine whether
additional provisions should be made after considering the factors noted above.
Based on these procedures, management is of the opinion that the reserve at
December 31, 1994 of $155,918,000 is adequate.
