OTHER FACTORS IMPACTING OUR OPERATIONS

Research and Development

The markets in which we participate are subject to rapid technological advances. Constant improvement of existing products and introduction of new products are necessary to maintain market leadership. Our research and development (R&D) efforts are directed toward maintaining or achieving technological leadership in each of the markets we serve in order to help ensure that patients using our devices and therapies receive the most advanced and effective treatment possible. We remain committed to developing technological enhancements and new indications for existing products, and less invasive and new technologies for new and emerging markets to address unmet patient needs. That commitment leads to our initiation and participation in many clinical trials each fiscal year as the demand for clinical and economic evidence remains high. Furthermore, our development activities are intended to help reduce patient care costs and the length of hospital stays in the future. We have not engaged in significant customer or government-sponsored research.

Our R&D activities include improving existing products and therapies, expanding their indications and applications for use, and developing new therapies and procedures. We continue to focus on optimizing innovation, improving our R&D productivity, driving growth in emerging markets, clinical evidence generation, and assessing our R&D programs based on their ability to deliver economic value to our customers.

Intellectual Property

We rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, tradenames, copyrights, trade secrets, and non-disclosure and non-competition agreements to establish and protect our proprietary technology. In addition, we have entered into exclusive and non-exclusive licenses relating to a wide array of third-party technologies. In the aggregate, these intellectual property assets and licenses are of



material importance to our business; however, we believe that no single patent, technology, trademark, intellectual property asset or license is material in relation to any segment of our business or to our business as a whole.

We operate in an industry characterized by extensive patent litigation. Patent litigation may result in significant damage awards and injunctions that could prevent the manufacture and sale of affected products or result in significant royalty payments in order to continue selling the products. At any given time, we are involved as both a plaintiff and a defendant in a number of patent infringement actions, the outcomes of which may not be known for prolonged periods of time. For additional information, see Note


to the consolidated financial statements in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Sales and Distribution

We sell most of our medical devices and therapies through direct sales representatives in the U.S. and a combination of direct sales representatives and independent distributors in markets outside the U.S. For certain portions of our business, we also sell through distributors in the U.S. Our medical supplies products are used primarily in hospitals, surgi-centers and alternate care facilities, such as home care and long-term care facilities, and are marketed to materials managers, GPOs and integrated delivery networks (IDNs) primarily through third-party distributors, although we also have direct sales representatives. We often negotiate with GPOs and IDNs, which enter into supply contracts for the benefit of their member facilities. Our four largest markets are the U.S., Western Europe, Japan, and China. Emerging markets are an area of increasing focus and opportunity, as we believe they remain under-penetrated.

Our marketing and sales strategy is focused on rapid, cost-effective delivery of high-quality products to a diverse group of customers worldwide. To achieve this objective, we organize our marketing and sales teams around physician specialties. This focus enables us to develop highly knowledgeable and dedicated sales representatives who are able to foster strong relationships with physicians and other customers and enhance our ability to cross-sell complementary products.

We are not dependent on any single customer for more than 10 percent of our total net sales.

Competition, Industry and Cost Containment

We compete in both the therapeutic and diagnostic medical markets in

more than


countries throughout the world. These markets are characterized by rapid change resulting from technological advances and scientific discoveries. Our product lines face a mix of competitors ranging from large manufacturers with multiple business lines to small manufacturers offering a limited selection of products. In addition, we face competition from providers of other medical therapies, such as pharmaceutical companies.

Major shifts in industry market share have occurred in connection with product problems, physician advisories, safety alerts, and publications about our products, reflecting the importance of product quality, product efficacy and quality systems in the medical device industry. In the current environment of managed care, economically motivated customers, consolidation among health care providers, increased competition, and declining reimbursement rates, we have been increasingly required to compete on the basis of price. In order to continue to compete effectively, we must continue to create or acquire advanced technology, incorporate this technology into proprietary products, obtain regulatory approvals in a timely manner, maintain high-quality manufacturing processes, and successfully market these products.

Government and private sector initiatives to limit the growth of health care costs, including price regulation, competitive pricing, bidding and tender mechanics, coverage and payment policies, comparative effectiveness of therapies, technology assessments and managed-care arrangements are continuing in many countries where we do business, including the U.S. These changes put increased emphasis on the delivery of more cost-effective medical devices and therapies. Government programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, private health care insurance and managed-care plans have attempted to control costs by limiting the amount of reimbursement they will pay for particular procedures or treatments, tying reimbursement to outcomes, shifting to population health management, and other mechanisms. Hospitals, which purchase implants, are also seeking to reduce costs through a variety of mechanisms, including, for example, centralized purchasing, and in some cases, limiting the number of vendors that may participate in the purchasing program. Hospitals are also aligning interests with physicians through employment and other arrangements, such as gainsharing, where a hospital agrees with physicians to share any realized cost savings resulting from changes in practice patterns such as device standardization. This has created an increasing level of price sensitivity among customers for our products.

Worldwide Operations

Our global operations are accompanied by certain financial and other risks. Relationships with customers and effective terms of sale vary by country. Exchange rate fluctuations may affect revenues, earnings, and cash flows from operations. We use operational and economic hedges, as well as derivative contracts, to manage the impact of currency exchange rate changes on earnings and



cash flow. See “Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” and Note


to the consolidated financial statements in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Net sales and property, plant, and equipment attributable to significant geographic areas are presented in Note


to the consolidated financial statements in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Production and Availability of Raw Materials

We manufacture products at manufacturing facilities located in various countries throughout the world. We purchase many of the components and raw materials used in manufacturing our products from numerous suppliers in various countries. Certain components and raw materials are available only from a sole supplier. We work closely with our suppliers to help ensure continuity of supply while maintaining high quality and reliability. Generally, we have been able to obtain adequate supplies of such raw materials and components. However, due to the U.S. FDA’s manufacturing requirements, we may not be able to quickly establish additional or replacement sources for certain components or materials if we experience a sudden or unexpected reduction or interruption in supply and are unable to develop alternative sources.

For additional information related to our manufacturing facilities refer to “Item 2. Properties” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Quality Management and Product Liability

Our business success depends on the quality of our products, and we have global processes, procedures and programs, including our “Quality Begins with Me” program, that are intended to help us maintain the highest possible level of quality in all products.

We operate in an industry susceptible to significant product liability claims. These claims may be brought by individuals seeking relief on their own behalf or purporting to represent a class.

Working Capital

Our goal is to carry sufficient levels of inventory to meet the product delivery needs of our customers. We also provide payment terms to customers in the normal course of business and rights to return product under warranty to meet the operational demands of our customers.

Employees

On

April 26, 2019

, we employed more than 90,000 full-time employees. Our employees are vital to our success. We believe we have been successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel in a highly competitive labor market due to our competitive compensation and benefits and our rewarding work environment.

Seasonality

Worldwide sales do not reflect a significant degree of seasonality. However, the number of medical procedures incorporating Medtronic products is generally lower during summer months in the northern hemisphere due to summer vacation schedules, particularly in European countries.

Government Regulation

Our operations and products are subject to extensive regulation by numerous government agencies, including the U.S. FDA, European regulatory authorities such as the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency in the United Kingdom (U.K.)  and the Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices in Germany, the China Food and Drug Administration (CFDA), and other government agencies inside and outside the U.S. To varying degrees, each of these agencies requires us to comply with laws and regulations governing the development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, marketing, distribution and post-marketing surveillance of our products. Our business is also affected by patient privacy laws and government payer cost containment initiatives, as well as environmental health and safety laws and regulations.

Product Approval and Monitoring

Many countries where we sell medical devices subject such medical devices and technologies to their own approval and other regulatory requirements regarding performance, safety, and quality of our products. Authorization to commercially distribute a new medical device in the U.S. is generally obtained in one of two ways. The first, known as pre-market notification or the 510(k) process, requires us to demonstrate that our new medical device is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed medical device. The second, more rigorous process, known as pre-market approval, requires us to independently demonstrate that a medical device is safe and effective for its intended use. This process is generally much more time-consuming and expensive than the 510(k) process.



In the European Union (E.U.), a single regulatory approval process exists, and conformity with the legal requirements is represented by the CE Mark. To obtain a CE Mark, defined products must meet minimum standards of performance, safety, and quality (i.e., the essential requirements), and then, according to their classification, comply with one or more of a selection of conformity assessment routes. The competent authorities of the E.U. countries separately regulate the clinical research for medical devices and the market surveillance of products once they are placed on the market. A new Medical Device Regulation was published by the E.U. in 2017 which will impose significant additional premarket and postmarket requirements. The regulation has a three-year implementation period to May 2020. After that time, medical devices marketed in the E.U. will require certification according to these new requirements, except that devices with valid CE certificates, issued pursuant to the Medical Device Directives before May 2020, can be placed on the market until May 2024.

The global regulatory environment is increasingly stringent and unpredictable. Several countries that did not have regulatory requirements for medical devices have established such requirements in recent years, and other countries have expanded, or plan to expand, their existing regulations. While harmonization of global regulations has been pursued, requirements continue to differ significantly among countries. We expect this global regulatory environment will continue to evolve, which could impact the cost, the time needed to approve, and ultimately, our ability to maintain existing approvals or obtain future approvals for our products.  Regulations of the U.S. FDA and other regulatory agencies in and outside the U.S. impose extensive compliance and monitoring obligations on our business. These agencies review our design and manufacturing practices, labeling, record keeping, and manufacturers’ required reports of adverse experiences and other information to identify potential problems with marketed medical devices. We are also subject to periodic inspections for compliance with applicable quality system regulations, which govern the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the design, manufacture, packaging, and servicing of finished medical devices intended for human use. In addition, the U.S. FDA and other regulatory bodies, both in and outside the U.S. (including the Federal Trade Commission, the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, the U.S. Department of Justice, and various state Attorneys General), monitor the promotion and advertising of our products. Any adverse regulatory action, depending on its magnitude, may limit our ability to effectively market and sell our products, limit our ability to obtain future premarket approvals or result in a substantial modification to our business practices and operations. For additional information, see "Item 1A. Risk Factors"

We are subject to costly and complex laws and governmental regulations and any adverse regulatory action may materially adversely affect our financial condition and business operation

In April 2015, we entered into a consent decree with the U.S. FDA relating to our Pain Therapies division's SynchroMed drug infusion system and the Neuromodulation quality system. The consent decree requires us to complete certain corrections and enhancements to the SynchroMed pump and the Neuromodulation quality system. The consent decree’s limitations on our ability to manufacture and distribute the SynchroMed drug infusion system were lifted by the U.S. FDA in September 2017. Following the successful completion of the required third-party expert audits, and in coordination with the FDA, the consent decree will be vacated. The Company must undergo third-party audits and submit audit reports to the U.S. FDA through 2020.

In June 2016, TYRX received a Warning Letter from the U.S. FDA following an inspection at the TYRX facility in Monmouth Junction, New Jersey. The U.S. FDA completed its follow up inspection to the Warning Letter in March 2018 and issued a Form-483 with observations, although the U.S. FDA noted in its closing meeting that there had been significant improvements made since the prior inspection. We have completed the commitments under the Form-483 and have been communicating to the U.S. FDA on the progress. The next step will be to signal readiness for inspection, which will occur at the Medtronic Rice Creek facility in Minneapolis, now that the manufacturing operations at Monmouth Junction have ceased. In June 2014, HeartWare Inc. received a Warning Letter from the U.S. FDA following an inspection at the HeartWare facility in Miami Lakes, Florida. Medtronic acquired HeartWare in August 2016, and implemented corrective actions and process improvements to address the items in the Warning Letter. In July 2018, HeartWare received a Form-483 after a U.S. FDA inspection and is implementing additional corrective actions, primarily related to the Pioneer 2.0 Controller, in response to the observations. We have been communicating monthly with the U.S. FDA on the progress of the actions.  In August 2018, we received two FDA Warning Letters, one issued to the CRHF facility in Mounds View, MN, and the other issued to the Juncos facility in Puerto Rico.  The letters were limited to the Blackwell ICD and focused on the manufacturing and design processes for Blackwell. Medtronic has been working with the U.S. FDA on resolving the open items and continues to make steady progress on implementing corrective actions. After the actions are complete, the U.S. FDA will perform a reinspection in order to lift the Warning Letters.

Trade Regulations

The movement of products, services, and investment across borders subject us to extensive trade regulations. A variety of laws and regulations in the countries in which we transact business apply to the sale, shipment and provision of goods, services and technology across borders. These laws and regulations govern, among other things, our import, export and other business activities. We are also subject to the risk that these laws and regulations could change in a way that would expose us to additional costs, penalties or liabilities. Some governments also impose economic sanctions against certain countries, persons or entities. In addition to our need to comply with such regulations in connection with our direct activities, we also sell and provide goods, technology and services to agents, representatives and distributors who may export such items to customers and end-users. If we, or the third



parties through which we do business, are not in compliance with applicable import, export control or economic sanctions laws and regulations, we may be subject to civil or criminal enforcement action, and varying degrees of liability. Such actions may disrupt or delay sales of our products or services or result in restrictions on our distribution and sales of products or services that may materially impact our business.

Anti-Boycott Laws

Under U.S. laws and regulations, U.S. companies and their subsidiaries and affiliates outside the U.S. are prohibited from participating or agreeing to participate in unsanctioned foreign boycotts in connection with certain business activities, including the sale, purchase, transfer, shipping or financing of goods or services within the U.S. or between the U.S. and countries outside of the U.S. If we, or certain third parties through which we sell or provide goods or services, violate anti-boycott laws and regulations, we may be subject to civil or criminal enforcement action and varying degrees of liability.

Data Privacy and Security Laws and Regulations

As a business with a significant global footprint, compliance with evolving regulations and standards in data privacy and cybersecurity has resulted, and may continue to result, in increased costs, new compliance challenges, and the threat of increased regulatory enforcement activity. Our business relies on the secure electronic transmission, storage and hosting of sensitive information, including personal information, protected health information, financial information, intellectual property and other sensitive information related to our customers and workforce.

For example, in the U.S., the collection, maintenance, protection, use, transmission, disclosure and disposal of certain personal information and the security of medical devices are regulated at the U.S. federal and state, international and industry levels. U.S. federal and state laws protect the confidentiality of certain patient health information, including patient medical records, and restrict the use and disclosure of patient health information by health care providers. Privacy and Security Rules under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), as amended, and the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 (HITECH),  govern the use, disclosure, and security of protected health information by “Covered Entities,” (which are health care providers that submit electronic claims, health plans, and health care clearinghouses) and by their “Business Associates” (which is anyone that performs a service on behalf of a Covered Entity involving the use or disclosure of protected health information and is not a member of the Covered Entity’s workforce). Rules under HIPAA and HITECH include specific security standards and breach notification requirements. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) (through the Office of Civil Rights) has direct enforcement authority against Covered Entities and Business Associates with regard to both the Security and Privacy Rules, including civil and criminal liability. With the exception of certain of its operations in its Diabetes and care management services businesses, Medtronic is generally not a Covered Entity. Medtronic also operates as a Business Associate to Covered Entities in a limited number of instances. There are comparable state laws governing the use and protection of personal health information by health care providers, and Medtronic may be subject to these laws in certain of its businesses.

In addition to the regulation of personal health information, a number of states have also adopted laws and regulations that may affect our privacy and data security practices for other kinds of personally identifiable information, such as state laws that govern the use, disclosure and protection of sensitive personal information, such as social security numbers, or that are designed to protect credit card account data. State consumer protection laws may also establish privacy and security standards for use and management of personally identifiable information, including information related to consumers and care providers.

Outside the U.S., we are impacted by the privacy and data security requirements at the international, national and regional level, and on an industry specific basis. We serve customers in more than 150 countries. Legal requirements in these countries relating to the collection, storage, handling and transfer of personal data and potentially intellectual property continue to evolve with increasingly strict enforcement regimes. More privacy and security laws and regulations are being adopted, and more are being enforced, with potential for significant financial penalties. In the E.U., stringent data protection and privacy rules which substantially impact the use of patient data across the healthcare industry became effective in May 2018. The E.U. General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) applies uniformly across the E.U. and includes, among other things, a requirement for prompt notice of data breaches to data subjects and supervisory authorities in certain circumstances and significant fines for non-compliance. The GDPR also requires companies processing personal data of individuals residing in the E.U. to comply with E.U. privacy and data protection rules.

Because the laws and regulations continue to expand, differ from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and are subject to evolving (and at times inconsistent) governmental interpretation, compliance with these laws and regulations may require significant additional cost expenditures or changes in products or business that increase competition or reduce revenue.  Noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines, penalties, or orders to stop noncompliant activities.



Regulations Governing Reimbursement

The delivery of our devices is subject to regulation by HHS and comparable state and non-U.S. agencies responsible for reimbursement and regulation of health care items and services. U.S. laws and regulations are imposed primarily in connection with federally-funded health care programs, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs, as well as the government’s interest in regulating the quality and cost of health care. Other governments also impose regulations in connection with their health care reimbursement programs and the delivery of health care items and services.

U.S. federal health care laws apply when we or customers submit claims for items or services that are reimbursed under federally-funded health care programs, including laws related to kickbacks, false claims, self-referrals and health care fraud. There are often similar state false claims, anti-kickback, and anti-self-referral and insurance laws that apply to state-funded Medicaid and other health care programs and private third-party payers. In some circumstances, insurance companies attempt to bring a private cause of action against a manufacturer for a pattern of causing false claims. In addition, as a manufacturer of U.S. FDA-approved devices reimbursable by federal healthcare programs, we are subject to the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires us to annually report certain payments and other transfers of value we make to U.S.-licensed physicians or U.S. teaching hospitals. Any failure to comply with these laws and regulations could subject us or our officers and employees to criminal and civil financial penalties.

Implementation of further legislative or administrative reforms to reimbursement systems, or adverse decisions relating to our products by administrators of these systems in coverage or reimbursement, could significantly reduce reimbursement or result in the denial of coverage, which could have an impact on the acceptance of and demand for our products and the prices that our customers are willing to pay for them. Further, as a result of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the “ACA”), the U.S. is implementing value-based payment methodologies and seeking to create alternate payment models, such as bundled payments, to continue to drive improved value.

Environmental Health and Safety Laws

We are also subject to various environmental health and safety laws and regulations both within and outside the U.S. Like other companies in our industry, our manufacturing and other operations involve the use and transportation of substances regulated under environmental health and safety laws including those related to the transportation of hazardous materials.

Item 1A. Risk Factors

Investing in our securities involves a variety of risks and uncertainties, known and unknown, including, among others, those discussed below. Each of the following risks should be carefully considered, together with all the other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and in our other filings with the SEC. Furthermore, additional risks and uncertainty not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business. Our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flow and prospects could be materially and adversely affected by any of these risks or uncertainties.



Risks Relating to the Company

We operate in a highly competitive industry and we may be unable to compete effectively.

We compete in both the therapeutic and diagnostic medical markets in more than 150 countries throughout the world. These markets are characterized by rapid change resulting from technological advances and scientific discoveries. In the product lines in which we compete, we face a range of competitors from large companies with multiple business lines to small, specialized manufacturers that offer a limited selection of niche products. Development by other companies of new or improved products, processes, technologies, or the introduction of reprocessed products or generic versions when our proprietary products lose their patent protection may make our existing or planned products less competitive. In addition, we face competition from providers of alternative medical therapies, such as pharmaceutical companies.

We believe our ability to compete depends upon many factors both within and beyond our control, including:

•

product performance and reliability,

•

product technology and innovation,

•

product quality and safety,

•

breadth of product lines,

•

product support services,

•

customer support,

•

cost-effectiveness and price,

•

reimbursement approval from health care insurance providers, and

•

changes to the regulatory environment.

Competition may increase as additional companies enter our markets or modify their existing products to compete directly with ours. In addition, academic institutions, governmental agencies and other public and private research organizations also may conduct research, seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for discovery, research, clinical development and marketing of products similar to ours. These companies and institutions compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, as well as in acquiring necessary product technologies. From time to time we have lost, and may in the future lose, market share in connection with product problems, physician advisories, safety alerts and publications about our products, which highlights the importance of product quality, product efficacy and quality systems to our business. In the current environment of managed care, consolidation among health care providers, increased competition, and declining reimbursement rates, we have been increasingly required to compete on the basis of price. Further, our continued growth and success depend on our ability to develop, acquire and market new and differentiated products, technologies and intellectual property, and as a result we also face competition for marketing, distribution, and collaborative development agreements, establishing relationships with academic and research institutions and licenses to intellectual property. In order to continue to compete effectively, we must continue to create, invest in or acquire advanced technology, incorporate this technology into our proprietary products, obtain regulatory approvals in a timely manner, and manufacture and successfully market our products. Given these factors, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to compete effectively or continue our level of success.

Reduction or interruption in supply or other manufacturing difficulties may adversely affect our manufacturing operations and related product sales.

The manufacture of our products requires the timely delivery of a sufficient amount of quality components and materials and is highly exacting and complex, due in part to strict regulatory requirements. We manufacture the majority of our products and procure important third-party services, such as sterilization services, at numerous facilities worldwide. We purchase many of the components, raw materials and services needed to manufacture these products from numerous suppliers in various countries. We have generally been able to obtain adequate supplies of such raw materials, components and services. However, for reasons of quality assurance, cost effectiveness, or availability, certain components, raw materials and services needed to manufacture our products are obtained from a sole supplier. Although we work closely with our suppliers to try to ensure continuity of supply while maintaining high quality and reliability, the supply of these components, raw materials and services may be interrupted or insufficient. In addition, due to the stringent regulations and requirements of regulatory agencies, including the U.S. FDA, regarding the manufacture of our products, we may not be able to quickly establish additional or replacement sources. Furthermore, the prices of commodities and other materials used in our products, which are often volatile and outside of our control, could adversely impact our supply. We use resins, other petroleum-based materials and pulp as raw materials in some of our products, and the prices of oil and gas also significantly affect our costs for freight and utilities. A reduction or interruption in supply, and an inability to develop alternative sources for such supply, could adversely affect our ability to manufacture our products in a timely or cost-effective manner and could result in lost sales.

Other disruptions in the manufacturing process or product sales and fulfillment systems for any reason, including equipment malfunction, failure to follow specific protocols and procedures, supplier facility shut-downs, defective raw materials, natural



disasters such as hurricanes, tornadoes or wildfires, and other environmental factors, could lead to launch delays, product shortage, unanticipated costs, lost revenues and damage to our reputation. For example, in the past we have experienced a global information technology systems interruption that affected our customer ordering, distribution, and manufacturing processes. Furthermore, any failure to identify and address manufacturing problems prior to the release of products to our customers could result in quality or safety issues.

In addition, several of our key products are manufactured or sterilized at a particular facility, with limited alternate facilities. If an event occurs that results in damage to or closure of one or more of such facilities, such as the damage caused by Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico in September 2017, we may be unable to manufacture or sterilize the relevant products at the previous levels or at all. Because of the time required to approve and license a manufacturing or sterilization facility, a third-party may not be available on a timely basis to replace production capacity in the event manufacturing or sterilization capacity is lost.

We are subject to costly and complex laws and governmental regulations and any adverse regulatory action may materially adversely affect our financial condition and business operations.

Our medical devices and technologies, as well as our business activities, are subject to a complex set of regulations and rigorous enforcement, including by the U.S. FDA, U.S. Department of Justice, Health and Human Services-Office of the Inspector General, and numerous other federal, state, and non-U.S. governmental authorities. To varying degrees, each of these agencies requires us to comply with laws and regulations governing the development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, marketing and distribution of our products. As a part of the regulatory process of obtaining marketing clearance for new products and new indications for existing products, we conduct and participate in numerous clinical trials with a variety of study designs, patient populations, and trial endpoints. Unfavorable or inconsistent clinical data from existing or future clinical trials or the market’s or U.S. FDA’s perception of this clinical data, may adversely impact our ability to obtain product approvals, our position in, and share of, the markets in which we participate, and our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to obtain or maintain marketing clearance for our new products or enhancements or modifications to existing products, and the failure to maintain approvals or obtain approval or clearance could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Even if we are able to obtain approval or clearance, it may:

•

take a significant amount of time,

•

require the expenditure of substantial resources,

•

involve stringent clinical and pre-clinical testing, as well as increased post-market surveillance,

•

involve modifications, repairs or replacements of our products, and

•

limit the proposed uses of our products.

Both before and after a product is commercially released, we have ongoing responsibilities under the U.S. FDA and other applicable non-U.S. government agency regulations. For instance, many of our facilities and procedures and those of our suppliers are also subject to periodic inspections by the U.S. FDA to determine compliance with applicable regulations. The results of these inspections can include inspectional observations on the U.S. FDA’s Form-483, warning letters, or other forms of enforcement. If the U.S. FDA were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations, or that any of our medical products are ineffective or pose an unreasonable health risk, the U.S. FDA could ban such medical products, detain or seize adulterated or misbranded medical products, order a recall, repair, replacement, or refund of such products, refuse to grant pending pre-market approval applications or require certificates of non-U.S governments for exports, and/or require us to notify health professionals and others that the devices present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health. The U.S. FDA and other non-U.S. government agencies may also assess civil or criminal penalties against us, our officers or employees and impose operating restrictions on a company-wide basis. The U.S. FDA may also recommend prosecution to the U.S. Department of Justice. Any adverse regulatory action, depending on its magnitude, may restrict us from effectively marketing and selling our products and limit our ability to obtain future pre-market clearances or approvals, and could result in a substantial modification to our business practices and operations. Furthermore, we occasionally receive subpoenas or other requests for information from state and federal governmental agencies, and while these investigations typically relate primarily to financial arrangements with health care providers, regulatory compliance and product promotional practices, we cannot predict the timing, outcome or impact of any such investigations. Any adverse outcome in one or more of these investigations could include the commencement of civil and/or criminal proceedings, substantial fines, penalties, and/or administrative remedies, including exclusion from government reimbursement programs and/or entry into Corporate Integrity Agreements (CIAs) with governmental agencies. In addition, resolution of any of these matters could involve the imposition of additional, costly compliance obligations. These potential consequences, as well as any adverse outcome from government investigations, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.

In addition, the U.S. FDA has taken the position that device manufacturers are prohibited from promoting their products other than for the uses and indications set forth in the approved product labeling, and any failure to comply could subject us to significant civil or criminal exposure, administrative obligations and costs, and/or other potential penalties from, and/or agreements with, the federal government.



Governmental regulations outside the U.S. have, and may continue to, become increasingly stringent and common. In the European Union, for example, a new Medical Device Regulation was published in 2017 which, when it enters into full force in 2020, will include significant additional premarket and post-market requirements. Penalties for regulatory non-compliance could be severe, including fines and revocation or suspension of a company’s business license, mandatory price reductions and criminal sanctions. Future laws and regulations may have a material adverse effect on us.

Our failure to comply with laws and regulations relating to reimbursement of health care goods and services may subject us to penalties and adversely impact our reputation, business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

Our devices, products and therapies are purchased principally by hospitals or physicians that typically bill various third-party payers, such as governmental health care programs (e.g., Medicare, Medicaid and comparable non-U.S. programs), private insurance plans and managed care plans, for the healthcare services provided to their patients. The ability of our customers to obtain appropriate reimbursement for products and services from third-party payers is critical because it affects which products customers purchase and the prices they are willing to pay. As a result, our devices, products and therapies are subject to regulation regarding quality and cost by HHS, including the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), as well as comparable state and non-U.S. agencies responsible for reimbursement and regulation of health care goods and services, including laws and regulations related to kickbacks, false claims, self-referrals and health care fraud. Many states have similar laws that apply to reimbursement by state Medicaid and other funded programs as well as in some cases to all payers. In certain circumstances, insurance companies attempt to bring a private cause of action against a manufacturer for causing false claims. In addition, as a manufacturer of U.S. FDA-approved devices reimbursable by federal healthcare programs, we are subject to the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires us to annually report certain payments and other transfers of value we make to U.S.-licensed physicians or U.S. teaching hospitals. Any failure to comply with these laws and regulations could subject us or our officers and employees to criminal and civil financial penalties.

We are also subject to risks relating to changes in government and private medical reimbursement programs and policies, and changes in legal regulatory requirements in the U.S. and around the world. Implementation of further legislative or administrative reforms to these reimbursement systems, or adverse decisions relating to coverage of or reimbursement for our products by administrators of these systems, could have an impact on the acceptance of and demand for our products and the prices that our customers are willing to pay for them.

We are substantially dependent on patent and other proprietary rights and failing to protect such rights or to be successful in litigation related to our rights or the rights of others may result in our payment of significant monetary damages and/or royalty payments, negatively impact our ability to sell current or future products, or prohibit us from enforcing our patent and other proprietary rights against others.

We are substantially dependent on patent and other proprietary rights and rely on a combination of patents, trade secrets, and non-disclosure and non-competition agreements to protect our proprietary intellectual property. We also operate in an industry characterized by extensive patent litigation. Patent litigation can result in significant damage awards and injunctions that could prevent our manufacture and sale of affected products or require us to pay significant royalties in order to continue to manufacture or sell affected products. At any given time, we are generally involved as both a plaintiff and a defendant in a number of patent infringement actions, the outcomes of which may not be known for prolonged periods of time. While it is not possible to predict the outcome of patent litigation, it is possible that the results of such litigation could require us to pay significant monetary damages and/or royalty payments, negatively impact our ability to sell current or future products, or prohibit us from enforcing our patent and proprietary rights against others, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.

While we intend to defend against any threats to our intellectual property, our patents, trade secrets or other agreements may not adequately protect our intellectual property. Further, pending patent applications may not result in patents being issued to us, patents issued to or licensed by us may be challenged or circumvented by competitors and such patents may be found invalid, unenforceable or insufficiently broad to protect our technology or provide us with any competitive advantage. Third parties could obtain patents that may require us to negotiate licenses to conduct our business, and these licenses may not be available on reasonable terms or at all. We also rely on non-disclosure and non-competition agreements with certain employees, consultants and other parties to protect, in part, trade secrets and other proprietary rights. We cannot be certain that these agreements will not be breached, that we will have adequate remedies for any breach, that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information, or that third parties will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or proprietary knowledge.

In addition, the laws of certain countries in which we market some of our products do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S., which could make it easier for competitors to capture market position in those countries. Competitors also may harm our sales by designing products that mirror the capabilities of our products or technology without infringing our intellectual property rights. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property in these countries, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.



Quality problems and product liability claims could lead to recalls or safety alerts, reputational harm, adverse verdicts or costly settlements, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

Quality is extremely important to us and our customers due to the serious and costly consequences of product failure, and our business exposes us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design, manufacture, and marketing of medical devices. In addition, many of our products are often used in intensive care settings with seriously ill patients and some of the medical devices we manufacture and sell are designed to be implanted in the human body for long periods of time or indefinitely. Component failures, manufacturing nonconformances, design defects, off-label use, or inadequate disclosure of product-related risks or product-related information with respect to our products, if they were to occur, could result in an unsafe condition or injury to, or death of, a patient. These problems could lead to recall of, or issuance of a safety alert relating to, our products, and could result in product liability claims and lawsuits, including class actions, which could ultimately result, in certain cases, in the removal from the body of such products and claims regarding costs associated therewith. Due to the strong name recognition of the Medtronic and Covidien brands, a material adverse event involving one of our products could result in reduced market acceptance and demand for all products within that brand, and could harm our reputation and ability to market products in the future.

Strong product quality is critical to the success of our goods and services. If we fall short of these standards and our products are the subject of recalls or safety alerts, our reputation could be damaged, we could lose customers and our revenue and results of operations could decline. Our success also can depend on our ability to manufacture to exact specification precision-engineered components, subassemblies and finished devices from multiple materials. If our components fail to meet these standards or fail to adapt to evolving standards, our reputation, competitive advantage and market share could be harmed. In certain situations, we may undertake a voluntary recall of products or temporarily shut down production lines based on performance relative to our own internal safety and quality monitoring and testing data.

Any of the foregoing problems, including future product liability claims or recalls, regardless of their ultimate outcome, could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

Our research and development efforts rely upon investments and investment collaborations, and we cannot guarantee that any previous or future investments or investment collaborations will be successful.

Our mission is to provide a broad range of therapies to restore patients to fuller, healthier lives, which requires a wide variety of technologies, products and capabilities. The rapid pace of technological development in the medical industry and the specialized expertise required in different areas of medicine make it difficult for one company alone to develop a broad portfolio of technological solutions. In addition to internally generated growth through our research and development efforts, historically we have relied, and expect to continue to rely, upon investments and investment collaborations to provide us access to new technologies both in areas served by our existing businesses as well as in new areas.

We expect to make future investments where we believe that we can stimulate the development or acquisition of new technologies and products to further our strategic objectives and strengthen our existing businesses. Investments and investment collaborations in and with medical technology companies are inherently risky, and we cannot guarantee that any of our previous or future investments or investment collaborations will be successful or will not materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

Health care policy changes may have a material adverse effect on us.

In response to perceived increases in health care costs in recent years, there have been and continue to be proposals by the federal government, state governments, regulators and third-party payers to control these costs and, more generally, to reform the health care system, including U.S. health care reform legislation. Certain of these proposals could, among other things, limit the prices we are able to charge for our products or the amounts of reimbursement available for our products and could limit the acceptance and availability of our products. The adoption of some or all of these proposals could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

Our insurance program may not be adequate to cover future losses.

We have elected to self-insure most of our insurable risks across the Company, and we made this decision based on cost and availability factors in the insurance marketplace. We manage and maintain a portion of our self-insured program through a wholly-owned captive insurance company. We continue to maintain a directors and officers liability insurance policy with third-party insurers that provides coverage for the directors and officers of the Company. We continue to monitor the insurance marketplace to evaluate the value of obtaining insurance coverage for other categories of losses in the future. Although we believe, based on historical loss trends, that our self-insurance program accruals and our existing insurance coverage will be adequate to cover future losses, historical trends may not be indicative of future losses. The absence of third-party insurance coverage for other categories of losses increases our exposure to unanticipated claims and these losses could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.



If we experience decreasing prices for our goods and services and we are unable to reduce our expenses, there may be a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

We have experienced, and may continue to experience, decreasing prices for our goods and services due to pricing pressure from managed care organizations and other third-party payers on our customers, increased market power of our customers as the medical device industry consolidates and increased competition among medical engineering and manufacturing services providers. If the prices for our goods and services decrease and we are unable to reduce our expenses, our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows will be adversely affected.

We are subject to a variety of risks associated with global operations that could adversely affect our profitability and operating results.

We develop, manufacture, distribute and sell our products globally. Operations in countries outside of the U.S. are accompanied by certain risks. We intend to continue to expand our operations and to pursue growth opportunities outside the U.S., especially in emerging markets, which could expose us to additional and greater risks. Our profitability and global operations are, and will continue to be, subject to a number of risks and potential costs, including:

•

fluctuations in currency exchange rates,

•

healthcare reform legislation,

•

the need to comply with different regulatory regimes worldwide that are subject to change and that could restrict our ability to manufacture and sell our products,

•

local product preferences and product requirements,

•

longer-term receivables than are typical in the U.S.,

•

trade protection measures, tariffs and other border taxes, and import or export licensing requirements,

•

less intellectual property protection in some countries outside the U.S. than exists in the U.S.,

•

different labor regulations and workforce instability,

•

political and economic instability,

•

the expiration and non-renewal of foreign tax rulings and/or grants,

•

potentially negative consequences from changes in or interpretations of tax laws, and

•

economic instability and inflation, recession or interest rate fluctuations.

On June 23, 2016, the U.K. held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the E.U., commonly referred to as “Brexit”.  As a result of the referendum, the British government began negotiations with the E.U. on the terms of the U.K.’s future relationship with the E.U. Brexit was due to take place on March 29, 2019, however, the inability to agree on the exact terms of the future relationship have delayed Brexit and led to continued uncertainty about Brexit’s potential impacts on the Company. It is possible that as a result of Brexit there will be greater restrictions on imports and exports between the U.K. and E.U. countries and increased regulatory complexities that could adversely impact the Company. Similarly, from time to time proposals are made in the U.S. to significantly change existing trade agreements and relationships between the U.S. and other countries, although we cannot currently predict whether or how these changes will be implemented over time. Changes to global trade policy, including between the U.S. and other countries such as China and Mexico, may adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

In addition, a significant amount of our trade receivables are with national health care systems in many countries. Repayment of these receivables is dependent upon the political and financial stability of those countries. In light of these global economic fluctuations, we continue to monitor the creditworthiness of customers. Failure to receive payment of all or a significant portion of these receivables could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

Finally, changes in currency exchange rates may impact the reported value of our revenues, expenses, and cash flows. We cannot predict changes in currency exchange rates, the impact of exchange rate changes, nor the degree to which we will be able to manage the impact of currency exchange rate changes.

The failure to comply with anti-corruption laws could materially adversely affect our business and result in civil and/or criminal sanctions.

The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), the Irish Criminal Justice (Corruption Offences) Act 2018, and similar anti-corruption laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Because of the predominance of government-administered healthcare systems in many jurisdictions around the world, many of our customer relationships outside of the U.S. are with governmental entities and are therefore potentially subject to such laws. We also participate in public-private partnerships and other commercial and policy arrangements with governments around the globe.



Global enforcement of anti-corruption laws has increased in recent years, with more frequent voluntary self-disclosures by companies, aggressive investigations and enforcement proceedings by U.S. and non-U.S. governmental agencies, and assessment of significant fines and penalties against companies and individuals. Our international operations create the risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by one of our employees, consultants, sales agents, or distributors. It is our policy to implement safeguards to educate our employees and agents on these legal requirements and prohibit improper practices. However, existing safeguards and any future improvements may not always be effective, and our employees, consultants, sales agents or distributors may engage in conduct for which we could be held responsible. In addition, the government may seek to hold us liable for FCPA violations committed by companies in which we invest or that we acquire. Any alleged or actual violations of these regulations may subject us to government scrutiny, criminal or civil sanctions and other liabilities, including exclusion from government contracting, and could disrupt our business, adversely affect our reputation and result in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

Laws and regulations governing international business operations could adversely impact our business.

The U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), and the Bureau of Industry and Security at the U.S. Department of Commerce (BIS), administer certain laws and regulations that restrict U.S. persons and, in some instances, non-U.S. persons, in conducting activities, transacting business with or making investments in certain countries, governments, entities and individuals subject to U.S. economic sanctions. Our international operations subject us to these laws and regulations, which are complex, restrict our business dealings with certain countries and individuals, and are constantly changing. Further restrictions may be enacted, amended, enforced or interpreted in a manner that materially impacts our operations.

From time to time, certain of our subsidiaries have limited business dealings in countries subject to comprehensive sanctions, including Iran, Sudan, Syria, Cuba and the region of Crimea. Certain of our subsidiaries sell medical devices, and may provide related services, to distributors and other purchasing bodies in such countries. These business dealings represent an insignificant amount of our consolidated revenues and income, but expose us to a heightened risk of violating applicable sanctions regulations. Violations of these regulations are punishable by civil penalties, including fines, denial of export privileges, injunctions, asset seizures, debarment from government contracts and revocations or restrictions of licenses, as well as criminal fines and imprisonment. We have established policies and procedures designed to assist with our compliance with such laws and regulations. However, there can be no assurance that our policies and procedures will prevent us from violating these regulations in every transaction in which we may engage, and such a violation could adversely affect our reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Consolidation in the health care industry could have an adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations.

Many health care industry companies, including health care systems, distributors, manufacturers, providers, and insurers, are consolidating or have formed strategic alliances. As the health care industry consolidates, competition to provide goods and services to industry participants will become more intense. Further, this consolidation creates larger enterprises with greater negotiating power, which they can use to negotiate price concessions. If we must reduce our prices because of industry consolidation, or if we lose customers as a result of consolidation, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.

Health care industry cost-containment measures could result in reduced sales of our medical devices and medical device components.

Most of our customers, and the health care providers to whom our customers supply medical devices, rely on third-party payers, including government programs and private health insurance plans, to reimburse some or all of the cost of the procedures in which medical devices that incorporate components we manufacture or assemble are used. The continuing efforts of governmental authorities, insurance companies and other payers of health care costs to contain or reduce these costs could lead to patients being unable to obtain approval for payment from these third-party payers. If third-party payer payment approval cannot be obtained by patients, sales of finished medical devices that include our components may decline significantly and our customers may reduce or eliminate purchases of our components. The cost-containment measures that health care providers are instituting, both in the U.S. and outside of the U.S., could harm our ability to operate profitably. For example, managed care organizations have successfully negotiated volume discounts for pharmaceuticals, and GPOs and IDNs have also concentrated purchasing decisions for some customers, which has led to downward pricing pressure for medical device companies, including us.

We are subject to environmental laws and regulations and the risk of environmental liabilities, violations and litigation.

We are subject to numerous U.S. federal, state, local and non-U.S. environmental, health and safety laws and regulations concerning, among other things, the health and safety of our employees, the generation, storage, use and transportation of hazardous materials, emissions or discharges of substances into the environment, investigation and remediation of hazardous substances or materials at various sites, chemical constituents in medical products and end-of-life disposal and take-back programs for medical devices. Our operations and those of certain third-party suppliers involve the use of substances subject to these laws and regulations,



primarily those used in manufacturing and sterilization processes. If we or our suppliers violate these environmental laws and regulations, facilities could be shut down and violators could be fined, criminally charged or otherwise sanctioned. Furthermore, environmental laws outside of the U.S. are becoming more stringent, resulting in increased costs and compliance burdens.

In addition, certain environmental laws assess liability on current or previous owners or operators of real property for the costs of investigation, removal or remediation of hazardous substances or materials at their properties or at properties which they have disposed of hazardous substances. In addition to cleanup actions brought by governmental authorities, private parties could bring personal injury or other claims due to the presence of, or exposure to, hazardous substances. The ultimate cost of site cleanup and timing of future cash outflows is difficult to predict, given the uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup, the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations, and alternative cleanup methods.

The costs of complying with current or future environmental protection and health and safety laws and regulations, or liabilities arising from past or future releases of, or exposures to, hazardous substances, may exceed our estimates, or have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.

The continuing development of many of our products depends upon us maintaining strong relationships with health care professionals.

If we fail to maintain our working relationships with health care professionals, many of our products may not be developed and marketed in line with the needs and expectations of the professionals who use and support our products, which could cause a decline in our earnings and profitability. The research, development, marketing and sales of many of our new and improved products depends on our maintaining working relationships with health care professionals. We rely on these professionals to provide us with considerable knowledge and experience regarding the development, marketing and sale of our products. Physicians assist us as researchers, marketing and product consultants, inventors and public speakers. If we are unable to maintain strong relationships with these professionals, the development and marketing of our products could suffer, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

We rely on the proper function, security and availability of our information technology systems and data to operate our business, and a breach, cyber-attack or other disruption to these systems or data could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, reputation or competitive position

.

We are increasingly dependent on sophisticated information technology systems to operate our business, including to process, transmit and store sensitive data, and many of our products and services include integrated software and information technology that collects data regarding patients or connects to our systems. Like other large multi-national corporations, we could experience, and in the past have experienced, attempted or actual interference with the integrity of, and interruptions in, our technology systems, as well as data breaches, such as cyber-attacks, malicious intrusions, breakdowns, interference with the integrity of our products and data or other significant disruptions. Furthermore, we rely on third-party vendors to supply and/or support certain aspects of our information technology systems. These third-party systems could also become vulnerable to cyber-attack, malicious intrusions, breakdowns, interference or other significant disruptions, and may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could result in system disruption or compromise the information security of our own systems. In addition, we continue to grow in part through new business acquisitions and, as a result, may face risks associated with defects and vulnerabilities in their systems, or difficulties or other breakdowns or disruptions in connection with the integration of the acquisitions into our information technology systems.

Our worldwide operations mean that we are subject to laws and regulations, including data protection and cybersecurity laws and regulations, in many jurisdictions. The variety of U.S. and international privacy and cybersecurity laws and regulations impacting our operations are described in “Item 1. Business" -

Other Factors Impacting Our Operations - Data Privacy and Security Laws and Regulations

. For example, GDPR requires us to manage personal data in the E.U. and may impose fines of up to four percent of our global revenue in the event of certain violations. Furthermore, there has been a developing trend of civil lawsuits and class actions relating to breaches of consumer data held by large companies or incidents arising from other cyber-attacks. Any data security breaches, cyber-attacks, malicious intrusions or significant disruptions could result in actions by regulatory bodies and/or civil litigation, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, reputation or competitive position.

In addition, our information technology systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain, protect, and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology, evolving legal and regulatory standards, the increasing need to protect patient and customer information, changes in the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to data and information systems, and the information technology needs associated with our changing products and services. There can be no assurance that our process of consolidating, protecting, upgrading and expanding our systems and capabilities, continuing to build security into the design of our products, and developing new systems to keep



pace with continuing changes in information processing technology will be successful or that additional systems issues will not arise in the future.

If our information technology systems, products or services or sensitive data are compromised, patients or employees could be exposed to financial or medical identity theft or suffer a loss of product functionality, and we could lose existing customers, have difficulty attracting new customers, have difficulty preventing, detecting, and controlling fraud, be exposed to the loss or misuse of confidential information, have disputes with customers, physicians, and other health care professionals, suffer regulatory sanctions or penalties under federal laws, state laws, or the laws of other jurisdictions, experience increases in operating expenses or an impairment in our ability to conduct our operations, incur expenses or lose revenues as a result of a data privacy breach, product failure, information technology outages or disruptions, or suffer other adverse consequences including lawsuits or other legal action and damage to our reputation.

Our substantial leverage and debt service obligations could adversely affect our business.

At April 26, 2019, we had approximately

$0.8 billion

of current debt obligations and

$24.5 billion

of long-term debt outstanding. We may also incur additional indebtedness in the future. Our substantial indebtedness could have adverse consequences, including:

•

making it more difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations,

•

increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic, regulatory and industry conditions, and placing us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors that are less leveraged,

•

limiting our ability to compete and our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate,

•

limiting our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes, and

•

exposing us to greater interest rate risk since the interest rate on borrowings under our floating rate notes and revolving credit facility is variable.

Our debt service obligations require us to use a portion of our operating cash flow to pay interest and principal on indebtedness instead of for other corporate purposes, including funding future expansion of our business, acquisitions, and ongoing capital expenditures, which could impede our growth. If our operating cash flow and capital resources are insufficient to service our debt obligations, we may be forced to sell assets, seek additional equity or debt financing or restructure our debt, which could harm our long-term business prospects. Our failure to comply with the terms of our revolving credit facility and other indebtedness could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of all of our debt.

Failure to integrate acquired businesses into our operations successfully could adversely affect our business.

As part of our strategy to develop and identify new products and technologies, we have made several significant acquisitions in recent years, and may make additional acquisitions in the future. Our integration of the operations of acquired businesses requires significant efforts, including the coordination of information technologies, research and development, sales and marketing, operations, manufacturing, and finance. These efforts result in additional expenses and involve significant amounts of management’s time that cannot then be dedicated to other projects. Our failure to manage and coordinate the growth of acquired companies successfully could also have an adverse impact on our business. In addition, we cannot be certain that the businesses we acquire will become profitable or remain so. Factors that will affect the success of our acquisitions include:

•

the presence or absence of adequate internal controls and/or significant fraud in the financial systems of acquired companies,

•

our ability or inability to integrate information technology systems of acquired companies in a secure and reliable manner,

•

adverse developments arising out of investigations by governmental entities of the business practices of acquired companies, including potential FCPA liability,

•

any decrease in customer loyalty and product orders caused by dissatisfaction with the combined companies’ product lines and sales and marketing practices, including price increases,

•

our ability to retain key employees, and

•

the ability to achieve synergies among acquired companies, such as increasing sales of the integrated company’s products, achieving cost savings, and effectively combining technologies to develop new products.

We also could experience negative effects on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows from acquisition-related charges, amortization of intangible assets and asset impairment charges. These effects, individually or in the aggregate, could cause a deterioration of our credit rating and result in increased borrowing costs and interest expense.



Changes in tax laws or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could have a material impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

We are subject to income taxes, as well as non-income based taxes, in the U.S., Ireland, and various other jurisdictions in which we operate. The tax laws in the U.S., Ireland and other countries in which we and our affiliates do business could change on a prospective or retroactive basis, and any such changes could materially adversely affect our business and our effective tax rate. For example, on December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted comprehensive tax legislation, commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "Tax Act"), which resulted in a significant charge to tax expense during our fiscal year 2018 associated with the U.S. taxation of accumulated foreign earnings as well as the requirement to revalue U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from the reduction in the U.S. corporate tax rate. The U.S. Treasury is expected to issue additional subsequent guidance and interpretation of the Tax Act. This guidance could have a material impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. In addition, the government in Switzerland is currently considering tax reform legislation, the results of which could have a material impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.

In 2013, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) published an action plan called Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) with a view to tackling perceived tax abuse and inconsistency between taxing authorities and their approach to International tax matters. The final BEPS Action report was published in October 2015 and subsequently many taxing authorities have adopted the guidelines provided within their local laws. The EU expanded upon these guidelines with Anti-Tax Avoidance Directives (ATAD 1 and 2) to be applied by all its member states by 2020. We continue to monitor any and all changes to local country legislation resulting from this guidance. One specific change is a requirement for increased disclosures of financial information on a local and global basis. This information could lead to disagreements between jurisdictions associated with the proper allocation of profits between such jurisdictions.

We are subject to ongoing tax audits in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken and assess additional taxes. We regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision. However, there can be no assurance that we will accurately predict the outcomes of these audits, and the actual outcomes of these audits could have a material impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.

We have recorded reserves for potential payments of tax to various tax authorities related to uncertain tax positions. However, the calculation of such tax liabilities involves the application of complex tax regulations in many jurisdictions. Therefore, any dispute with a tax authority may result in a payment that is significantly different from current estimates. If payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts, the reversal of the liabilities generally would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. If our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the amount for which it is ultimately liable, we would incur additional charges, and such charges could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.

The Medtronic, Inc. tax court proceeding outcome could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition.

In March 2009, the IRS issued its audit report for Medtronic Inc. for fiscal years 2005 and 2006. Medtronic, Inc. reached agreements with the IRS on some, but not all matters related to these fiscal years. The remaining unresolved issue for fiscal years 2005 and 2006 relates to the allocation of income between Medtronic, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiary operating in Puerto Rico, which is one of our key manufacturing sites. An adverse outcome in this matter could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.  See Note


to the consolidated financial statements in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Future potential changes to the U.S. tax laws could result in us being treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal tax purposes, and the IRS may not agree with the conclusion that we should be treated as a foreign corporation for U.S federal income tax purposes.

Because Medtronic plc is organized under the laws of Ireland, we would generally be classified as a foreign corporation under the general rule that a corporation is considered tax resident in the jurisdiction of its organization or incorporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Even so, the IRS may assert that we should be treated as a U.S. corporation (and, therefore, a U.S. tax resident) for U.S. federal income tax purposes pursuant to Section 7874 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code).

Under Section 7874 of the Code, if Medtronic Inc.’s shareholders immediately prior to the Covidien transaction held 80% or more of the vote or value of our shares by reason of holding stock in Medtronic, Inc. immediately after the transaction (the ownership test), and our expanded affiliated group after the transaction did not have substantial business activities in Ireland relative to its worldwide activities (the substantial business activities test), we would have been treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Based on the rules for determining share ownership under Section 7874 of the Code, Medtronic, Inc.’s



shareholders received approximately 70% of our ordinary shares (by both vote and value) by reason of holding stock in Medtronic, Inc. Therefore, under current law, Medtronic plc should not be treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. However, there is limited guidance regarding the application of Section 7874, including the application of the ownership test. If we were to be treated as a U.S. corporation for federal tax purposes, we could be subject to substantially greater U.S. tax liability than currently contemplated as a non-U.S. corporation.

Legislative or other governmental action relating to the denial of U.S. federal or state governmental contracts to U.S. companies that redomicile abroad could adversely affect our business.

Various U.S. federal and state legislative proposals that would deny governmental contracts to U.S. companies that move their corporate location abroad may affect us. We are unable to predict the likelihood that, or final form in which, any such proposed legislation might become law, the nature of the regulations that may be promulgated under any future legislative enactments, or the effect such enactments and increased regulatory scrutiny may have on our business.

Risks Relating to Our Jurisdiction of Incorporation

We are incorporated in Ireland, and Irish law differs from the laws in effect in the U.S. and may afford less protection to holders of our securities.

Our shareholders may have more difficulty protecting their interests than would shareholders of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the United States. It may not be possible to enforce court judgments obtained in the U.S. against us in Ireland based on the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal or state securities laws. In addition, there is some uncertainty as to whether the courts of Ireland would recognize or enforce judgments of U.S. courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on the civil liabilities provisions of the U.S. federal or state securities laws or hear actions against us or those persons based on those laws. We have been advised that the U.S. currently does not have a treaty with Ireland providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters. Therefore, a final judgment for the payment of money rendered by any U.S. federal or state court based on civil liability, whether or not based solely on U.S. federal or state securities laws, would not automatically be enforceable in Ireland.

As an Irish company, we are governed by the Irish Companies Act 2014, which differs in some material respects from laws generally applicable to U.S. corporations and shareholders, including, among others, differences relating to interested director and officer transactions and shareholder lawsuits. Likewise, the duties of directors and officers of an Irish company generally are owed to the company only. Shareholders of Irish companies generally do not have a personal right of action against directors or officers of the company and may exercise such rights of action on behalf of the company only in limited circumstances. Accordingly, holders of our securities may have more difficulty protecting their interests than would holders of securities of a corporation incorporated in the U.S.

As an Irish public limited company, certain capital structure decisions require shareholder approval, which may limit Medtronic’s flexibility to manage its capital structure.

Under Irish law, our authorized share capital can be increased by an ordinary resolution of our shareholders and the directors may issue new ordinary or preferred shares up to a maximum amount equal to the authorized but unissued share capital, without shareholder approval, once authorized to do so by our articles of association or by an ordinary resolution of our shareholders. Additionally, subject to specified exceptions, Irish law grants statutory preemption rights to existing shareholders where shares are being issued for cash consideration but allows shareholders to disapply such statutory preemption rights either in our articles of association or by way of special resolution. Such disapplication can either be generally applicable or be in respect of a particular allotment of shares. Accordingly, our articles of association contain, as permitted by Irish company law, provisions authorizing the board to issue new shares, and to disapply statutory preemption rights. The authorization of the directors to issue shares and the disapplication of statutory preemption rights must both be renewed by the shareholders at least every five years, and our current authorizations are due to expire in January 2020. We anticipate seeking new authorizations at our 2019 Annual General Meeting and in subsequent years. We cannot provide any assurance that these authorizations will always be approved, which could limit our ability to issue equity and thereby adversely affect the holders of our securities.

A transfer of our shares, other than ones effected by means of the transfer of book-entry interests in the Depository Trust Company, may be subject to Irish stamp duty.

Transfers of our shares effected by means of the transfer of book entry interests in the Depository Trust Company (DTC) will not be subject to Irish stamp duty. However, if a shareholder holds our shares directly rather than beneficially through DTC, any transfer of shares could be subject to Irish stamp duty (currently at the rate of 1% of the higher of the price paid or the market value of the shares acquired). Payment of Irish stamp duty is generally a legal obligation of the transferee. The potential for stamp duty could adversely affect the price of shares.



In certain limited circumstances, dividends we pay may be subject to Irish dividend withholding tax and dividends received by Irish residents and certain other shareholders may be subject to Irish income tax.

In certain limited circumstances, dividend withholding tax (currently at a rate of 20%) may arise in respect of dividends paid on our shares. A number of exemptions from dividend withholding tax exist such that shareholders resident in the U.S. and other specified countries that have a tax treaty with Ireland may be entitled to exemptions from dividend withholding tax.

Shareholders resident in the U.S. that hold their shares through DTC will not be subject to dividend withholding tax, provided the addresses of the beneficial owners of such shares in the records of the brokers holding such shares are recorded as being in the U.S. (and such brokers have further transmitted the relevant information to a qualifying intermediary appointed by us). However, other shareholders may be subject to dividend withholding tax, which could adversely affect the price of their shares.

Shareholders entitled to an exemption from Irish dividend withholding tax on dividends received from us will not be subject to Irish income tax in respect of those dividends unless they have some connection with Ireland other than their shareholding in our Company (for example, they are resident in Ireland). Shareholders who receive dividends subject to Irish dividend withholding tax generally have no further liability to Irish income tax on those dividends.

Our shares received by means of a gift or inheritance could be subject to Irish capital acquisitions tax.

Irish capital acquisitions tax (CAT) could apply to a gift or inheritance of our shares irrespective of the place of residence, ordinary residence or domicile of the parties. This is because our shares will be regarded as property situated in Ireland. The person who receives the gift or inheritance has primary liability for CAT. Gifts and inheritances passing between spouses are exempt from CAT. Children have a tax-free threshold which Irish Revenue typically updates annually in respect of taxable gifts or inheritances received from their parents.

PART II

Item 5. Market for Medtronic’s Common Equity, Related Shareholder Matters, and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities

The Company’s ordinary shares are listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “MDT.”

The following table provides information about the shares repurchased by the Company during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019:

In June 2017, the Company's Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of $5.0 billion of the Company’s ordinary shares. This authorization replaced the previous June 2015 repurchase authorization to redeem up to an aggregate number of ordinary shares. In March 2019, the Company's Board of Directors authorized an incremental $6.0 billion for repurchase of the Company's ordinary shares. There is no specific time-period associated with these repurchase authorizations.

On June 18, 2019, there were approximately 25,797 shareholders of record of the Company’s ordinary shares. Ordinary cash dividends declared and paid totaled 50.0 cents per share for each quarter of fiscal year


and 46.0 cents per share for each quarter of fiscal year


.



Stock Performance Graph

The following graph compares the cumulative total shareholder return on Medtronic’s ordinary shares with the cumulative total shareholder return on the Standard & Poor’s (S&P) 500 Index and the S&P 500 Health Care Equipment Index for the last five fiscal years. The graph assumes that $100 was invested at market close on April 25, 2014 in Medtronic’s ordinary shares, the S&P 500 Index, and the S&P 500 Health Care Equipment Index and that all dividends were reinvested.

Irish Restrictions on Import and Export of Capital

Except as indicated below, there are no restrictions on non-residents of Ireland dealing in Irish domestic securities, which includes ordinary shares of Irish companies. Except as indicated below, dividends and redemption proceeds also continue to be freely transferable to non-resident holders of such securities. The Financial Transfers Act, 1992, provides that the Irish Minister for Finance can make provision for the restriction of financial transfers between Ireland and other countries. For the purposes of this Act, “financial transfers” include all transfers which would be movements of capital or payments within the meaning of the treaties governing the E.U. if they had been made between Member States of the E.U. This Act has been used by the Minister for Finance to implement European Council Directives, which provide for the restriction of financial transfers to certain countries, organizations and people including the Al-Qaeda network and the Taliban, Afghanistan, Belarus, Burma (Myanmar), Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, Democratic Republic of Congo, Egypt, Eritrea, Iran, Iraq, Ivory Coast, Lebanon, Liberia, Libya, Republic of Guinea, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, Tunisia, Ukraine and Zimbabwe.



Any transfer of, or payment in respect of, a share or interest in a share involving the government of any country that is currently the subject of United Nations sanctions, any person or body controlled by any of the foregoing, or by any person acting on behalf of the foregoing, may be subject to restrictions pursuant to such sanctions as implemented into Irish law.

Irish Taxes Applicable to U.S. Holders

Dividends paid by Medtronic will generally be subject to Irish dividend withholding tax at the standard rate of income tax (currently 20 percent) unless an exemption applies.

Dividends paid to U.S. residents will not be subject to Irish dividend withholding tax provided that:

•

in the case of a beneficial owner of Medtronic shares held in the Depository Trust Company (DTC), the address of the beneficial owner in the records of his or her broker is in the United States and this information is provided by the broker to the Company’s qualifying intermediary; or

•

in the case of a record owner, the record owner has provided to the Company’s transfer agent a valid U.S. Certification of Residence (Form 6166) or valid Irish Non-Resident Form V2.

Irish income tax may also arise with respect to dividends paid on Medtronic’s ordinary shares. A U.S. resident who meets one of the exemptions from dividend withholding tax described above and who does not hold Medtronic shares through a branch or agency in Ireland through which a trade is carried on generally will not have any Irish income tax liability on a dividend paid by Medtronic. In addition, if a U.S. shareholder is subject to the dividend withholding tax, the withholding payment discharges any Irish income tax liability, provided the shareholder furnishes to the Irish Revenue authorities a statement of the dividend withholding tax imposed.

While the U.S./Ireland Double Tax Treaty contains provisions regarding withholding, due to the wide scope of the exemptions from dividend withholding tax available under Irish domestic law, it would generally be unnecessary for a U.S. resident shareholder to rely on the treaty provisions.



Item 6. Selected Financial Data

Our fiscal year-end is the last Friday in April, and therefore, the total weeks in a fiscal year fluctuates between 52 and 53 weeks. Fiscal years 2019, 2018, 2017, and 2015 were 52-week years. Fiscal year 2016 was a 53-week year, with the additional week occurring in the first quarter. The table below illustrates operating results and other selected financial data for fiscal years 2015 to 2019. Certain reclassifications have been made to prior year selected financial data to conform to classifications used in the current year.

(1)

Covidien plc was acquired on January 26, 2015. As such, for the fiscal year ended April 24, 2015, the results of operations of Covidien are reflected in Medtronic’s results of operations for only the fourth quarter due to the timing of the acquisition, which affects comparability.



Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

The following discussion and analysis provides information management believes to be relevant to understanding the financial condition and results of operations of the Company. You should read this discussion and analysis along with our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto at

April 26, 2019

and

April 27, 2018

and for each of the three fiscal years ended

April 26, 2019

(fiscal year 2019),

April 27, 2018

(fiscal year 2018), and

April 28, 2017

(fiscal year


), which are presented within "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Throughout this Management’s Discussion and Analysis, we present certain financial measures that we use to evaluate the operational performance of the Company and as a basis for strategic planning; however, such financial measures are not presented in our financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (U.S. GAAP). These financial measures are considered "non-GAAP financial measures" and are intended to supplement, and should not be considered as superior to, financial measures presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We generally use non-GAAP financial measures to facilitate management's review of the operational performance of the Company and as a basis for strategic planning. We believe that non-GAAP financial measures provide information useful to investors in understanding the Company's underlying operational performance and trends and may facilitate comparisons with the performance of other companies in the medical technologies industry.

As presented in the GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliations section below, our non-GAAP financial measures exclude the impact of certain charges or gains that contribute to or reduce earnings and that may affect financial trends, and include certain charges or benefits that result from transactions or events that we believe may or may not recur with similar materiality or impact to our operations in future periods (Non-GAAP Adjustments).

In the event there is a Non-GAAP Adjustment recognized in our operating results, the tax cost or benefit attributable to that item is separately calculated and reported. Because the effective rate can be significantly impacted by the Non-GAAP Adjustments that take place during the period, we often refer to our tax rate using both the effective rate and the non-GAAP nominal tax rate (Non-GAAP Nominal Tax Rate). The Non-GAAP Nominal Tax Rate is calculated as the income tax provision, adjusted for the impact of Non-GAAP Adjustments, as a percentage of income before income taxes, excluding Non-GAAP Adjustments.

Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure calculated by subtracting property, plant, and equipment additions from operating cash flows.

Refer to the “GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliations," "Income Taxes," and "Free Cash Flow" sections for reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

EXECUTIVE LEVEL OVERVIEW

Medtronic is among the world's largest medical technology, services, and solutions companies - alleviating pain, restoring health, and extending life for millions of people around the world. Our primary products include those for cardiac rhythm disorders, cardiovascular disease, advanced and general surgical care, respiratory and monitoring solutions, renal care, neurological disorders, spinal conditions and musculoskeletal trauma, urological and digestive disorders, and ear, nose, and throat and diabetes conditions.

The table below presents net income attributable to Medtronic and diluted earnings per share for fiscal years


,


, and


:

The increase in net income attributable to Medtronic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) for fiscal year


as compared to fiscal year


was primarily attributable to the $2.4 billion tax charge recognized during fiscal year 2018 related to the enactment of U.S. comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "Tax Act"). Further contributing to the increases was a reduction in other operating expense, net, and an increase in other non-operating income, net. These items were partially offset by the $697 million gain on the sale of our Patient Care, Deep Vein Thrombosis, and Nutritional Insufficiency businesses within the Minimally Invasive Therapies Group on July 29, 2017 (the "Divestiture") in fiscal year 2018, along with increases in interest expense and restructuring and associated costs.

The decrease in net income attributable to Medtronic and diluted EPS for fiscal year 2018 as compared to fiscal year 2017 was unfavorably affected by the aforementioned $2.4 billion tax charge related to the Tax Act, along with the impacts of the Divestiture;



net sales of the divested businesses for fiscal years 2018 and 2017 were $0.6 billion and $2.4 billion, respectively. For fiscal year 2018, decreases in net income attributable to Medtronic and diluted EPS were partially offset by a $697 million gain on the Divestiture.

Net sales increases in the U.S. for fiscal year


as compared to fiscal year


were primarily attributable to strong growth in our Restorative Therapies Group and Diabetes Group, partially offset by the impact of the Divestiture within the Minimally Invasive Therapies Group. Net sales remained flat in non-U.S. developed markets for fiscal year


, reflecting consistent growth across our segments in Japan and Korea, partially offset by declines in Australia. Net sales growth in emerging markets continues to reflect our broad diversification and was driven by strong performance in China, the Middle East & Africa, Eastern Europe, and both South and Southeast Asia. Currency had an unfavorable impact on net sales in non-U.S. developed markets and emerging markets of $205 million and $250 million, respectively, for fiscal year


.

Net sales declines in the U.S. for fiscal year


as compared to fiscal year 2017 were primarily attributable to the Divestiture within the Minimally Invasive Therapies Group, partially offset by growth in our other segments. Net sales growth in non-U.S.



developed markets was led by strong performance in Western Europe. Net sales growth in emerging markets continues to reflect our broad diversification and was driven by strong performance in all of our segments, with strong performance in China, Latin America, Eastern Europe, and the Middle East & Africa.

Looking ahead, our segments are likely to face competitive product launches and pricing pressure, geographic macro-economic risks, reimbursement challenges, impacts from changes in the mix of our product offerings, the timing of product registration approvals, replacement cycle challenges, and fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Additionally, changes in procedural volumes could affect our Cardiac and Vascular, Minimally Invasive Therapies, and Restorative Therapies Groups.

Cardiac and Vascular Group

The Cardiac and Vascular Group’s products include pacemakers, insertable and external cardiac monitors, cardiac resynchronization therapy devices (CRT-D), implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICD), leads and delivery systems, ventricular assist systems, ablation products, electrophysiology catheters, products for the treatment of atrial fibrillation, information systems for the management of patients with Cardiac Rhythm & Heart Failure devices, products designed to reduce surgical site infections, coronary and peripheral stents and related delivery systems, balloons and related delivery systems, endovascular stent graft systems, heart valve replacement technologies, cardiac tissue ablation systems, and open heart and coronary bypass grafting surgical products. The Cardiac and Vascular Group also includes Care Management Services and Cath Lab Managed Services (CLMS) within the Cardiac Rhythm & Heart Failure division. The Cardiac and Vascular Group's net sales for fiscal year


were

$11.5 billion

, an increase of


percent as compared to fiscal year


. Currency had an unfavorable impact on net sales for fiscal year


of $182 million. The Cardiac and Vascular Group's net sales for fiscal year


, as compared to fiscal year


, benefited from net sales growth in Coronary & Structural Heart and Aortic, Peripheral & Venous (formerly known as Aortic & Peripheral Vascular) divisions, offset by declines in Cardiac Rhythm & Heart Failure.

Cardiac Rhythm & Heart Failure net sales for fiscal year


were

$5.8 billion

, a decrease of


percent as compared to fiscal year


. Cardiac Rhythm & Heart Failure net sales decrease for fiscal year


was driven by declines in Heart Failure, Care Management Services, and CLMS, offset by growth in Arrhythmia Management. The decline in Heart Failure was driven by CRT-D replacements and LVAD headwinds due to a competitor product launch in the U.S. and changes in the U.S. heart transplant guidelines. The growth in Arrhythmia Management was driven by AF Solutions due to the continued strength of the Arctic Front Cardiac CryoAblation Catheter System and Diagnostics due to growth from our Reveal LINQ insertable cardiac monitor. Arrhythmia Management net sales growth also benefited from strong adoption of the TYRX absorbable antibacterial envelope through further expansion of value-based health-care arrangements.

Coronary & Structural Heart net sales for fiscal year


were

$3.7 billion

, an increase of


percent as compared to fiscal year


. Coronary & Structural Heart net sales growth for fiscal year


was driven by the global strength of the CoreValve Evolut PRO transcatheter aortic valve system (Evolut PRO) and continued penetration into intermediate risk in the U.S., as well as growth in cannulae, including the Bio-Medicus Next Gen Cannulae, guide catheters, and coronary balloons.

Aortic, Peripheral & Venous net sales for fiscal year


were

$1.9 billion

, an increase of


percent as compared to fiscal year


. Aortic, Peripheral & Venous net sales growth for fiscal year


was driven by strong performance of the VenaSeal vein closure system, for which final approval for reimbursement payment in the U.S. from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) was received in January 2018, growth in Percutaneous Transluminal Angioplasty (PTA) balloons, as well as the launch of the Valiant Navion thoracic stent graft system which received U.S. FDA and CE Mark approval in October and November 2018, respectively.

Cardiac Rhythm & Heart Failure net sales for fiscal year


were

$5.9 billion

, an increase of

5 percent

as compared to fiscal year


. Cardiac Rhythm & Heart Failure net sales growth for fiscal year 2018 was driven by strong growth in Arrhythmia Management and Heart Failure. The strong growth in Arrhythmia Management was largely due to growth in AF Solutions, driven by the continued global acceptance of our Arctic Front Cardiac CryoAblation Catheter System, growth in Diagnostics, driven by the continued adoption of the Reveal LINQ insertable cardiac monitor, as well as strong adoption of the Micra transcatheter pacing system and TYRX absorbable antibacterial envelope. The strong growth in Heart Failure was driven by growth in Mechanical Circulatory Support from sales of the HVAD system, as well as continued demand for the CRT-P quadripolar pacing system, which launched in the U.S. in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018.

Coronary & Structural Heart net sales for fiscal year


were

$3.6 billion

, an increase of

14 percent

as compared to fiscal year


. Coronary & Structural Heart net sales growth for fiscal year


was largely driven by the continued strong customer adoption of Evolut PRO and the Evolut R 34mm transcatheter aortic heart valve, as well as continued penetration into intermediate risk in the U.S., which received approval late in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018. Net sales growth was also driven by the continued strong demand for the Resolute Onyx drug-eluting stent in the U.S. and Japan, which launched in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018.



Aortic, Peripheral & Venous net sales for fiscal year


were

$1.8 billion

, an increase of

6 percent

as compared to fiscal year


. Aortic, Peripheral & Venous net sales growth for fiscal year


was driven by growth in Valiant Captivia thoracic stent grafts, PTA and drug-coated balloons, as well as success of the Heli-FX EndoAnchor System. Net sales growth was further driven by strong performance in EndoVenous due to accelerated growth of the VenaSeal vein closure system, for which approval for reimbursement payment in the U.S. from CMS was received in January 2018.

Looking ahead, we expect our Cardiac and Vascular Group could be affected by the following:

•

Acceptance and growth from penetration of the self-expanding CoreValve Evolut transcatheter aortic valve replacement platform into intermediate risk indication in the U.S.

•

Continued acceptance and growth from Evolut PRO, which provides industry-leading hemodynamics, reliable delivery, and advanced sealing with an excellent safety profile. Evolut PRO received CE Mark approval at the end of the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 and launched in Europe during the second quarter of fiscal year 2018. Evolut PRO launched in Japan and received approval from the Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare during the second quarter of fiscal year 2019.

•

Continued acceptance and growth of the CRT-P quadripolar pacing system.

•

Continued acceptance and growth of the Claria MRI CRT-D system with EffectivCRT Diagnostic and Effective CRT during AF algorithm, which launched in Japan during the third quarter of fiscal year 2018.

•

Continued growth of our Micra transcatheter pacing system. We received final approval for reimbursement in the U.S. from the CMS and in Japan from the Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017 and during the second quarter of fiscal year 2018, respectively, which we expect will continue to accelerate sales in the U.S. and in Japan.

•

Continued acceptance and growth from the Azure XT and S SureScan pacing systems, which launched in the U.S. during the third quarter of fiscal year 2018. Azure pacemakers feature Medtronic-exclusive BlueSync technology, which enables automatic, secure wireless remote monitoring with increased device longevity.

•

Continued acceptance of the HVAD System as a Destination Therapy for patients with advanced heart failure who are not candidates for heart transplants. The HVAD System, a left ventricular assist device or LVAD, helps the heart pump and increases the amount of blood that flows through the body. In the U.S., we received FDA approval for the Destination Therapy indication in September 2017 and the thoracotomy indication in July 2018, which allows for a less-invasive implant via a small surgical incision between the patient's ribs on the left side of the chest. We expect that future LVAD net sales will be impacted by a competitor's product launch and the impact of changes in the U.S. heart transplant guidelines.

•

Continued growth, adoption, and utilization of the TYRX Envelope for implantable devices driven by the favorable results of the WRAP-IT clinical study.

•

Continued acceptance of Care Management Services as post-acute care services become even more critical in bundled payment models for different interventions or therapies.

•

Approval and acceptance of the self-expanding CoreValve Evolut transcatheter aortic valve replacement platform for the treatment of patients determined to be at low risk with surgery. The application for expanded indication is pending regulatory approval and is anticipated in fiscal year 2020.

•

Continued acceptance and growth from the VenaSeal vein closure system in the United States, for which reimbursement payment was established in January 2018 and payer coverage has been gradually increasing. The VenaSeal system is a unique non-thermal solution to address superficial venous disease that provides improved patient comfort, reduces the recovery time, and eliminates the risk of thermal nerve injury.

•

Continued acceptance and growth from the Valiant family of thoracic stent grafts, including the Valiant Navion which received U.S. FDA approval in October 2018 and CE Mark approval in November 2018.

were

$3.2 billion

, a decrease of

33 percent

as compared to fiscal year


. Respiratory, Gastrointestinal, & Renal net sales declined as a result of the Divestiture. Apart from the decline in net sales due to the Divestiture, net sales performance in Respiratory, Gastrointestinal, & Renal benefited from growth in GI Solutions, the strength in Nellcor pulse oximetry products due to the intensity of the flu season in the U.S., the continued adoption of MicroStream capnography monitoring product, and growth in Airway and Ventilation net sales.

Looking ahead, we expect our Minimally Invasive Therapies Group could be affected by the following:

•

Continued acceptance and future growth of Open-to-MIS techniques and tools supported by our efforts to transition open surgery to MIS. The Open-to-MIS initiative focuses on furthering our presence in and working to optimize open surgery globally, while capturing the market opportunity that exists in transitioning open procedures to MIS, whether through traditional MIS, or advanced technologies including robotics.

•

Continued acceptance and future growth of powered stapling and energy platform, along with our ability to execute ongoing strategies to develop, gain regulatory approval, and commercialize new products including our surgical robotics platform.

•

Our ability to obtain adequate replacement sterilization capacity in our Surgical Innovations business and Gastrointestinal product lines in light of the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency's (Illinois EPA) decision to close the Sterigenics U.S. LLC (Sterigenics) Willowbrook, Illinois facility on February 15, 2019. We have



been working to identify alternate suppliers and rerouting our supply chain, and expect to return to full sterilization capacity late in the first quarter of fiscal year 2020.

•

The July 29, 2017 divestiture of the Patient Care, Deep Vein Thrombosis, and Nutritional Insufficiency businesses. Net sales of the businesses included in the Divestiture were $0.6 billion and $2.4 billion for fiscal years 2018 and 2017, respectively. We have entered into Transition Manufacturing Agreements (TMAs) with Cardinal Health, Inc. (Cardinal). The TMAs will contribute to net sales and are designed to ensure and facilitate an orderly transfer of business operations for a transition period of two to five years, with the ability to extend upon mutual agreement of the parties.

•

Our ability to execute ongoing strategies in order to address the competitive pressure of reprocessing of our vessel sealing disposables in the U.S.

•

Our ability to create markets and drive product and procedures into emerging markets.

were

$8.2 billion

, an increase of


percent as compared to fiscal year


. Currency had a negative impact on net sales for fiscal year


of

$73 million

. The Restorative Therapies Group’s performance for fiscal year


was driven by the Brain Therapies, Specialty Therapies, and Pain Therapies divisions.



Spine net sales for fiscal year


were

$2.7 billion

, a decrease of


percent as compared to fiscal year


. Despite the decline, we saw incremental growth driven by increased spinal impact attachment rates in conjunction with our Surgical Synergy strategy, which integrates our spinal implants with enabling technologies such as robotics, imaging, navigation, power instruments, and nerve monitoring. Further contributing to growth was our "Speed-to-Scale" initiative, which involves faster innovation cycles and the launching of a steady cadence of new products at scale with sets immediately available for the entire market. Recently launched products include the Infinity OCT System and the Solera Voyager 5.5/6.0 fixation system.

Brain Therapies net sales for fiscal year


were

$2.6 billion

, an increase of


percent as compared to fiscal year


. Brain Therapies net sales growth was driven by strong growth in both Neurovascular and Neurosurgery. Neurovascular net sales growth was driven by strength across our stroke franchise, with growth across our stent retriever, flow diversion, neuro access, coil, and embolic protection products. Neurosurgery net sales growth was driven by strong capital equipment sales of the Mazor X robotic guidance systems, StealthStation S8 surgical navigation systems, Midas Rex powered surgical instrument systems, O-Arm Imaging Systems, and Visualase MRI-guided laser ablation systems.

Specialty Therapies net sales for fiscal year


were

$1.6 billion

, an increase of


percent as compared to fiscal year


. Net sales growth was driven by strong sales of the Aquamantys biopolar sealers and PlasmaBlade dissection devices within Transformative Solutions and growth in ENT.

Pain Therapies net sales for fiscal year


were

$1.3 billion

, an increase of


percent as compared to fiscal year


. The increase in net sales was driven by our Intellis spinal cord stimulation platform which received U.S. FDA approval in September 2017 and CE Mark in November 2017. Further driving net sales growth were the Evolve workflow algorithm, Snapshot reports, and our Targeted Drug Delivery products, including the new clinician and patient programmers.

Spine net sales for fiscal year


were

$2.7 billion

, an increase of


percent as compared to fiscal year


. Spine net sales growth was driven by growth in bone morphogenetic protein (composed of INFUSE bone graft (InductOs in the European Union)), partially offset by a slight decline in Core Spine. Core Spine net sales declined due to continued overall market softness in the U.S. and Europe, partially offset by the continued success of our Surgical Synergy strategy and our "Speed-to-Scale" initiative.

Brain Therapies net sales for fiscal year


were

$2.4 billion

, an increase of

12 percent

as compared to fiscal year


. Brain Therapies net sales growth was driven by strong growth in both Neurovascular and Neurosurgery. Neurovascular net sales growth was driven by strength across our stroke portfolio, specifically in stents, as a result of our leading role in the development of the endovascular therapy market for treatment of ischemic stroke. Neurosurgery net sales growth was driven by strong sales of the StealthStation S8 surgical navigation system, O-arm O2 surgical imaging system, Visualase MRI-guided laser ablation system, Midas disposables, as well as disposables revenue from placement of capital equipment. Net sales growth in Neurovascular and Neurosurgery for fiscal year 2018 was partially offset by slight declines in Brain Modulation due to competitive pressures in major markets.

Specialty Therapies net sales for fiscal year


were

$1.6 billion

, an increase of

4 percent

as compared to fiscal year


. Specialty Therapies net sales growth was driven by growth in ENT, Pelvic Health, and Transformative Solutions.

Pain Therapies net sales for fiscal year


were

$1.2 billion

, an increase of

3 percent

as compared to fiscal year


. Pain Therapies net sales growth was driven by Interventional from the OsteoCool RF Spinal Tumor ablation system. Within Spinal Cord Stimulation, the Intellis Platform launch and ongoing roll-out of the Evolve workflow algorithm contributed to net sales in fiscal year 2018 and helped mitigate competitive pressures in the U.S. and Europe.

Looking ahead, we expect our Restorative Therapies Group could be affected by the following:

•

Continued acceptance and growth of the Solitare FR revascularization device for treatment of acute ischemic stroke and the Pipeline Embolization Devices, endovascular treatments for large or giant wide-necked brain aneurysms.

•

Diabetes Group

The Diabetes Group's products include insulin pumps, continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems, insulin pump consumables, and therapy management software. The Diabetes Group’s net sales for fiscal year


were

$2.4 billion

, an increase of


percent as compared to fiscal year 2018. Currency had an unfavorable impact on net sales for fiscal year


of $36 million. The Diabetes Group's net sales growth for fiscal year


was primarily attributable to the continued demand for the MiniMed 670G hybrid closed loop system, which offers the latest in SmartGuard technology, as well as the higher sensor attachment and utilization we are seeing with our integrated CGM users. Further, we experienced continued international growth due to strong sales of insulin pump systems in Europe, Latin America, and Asia Pacific as well as worldwide strength of the Guardian Connect CGM system.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

We have used various accounting policies to prepare the consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Our significant accounting policies are disclosed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

The preparation of the consolidated financial statements, in conformity with U.S. GAAP, requires us to use judgment in making estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. These estimates reflect our best judgment about economic and market conditions and the potential effects on the valuation and/or carrying value of assets and liabilities based upon relevant information available. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.

Our critical accounting estimates include the following:

Litigation Contingencies

We are involved in a number of legal actions involving product liability, intellectual property and commercial disputes, shareholder related matters, environmental proceedings, income tax disputes, and governmental proceedings and investigations. The outcomes of these legal actions are not completely within our control and may not be known for prolonged periods of time. In some actions, the enforcement agencies or private claimants seek damages, as well as other civil or criminal remedies (including injunctions barring the sale of products that are the subject of the proceeding), that could require significant expenditures or result in lost revenues or limit our ability to conduct business in the applicable jurisdictions. Estimating probable losses from our litigation and governmental proceedings is inherently difficult, particularly when the matters are in early procedural stages, with incomplete scientific facts or legal discovery; involve unsubstantiated or indeterminate claims for damages; potentially involve penalties, fines, or punitive damages; or could result in a change in business practice. Our significant legal proceedings are discussed in Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Income Tax Reserves and U.S. Tax Reform

We establish reserves when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable, we believe that certain positions are likely to be challenged and that we may or may not prevail. Under U.S. GAAP, if we determine that a tax position is more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, based solely on the technical merits of the position, we recognize the benefit. We measure the benefit by determining the amount that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement. We presume that all tax positions will be examined by a taxing authority with full knowledge of all relevant information. The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations. We regularly monitor our tax positions and tax liabilities. We reevaluate the technical merits of our tax positions and recognize an uncertain tax benefit, or derecognize a previously recorded tax benefit, when there is (i) a completion of a tax audit, (ii) effective settlement of an issue, (iii) a change in applicable tax law including a tax case or legislative guidance, or (iv) the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations. Significant judgment is required in accounting for tax reserves. Although we believe that we have adequately provided for liabilities resulting from tax assessments by taxing authorities, positions taken by these tax authorities could have a material impact on our effective tax rate, consolidated earnings, financial position and/or cash flows.

On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation, commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "Tax Act"), which significantly revised U.S. corporate income taxation by, among other things, lowering the U.S. corporate income tax rate, broadening the base of taxation, and implementing a territorial tax system. We had a measurement period of up to one year after the enactment date of the Tax Act to finalize the recognition of the related tax impacts. The measurement period closed during fiscal year 2019.

Valuation of Intangible Assets and Goodwill

When we acquire a business, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their respective fair values at the acquisition date. Goodwill is the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of net assets of acquired businesses. Intangible assets primarily include patents, trademarks, tradenames, customer relationships, purchased technology, and IPR&D. Determining the fair value of intangible assets acquired as part of a business combination requires us to make significant estimates. These estimates include the amount and timing of projected future cash flows of each project or technology, the discount rate used to discount those cash flows to present value, the assessment of the asset’s life cycle, and the consideration of legal, technical, regulatory, economic, and competitive risks.



The test for goodwill impairment requires us to make several estimates to determine fair value, most of which are based on projected future cash flows. Our estimates associated with the goodwill impairment test are considered critical due to the amount of goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheets and the judgment required in determining fair value. We assess the impairment of goodwill at the reporting unit level annually in the third quarter and whenever an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate that the carrying amount may be impaired.

We test definite-lived intangible assets for impairment when an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount of the assets or asset group may be impaired. Our tests are based on future cash flows that require significant judgment with respect to future revenue and expense growth rates, appropriate discount rates, asset groupings, and other assumptions and estimates. We use estimates that are consistent with our business plans and a market participant's view of the assets being evaluated. Actual results may differ from our estimates due to a number of factors including, among others, changes in competitive conditions, timing of regulatory approval, results of clinical trials, changes in worldwide economic conditions, and fluctuations in currency exchange rates.

We assess the impairment of indefinite-lived intangible assets annually in the third quarter and whenever an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate that the carrying amount may be impaired. Our impairment tests of indefinite-lived intangible assets require us to make several estimates to determine fair value, including projected future cash flows and discount rates.

ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES

COSTS AND EXPENSES

The following is a summary of cost of products sold, research and development, and selling, general, and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales:

Cost of Products Sold

We continue to focus on reducing our costs of production through supplier management, manufacturing improvements, and optimizing our manufacturing network.

Cost of products sold was

$9.2 billion

,

$9.1 billion

, and

$9.3 billion

during fiscal years


,


, and


, respectively. The decrease in cost of products sold as a percentage of net sales from fiscal year


as compared to fiscal year


was favorably affected by decreased sales of lower-margin products as a result of the Divestiture. Also contributing to the decrease in cost of products sold as a percentage of net sales during fiscal year


was the infusion set recall in our Diabetes Group, along with

$17 million

of costs recognized in relation to restoring operations at four Puerto Rico manufacturing sites after Hurricane Maria, including idle facility costs, asset write-downs, and other facility-related costs, incurred during fiscal year


. These benefits were slightly offset by increased restructuring and associated costs, a change in product mix due to strong growth in some of our lower-margin businesses, and additional expenses incurred due to the closing of a supplier sterilization facility used by our Minimally Invasive Therapies Group during fiscal year


. Cost of products sold for fiscal year


includes

$91 million

of restructuring and associated costs, as compared to

$40 million

for fiscal year


.

The decrease in cost of products sold as a percentage of sales from fiscal year


as compared to


was due primarily to decreased sales of lower-margin products as a result of the Divestiture and a

$38 million

charge recognized during fiscal year


related to the fair value step-up taken on inventory acquired in connection with the HeartWare acquisition. Partially offsetting these benefits were the costs recognized in relation to restoring operations at four Puerto Rico manufacturing sites after Hurricane Maria and the infusion set recall in our Diabetes group during fiscal year


.



Research and Development Expense

We remain committed to accelerating the development of meaningful innovations to deliver better patient outcomes at appropriate costs that lead to enhanced quality of life and may be validated by clinical and economic evidence. We are also focused on expanding access to quality healthcare. Research and development expense was

$2.3 billion

during fiscal years


and


and

$2.2 billion

during fiscal year


.

Selling, General, and Administrative Expense

Our goal is to continue to leverage selling, general, and administrative expense initiatives and to continue to realize cost synergies expected from our acquisitions. Selling, general, and administrative expense primarily consists of salaries and wages, other administrative costs, such as professional fees and marketing expenses, and certain acquisition, restructuring, and divestiture-related expenses.

Selling, general, and administrative expense was

$10.4 billion

,

$10.2 billion

, and

$10.0 billion

during fiscal years


,


, and


, respectively. The decrease in selling, general, and administrative expense as a percentage of sales from fiscal year


to


benefited from our Enterprise Excellence program, continued net sales growth, cost containment measures, and

$115 million

of professional service fees and accelerated stock compensation expense incurred in connection with the Divestiture during fiscal year


. Offsetting these benefits were increased restructuring and associated costs. Selling, general, and administrative expense in fiscal year


includes

$118 million

of restructuring and associated costs, as compared to

$37 million

in fiscal year


.

The increase in selling, general, and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales from fiscal year


to


was driven by expenses incurred for new product launches, expenses incurred to fulfill our Transition Service Agreements (TSAs) that we entered into with Cardinal Health in conjunction with the Divestiture, and

$115 million

of professional service fees and accelerated stock compensation expense incurred in connection with the Divestiture. Offsetting these increases were decreased acquisition-related items. Selling, general, and administrative expense in fiscal year


includes

$137 million

of acquisition-related items, as compared to

$303 million

in fiscal year


.

The following is a summary of other costs and expenses:

Amortization of Intangible Assets

Amortization of intangible assets

includes the amortization expense of our definite-lived intangible assets, consisting of purchased patents, trademarks, tradenames, customer relationships, purchased technology, and other intangible assets. Amortization expense was

$1.8 billion

during fiscal years


and


and

$2.0 billion

during fiscal year


.

While amortization expense remained consistent when comparing fiscal year


to


, the decrease in amortization expense from fiscal year


to fiscal year


was primarily attributable to the discontinuation of amortization on the definite-lived intangible assets classified as assets held for sale at April 28, 2017 and through the first quarter of fiscal year


related to the Divestiture, which was completed during the second quarter of fiscal year


.



Restructuring Charges, Net

Enterprise Excellence

In the third quarter of fiscal year 2018, we announced a multi-year global Enterprise Excellence Program designed to drive long-term business growth and sustainable efficiency. The Enterprise Excellence Program is expected to further leverage our global size and scale as well as enhance the customer and employee experience.

The Enterprise Excellence Program is focused on three objectives:

•

Global Operations - integrating and enhancing global manufacturing and supply processes, systems and site presence to improve quality, delivery cost and cash flow

•

Functional Optimization - enhancing and leveraging global operating models and systems across several enabling functions to improve productivity and employee experience

•

Commercial Optimization - optimizing certain processes, systems and models to improve productivity and the customer experience

The Enterprise Excellence Program is designed to drive operating margin improvement, as well as fund investment in strategic growth initiatives, with expected annual gross savings of more than

$3.0 billion

from cost reductions and leverage of our fixed infrastructure by the end of fiscal year 2022. Approximately

$500 million

to

$700 million

of gross annual savings are expected to be achieved each fiscal year through the end of fiscal year 2022.

The Enterprise Excellence Program is expected to result in pre-tax restructuring charges of approximately

$1.6 billion

to

$1.8 billion

, the vast majority of which are expected to be incurred by the end of fiscal year 2022 and result in cash outlays to be substantially complete by the end of fiscal year 2023. Approximately half of the estimated restructuring charges are related to employee termination benefits. The remaining restructuring charges are costs associated with the restructuring program, such as salaries for employees supporting the program and consulting expenses. We expect these costs to be recognized within

restructuring charges, net, cost of products sold,

and

selling, general and administrative expense

in the consolidated statements of income.

During fiscal year


, we recognized restructuring charges of

$424 million

. For fiscal year


, restructuring charges included

$198 million

recognized within

restructuring charges, net

in the consolidated statements of income, primarily comprised of employee termination benefits. For fiscal year


, restructuring charges also included costs incurred as a direct result of the restructuring program, such as salaries for employees supporting the program and consulting expenses, including

$91 million

recognized within

cost of products sold

and

$118 million

recognized within

selling, general and administrative expense

in the consolidated statements of income. For fiscal year


,

selling, general, and administrative expense

also includes

$17 million

of fixed asset write-downs.

During fiscal year


, we recognized restructuring charges of

$96 million

. For fiscal year


, restructuring charges included

$35 million

recognized within

restructuring charges, net

in the consolidated statements of income, primarily comprised of employee termination benefits. For fiscal year


, restructuring charges also included costs incurred as a direct result of the restructuring program, such as salaries for employees supporting the program and consulting expenses, including

$28 million

recognized within

cost of products sold

and

$33 million

recognized within

selling, general and administrative expense

in the consolidated statements of income.

Cost Synergies

In the third quarter of fiscal year 2018, we achieved

$850 million

in cost synergies related to the acquisition of Covidien plc. The cost synergies related to administrative office optimization, manufacturing and supply chain infrastructure, and certain general and administrative savings. Cash outlays for the cost synergies program are scheduled to be substantially complete by the end of fiscal year 2019.

During fiscal year


, we recognized

no

restructuring charges and accrual adjustments of

$17 million

. Accrual adjustments relate to certain employees identified for termination finding other positions within Medtronic, cancellations of employee terminations, and employee termination benefits being less than initially estimated.

For fiscal years


and 2017, we recognized restructuring charges of

$45 million

and

$441 million

, respectively, partially offset by accrual adjustments of

$34 million

and

$68 million

, respectively. Accrual adjustments relate to certain employees identified for termination finding other positions within Medtronic, cancellations of employee terminations, and employee termination benefits being less than initially estimated. For fiscal year 2017, restructuring charges included asset write-downs of

$17 million

related to property, plant, and equipment impairments and

$10 million

related to inventory write-offs recognized within

cost of



products sold

in the consolidated statements of income. Additionally, fiscal year 2017 restructuring charges included

$73 million

of incremental defined benefit pension and post-retirement related expenses for employees that accepted voluntary early retirement packages.

For additional information, see Note


to the consolidated financial statements in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Certain Litigation Charges

We classify litigation charges and gains related to significant legal matters as certain litigation charges. During fiscal years


,


, and


, we recognized

$166 million

,

$61 million

, and

$300 million

, respectively, of certain litigation charges related to probable and estimable damages for significant legal matters.

Gain on Sale of Businesses

We recognized a pre-tax gain of

$697 million

on the sale of the Patient Care, Deep Vein Thrombosis, and Nutritional Insufficiency businesses during fiscal year


. There were no sales of businesses during fiscal years


or


.

Other Operating Expense, Net

Other operating expense, net primarily includes royalty income and expense, TSA income, intangible asset charges, currency transaction and derivative gains and losses, contributions to the Medtronic Foundation, Puerto Rico excise taxes, changes in the fair value of contingent consideration, and charges associated with business exits. Other operating expense, net was

$258 million

,

$535 million

, and

$239 million

, during fiscal years


,


, and


, respectively.

The decrease in other operating expense, net from fiscal year


to fiscal year


was primarily attributable to remeasurement and our hedging programs, which, combined, resulted in a gain of

$87 million

for fiscal year


and a loss of

$176 million

for fiscal year


. Also contributing to the change was a charge of

$80 million

recognized in fiscal year


for charitable contributions to the Medtronic Foundation and increased gains from the change in fair value of contingent consideration. These items were partially offset by intangible asset impairments and other charges of

$149 million

associated with business exits during fiscal year


and a reduction of TSA income.

The increase in other operating expense, net from fiscal year


to fiscal year


was primarily attributable to remeasurement and our hedging programs, which, combined, resulted in a loss of

$176 million

for fiscal year


and a gain of

$81 million

for fiscal year


. Also contributing to the increase were losses of

$68 million

related to the impairment of IPR&D assets in fiscal year


,

$15 million

of humanitarian aid provided to our employees affected by Hurricane Maria in fiscal year


, and a decrease in gains from the changes in fair value of contingent consideration. These items were partially offset by

$74 million

of TSA income and a reduction in charitable contributions to the Medtronic Foundation.

Other Non-Operating Income, Net

Other non-operating income, net includes the non-service component of net periodic pension and post-retirement benefit cost, investment gains and losses, and interest income. Other non-operating income, net was

$373 million

,

$181 million

, and

$313 million

during fiscal years


,


, and


, respectively.

The change in other non-operating income, net from fiscal year


to


was due to

$227 million

of losses recognized in fiscal year


related to the impairment of certain cost and equity method investments, increased investment gains on our minority investment portfolio, and decreased interest income. Increases in investment gains on our minority investment portfolio were partially due to the adoption of new accounting guidance in the first quarter of fiscal year


. Refer to Note


to the consolidated financial statements in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information on recently adopted accounting pronouncements.

The change in other non-operating income, net from fiscal year


to


was due to

$227 million

of losses recognized in fiscal year


related to the impairment of certain cost and equity method investments, partially offset by increased interest income, and charges of

$60 million

related to the non-service component of net periodic pension and post-retirement benefit costs associated with voluntary early retirement packages offered and accepted by certain eligible U.S. employees during fiscal year


.

Interest Expense

Interest expense includes interest incurred on our outstanding borrowings, amortization of debt issuance costs and debt premiums or discounts, amortization of gains or losses on terminated or de-designated interest rate derivative instruments, ineffectiveness on interest rate derivative instruments, and charges recognized in connection with the tender and early redemption of senior notes. Interest expense was

$1.4 billion

during fiscal year 2019 and

$1.1 billion

during fiscal years


and


.

The increase in interest expense from fiscal year


to


was the result of

$485 million

of charges recognized in connection with the tender and early redemption of approximately $6.4 billion of Medtronic Inc. and CIFSA senior notes during fiscal year


. This increase in interest expense was partially offset by interest expense savings resulting from a decrease in total debt obligations and a decrease in the weighted-average interest rate of outstanding debt obligations during fiscal year


, on average, compared to fiscal year


.



The change in interest expense from fiscal year


to


was primarily driven by modestly higher average interest rates on total debt obligations outstanding and a

$38 million

charge recognized in connection with the early redemption of approximately $1.2 billion of Medtronic Inc. senior notes during fiscal year


.

INCOME TAXES

On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted the Tax Act, which significantly revises U.S. corporate income taxation by, among other things, lowering the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35.0 percent to 21.0 percent, broadening the base of taxation, implementing a territorial tax system, and imposing a repatriation tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries.

We made the accounting policy election to treat taxes due on U.S. inclusions in taxable income related to Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI) as a current period expense when incurred (the "period cost method").

Many of the countries we operate in have statutory tax rates lower than our blended U.S. statutory rate, thereby resulting in an overall effective tax rate less than the U.S. statutory rate of 21.0 percent for fiscal year


. A significant portion of our earnings are generated from operations in Puerto Rico, Switzerland, and Ireland. The statutory tax rates for these jurisdictions range from 12.5 percent to 45.1 percent. Our earnings in Puerto Rico and Switzerland are subject to certain tax incentive grants which provide for tax rates lower than the country statutory tax rates. Unless our tax incentive grants are extended, they expire between fiscal years 2020 and 2030. The tax incentive grants which expired during fiscal year


did not have a material impact on our financial results. See Note


to the consolidated financial statements in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.

Our effective tax rate for fiscal year


was

10.5 percent

, as compared to

45.5 percent

in fiscal year


. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the impacts from U.S. tax reform, certain tax adjustments, the gain on the Divestiture, the impact from investment losses, and year-over-year changes in operational results by jurisdiction.

Our Non-GAAP Nominal Tax Rate for fiscal year


was

13.6 percent

, as compared to

14.7 percent

in fiscal year


. The decrease in our Non-GAAP Nominal Tax Rate for fiscal year


as compared to fiscal year


was primarily due to the impacts from U.S. tax reform and year-over-year changes in operational results by jurisdiction.

During fiscal year


, we recognized

$134 million of operational tax benefits. The operational tax benefits included a $50 million benefit from excess tax benefits associated with stock-based compensation, and an $84 million net benefit associated with the resolution of certain income tax audits, finalization of certain tax returns, changes to uncertain tax position reserves, and changes to certain deferred income tax balances.

Our effective tax rate for fiscal year


was

45.5 percent

, as compared to

12.6 percent

in fiscal year


. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the impacts from U.S. tax reform, the Divestiture, the utilization of non-U.S. special deductions, the net tax cost associated with an internal reorganization, excess tax benefits associated with stock-based compensation, and the tax effect from the intercompany sales of certain intellectual property.

Our Non-GAAP Nominal Tax Rate for fiscal year


was

14.7 percent

, as compared to

16.2 percent

in fiscal year


. The decrease in our Non-GAAP Nominal Tax Rate for fiscal year


as compared to fiscal year


was primarily due to operational tax benefits and year-over-year changes in operational results by jurisdiction.

During fiscal year


, we recognized $135 million of operational tax benefits. The operational tax benefits included a $61 million benefit from excess tax benefits associated with stock-based compensation and a $74 million net benefit associated with



the resolution of certain income tax audits, finalization of certain tax returns, changes to uncertain tax position reserves, and changes to certain deferred income tax balances.

An increase in our Non-GAAP Nominal Tax Rate of 1 percent would result in an additional income tax provision for fiscal years


,


, and


of approximately

$82 million, $77 million, and $76 million, respectively.

Certain Tax Adjustments

During fiscal year


, certain tax adjustments of $40 million, recognized in

income tax provision

in the consolidated statement of income, included the following:

•

A net benefit of $30 million associated with the finalization of the transition tax liability and the Tax Act impact to deferred tax assets, liabilities, and valuation allowances.

•

A charge of $42 million related to the recognition of a prepaid tax expense resulting from the reduction in the U.S. statutory tax rate under the Tax Act and the current year sale of U.S. manufactured inventory held as of April 27, 2018.

•

A benefit of $32 million related to intercompany legal entity restructuring.

•

A net benefit of $20 million associated with the finalization of certain income tax aspects of the Divestiture.

During fiscal year


, certain tax adjustments of $1.9 billion, recognized in

income tax provision

in the consolidated statement of income, included the following:

•

A net charge of $2.4 billion associated with U.S. tax reform, inclusive of the transition tax, remeasurement of U.S. Federal deferred tax assets and liabilities, and the decrease in the U.S. statutory tax rate.

•

A charge of $73 million associated with an internal reorganization of certain foreign subsidiaries.

•

A net benefit of $579 million associated with the intercompany sale of intellectual property.

During fiscal year


, certain tax adjustments of $202 million, recognized in

income tax provision

in the consolidated statement of income, included the following:

•

A charge of $404 million associated with the IRS resolution for the Ardian, CoreValve, Inc., Ablation Frontiers, Inc., PEAK Surgical, Inc. and Salient Surgical Technologies, Inc. acquisition-related issues and the allocation of income between Medtronic, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiary operating in Puerto Rico for certain businesses. This resolution does not include the businesses that are the subject of the Medtronic, Inc. U.S. Tax Court case for fiscal years 2005 and 2006.

•

A net charge of $125 million associated with the Divestiture.  The net charge primarily relates to the tax effect from the recognition of the outside basis difference of certain subsidiaries which were included in the divestiture.

•

A charge of $86 million associated with the IRS’s disallowance of the utilization of certain net operating losses, along with the recognition of a valuation allowance against the net operating loss deferred tax asset, was recognized during the year.

•

A charge of $18 million as a result of the redemption of an intercompany minority interest during the year.

•

A benefit of $431 million as the result of the resolution of Covidien's previously disclosed Tyco International plc intercompany debt issues with the U.S. Tax Court and the Appeals Division of the IRS.

Certain tax adjustments will affect the comparability of our operating results between periods. Therefore, we consider these Non-GAAP Adjustments. Refer to the "Executive Level Overview" section of this Management's Discussion and Analysis for further discussion of these adjustments.



LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Our liquidity and capital structure is evaluated regularly within the context of our annual operating and strategic planning process. We consider the liquidity necessary to fund our operations, which includes working capital needs, investments in research and development, property, plant, and equipment, and other operating costs. We also consider capital allocation alternatives that balance returning value to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, satisfying maturing debt, and acquiring businesses and technology.

Summary of Cash Flows

The following is a summary of cash provided by (used in) operating, investing, and financing activities, the effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents, and the net change in cash and cash equivalents:

Operating Activities

The

$2.3

billion increase in net cash provided in fiscal year


as compared to fiscal year


was primarily driven by our operating margin expansion as well as decreases in cash paid to suppliers and other vendors, cash paid for taxes, cash paid for interest, and retirement benefit plan contributions, partially offset by an increase in certain litigation payments. The decrease in cash paid to suppliers is primarily due to our continued progress in extending supplier payment terms. The decrease in cash paid for taxes was primarily a result of a $1.1 billion pre-payment that we elected to make to the U.S. IRS in fiscal year


related to in-process litigation on Puerto Rico transfer pricing. Cash paid for interest decreased due to a decrease in total debt obligations as well as a decrease in the weighted average interest rate of outstanding debt obligations. The decrease in retirement benefit plan contributions reflects lower contributions to the U.S. pension plan for fiscal year


as compared to fiscal year


. Certain litigation payments increased primarily due to the payment of previously accrued settlement amounts for the INFUSE litigation matter.

The

$2.2

billion decrease in net cash provided in fiscal year


as compared to fiscal year


was primarily driven by an increase in cash paid for taxes of $1.5 billion, an increase in net cash outflows for collateral related to our derivative instruments of $145 million, cash paid for divestiture-related expenses of approximately $100 million, and a decrease in cash collected from customers. The increase in cash paid for income taxes was primarily a result of the aforementioned $1.1 billion Puerto Rico pre-payment, tax payments related to the intercompany sale of intellectual property and the Divestiture, as well as settlement payments for U.S. federal income taxes for fiscal years 2012 to 2014 and audit settlements outside of the U.S.

Investing Activities

The

$6.6

billion increase in net cash used in fiscal year


as compared to fiscal year


was primarily attributable to the Divestiture in fiscal year


, which resulted in net proceeds of $6.1 billion, and an increase in cash paid for acquisitions of

$1.7

billion, primarily due to the acquisition of Mazor and EPiX during fiscal year


, partially offset by an increase in net proceeds from purchases and sales and maturities of investments.

The

$7.4

billion increase in net cash provided in fiscal year


as compared to fiscal year


was primarily attributable to the Divestiture in fiscal year


, a decrease in cash paid for acquisitions of $1.2 billion, primarily due to the acquisition of Heartware during fiscal year


, and a decrease in additions to property, plant, and equipment.

Financing Activities

The

$6.5

billion decrease in net cash used in fiscal year


as compared to fiscal year


was primarily attributable to the issuance of $7.8 billion of Euro-denominated senior notes in fiscal year


, partially offset by an increase in share repurchases of

$706

million and an increase in repayments of commercial paper.  In fiscal year


, we repaid

$7.9 billion

of long-term debt primarily through the use of the net proceeds from the Euro-debt issuance. In fiscal year


, we repaid

$7.4 billion

of long-term debt, which was not funded through the issuance of long-term debt.

The

$8.7

billion increase in net cash used in fiscal year


as compared to fiscal year


was primarily attributable to long-term debt repayments of

$7.4

billion, the issuance of $2.0 billion of Senior Notes in fiscal year


, and a reduction of commercial paper borrowings in fiscal year


as compared to fiscal year


, partially offset by a decrease in share repurchases of

$1.4

billion.



Free Cash Flow

Free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, is calculated by subtracting additions to property, plant, and equipment from net cash provided by operating activities. Management uses this non-GAAP financial measure, in addition to U.S. GAAP financial measures, to evaluate our operating results. Free cash flow should be considered supplemental to, and not a substitute for, our reported financial results prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Reconciliations between net cash provided by operating activities (the most comparable U.S. GAAP measure) and free cash flow are as follows:

Debt and Capital

Our capital structure consists of equity and interest-bearing debt. We use a combination of bank borrowings and commercial paper issuances to fund our short-term financing needs. Current debt, including the current portion of our long-term debt and capital lease obligations, at

April 26, 2019

was

$838 million

as compared to

$2.1 billion

at

April 27, 2018

. Long-term debt at

April 26, 2019

was

$24.5 billion

as compared to

$23.7 billion

at

April 27, 2018

. We utilize unsecured senior debt obligations to meet our long-term financing needs. From time to time, we may repurchase our outstanding debt obligations in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions.

Total debt at

April 26, 2019

was

$25.3 billion

, as compared to

$25.8 billion

at

April 27, 2018

. The decrease in total debt was primarily driven by the reduction in our commercial paper borrowings of $698 million, partially offset by the net impact of the issuance, cash tender offer, early redemptions, and repayment described below.

In March 2019, Medtronic Global Holdings S.C.A. (Medtronic Luxco) issued six tranches of Euro-denominated senior notes with an aggregate principal of

€7.0 billion

, with maturities ranging from fiscal year 2021 to fiscal year 2039, resulting in cash proceeds of approximately

$7.8 billion

, net of discounts and issuance costs. We used the net proceeds of the offering to fund the previously announced cash tender offers and early redemption, described below. The Euro-denominated debt is designated as a net investment hedge of certain of our European operations.

We completed the cash tender offer and early redemption of $6.4 billion of Medtronic Inc. and CIFSA

senior notes for $6.9 billion of total consideration in March 2019. We recognized a loss on debt extinguishment of $485 million, which primarily included cash premiums and accelerated amortization of deferred financing costs and debt discounts and premiums. The loss on debt extinguishment was recognized in

interest expense

in the consolidated statements of income. Also in March 2019, we repaid our 1.700 percent two-year 2017 senior notes, including interest, for $1.0 billion.

For additional information on the issuance of these senior notes and the subsequent cash tender offer and early redemption, refer to Note


to the consolidated financial statements in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. For additional information on the Euro-denominated debt designated as a net investment hedge, refer to Note


to the consolidated financial statements in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

During fiscal year 2018, we repaid our senior unsecured term loan, including accrued interest, for $3.0 billion, our 6.000 percent ten-year 2008 CIFSA senior notes, including accrued interest, for $1.2 billion, our 3.500 percent seven-year 2010 HTWR senior notes, including interest, for $43 million, our 1.500 percent three-year 2015 senior notes, including accrued interest, for $1.0 billion, our 1.375 percent five-year 2013 senior notes, including accrued interest, for $1.0 billion, our 4.450 percent ten-year 2010 senior notes, including accrued interest and early redemption premium, for $795 million, and our 5.600 percent ten-year 2009 senior notes, including accrued interest and early redemption premium, for $413 million.

We maintain a commercial paper program for short-term financing, which allows us to issue unsecured commercial paper notes on a private placement basis up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $3.5 billion. At

April 26, 2019

, we had

no

commercial paper outstanding, as compared to

$698 million

outstanding at

April 27, 2018

. During fiscal years


and


, the weighted average original maturity of the commercial paper outstanding was approximately


and


days, respectively, and the weighted average interest rate was

2.12 percent

and

1.46 percent

, respectively. The issuance of commercial paper reduces the amount of credit available under our existing line of credit, as explained below.



We also have a $3.5 billion five-year syndicated credit facility (Credit Facility) which was amended and restated in December 2018, and now expires in December 2023. The Credit Facility provides backup funding for the commercial paper program and may also be used for general corporate purposes. The Credit Facility provides us with the ability to increase our borrowing capacity by an additional $1.0 billion at any time during the term of the agreement. At each anniversary date of the Credit Facility, but not more than twice prior to the maturity date, we could also request a one-year extension of the maturity date. At

April 26, 2019

and April 27, 2018, no amounts were outstanding on the committed line of credit.

Interest rates on advances of our Credit Facility are determined by a pricing matrix, based on our long-term debt ratings assigned by S&P and Moody’s. For additional information on our credit ratings status by S&P and Moody's, refer to the "Liquidity" section of this Management's Discussion and Analysis. Facility fees are payable on the Credit Facility and are determined in the same manner as the interest rates. The agreements also contain customary covenants, all of which we were in compliance with at

April 26, 2019

.

We repurchase our ordinary shares from time to time as part of our focus on returning value to our shareholders. In June 2017, our Board of Directors authorized the expenditure of up to $5.0 billion for new share repurchases. In March 2019, our Board of Directors authorized an incremental $6.0 billion for repurchase of our ordinary shares. There is no specific time period associated with these repurchase authorizations. During fiscal years


and


, we repurchased a total of

31 million

and

25 million

shares, respectively, under these programs at an average price of

$91.43

and

$83.71

, respectively. At

April 26, 2019

, we had approximately $7.2 billion remaining under the share repurchase programs authorized by our Board of Directors.

For more information on credit arrangements, see Note


of the consolidated financial statements in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Liquidity

Our liquidity sources at

April 26, 2019

include $4.4 billion of cash and cash equivalents and $5.5 billion of current investments.  Additionally, we maintain a commercial paper program (no commercial paper outstanding at April 26, 2019) and Credit Facility. See discussion above regarding changes in our cash and cash equivalents, commercial paper program and Credit Facility.

Our investments include available-for-sale debt securities, including U.S. and non-U.S. government and agency securities, corporate debt securities, mortgage-backed securities, other asset-backed securities, and auction rate securities. Some of our investments may experience reduced liquidity due to changes in market conditions and investor demand. Our auction rate security holdings continue to experience reduced liquidity due to low investor demand. Although our auction rate securities are currently illiquid and other securities could become illiquid, we believe we could liquidate a substantial amount of our portfolio without incurring a material impairment loss.

For fiscal year


, the total other-than-temporary impairment losses on available-for-sale debt securities were not significant. Based on our assessment of the credit quality of the underlying collateral and credit support available to each of the remaining securities in which we are invested, we believe we have recognized all necessary other-than-temporary impairments as we do not have the intent to sell, nor is it more likely than not that we will be required to sell, before recovery of the amortized cost. At

April 26, 2019

, we have

$61 million

of gross unrealized losses on our aggregate available-for-sale debt securities of

$5.5 billion

. If market conditions deteriorate, some of these holdings may experience other-than-temporary impairment in the future, which could adversely affect our financial results. We are required to use estimates and assumptions in our valuation of investments, which requires a high degree of judgment, and therefore, actual results could differ materially from estimates. See Note


to the consolidated financial statements in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.



The following table is a summary of our Standard and Poor's Rating Services (S&P) and Moody's Investors Service (Moody's) long-term debt ratings and short-term debt ratings:

(1)

Agency ratings are subject to change, and there is no assurance that an agency will continue to provide ratings and/or maintain its current ratings. A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities, and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating agency, and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.

S&P and Moody's long-term debt ratings and short-term debt ratings at

April 26, 2019

were unchanged as compared to the ratings at

April 27, 2018

. We do not expect the S&P and Moody's ratings to have a significant impact on our liquidity or future flexibility to access additional liquidity given our balance sheet and Credit Facility and related commercial paper program.

We have future contractual obligations and other minimum commercial commitments that are entered into in the normal course of business. We believe our off-balance sheet arrangements do not have a material current or anticipated future effect on our consolidated earnings, financial position, and/or cash flows. Refer to the "Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Long-Term Contractual Obligations" section of this Management's Discussion and Analysis for more information on these obligations and commitments.

Note


to the consolidated financial statements in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K provides information regarding amounts we have accrued related to legal matters. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, we record a liability in our consolidated financial statements for these matters when a loss is known or considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Actual settlements may be different than estimated and could have a material effect on our consolidated earnings, financial position, and/or cash flows.

We record tax liabilities in our consolidated financial statements for amounts that we expect to repatriate from subsidiaries (to the extent the repatriation would be subject to tax); however, no tax liabilities are recorded for amounts that we consider to be permanently reinvested. We have removed our permanently reinvested assertion on the undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries with a U.S. parent which were subject to the transition tax. We removed the assertion for all earnings of such subsidiaries through April 27, 2018 and reasserted for earnings generated for subsequent fiscal years. We expect to have access to the majority of our cash flows in the future. In addition, we continue to evaluate our legal entity structure supporting our business operations, and to the extent such evaluation results in a change to our overall business structure, we may be required to accrue for additional tax obligations.

We believe our balance sheet and liquidity provide us with flexibility, and that our cash, cash equivalents, and current investments, as well as our Credit Facility and related commercial paper program, will satisfy our foreseeable operating needs for at least the next 12 months. We regularly review our capital needs and consider various investing and financing alternatives to support our requirements.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND LONG-TERM CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS

In the normal course of business, we periodically enter into agreements that require us to indemnify customers or suppliers for specific risks, such as claims for injury or property damage arising as a result of our products or the negligence of our personnel or claims alleging that our products infringe third-party patents or other intellectual property. Our maximum exposure under these indemnification provisions is unable to be estimated, and we have not accrued any liabilities within our consolidated financial statements or included any indemnification provisions in the table below. Historically, we have not experienced significant losses on these types of indemnification agreements.



Presented below is a summary of our off-balance sheet contractual obligations and other minimum commercial commitments at

April 26, 2019

, as well as long-term contractual obligations reflected in the balance sheet at

April 26, 2019

.

(1)

Includes commitments related to the funding of equity method or other investments, estimated milestone payments, and royalty obligations. While it is not certain if and/or when payments will be made, the maturity dates included in the table reflect our best estimates.

(2)

Includes the contractual interest payments on our outstanding debt and excludes the impacts of debt premium and discount amortization and interest rate swap agreements. See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on our debt agreements.

(3)

Includes inventory purchase commitments and research and development arrangements which are legally binding and specify minimum purchase quantities or spending amounts. These purchase commitments do not exceed our projected requirements and are in the normal course of business. Excludes open purchase orders with a remaining term of less than one year.

(4)

Includes the current and non-current portion of our Senior Notes and bank borrowings. Excludes debt premium and discount, the fair value impact of outstanding interest rate swap agreements, unamortized gains from terminated interest rate swap agreements, and commercial paper. See Notes 7 and 8 to the consolidated financial statements in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on our debt agreements and interest rate swap agreements, respectively.

(5)

Includes the fair value of our current and non-current portions of contingent consideration. While it is not certain if and/or when payments will be made, the maturity dates included in this table reflect our best estimates.

(6)

Represents the tax obligations associated with the transition tax that resulted from U.S. Tax Reform. The transition tax will be paid over an eight-year period and will not accrue interest. See Note


to the consolidated financial statements in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.

(7)

Excludes defined benefit plan obligations, guarantee obligations, uncertain tax positions, non-current tax liabilities, and litigation settlements for which we cannot make a reliable estimate of the period of cash settlement. For further information, see Notes


,


, and


to the consolidated financial statements in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.



Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE RISK

Due to the global nature of our operations, we are exposed to currency exchange rate changes which may cause fluctuations in earnings and cash flows. We use operational and economic hedges, as well as currency exchange rate derivative instruments, to manage the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations. In order to minimize earnings and cash flow volatility resulting from currency exchange rate fluctuations, we enter into derivative instruments, principally forward currency exchange rate contracts. These contracts are designed to hedge anticipated transactions in other currencies and changes in the value of specific assets and liabilities. At inception of the contract, the derivative instrument is designated as either a freestanding derivative or a cash flow hedge. The primary currencies of our derivative instruments are the Euro, Japanese Yen, and British Pound. Fluctuations in the currency exchange rates of currency exposures that are unhedged, such as in certain emerging markets, may result in future earnings and cash flow volatility. We do not enter into currency exchange rate derivative instruments for speculative purposes.

The gross notional amount of all currency exchange rate derivative instruments outstanding at

April 26, 2019

and

April 27, 2018

was

$11.1 billion

and

$11.5 billion

, respectively. At

April 26, 2019

, these contracts were in a net unrealized gain position of $322 million. A sensitivity analysis of changes in the fair value of all currency exchange rate derivative contracts at

April 26, 2019

indicates that, if the U.S. dollar uniformly strengthened/weakened by 10 percent against all currencies, the fair value of these contracts would increase/decrease by approximately $916 million. Any gains and losses on the fair value of derivative contracts would generally be offset by gains and losses on the underlying transactions. These offsetting gains and losses are not reflected in the above analysis.

In the second quarter of fiscal year 2019, we began accounting for our operations in Argentina as highly inflationary, as the prior three-year cumulative inflation rate exceeded 100 percent. The change did not have a material impact on our results for fiscal year 2019.

INTEREST RATE RISK

We are subject to interest rate risk on our investments and our borrowings. We manage interest rate risk in the aggregate, while focusing on our immediate and intermediate liquidity needs. Our debt portfolio at

April 26, 2019

was comprised of debt predominately denominated in U.S. dollars and the Euro, of which substantially all is fixed rate debt. We are also exposed to interest rate changes affecting our investments in interest rate sensitive instruments, which include our marketable debt securities, fixed-to-floating interest rate swap agreements, and forward starting interest rate swap agreements.

A sensitivity analysis of the impact on our interest rate-sensitive financial instruments of a hypothetical 10 basis point change in interest rates, as compared to interest rates at

April 26, 2019

, indicates that the fair value of these instruments would correspondingly change by $49 million.

For a discussion of current market conditions and the impact on our financial condition and results of operations, please see the “Liquidity” section of the Management's Discussion and Analysis in "Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. For additional discussion of market risk, see Notes

Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the

Shareholders and Board of Directors of Medtronic plc:

Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Medtronic plc and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of April 26, 2019 and April 27, 2018, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended April 26, 2019, including the related notes and schedule of valuation and qualifying accounts for each of the three years in the period ended April 26, 2019 appearing under Item 15(a)(1) (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”).

We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of April 26, 2019, based on criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework

(2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

In our opinion, the consolidated

financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of April 26, 2019 and April 27, 2018

,

and the results of its

operations and its

cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended April 26, 2019

in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of April 26, 2019, based on criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework

(2013)

issued by the COSO.

Basis for Opinions

The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A

. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated

financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated

financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated

financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.



Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

We have served as the Company’s auditor since 1963.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Nature of Operations

Medtronic plc (Medtronic or the Company) is among the world's largest medical technology, services, and solutions companies – alleviating pain, restoring health, and extending life for millions of people around the world. The Company provides innovative products and therapies to serve hospitals, physicians, clinicians, and patients. Medtronic was founded in 1949 and is headquartered in Dublin, Ireland.

Principles of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Medtronic plc, its wholly-owned subsidiaries, entities for which the Company has a controlling financial interest, and variable interest entities for which the Company is the primary beneficiary. Intercompany transactions and balances have been fully eliminated in consolidation.

Certain reclassifications have been made to prior year financial statements to conform to classifications used in the current year. For the purpose of providing more concise consolidated statements of income, amounts previously reported in

acquisition-related items

were reclassified to

selling, general, and administrative expense

and

Use of Estimates

The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S.) (U.S. GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Estimates are used when accounting for items such as  income taxes, contingencies, intangible asset, and liability valuations. Actual results may or may not differ from those estimates.

Fiscal Year-End

The Company utilizes a 52/53-week fiscal year, ending the last Friday in April, for the presentation of its consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto at

April 26, 2019

and

April 27, 2018

and for each of the three fiscal years ended

were 52-week years.

Cash Equivalents

The Company considers highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less from the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. These investments are carried at cost, which approximates fair value.

Investments

The Company invests in marketable debt and equity securities, investments that do not have readily determinable fair values, and investments accounted for under the equity method.

Marketable debt securities are classified and accounted for as available-for-sale. These investments are recorded at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets. The change in fair value for available-for-sale securities is recorded, net of taxes, as a component of

accumulated other comprehensive loss

on the consolidated balance sheets. The Company determines the appropriate classification of its investments in marketable debt securities at the time of purchase and reevaluates such determinations at each balance sheet date. The classification of marketable debt securities as current or long-term is based on the nature of the securities and the availability for use in current operations consistent with the Company's management of its capital structure and liquidity.

Certain of the Company’s investments in marketable equity securities and other securities are long-term, strategic investments in companies that are in various stages of development and are included in

other assets

on the consolidated balance sheets. Marketable equity securities are recorded at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets. The change in fair value of marketable equity securities is recognized within

other non-operating income, net

in the consolidated statements of income. Investments without readily determinable fair values that do not qualify for the practical expedient to estimate fair value using the net asset value per share or its equivalent are accounted for at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or similar investments of the issuer. This election is made for each investment separately and is reassessed at each reporting period as to whether the investment continues to qualify for this election. At each reporting period, the Company makes a qualitative assessment considering impairment indicators to evaluate whether the investment is impaired. Equity securities accounted for under the equity method are initially recorded at the amount of the Company’s investment and are adjusted each period for the Company’s share of the investee’s income or loss and dividends paid. Securities accounted for under the equity method are reviewed quarterly for changes in circumstance or the occurrence of events that suggest the Company’s investment may not be recoverable.

Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

The Company grants credit to customers in the normal course of business and maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for potential credit losses. When evaluating allowances for doubtful accounts, the Company considers various factors, including historical experience and customer-specific information. Uncollectible accounts are written-off against the allowance when it is deemed that a customer account is uncollectible.

Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, with cost determined on a first-in, first-out basis. The Company reduces the carrying value of inventories for items that are potentially excess, obsolete, or slow-moving based on changes in customer demand, technology developments, or other economic factors.

Property, Plant, and Equipment

Property, plant, and equipment is stated at cost. Additions and improvements that extend the lives of the assets are capitalized, while expenditures for repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. The Company assesses property, plant, and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of property, plant, and equipment asset groupings may not be recoverable. The Company utilizes the straight-line method of depreciation over the estimated useful lives of the various assets. The cost of interest that is incurred in connection with ongoing construction projects is capitalized using a weighted average interest rate. These costs are included in property, plant, and equipment and amortized over the useful life of the related asset. Upon retirement or disposal of property, plant, and equipment, the costs and related amounts of accumulated depreciation or amortization are eliminated from the asset and accumulated depreciation accounts. The difference, if any, between the net asset value and the proceeds, is recognized in earnings.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets

Goodwill is the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of net assets of acquired businesses. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, goodwill is not amortized. The Company assesses goodwill for impairment annually in the third quarter of the fiscal year and whenever an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount may be impaired. Impairment testing for goodwill is performed at a reporting unit level. There were no changes in reporting units during fiscal year


. The test for impairment of goodwill requires the Company to make several estimates about fair value, most of which are based on projected future cash flows. The Company calculates the excess of each reporting unit's fair value over its carrying amount, including goodwill, utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis. An impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s net assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit.

Intangible assets include patents, trademarks, tradenames, customer relationships, purchased technology, and in-process research and development (IPR&D). Intangible assets with a definite life are amortized on a straight-line basis with estimated useful lives typically ranging from

three

to


years

. Amortization is recognized within

amortization of intangible assets

in the consolidated statements of income. Intangible assets with a definite life are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an intangible asset (asset group) may not be recoverable. When events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an intangible asset may not be recoverable, the Company calculates the excess of an intangible asset's carrying value over its undiscounted future cash flows. If the carrying value is not recoverable, an impairment loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value. The inputs used in the fair value analysis fall within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy due to the use of significant unobservable inputs to determine fair value.

Acquired IPR&D represents the fair value assigned to those research and development projects that were acquired in a business combination for which the related products have not received regulatory approval and have no alternative future use. IPR&D is capitalized at its fair value as an indefinite-lived intangible asset, and any development costs incurred after the acquisition are expensed as incurred. The fair value of IPR&D is determined by estimating the future cash flows of each project and discounting the net cash flows back to their present values. Upon achieving regulatory approval or commercial viability for the related product, the indefinite-lived intangible asset is accounted for as a definite-lived asset and is amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life. If the project is not completed or is terminated or abandoned, the Company may have an impairment related to the IPR&D which is charged to expense. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually in the third quarter of the fiscal year and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may be impaired. Impairment is calculated as the excess of the asset’s carrying value over its fair value. Fair value is generally determined using a discounted future cash flow analysis. IPR&D acquired outside of a business combination is expensed immediately.

Contingent Consideration

Certain of the Company’s business combinations involve potential payment of future consideration that is contingent upon the achievement of certain product development milestones and/or contingent on the acquired business reaching certain performance milestones. The Company records contingent consideration at fair value at the date of acquisition based on the consideration expected to be transferred, estimated as the probability-weighted future cash flows, discounted back to present value. The fair value of contingent consideration is measured using projected payment dates, discount rates, probabilities of payment, and projected revenues (for revenue-based considerations). Projected revenues are based on the Company’s most recent internal operational budgets and long-range strategic plans. The discount rate used is determined at the time of measurement in accordance with accepted valuation methodologies. Changes in projected revenues, probabilities of payment, discount rates, and projected payment dates may result in adjustments to the fair value measurements. Contingent consideration is remeasured each reporting period using Level 3 inputs, and the change in fair value, including accretion for the passage of time, is recognized as income or expense within

other operating expense, net

in the consolidated statements of income. Contingent consideration payments made soon after the acquisition date are classified as investing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. Contingent consideration payments not made soon after the acquisition date that are related to the acquisition date fair value are



Medtronic plc

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

reported as financing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows, and amounts paid in excess of the original acquisition date fair value are reported as operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.

Self-Insurance

The Company self-insures the majority of its insurable risks, including medical and dental costs, disability coverage, physical loss to property, business interruptions, workers’ compensation, comprehensive general, and product liability. Insurance coverage is obtained for risks required to be insured by law or contract. The Company uses claims data and historical experience, as applicable, to estimate liabilities associated with the exposures that the Company has self-insured.

Retirement Benefit Plan Assumptions

The Company sponsors various retirement benefit plans, including defined benefit pension plans, post-retirement medical plans, defined contribution savings plans, and termination indemnity plans, covering substantially all U.S. employees and many employees outside the U.S. See Note


for assumptions used in determining pension and post-retirement benefit costs and liabilities.

Derivatives

The Company recognizes all derivative financial instruments in its consolidated financial statements at fair value in accordance with authoritative guidance on derivatives and hedging, and presents assets and liabilities associated with derivative financial instruments on a gross basis in the consolidated financial statements. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as hedging instruments, the hedging instrument must be designated, based upon the exposure being hedged, as a fair value hedge or a cash flow hedge. See Note


for more information on the Company's derivative instruments and hedging programs.

Fair Value Measurements

The Company follows the authoritative guidance on fair value measurements and disclosures with respect to assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on both a recurring and nonrecurring basis. Fair value is defined as the exit price, or the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants as of the measurement date. The authoritative guidance also establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available. Observable inputs are inputs market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability, based on market data obtained from sources independent of the Company. Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the Company’s assumptions about the factors market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability developed based upon the best information available in the circumstances. The categorization of financial assets and financial liabilities within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The hierarchy is broken down into three levels defined as follows:

•

Level 1 - Inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

•

Level 2 - Inputs include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, and inputs (other than quoted prices) that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.

•

Level 3 - Inputs are unobservable for the asset or liability.

Financial assets that are classified as Level 1 securities include highly liquid government bonds within U.S. government and agency securities and marketable equity securities for which quoted market prices are available. In addition, the Company classifies currency forward contracts as Level 1 since they are valued using quoted market prices in active markets which have identical assets or liabilities.

The valuation for most fixed maturity securities are classified as Level 2. Financial assets that are classified as Level 2 include corporate debt securities, government and agency securities, other asset-backed securities, debt funds, and mortgage-backed securities whose value is determined using inputs that are observable in the market or may be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data such as pricing for similar securities, recently executed transactions, cash flow models with yield curves, and benchmark securities. In addition, interest rate swaps and total return swaps are included in Level 2 as the Company uses inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset. The Level 2 derivative instruments are primarily valued using standard calculations and models that use readily observable market data as their basis.

Financial assets are considered Level 3 when their fair values are determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques, and at least one significant model assumption or input is unobservable. Financial assets that are classified as Level 3 include certain investment securities for which there is limited market activity such that the determination of fair value requires significant judgment or estimation, certain corporate debt securities and auction rate securities. With the exception of auction rate securities, these securities are valued using third-party pricing sources that incorporate transaction details such as contractual terms, maturity, timing, and amount of expected future cash flows, as well as assumptions about liquidity and credit valuation adjustments by market participants. The fair value of auction rate securities is estimated by the Company using a discounted cash flow model, which incorporates significant unobservable inputs. The significant unobservable inputs used in the



Medtronic plc

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

fair value measurement of the Company’s auction rate securities are years to principal recovery and the illiquidity premium that is incorporated into the discount rate.

Certain investments for which the fair value is measured using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) practical expedient are excluded from the fair value hierarchy. Financial assets for which the fair value is measured using the net asset value per share practical expedient include certain debt funds, equity and fixed income commingled trusts, and registered investment companies.

Revenue Recognition

The Company sells its products through direct sales representatives and independent distributors. Additionally, a portion of the Company's revenue is generated from consignment inventory maintained at hospitals. The Company recognizes revenue when control is transferred to the customer. For products sold through direct sales representatives and independent distributors, control is transferred upon shipment or upon delivery, based on the contract terms and legal requirements. For consignment inventory, control is transferred when the product is used or implanted. Payment terms vary depending on the country of sale, type of customer, and type of product.

If a contract contains more than one performance obligation, the transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation based on relative standalone selling price. Shipping and handling is treated as a fulfillment activity rather than a promised service, and therefore, is not considered a performance obligation. Taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are both imposed on, and concurrent with, a specific revenue producing transaction and collected by the Company from customers (for example, sales, use, value added, and some excise taxes) are not included in revenue. For contracts that have an original duration of one year or less, the Company uses the practical expedient applicable to such contracts and does not adjust the transaction price for the time value of money.

The amount of revenue recognized reflects sales rebates and returns, which are estimated based on sales terms, historical experience, and trend analysis. In estimating rebates, the Company considers the lag time between the point of sale and the payment of the rebate claim, the stated rebate rates, and other relevant information. The Company records adjustments to rebates and returns reserves as increases or decreases of revenue.

The Company offers warranties on various products. For standard, assurance-type warranties, the Company estimates the costs that may be incurred under its warranties and records a liability in the amount of such costs at the time the product is sold. The amount of the reserve is equal to the net costs to repair or otherwise satisfy the obligation. The Company includes the warranty obligation in

other accrued expenses

and

other liabilities

in the consolidated balance sheets. For extended, service-type warranties, a portion of the transaction price is allocated to the performance obligation. Warranty obligations at April 26, 2019 and April 27, 2018 were

not

material.

The Company records a deferred revenue liability if a customer pays consideration before the Company transfers a good or service to the customer. Deferred revenue primarily represents remote monitoring services and equipment maintenance, for which consideration is received at the same time as consideration for the device or equipment. Deferred revenue also includes extended, service-type warranties. Revenue related to remote monitoring services, equipment maintenance, and service-type warranties is recognized over the service period as time elapses.

Remaining performance obligations include deferred revenue and amounts the Company expects to receive for goods and services that have not yet been delivered or provided under existing, noncancellable contracts with minimum purchase commitments, primarily related to consumables for previously sold equipment as well as remote monitoring services and equipment maintenance. For contracts that have an original duration of one year or less, the Company has elected the practical expedient applicable to such contracts and does not disclose the transaction price for remaining performance obligations at the end of each reporting period and when the Company expects to recognize this revenue.

Shipping and Handling

Shipping and handling costs incurred to physically move product from the Company's premises to the customer's premises are recognized in

selling, general, and administrative expense

in the consolidated statements of income and were

$

, and


, respectively. Other shipping and handling costs incurred to store, move, and prepare products for shipment are recognized in

in the consolidated statements of income.

Research and Development

Research and development costs are expensed when incurred. Research and development costs include costs of other research, engineering, and technical activities to develop a new product or service or make significant improvement to an existing product or manufacturing process. Research and development costs also include pre-approval regulatory and clinical trial expenses.



Medtronic plc

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Contingencies

The Company records a liability in the consolidated financial statements for loss contingencies when a loss is known or considered probable and the amount may be reasonably estimated. If the reasonable estimate of a known or probable loss is a range, and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other, the minimum amount of the range is accrued. If a loss is reasonably possible but not known or probable, and may be reasonably estimated, the estimated loss or range of loss is disclosed. Insurance recoveries related to potential claims are recognized up to the amount of the recorded liability when coverage is confirmed and the estimated recoveries are probable of payment. These recoveries are not netted against the related liabilities for financial statement presentation.

Income Taxes

The Company has deferred taxes that arise as a result of the different treatment of transactions for U.S. GAAP and income tax accounting, known as temporary differences. The Company records the tax effect of these temporary differences as deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that may be used as a tax deduction or credit in a tax return in future years for which the Company has already recognized the tax benefit in the consolidated statements of income. The Company establishes valuation allowances for deferred tax assets when the amount of expected future taxable income is not likely to support the use of the deduction or credit. Deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense for which payment has been deferred or expense has already been taken as a deduction on the Company’s tax return but has not yet been recognized as an expense in the consolidated statements of income.

Other Operating Expense, Net

Other operating expense, net primarily includes royalty income and expense, Transition Service Agreement income, intangible asset charges, currency transaction and derivative gains and losses, contributions to the Medtronic Foundation, Puerto Rico excise taxes, changes in the fair value of contingent consideration, and charges associated with business exits.

Other Non-Operating Income, Net

Other non-operating income, net includes the non-service component of net periodic pension and post-retirement benefit cost, investment gains and losses, and interest income.

Currency Translation

Assets and liabilities of non-U.S. dollar functional currency entities are translated to U.S. dollars at period-end exchange rates, and the currency impacts arising from the translation of the assets and liabilities are recorded as a cumulative translation adjustment, a component of

accumulated other comprehensive loss,

on the consolidated balance sheets. Elements of the consolidated statements of income are translated at the average monthly currency exchange rates in effect during the period. Currency transaction gains and losses are included in

other operating expense, net

in the consolidated statements of income.

Stock-Based Compensation

The Company measures stock-based compensation expense at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and recognizes the compensation expense over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period. The amount of stock-based compensation expense recognized during a period is based on the portion of the awards that are expected to vest. The Company estimates pre-vesting forfeitures at the time of grant and revises the estimates in subsequent periods.

New Accounting Standards

Recently Adopted

In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued amended revenue recognition guidance to clarify the principles for recognizing revenue from contracts with customers. The guidance requires an entity to recognize revenue in an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for the transfer of goods or services. The guidance also requires expanded disclosures relating to the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. Additionally, qualitative and quantitative disclosures are required about customer contracts, significant judgments and changes in judgments, and assets recognized from the costs to obtain or fulfill a contract. The Company adopted this guidance using the modified retrospective method in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019, and elected to apply the guidance only to contracts that were not completed as of the date of initial application. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.

In January 2016, the FASB issued guidance which requires equity investments (except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation of the investee) to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. The guidance also includes a simplified impairment assessment of equity investments without readily determinable fair values and presentation and disclosure changes. The Company adopted this guidance in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 on a prospective basis. As a result of the adoption, the Company reclassified

$


million

from

accumulated other comprehensive loss

to the opening balance of

retained earnings

as of April 28, 2018.

In March 2017, the FASB issued guidance which changes the financial statement presentation requirements for pension and other post-retirement benefit expense. While service cost will continue to be recognized in the same financial statement line items as other current employee compensation costs, the guidance requires all other non-service components of net benefit costs to be



Medtronic plc

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

classified and presented outside of income from operations. The Company adopted this guidance in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019, and the consolidated statements of income were retrospectively adjusted. For fiscal years 2018 and 2017, the Company reclassified

$


million

of income and

$


million

of expense, respectively, of non-service components of net periodic benefit costs, which were previously presented as a component of operating profit, to

other non-operating income, net

.

Not Yet Adopted

In February 2016, the FASB issued guidance which requires lessees to recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet. The guidance will be adopted using the modified retrospective method by applying the new guidance as of the transition date with a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption.  The Company will elect the package of practical expedients upon adoption which allows the Company to not reassess whether any expired or existing contracts are or contain leases, the classification of any expired or existing leases or any initial direct costs for existing leases. Further, the Company will make accounting policy elections to not apply the recognition requirements to short-term leases and to account for lease and nonlease components as a single lease component.

This guidance is effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2020. As a result of adopting the guidance, the Company expects to record right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for operating leases in an amount of approximately

one

percent of total assets on the consolidated balance sheet. The Company expects the adoption to have an immaterial impact on the consolidated statements of income and cash flows. The Company will also make additional lease related disclosures in the footnotes to the Company's consolidated financial statements upon adoption.

Revenue

The Company's revenues are principally derived from device-based medical therapies and services related to cardiac rhythm disorders, cardiovascular disease, renal disease, neurological disorders and diseases, spinal conditions and musculoskeletal trauma, chronic pain, urological and digestive disorders, ear, nose, and throat conditions, and diabetes conditions as well as advanced and general surgical care products, respiratory and monitoring solutions, and neurological surgery technologies. The Company's primary customers include hospitals, clinics, third-party health care providers, distributors, and other institutions, including governmental health care programs and group purchasing organizations.

Acquisitions

The Company had acquisitions during fiscal years


and


that were accounted for as business combinations. The assets and liabilities of businesses acquired were recorded and consolidated on the acquisition date at their respective fair values. Goodwill resulting from business combinations is largely attributable to future yet to be defined technologies, new customer relationships, existing workforce of the acquired businesses, and synergies expected to arise after the Company's acquisition of these businesses. The pro forma impact of acquisitions during fiscal years


and


was not significant, either individually or in the aggregate, to the results of the Company. The results of operations of acquired businesses have been included in the Company’s consolidated statements of income since the date each business was acquired.

Enterprise Excellence

In the third quarter of fiscal year 2018, the Company announced its Enterprise Excellence restructuring program, which is expected to leverage the Company's global size and scale, as well as enhance the customer and employee experience, with a focus on three objectives: global operations, functional optimization, and commercial optimization. Primary activities of the restructuring program include integrating and enhancing global manufacturing and supply processes, systems and site presence, enhancing and leveraging global operating models across several enabling functions, and optimizing certain commercial processes, systems, and models.

The Company estimates that, in connection with its Enterprise Excellence restructuring program, it will recognize pre-tax exit and disposal costs and other costs associated with the restructuring program across all segments of approximately

$

1.6

billion

to

$

1.8

billion

, the majority of which are expected to be incurred by the end of fiscal year 2022. Approximately half of the estimated charges are related to employee termination benefits. The remaining restructuring charges are costs associated with the restructuring program, such as salaries for employees supporting the program and consulting expenses. These charges are recognized within

Financial Instruments

Debt Securities

The Company holds investments in marketable debt securities that are classified and accounted for as available-for-sale and are remeasured on a recurring basis. Refer to Note


for information regarding valuation techniques and inputs used in the fair value measurements.

The following table presents the unobservable inputs utilized in the fair value measurement of the auction rate securities classified as Level 3 at

:



Medtronic plc

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

The Company reviews the fair value hierarchy classification on a quarterly basis. Changes in the ability to observe valuation inputs may result in a reclassification of levels for certain securities within the fair value hierarchy. The Company’s policy is to recognize transfers into and out of levels within the fair value hierarchy at the end of the fiscal quarter in which the actual event or change in circumstances that caused the transfer occurs. There were no transfers between Level 1, Level 2, or Level 3 during fiscal years


or


. When a determination is made to classify an asset or liability within Level 3, the determination is based upon the significance of the unobservable inputs to the overall fair value measurement.

The following table provides a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of items measured at fair value on a recurring basis that used significant unobservable inputs (Level 3):

Activity related to the Company’s debt securities portfolio is as follows:

Credit losses represent the difference between the present value of cash flows expected to be collected on certain mortgage-backed securities and auction rate securities and the amortized cost of these securities. Based on the Company’s assessment of the credit quality of the underlying collateral and credit support available to each of the remaining securities in which the Company is invested, the Company believes it has recognized all necessary other-than-temporary impairments, as the Company does not have the intent to sell, nor is it more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell, before recovery of the amortized cost.

At

April 26, 2019

and

April 27, 2018

, the credit loss portion of other-than temporary impairments on debt securities was

no

t significant. The total reductions for available-for-sale debt securities sold during fiscal years


and


were

no

t significant.

The

April 26, 2019

balance of available-for-sale debt securities by contractual maturity is shown in the following table. Within the table, maturities of mortgage-backed securities have been allocated based upon timing of estimated cash flows assuming no change in the current interest rate environment. Actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities because the issuers of the securities may have the right to prepay obligations without prepayment penalties.

Equity Securities, Equity Method Investments, and Other Investments

The Company commonly holds investments in equity securities with readily determinable fair values, equity investments without readily determinable fair values, investments accounted for under the equity method, and other investments.



Medtronic plc

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Effective April 28, 2018, the Company adopted accounting standards update (ASU) 2016-01, which requires equity investments (except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation of the investee) to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. As a result of the adoption, the Company reclassified

$


million

from

accumulated other comprehensive loss

to the opening balance of

retained earnings

as of April 28, 2018. The Company uses quoted market prices to determine the fair value of equity securities with readily determinable fair values. For equity investments without readily determinable fair values that do not qualify for the practical expedient to estimate fair value using the net asset value per share or its equivalent, the Company has elected to measure these investments at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or similar investment of the same issuer. This election is made for each investment separately and is reassessed at each reporting period as to whether the investment continues to qualify for this election. Additionally, at each reporting period, the Company makes a qualitative assessment considering impairment indicators to evaluate whether the investment is impaired.

Equity securities with readily determinable fair values are included within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy, as they are measured using quoted market prices. Equity method investments and investments without readily determinable fair values, as described above, are included within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy due to the use of significant unobservable inputs to determine fair value. To determine the fair value of these investments, the Company uses all pertinent financial information available related to the investees, including financial statements, market participant valuations from recent and proposed equity offerings, and other third-party data.

The following table summarizes the Company's equity and other investments at

April 26, 2019

, which are classified as

other assets

in the consolidated balance sheets:

Prior to the adoption of ASU 2016-01, marketable equity securities were classified as available-for-sale and measured at fair value with unrealized changes recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI), net of deferred taxes. Gains and losses on available-for-sale marketable equity securities were recognized in net income when realized. The Company also accounted for certain investments without quoted market prices under the cost method of accounting.

The following table summarizes the values of the Company's equity and other investments by significant investment category and the related consolidated balance sheet classification at

April 27, 2018

:

(1)   Certain investments that are measured at the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient are excluded from the fair value hierarchy. The fair value amounts presented herein are intended to permit reconciliation to the consolidated balance sheets.

Net gains recognized during fiscal year


were

April 26, 2019

. Gross gains and losses for fiscal years


and


represent gains and losses on instruments sold during the period.

During fiscal year 2018, the Company received bids from potential buyers and investors for some or all of its ownership in a portfolio of selected investments, which indicated that the fair values of certain of the underlying cost and equity method investments in the portfolio may be below the respective carrying values. The Company determined that the decline in the fair values was other-than-temporary given the uncertainty regarding the Company’s intent to hold the investments for a period of time that would be sufficient to recover the carrying values. As a result, the Company recognized impairment charges of

$


million during fiscal year 2018, which were recognized in

other non-operating income, net

in the consolidated statements of income. The fair values of the investments were determined based on Level 3 inputs. The carrying values of the investments prior to recognizing the impairment charges was

Financing Arrangements

Current debt obligations consisted of the following:

Bank Borrowings

Outstanding bank borrowings at

were short-term advances to certain non-U.S. subsidiaries under credit agreements with various banks. Bank borrowings consist primarily of borrowings in Japanese Yen at an interest rate of

0.18

%

, and the borrowing is a natural hedge of currency and exchange rate risk.

Commercial Paper

On January 26, 2015, Medtronic Global Holdings S.C.A. (Medtronic Luxco), an entity organized under the laws of Luxembourg, entered into various agreements pursuant to which Medtronic Luxco may issue unsecured commercial paper notes (the 2015 Commercial Paper Program) on a private placement basis up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of

Line of Credit

On December 12, 2018, Medtronic Luxco, as borrower, entered into an amended and restated credit agreement (Credit Facility), by and among Medtronic, Medtronic, Inc., Medtronic Luxco, the lenders from time to time party thereto, and Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent and issuing bank, which expires in December 2023. The Credit Facility replaces the previous credit agreement dated November 7, 2014 and effective as of January 26, 2015.



Medtronic plc

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

The Credit Facility provides for a

one

-year extension of the maturity date. The Credit Facility provides the Company with the ability to increase its borrowing capacity by an additional

$

1.0

at any time during the term of the agreement. The Company and Medtronic, Inc. have guaranteed the obligations of the borrowers under the Credit Facility, and Medtronic Luxco will also guarantee the obligations of any designated borrower. The Credit Facility includes a multi-currency borrowing feature for certain specified foreign currencies. At

April 26, 2019

and

Derivatives and Currency Exchange Risk Management

The Company uses operational and economic hedges, as well as currency exchange rate derivative contracts and interest rate derivative instruments, to manage the impact of currency exchange and interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows. In addition, the Company uses cross-currency interest rate swaps to manage currency risk related to certain debt. In order to minimize earnings and cash flow volatility resulting from currency exchange rate changes, the Company enters into derivative instruments, principally forward currency exchange rate contracts. These contracts are designed to hedge anticipated foreign currency transactions and changes in the value of specific assets and liabilities. At inception of the contract, the derivative is designated as either a freestanding derivative or a cash flow hedge. The primary currencies of the derivative instruments are the Euro, Japanese Yen, and British Pound. The Company does not enter into currency exchange rate derivative contracts for speculative purposes. The gross notional



Medtronic plc

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

amount of all currency exchange rate derivative instruments outstanding was

$

11.1

billion

and

$

11.5

billion

at

April 26, 2019

and

April 27, 2018

, respectively.

The Company also uses derivative and non-derivative instruments to manage the impact of currency exchange rate changes on net investments in foreign currency-denominated operations. The information that follows explains the various types of derivatives and financial instruments used by the Company, reasons the Company uses such instruments, and the impact such instruments have on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets and statements of income.

Freestanding Derivative Contracts

Freestanding derivative contracts are primarily used to offset the Company’s exposure to the change in value of specific foreign-currency-denominated assets and liabilities and to offset variability of cash flows associated with forecasted transactions denominated in foreign currencies. The gross notional amount of the Company's currency exchange rate contracts outstanding at

April 26, 2019

and

April 27, 2018

was

$

4.3

billion

and

$

5.2

billion

, respectively. The Company's freestanding currency exchange rate contracts are not designated as hedges, and therefore, changes in the value of these contracts are recognized in earnings, thereby offsetting the current earnings effect of the related change in value of foreign-currency-denominated assets, liabilities, and cash flows.

The Company also entered into total return swaps in fiscal year


, which are used to hedge the liability of a non-qualified, deferred compensation plan. The gross notional amount of the Company's total return swaps outstanding at

April 26, 2019

and

April 27, 2018

was

$


million

and

$

April 26, 2019

, the Company had

$

7.8

billion

of outstanding Euro-denominated debt designated as a hedge of its net investment in certain of its European operations. These non-derivative instruments will mature beginning fiscal year 2021 through fiscal year 2039.

Additionally, during the fourth quarter of fiscal year


, the Company entered into and settled forward currency exchange rate contracts to manage the exposure to exchange rate movements in anticipation of the issuance of the 2019 Senior Notes. Certain of these forward currency exchange rate contracts were designated as a net investment hedge of certain of the Company's European operations. These contracts were terminated in conjunction with the issuance of the 2019 Senior Notes. Historically, the Company utilized forward currency exchange rate contracts designated as net investment hedges, all of which were terminated effective in fiscal year 2009 or prior.

For instruments that are designated and qualify as net investment hedges, the effective portion of the gains or losses is reported as a component of

Fair Value Hedges

Interest rate derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges are designed to manage the exposure to interest rate movements and to reduce borrowing costs by converting fixed-rate debt into floating-rate debt. Under these agreements, the Company agrees to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional principal amount.

Changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument are recognized in

interest expense

and are offset by changes in the fair value of the underlying debt instrument. The gains (losses) from terminated interest rate swap agreements are recognized in

Balance Sheet Presentation

The following tables summarize the balance sheet classification and fair value of derivative instruments included in the consolidated balance sheets at

April 26, 2019

and

April 27, 2018

. The fair value amounts are presented on a gross basis, and are segregated between derivatives that are designated and qualify as hedging instruments and those that are not designated and do not qualify as hedging instruments, and are further segregated by type of contract within those two categories.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

The following table provides information by level for the derivative assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis:

The Company has elected to present the fair value of derivative assets and liabilities within the consolidated balance sheets on a gross basis, even when derivative transactions are subject to master netting arrangements and may otherwise qualify for net presentation. The cash flows related to collateral posted and received are reported gross as investing and financing activities, respectively, in the consolidated statements of cash flows.

The following tables provide information as if the Company had elected to offset the asset and liability balances of derivative instruments, netted in accordance with various criteria as stipulated by the terms of the master netting arrangements with each of the counterparties. Derivatives not subject to master netting arrangements are not eligible for net presentation.

Concentrations of Credit Risk

Financial instruments, which potentially subject the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk, consist principally of interest-bearing investments, forward exchange derivative contracts, and trade accounts receivable. Global concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of customers and their dispersion across many geographic areas. The Company monitors the creditworthiness of its customers to which it grants credit terms in the normal course of business.

The Company maintains cash and cash equivalents, investments, and certain other financial instruments (including currency exchange rate and interest rate derivative contracts) with various major financial institutions. The Company performs periodic evaluations of the relative credit standings of these financial institutions and limits the amount of credit exposure with any one institution. In addition, the Company has collateral credit agreements with its primary derivatives counterparties. Under these agreements, either party is required to post eligible collateral when the market value of transactions covered by the agreement exceeds specific thresholds, thus limiting credit exposure for both parties. At

April 26, 2019

, the Company received net cash collateral of

$


million

from its counterparties. At

April 27, 2018

, the Company posted net securities collateral of

$

Dividends

The timing, declaration, and payment of future dividends to holders of the Company's ordinary and A Preferred shares falls within the discretion of the Company's Board of Directors and depends upon many factors, including the statutory requirements of Irish law, the Company's earnings and financial condition, the capital requirements of the Company's businesses, industry practice and any other factors the Board of Directors deems relevant.

Ordinary Share Repurchase Program

Shares are repurchased from time to time to support the Company’s stock-based compensation programs and to return capital to shareholders. During fiscal years


and


, the Company repurchased approximately


million

and


million

shares, respectively, at an average price of

$

91.43

and

$

83.71

, respectively.

In June 2015, the Company's Board of Directors authorized, subject to the ongoing existence of sufficient distributable reserves, the repurchase of


million

of the Company's ordinary shares. As described below, this authorization was replaced in June 2017. During fiscal year 2018, prior to the June 2017 repurchase program which became effective on June 26, 2017, the Company purchased approximately


million

shares authorized under the June 2015 repurchase program.

In June 2017, the Company’s Board of Directors replaced the June 2015 authorization to repurchase up to an aggregate number of ordinary shares with an authorization to expend up to an aggregate amount of

$

5.0

billion

beginning June 26, 2017 to repurchase the Company’s ordinary shares. In March 2019, the Company's Board of Directors authorized an incremental

Stock Purchase and Award Plans

The Medtronic, Inc. 2013 Stock Award and Incentive Plan was originally approved by the Company's shareholders in August 2013. In January 2015, the Company's Board of Directors approved an amendment to and assumption of the Medtronic, Inc. 2013 Stock Award and Incentive Plan, which created the Medtronic plc 2013 Stock Award and Incentive Plan (2013 Plan). In fiscal year


, the Company granted stock awards under the 2013 Plan. The 2013 Plan provides for the grant of non-qualified and incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance awards, and other stock and cash-based awards. At

April 26, 2019

, there were approximately


million

shares available for future grants under the 2013 Plan.

Share Options

Options are granted at the exercise price, which is equal to the closing price of the Company’s ordinary shares on the grant date. The majority of the Company’s options are non-qualified options with a


-year life and a


-year ratable vesting term. The Company also grants shares of performance-based share options that typically cliff vest after

three years

only if the Company has also achieved certain performance objectives. Performance awards are expensed over the performance period based on the probability of achieving the performance objectives.

Restricted Stock

Restricted stock awards and restricted stock units (collectively referred to as restricted stock) are granted to officers and key employees. At

April 26, 2019

, the Company does

no

t have any outstanding restricted stock awards. Beginning in fiscal year 2018, restricted stock units have a


-year ratable vesting term. Restricted stock units issued prior to fiscal year 2018 cliff vest after

four years

. The expense recognized for restricted stock units is equal to the grant date fair value, which is equal to the closing stock price on the date of grant. Restricted stock units are expensed over the vesting period and are subject to forfeiture if employment terminates prior to the lapse of the restrictions. The Company also grants shares of performance-based restricted stock units that typically cliff vest after

three years

only if the Company has also achieved certain performance objectives. Performance awards are expensed over the performance period based on the probability of achieving the performance objectives.

Restricted stock units are not considered issued or outstanding ordinary shares of the Company. Dividend equivalent units are accumulated on restricted stock units during the vesting period. At

April 26, 2019

, all restricted stock outstanding were restricted stock units.

Employees Stock Purchase Plan

The Medtronic plc Amended and Restated 2014 Employees Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) allows participating employees to purchase the Company's ordinary shares at a discount through payroll deductions. The expense recognized for shares purchased under the Company’s ESPP is equal to the


percent

discount the employee receives at the end of the calendar quarter purchase period.

Employees may contribute between


percent and


percent

of their wages or the statutory limit under the U.S. Internal Revenue Code toward the purchase of newly-issued ordinary shares of the Company at


percent

of its market value at the end of the calendar quarter purchase period. Employees purchased


million

shares at an average price of

$

77.74

per share in fiscal year


. At

April 26, 2019

, plan participants had approximately

$


million

withheld to purchase the Company's ordinary shares at


percent

of its market value on June 28, 2019, the last trading day before the end of the calendar quarter purchase period. At

April 26, 2019

, approximately


million

ordinary shares were available for future purchase under the ESPP.

Stock Option Valuation Assumptions

The Company uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model (Black-Scholes model) to determine the fair value of stock options at the grant date. The fair value of stock options under the Black-Scholes model requires management to make assumptions regarding projected employee stock option exercise behaviors, risk-free interest rates, volatility of the Company’s stock price, and expected dividends.

The following table provides the weighted average fair value of options granted to employees and the related assumptions used in the Black-Scholes model:

(1)

The Company analyzes historical employee stock option exercise and termination data to estimate the expected life assumption. The Company calculates the expected life assumption using the midpoint scenario, which combines historical exercise data with hypothetical exercise data, as the Company believes this data currently represents the best estimate of the expected life of a new employee option.

(2)

The rate is based on the grant date yield of a zero-coupon U.S. Treasury bond whose maturity period equals the expected term of the option.

(3)

Expected volatility is based on a blend of historical volatility and an implied volatility of the Company’s ordinary shares. Implied volatility is based on market traded options of the Company’s ordinary shares.

(4)

The dividend yield rate is calculated by dividing the Company’s annual dividend, based on the most recent quarterly dividend rate, by the closing stock price on the grant date.

Income Taxes

The income tax provision is based on income before income taxes reported for financial statement purposes.

The components of income before income taxes, based on tax jurisdiction, are as follows:

The income tax provision consists of the following:

On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation, commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "Tax Act"), which significantly revises U.S. corporate income taxation by, among other things, lowering the U.S. corporate income tax rate from

35.0 percent

to

21.0 percent

effective January 1, 2018, broadening the base of taxation, implementing a territorial tax system, and imposing a repatriation tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries.

The Company has recorded a cumulative income tax charge associated with the Tax Act totaling

$

2.4

billion

. The

$

2.4

billion

charge is made up of the following components:

•

A

$

2.4

billion

charge associated with the one-time repatriation tax based on post-1986 undistributed earnings and profits not previously subject to U.S. income tax and whether such earnings were held in cash or other specified assets.

•

A

$


million

charge resulting from the removal of the permanent reinvestment assertion on earnings and profits through April 27, 2018 for entities subject to the one-time repatriation tax.

•

A

$


million

net benefit associated with the remeasurement of U.S. Federal deferred tax assets, liabilities, and valuation allowances, and impacts from the decrease in the U.S. statutory tax rate.

The Company made the accounting policy election to treat taxes due on U.S. inclusions in taxable income related to Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI) as a current period expense when incurred (the "period cost method").



Medtronic plc

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Tax assets (liabilities), shown before jurisdictional netting of deferred tax assets (liabilities), are comprised of the following:

No deferred taxes have been provided on the approximately

$

64.1

billion

and

$

61.0

billion

of undistributed earnings of the Company’s subsidiaries at

April 26, 2019

and

April 27, 2018

, respectively, since these earnings have been, and under current plans will continue to be, permanently reinvested in these subsidiaries. During fiscal year


, the Company removed its permanently reinvested assertion on the undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries with a U.S. parent which were subject to the transition tax. The Company removed the assertion for all earnings of such subsidiaries through

April 27, 2018

and reasserted for earnings generated in subsequent fiscal years. Due to the number of legal entities and jurisdictions involved, the complexity of the legal entity structure of the Company, and the complexity of the tax laws in the relevant jurisdictions, the Company believes it is not practicable to estimate, within any reasonable range, the amount of additional taxes which may be payable upon distribution of these undistributed earnings.

At

April 26, 2019

, the Company had approximately

$

26.2

billion

of net operating loss carryforwards in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions, of which

$

22.9

billion

have no expiration, and the remaining

$

3.3

billion

will expire during fiscal years 2020 through 2039. Included in these net operating loss carryforwards are

$

18.1

billion

of net operating losses related to a subsidiary of the Company, substantially all of which were recorded in fiscal 2008 as a result of the receipt of a favorable tax ruling from certain non-U.S. taxing authorities. The Company has recorded a full valuation allowance against these net operating losses, as management does not believe that it is more likely than not that these net operating losses will be utilized. Certain of the remaining non-U.S.



Medtronic plc

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

net operating loss carryforwards of

$

8.1

billion

have a valuation allowance recorded against the carryforwards, as management does not believe that it is more likely than not that these net operating losses will be utilized.

At

April 26, 2019

, the Company had

$


million

of U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards, which will expire during fiscal years 2020 through 2036. For U.S. state purposes, the Company had

$

1.3

billion

of net operating loss carryforwards at

April 26, 2019

, which will expire during fiscal years 2020 through 2039.

At

April 26, 2019

, the Company also had

$


million

of tax credits available to reduce future income taxes payable, of which

$


million

have no expiration. The remaining credits expire during fiscal years 2020 through 2039.

The Company has established valuation allowances of

$

6.3

billion

and

$

7.2

billion

at

April 26, 2019

and

April 27, 2018

, respectively, primarily related to the uncertainty of the utilization of certain deferred tax assets which are primarily comprised of tax loss and credit carryforwards in various jurisdictions. The decrease in the valuation allowance during fiscal year


is primarily related to tax rate changes and the effects of currency fluctuations. These valuation allowances would result in a reduction to the income tax provision in the consolidated statements of income if they are ultimately not required.

The Company’s effective income tax rate varied from the U.S. federal statutory tax rate as follows:

During fiscal year


, certain tax adjustments of

$


million

, recognized in

income tax provision

in the consolidated statements of income, included the following:

•

A net benefit of

•

A charge of

This resolution does not include the businesses that are the subject of the Medtronic, Inc. U.S. Tax Court case for fiscal years 2005 and 2006.

•

A net charge of

$


million

associated with the divestiture of a portion of the Patient Care, Deep Vein Thrombosis, and Nutritional Insufficiency businesses.  The net charge primarily relates to the tax effect from the recognition of the outside basis difference of certain subsidiaries, which are included in the expected divestiture.

•

A charge of

$


million

associated with the IRS’s disallowance of the utilization of certain net operating losses, along with the recognition of a valuation allowance against the net operating loss deferred tax asset, which were recognized during the year.

•

A charge of

$


million

as a result of the redemption of an intercompany minority interest during the year.

•

A benefit of

$

as the result of the resolution of Covidien's previously disclosed Tyco International plc intercompany debt issues with the U.S. Tax Court and the Appeals Division of the IRS.

Currently, the Company’s operations in Puerto Rico, Switzerland, Singapore, Dominican Republic, Costa Rica, China, and Israel have various tax holidays and tax incentive grants. The tax reductions as compared to the local statutory rate favorably impacted earnings by

$


million

,

$

,


, and


, respectively, and earnings per diluted share by

$

0.32

,

$

0.33

in fiscal years


,


, and


, respectively. The tax holidays are conditional upon the Company meeting certain thresholds required under statutory law. The tax incentive grants, unless extended, will expire between fiscal years 2020 and 2030. The Company’s historical practice has been to renew, extend, or obtain new tax incentive grants upon expiration of existing tax incentive grants. If the Company is not able to renew, extend, or obtain new tax incentive grants, the expiration of existing tax incentive grants could have a material impact on the Company’s financial results in future periods. The tax incentive grants which expired during fiscal year


did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.

The Company had

$

would impact the Company’s effective tax rate, respectively. Although the Company believes that it has adequately provided for liabilities resulting from tax assessments by taxing authorities, positions taken by these tax authorities could have a material impact on the Company’s effective tax rate in future periods. The Company has recorded gross unrecognized tax benefits, net of cash advance, of

$


million

as a noncurrent liability which is not expected to decrease within the next 12 months.

The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to income tax matters in

The Company’s reserves for uncertain tax positions related to unresolved matters with the IRS and other taxing authorities. These reserves are subject to a high degree of estimation and management judgment. Resolution of these significant unresolved matters, or positions taken by the IRS or other tax authorities during future tax audits, could have a material impact on the Company’s financial results in future periods. The Company continues to believe that its reserves for uncertain tax positions are appropriate and that it has meritorious defenses for its tax filings and will vigorously defend them during the audit process, appellate process, and through litigation in courts, as necessary.

The major tax jurisdictions where the Company conducts business which remain subject to examination are as follows:

Earnings Per Share

Earnings per share is calculated using the two-class method, as the Company's A Preferred Shares are considered participating securities. Accordingly, earnings are allocated to both ordinary shares and participating securities in determining earnings per ordinary share. Due to the limited number of A Preferred Shares outstanding, this allocation had no effect on the ordinary earnings



Medtronic plc

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

per share; therefore, it is not presented below. Basic earnings per share is computed based on the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share is computed based on the weighted number of ordinary shares outstanding, increased by the number of additional shares that would have been outstanding had the potentially dilutive ordinary shares been issued, and reduced by the number of shares the Company could have repurchased with the proceeds from issuance of the potentially dilutive shares. Potentially dilutive ordinary shares include stock-based awards granted under stock-based compensation plans and shares committed to be purchased under the employee stock purchase plan.

The table below sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share:

The calculation of weighted average diluted shares outstanding excludes options to purchase approximately


million

,


million

, and


million

ordinary shares in fiscal years

, and


, respectively, because their effect would have been anti-dilutive on the Company’s earnings per share.


.

Retirement Benefit Plans

The Company sponsors various retirement benefit plans, including defined benefit pension plans, post-retirement medical plans, defined contribution savings plans, and termination indemnity plans, covering substantially all U.S. employees and many employees outside the U.S. The expense related to these plans was

In the U.S., the Company maintains a qualified pension plan designed to provide guaranteed minimum retirement benefits to all eligible U.S. employees. Pension coverage for non-U.S. employees is provided, to the extent deemed appropriate, through separate plans. In addition to the benefits provided under the qualified pension plan, retirement benefits associated with wages in excess of the IRS allowable limits are provided to certain employees under a non-qualified plan. U.S. and Puerto Rico employees are also eligible to receive a medical benefit component, in addition to normal retirement benefits, through the Company’s post-retirement benefits.

At

April 26, 2019

and

million

, respectively.



Medtronic plc

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

The actuarial assumptions are as follows:

The Company utilizes a full yield curve approach methodology to estimate the service and interest cost components of net periodic pension cost and net periodic post-retirement benefit cost for the Company’s pension and other post-retirement benefits. The full yield curve approach applies specific spot rates along the yield curve to their underlying projected cash flows in estimation of the cost components. The current yield curves represent high quality, long-term fixed income instruments.

The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumptions are determined using a building block approach, considering historical averages and real returns of each asset class. In certain countries, where historical returns are not meaningful, consideration is given to local market expectations of long-term returns.

Retirement Benefit Plan Investment Strategy

The Company sponsors trusts that hold the assets for U.S. pension plans and other U.S. post-retirement benefit plans, primarily retiree medical benefits. For investment purposes, the legacy Medtronic U.S. pension and other U.S. post-retirement benefit plans are managed in an identical way, as their objectives are similar.

The Company has a Qualified Plan Committee (the Plan Committee) that sets investment guidelines for U.S. pension plans and other U.S. post-retirement benefit plans with the assistance of external consultants. These guidelines are established based on market conditions, risk tolerance, funding requirements, and expected benefit payments. The Plan Committee also oversees the investment allocation process, selects the investment managers, and monitors asset performance. As pension liabilities are long-term in nature, the Company employs a long-term total return approach to maximize the long-term rate of return on plan assets for a prudent level of risk. An annual analysis on the risk versus the return of the investment portfolio is conducted to justify the expected long-term rate of return assumption.

The investment portfolios contain a diversified allocation of investment categories, including equities, fixed income securities, hedge funds, and private equity. Securities are also diversified in terms of domestic and international, short- and long-term, growth and value styles, large cap and small cap stocks, and active and passive management.

Outside the U.S., pension plan assets are typically managed by decentralized fiduciary committees. There is significant variation in policy asset allocation from country to country. Local regulations, funding rules, and financial and tax considerations are part of the funding and investment allocation process in each country. The weighted average target asset allocations at

Retirement Benefit Plan Asset Fair Values

The following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for retirement benefit plan assets measured at fair value:

Short-term investments:

Valued at the closing price reported in the active markets in which the individual security is traded.

U.S. government securities:

Certain U.S. government securities are valued at the closing price reported in the active markets in which the individual security is traded. Other U.S. government securities are valued based on inputs other than quoted prices that are observable.

Corporate debt securities:

Valued based on inputs other than quoted prices that are observable.

Equity commingled trusts:

Comprised of investments in equity securities held in pooled investment vehicles. The valuations of equity commingled trusts are based on the respective net asset values which are determined by the fund daily at market close. The net asset values are calculated based on the valuation of the underlying assets which are determined using observable inputs. The net asset values are not publicly reported and funds are valued at the net asset value practical expedient.

Fixed income commingled trusts:

Comprised of investments in fixed income securities held in pooled investment vehicles. The valuations of fixed income commingled trusts are based on the respective net asset values which are determined by the fund daily at market close. The net asset values are calculated based on the valuation of the underlying assets which are determined using observable inputs. The net asset values are not publicly reported and funds are valued at the net asset value practical expedient.

Partnership units:

Valued based on the year-end net asset values of the underlying partnerships. The net asset values of the partnerships are based on the fair values of the underlying investments of the partnerships. Quoted market prices are used to value the underlying investments of the partnerships, where the partnerships consist of the investment pools which invest primarily in common stocks. Partnership units include partnerships, private equity investments, and real asset investments. Partnerships primarily include long/short equity and absolute return strategies. These investments may be redeemed monthly with notice periods ranging from


to


days. At

April 26, 2019

, there are

no

funds in the process of liquidation. Private equity investments consist of common stock and debt instruments of private companies. For private equity funds, the sum of the unfunded commitments at

April 26, 2019

is

$


million

, and the estimated liquidation period of these funds is expected to be

one

to


years

. Real asset investments consist of commodities, derivatives, Real Estate Investment Trusts, and illiquid real estate holdings. These investments have redemption and liquidation periods ranging from


days

to


years

. At

April 26, 2019

, there are

no

real estate investments in the process of liquidation. Valuation procedures are utilized to arrive at fair value if a quoted market price is not available for a partnership investment.

Registered investment companies:

Valued at net asset values which are not publicly reported. The net asset values are calculated based on the valuation of the underlying assets. The underlying assets are valued at the quoted market prices of shares held by the plan at year-end in the active market on which the individual securities are traded.

Insurance contracts:

Comprised of investments in collective (group) insurance contracts, consisting of individual insurance policies. The policyholder is the employer and each member is the owner/beneficiary of their individual insurance policy. These policies are a part of the insurance company’s general portfolio and participate in the insurer’s profit-sharing policy on an excess yield basis.

The methods described above may produce fair values that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values. Furthermore, while the Company believes its valuation methodologies are appropriate and consistent with other market



Medtronic plc

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different fair value measurement at the reporting date.

There were no transfers between Level 1, Level 2, or Level 3 during fiscal years


or


.

The following tables provide information by level for the retirement benefit plan assets that are measured at fair value, as defined by U.S. GAAP. See Note 1 for discussion of the fair value measurement terms of Levels 1, 2, and 3. In accordance with authoritative guidance adopted in fiscal year 2017, certain investments for which the fair value is measured using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) practical expedient are not presented within the fair value hierarchy. The fair value amounts presented for these investments are intended to permit reconciliation to the total fair value of plan assets at April 26, 2019 and April 27, 2018.

Retirement Benefit Plan Funding

It is the Company’s policy to fund retirement costs within the limits of allowable tax deductions. During fiscal year


, the Company made discretionary contributions of approximately

$


million

to the U.S. pension plan. Internationally, the Company contributed approximately

$


million

for pension benefits during fiscal year


. The Company anticipates that it will make contributions of

$


million

and

$


million

to its U.S. pension benefit plans and non-U.S. pension benefit plans, respectively, in fiscal year


. Based on the guidelines under the U.S. Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 and the various guidelines which govern the plans outside the U.S., the majority of anticipated fiscal year 2020 contributions



Medtronic plc

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

will be discretionary. The Company believes that, along with pension assets, the returns on invested pension assets, and Company contributions, the Company will be able to meet its pension and other post-retirement obligations in the future.

Retiree benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, are anticipated to be paid as follows:

Post-retirement Benefit Plans

The net periodic benefit cost associated with the Company’s post-retirement benefit plans was income of

$

Defined Contribution Savings Plans

The Company has defined contribution savings plans that cover substantially all U.S. employees and certain non-U.S. employees. The general purpose of these plans is to provide additional financial security during retirement by providing employees with an incentive to make regular savings. Company contributions to the plans are based on employee contributions and Company performance. Expense recognized under these plans was

$

,

$


million

, and

$

, and


, respectively.

Effective May 1, 2005, the Company froze participation in the original defined benefit pension plan in the U.S. and implemented

two

new plans: an additional defined benefit pension plan, the Personal Pension Account (PPA), and a new defined contribution plan, the Personal Investment Account (PIA). Employees in the U.S. hired on or after May 1, 2005 but before January 1, 2016 had the option to participate in either the PPA or the PIA. Participants in the PPA receive an annual allocation of their salary and bonus on which they will receive an annual guaranteed rate of return, which is based on the

ten

-year Treasury bond rate. Participants in the PIA also receive an annual allocation of their salary and bonus; however, they are allowed to determine how to invest their funds among identified fund alternatives. The cost associated with the PPA is included in U.S. Pension Benefits in the tables presented earlier. The defined contribution cost associated with the PIA was approximately

$


million

,

$

Effective January 1, 2016, the Company froze participation in the existing defined benefit (PPA) and contribution (PIA) pension plans in the U.S. and implemented a new form of benefit under the existing defined contribution plan for legacy Covidien employees and employees in the U.S. hired on or after January 1, 2016. Participants in the Medtronic Core Contribution (MCC) also receive an annual allocation of their salary and bonus and are allowed to determine how to invest their funds among identified fund alternatives.

Commitments and Contingencies

Legal Matters

The Company and its affiliates are involved in a number of legal actions involving product liability, intellectual property and commercial disputes, shareholder related matters, environmental proceedings, income tax disputes, and governmental proceedings and investigations, including those described below. With respect to governmental proceedings and investigations, like other companies in our industry, the Company is subject to extensive regulation by national, state and local governmental agencies in the United States and in other jurisdictions in which the Company and its affiliates operate. As a result, interaction with governmental agencies is ongoing. The Company’s standard practice is to cooperate with regulators and investigators in responding to inquiries. The outcomes of legal actions are not within the Company’s complete control and may not be known for prolonged periods of time. In some actions, the enforcement agencies or private claimants seek damages, as well as other civil or criminal remedies (including injunctions barring the sale of products that are the subject of the proceeding), that could require significant expenditures, result in lost revenues, or limit the Company's ability to conduct business in the applicable jurisdictions.

The Company records a liability in the consolidated financial statements on an undiscounted basis for loss contingencies related to legal actions when a loss is known or considered probable and the amount may be reasonably estimated. If the reasonable estimate of a known or probable loss is a range, and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other, the minimum amount of the range is accrued. If a loss is reasonably possible but not known or probable, and may be reasonably estimated, the estimated loss or range of loss is disclosed. When determining the estimated loss or range of loss, significant judgment is required. Estimates of probable losses resulting from litigation and governmental proceedings involving the Company are inherently difficult to predict, particularly when the matters are in early procedural stages, with incomplete scientific facts or legal discovery, involve unsubstantiated or indeterminate claims for damages, potentially involve penalties, fines or punitive damages, or could result in a change in business practice. At

April 26, 2019

and

April 27, 2018

, accrued litigation was approximately

$

0.5

billion

and

$

0.9

billion

, respectively. The ultimate cost to the Company with respect to accrued litigation could be materially different than the amount of the current estimates and accruals and could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s consolidated earnings, financial position, and/or cash flows. The Company includes accrued litigation in

other accrued expenses

and

other liabilities

on the consolidated balance sheets. While it is not possible to predict the outcome for most of the legal matters discussed below, the Company believes it is possible that the costs associated with these matters could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s consolidated earnings, financial position, and/or cash flows.

Product Liability Matters

Sprint Fidelis

In 2007, a putative class action was filed in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice in Canada seeking damages for personal injuries allegedly related to the Company's Sprint Fidelis family of defibrillation leads. On October 20, 2009, the court certified a class proceeding but denied class certification on plaintiffs' claim for punitive damages. The Company has recognized an expense for probable and estimable damages related to this matter, and during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019 the Company paid out previously accrued settlement amounts with no admission of liability, bringing this matter to a conclusion.

INFUSE Litigation

The Company estimated law firms representing approximately

6,000

claimants asserted or intended to assert personal injury claims against Medtronic in the U.S. state and federal courts involving the INFUSE bone graft product. As of June 1, 2017, the Company



Medtronic plc

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

had reached agreements to settle substantially all of these claims, and during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019 the Company paid out previously accrued settlement amounts with no admission of liability, bringing this matter to a conclusion.

Pelvic Mesh Litigation

The Company is currently involved in litigation in various state and federal courts against manufacturers of pelvic mesh products alleging personal injuries resulting from the implantation of those products.

Two

subsidiaries of Covidien supplied pelvic mesh products to

one

of the manufacturers, C.R. Bard (Bard), named in the litigation. The litigation includes a federal multi-district litigation in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of West Virginia and cases in various state courts and jurisdictions outside the U.S. Generally, complaints allege design and manufacturing claims, failure to warn, breach of warranty, fraud, violations of state consumer protection laws and loss of consortium claims. In fiscal year 2016, Bard paid the Company

$


million

towards the settlement of

11,000

of these claims. In May 2017, the agreement with Bard was amended to extend the terms to apply to up to an additional

5,000

claims. That agreement does not resolve the dispute between the Company and Bard with respect to claims that do not settle, if any. As part of the agreement, the Company and Bard agreed to dismiss without prejudice their pending litigation with respect to Bard’s obligation to defend and indemnify the Company. The Company estimates law firms representing approximately

15,800

claimants have asserted or may assert claims involving products manufactured by Covidien’s subsidiaries. As of June 1, 2019, the Company had reached agreements to settle approximately

15,400

of these claims. The Company's accrued expenses for this matter are included within accrued litigation as discussed above.

Patent Litigation

Ethicon

On December 14, 2011, Ethicon filed an action against Covidien in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, alleging patent infringement and seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief. On January 22, 2014, the district court entered summary judgment in Covidien's favor, and the majority of this ruling was affirmed by the Federal Circuit on August 7, 2015.  Following appeal, the case was remanded back to the District Court with respect to

one

patent. On January 21, 2016, Covidien filed a second action in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, seeking a declaration of non-infringement with respect to a second set of patents held by Ethicon. The court consolidated this second action with the remaining patent issues from the first action. Following consolidation of the cases, Ethicon dismissed

six

of the asserted patents, leaving a single asserted patent. In addition to claims of non-infringement, the Company asserts an affirmative defense of invalidity. The Company has not recognized an expense related to damages in connection with this matter, because any potential loss is not currently probable or reasonably estimable under U.S. GAAP. Additionally, the Company is unable to reasonably estimate the range of loss, if any, that may result from this matter.

Sasso

The Company is involved in litigation in Indiana relating to certain patent and royalty disputes with Dr. Sasso under agreements originally entered into in 1999 and 2001. On November 28, 2018, a jury in Indiana state court returned a verdict against the Company for approximately

$


million

. The Company has strong arguments to appeal the verdict and has filed post-trial motions and appeals with the appropriate appellate courts. The Company has not recognized an expense in connection with this matter because it does not currently believe a loss is probable under U.S. GAAP.

Shareholder Related Matters

Covidien Acquisition

On July 2, 2014, Lewis Merenstein filed a putative shareholder class action in Hennepin County, Minnesota, District Court seeking to enjoin the then-potential acquisition of Covidien. The lawsuit named Medtronic, Inc., Covidien, and each member of the Medtronic, Inc. Board of Directors at the time as defendants, and alleged that the directors breached their fiduciary duties to shareholders with regard to the then-potential acquisition. On August 21, 2014, Kenneth Steiner filed a putative shareholder class action in Hennepin County, Minnesota, District Court, also seeking an injunction to prevent the potential Covidien acquisition. In September 2014, the

Merenstein

and

Steiner

matters were consolidated and in December 2014, the plaintiffs filed a preliminary injunction motion seeking to enjoin the Covidien transaction. On March 20, 2015, the District Court issued an order and opinion granting Medtronic’s motion to dismiss the case. In May of 2015, the plaintiffs filed an appeal, and, in January of 2016, the Minnesota State Court of Appeals affirmed in part, and reversed in part. On April 19, 2016, the Minnesota Supreme Court granted the Company’s petition to review the issue of whether most of the original claims are properly characterized as direct or derivative under Minnesota law. In August of 2017, the Minnesota Supreme Court affirmed the decision of the Minnesota State Court of Appeals, sending the matter back to the trial court for further proceedings, which are ongoing. The Company has not recognized



Medtronic plc

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

an expense related to damages in connection with this matter, because any potential loss is not currently probable or reasonably estimable under U.S. GAAP. Additionally, the Company is unable to reasonably estimate the range of loss, if any, that may result from these matters.

HeartWare

On January 22, 2016, the St. Paul Teachers’ Retirement Fund Association filed a putative class action complaint (the “Complaint”) in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against HeartWare on behalf of all persons and entities who purchased or otherwise acquired shares of HeartWare from June 10, 2014 through January 11, 2016 (the “Class Period”). The Complaint was amended on June 29, 2016 and claims HeartWare and one of its executives violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 by making false and misleading statements about, among other things, HeartWare’s response to a June 2014 U.S. FDA warning letter, the development of the Miniaturized Ventricular Assist Device (MVAD) System and the proposed acquisition of Valtech Cardio Ltd. The Complaint seeks to recover damages on behalf of all purchasers or acquirers of HeartWare’s stock during the Class Period. In August of 2016, the Company acquired HeartWare. In October of 2018, the parties reached an agreement to settle this matter, and in January 2019, the settlement amount was deposited into a qualified settlement fund to be distributed following final court approval. In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019, the court approved the settlement, bringing this matter to a conclusion.

Environmental Proceedings

The Company is involved in various stages of investigation and cleanup related to environmental remediation matters at a number of sites. These projects relate to a variety of activities, including removal of solvents, metals and other hazardous substances from soil and groundwater. The ultimate cost of site cleanup and timing of future cash flows is difficult to predict given uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup, the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations, and alternative cleanup methods.

The Company is a successor to a company which owned and operated a chemical manufacturing facility in Orrington, Maine from 1967 until 1982, and is responsible for the costs of completing an environmental site investigation as required by the Maine Department of Environmental Protection (MDEP). MDEP served a compliance order on Mallinckrodt LLC and U.S. Surgical Corporation, subsidiaries of Covidien, in December 2008, which included a directive to remove a significant volume of soils at the site. After a hearing on the compliance order before the Maine Board of Environmental Protection (Maine Board) to challenge the terms of the compliance order, the Maine Board modified the MDEP order and issued a final order requiring removal of

two

landfills, capping of the remaining

three

landfills, installation of a groundwater extraction system and long-term monitoring of the site and the

three

remaining landfills.

The Company has proceeded with implementation of the investigation and remediation at the site in accordance with the MDEP order as modified by the Maine Board order.

Since the early 2000s, the Company or its predecessors have also been involved in a lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maine by the Natural Resources Defense Council and the Maine People’s Alliance. Plaintiffs sought an injunction requiring the Company's predecessor to conduct extensive studies of mercury contamination of the Penobscot River and Bay and options for remediating such contamination, and to perform appropriate remedial activities, if necessary.

Following a trial in March 2002, the Court held that conditions in the Penobscot River and Bay may pose an imminent and substantial endangerment and that the Company’s predecessor was liable for the cost of performing a study of the River and Bay. Following a second trial in June 2014, the Court ordered that further engineering study and engineering design work was needed to determine the nature and extent of remediation in the Penobscot River and Bay. The Court also appointed an engineering firm to conduct such studies and issue a report on potential remediation alternatives. In connection with these proceedings, reports have been produced including a variety of cost estimates for a variety of potential remedial options. A third trial to determine the course of remediation to be pursued is scheduled to occur in November of 2019.

The Company's accrued expenses for environmental proceedings are included within accrued litigation as discussed above.

Government Matters

Since 2017, the Company has been responding to requests from the Department of Justice and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services for information about business practices relating to a neurovascular product developed and first marketed by ev3 and Covidien. The Company has provided information in response to these requests and is cooperating with the inquiry. The Company has not recognized an expense in connection with any ongoing investigation, because any such potential loss is not currently probable or reasonably estimable under U.S. GAAP. Additionally, the Company is unable to reasonably estimate the range of loss, if any, that may result from the ongoing information requests.

Income Taxes

In March 2009, the IRS issued its audit report on Medtronic, Inc. for fiscal years 2005 and 2006. Medtronic, Inc. reached agreement with the IRS on some, but not all matters related to these fiscal years. The remaining unresolved issue for fiscal years 2005 and 2006 relates to the allocation of income between Medtronic, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiary operating in Puerto Rico, which is one of the Company's key manufacturing sites. The U.S. Tax Court reviewed this dispute, and on June 9, 2016, issued its opinion with respect to the allocation of income between the parties for fiscal years 2005 and 2006. The U.S. Tax Court generally rejected the IRS’s position, but also made certain modifications to the Medtronic, Inc. tax returns as filed. On April 21, 2017, the IRS filed their Notice of Appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 8th Circuit regarding the Tax Court Opinion. Oral argument for the Appeal occurred on March 14, 2018. The 8th Circuit Court of Appeals issued their opinion on August 16, 2018, and remanded the case back to the U.S. Tax Court for additional factual findings.

In October 2011, the IRS issued its audit report on Medtronic, Inc. for fiscal years 2007 and 2008. Medtronic, Inc. reached agreement with the IRS on some, but not all matters related to these fiscal years. The remaining unresolved issue for fiscal years 2007 and 2008 relates to the allocation of income between Medtronic, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiary operating in Puerto Rico for the businesses that are the subject of the U.S. Tax Court Case for fiscal years 2005 and 2006.

In April 2014, the IRS issued its audit report on Medtronic, Inc. for fiscal years 2009, 2010, and 2011. Medtronic, Inc. reached agreement with the IRS on some but not all matters related to these fiscal years. The remaining unresolved issue for fiscal years 2009, 2010, and 2011 relates to the allocation of income between Medtronic, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiary operating in Puerto Rico for the businesses that are the subject of the U.S. Tax Court Case for fiscal years 2005 and 2006.

In May 2017, the IRS issued its audit report on Medtronic, Inc. for fiscal years 2012, 2013, and 2014. Medtronic, Inc. reached agreement with the IRS on some but not all matters related to these fiscal years. The significant issues that remain unresolved relate to the allocation of income between Medtronic, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiary operating in Puerto Rico, and proposed adjustments associated with the utilization of certain net operating losses. The Company disagrees with the IRS and will attempt to resolve these matters at the IRS Appellate level.

Medtronic, Inc.’s fiscal years 2015 and 2016 U.S. federal income tax returns are currently being audited by the IRS.

Covidien and the IRS have concluded and reached agreement on its audit of Covidien’s U.S. federal income tax returns for all tax years through 2012. The statute of limitations for Covidien’s 2013 and 2014 U.S. federal income tax returns lapsed during the first quarter of fiscal years 2018 and 2019, respectively. Covidien's fiscal year 2015 U.S. federal income tax returns are currently being audited by the IRS.

While it is not possible to predict the outcome for most of the income tax matters discussed above, the Company believes it is possible that charges associated with these matters could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s consolidated earnings, financial position, and/or cash flows.

See Note


for additional discussion of income taxes.

Guarantees

As a result of the acquisition of Covidien, the Company has a guarantee commitment related to certain contingent tax liabilities as a party to the Tax Sharing Agreement that was entered into on June 29, 2007, between Covidien, Tyco International (now Johnson Controls), and Tyco Electronics (now TE Connectivity), associated with the spin-off from Tyco. The Tax Sharing Agreement covers certain income tax liabilities for periods prior to and including the spin-off. Medtronic’s share of the income tax liabilities for these periods is


percent

, with Johnson Controls and TE Connectivity share being


percent

, and


percent

, respectively. If Johnson Controls and TE Connectivity default on their obligations to the Company under the Tax Sharing Agreement, the Company would be liable for the entire amount of these liabilities. All costs and expenses associated with the management of these tax liabilities are being shared equally among the parties. The most significant amounts at risk under this Tax Sharing Agreement were resolved with the U.S. Tax Court and IRS Appeals resolutions reached in May 2016. However, the Tax Sharing Agreement remains in place with respect to income tax liabilities that are not the subject of such resolution, including certain state and international tax matters that remain open.

The Company has used available information to develop its best estimates for certain assets and liabilities related to periods prior to the 2007 separation, including amounts subject to or impacted by the provisions of the Tax Sharing Agreement. The actual amounts that the Company may be required to ultimately accrue or pay under the Tax Sharing Agreement, however, could vary depending upon the outcome of the unresolved tax matters. Final determination of the balances will be made in subsequent periods,

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

primarily related to tax years that remain open for examination. These balances will also be impacted by the filing of final or amended income tax returns in certain jurisdictions where those returns include a combination of Tyco International, Covidien and/or Tyco Electronics legal entities for periods prior to the 2007 separation.

As part of the Company’s sale of the Patient Care, Deep Vein Thrombosis, and Nutritional Insufficiency businesses to Cardinal on July 29, 2017, the Company has indemnified Cardinal for certain contingent tax liabilities related to the divested businesses that existed prior to the date of divestiture. The actual amounts that the Company may be required to ultimately accrue or pay could vary depending upon the outcome of the unresolved tax matters.

In the normal course of business, the Company and/or its affiliates periodically enter into agreements that require one or more of the Company and/or its affiliates to indemnify customers or suppliers for specific risks, such as claims for injury or property damage arising as a result of the Company or its affiliates’ products, the negligence of the Company's personnel, or claims alleging that the Company's products infringe on third-party patents or other intellectual property. The Company also offers warranties on various products. The Company’s maximum exposure under these guarantees is unable to be estimated. Historically, the Company has not experienced significant losses on these types of guarantees.

The Company believes the ultimate resolution of the above guarantees is not expected to have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated earnings, financial position, or cash flows.

Segment and Geographic Information

The Company’s organizational structure is based upon

four

principal operating and reportable segments: the Cardiac and Vascular Group, the Minimally Invasive Therapies Group, the Restorative Therapies Group, and the Diabetes Group. The Company's management has chosen to organize the entity based upon therapy solutions provided by each segment. The

four

principal segments are strategic businesses that are managed separately, as each one develops and manufactures products and provides services oriented toward targeted therapy solutions.

The primary products and services from which the Cardiac and Vascular Group segment derives its revenues include products for the diagnosis, treatment, and management of cardiac rhythm disorders and cardiovascular disease, as well as services to diagnose, treat, and manage heart- and vascular-related disorders and diseases.

The primary products and services from which the Minimally Invasive Therapies Group segment derives its revenues include those focused on diseases of the respiratory system, gastrointestinal tract, renal system, lungs, pelvic region, kidneys, obesity, and other preventable complications.

The primary products and services from which the Restorative Therapies Group segment derives its revenues include those focused on neurostimulation therapies and drug delivery systems for the treatment of chronic pain, as well as various areas of the spine and brain, along with pelvic health and conditions of the ear, nose, and throat.



Medtronic plc

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

The primary products from which the Diabetes Group segment derives its revenues include those focused on diabetes management, including insulin pumps, continuous glucose monitoring systems, insulin pump consumables, and diabetes therapy management software.

Segment disclosures are on a performance basis, consistent with internal management reporting. Net sales of the Company's segments include end-customer revenues from the sale of products the segment develops, manufactures, and distributes. There are certain corporate and centralized expenses that are not allocated to the segments. The Company's management evaluates the performance of the segments and allocates resources based on net sales and segment earnings before interest, taxes, and amortization ("Segment EBITA"). Segment EBITA represents income before income taxes, excluding interest expense, interest income, amortization of intangible assets, centralized distribution costs, certain corporate charges, and other items not allocated to the segments.

The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in Note


. Certain depreciable assets may be recorded by one segment, while the depreciation expense is allocated to another segment. The allocation of depreciation expense is based on the proportion of the assets used by each segment.

The following tables present reconciliations of financial information from the segments to the applicable line items in the Company's consolidated financial statements:

Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act)) and changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this annual report, our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) are effective.

Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f)). Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on this evaluation, management concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective at

April 26, 2019

April 26, 2019

, has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm who has also audited our consolidated financial statements, as stated in their report in the section entitled “Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm,” which expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting at

April 26, 2019

, which is included in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

The Company is deploying an enterprise resource planning (ERP) software program, SAP, to the Minimally Invasive Therapies Group. During fiscal year 2019, the Company continued the deployment of this software along with other enterprise systems, which resulted in changes to the internal controls over financial reporting for the Minimally Invasive Therapies Group in Latin America. The internal controls were updated to reflect these changes. These system deployments will continue with projected completion in fiscal year 2020. There have been no other changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
