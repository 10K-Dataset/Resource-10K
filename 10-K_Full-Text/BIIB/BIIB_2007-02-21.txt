TABLE OF
    CONTENTS


PART I

Item 1.

Business

Overview

Biogen Idec creates new standards of care in oncology,
    neurology, immunology and other specialty areas of unmet medical
    need. As a global leader in the development, manufacturing, and
    commercialization of novel therapies, we transform scientific
    discoveries into advances in human healthcare. We currently have
    five products:

AVONEX

®

(interferon beta-1a)

AVONEX is approved worldwide for the treatment of relapsing
    forms of multiple sclerosis, or MS, and is the most prescribed
    therapeutic product in MS worldwide. Globally over
    135,000 patients use AVONEX.

RITUXAN

®

(rituximab)

RITUXAN is approved worldwide for the treatment of relapsed or
    refractory low-grade or follicular,

CD20-positive,

B-cell non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas, or B-cell NHLs. In 2006,
    the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, approved
    RITUXAN for three additional uses in NHL. We believe that
    RITUXAN is the top-selling oncology therapeutic in the United
    States and has had more than 960,000 patient exposures
    worldwide. In addition, in February 2006, the FDA approved the
    RITUXAN supplemental Biologics License Application, or sBLA, for
    use of RITUXAN, in combination with methotrexate, for reducing
    signs and symptoms in adult patients with

moderately-to-severely

active rheumatoid arthritis, or RA, who have had an inadequate
    response to one or more tumor necrosis factor, or TNF,
    antagonist therapies. We are working with Genentech and Roche on
    the development of RITUXAN in additional oncology and other
    indications.

RITUXAN is the trade name for the compound rituximab in the
    U.S., Canada and Japan. MabThera is the trade name for rituximab
    in the European Union, or EU. In this Annual Report, we refer to
    rituximab, RITUXAN, and MabThera collectively as RITUXAN, except
    where we have otherwise indicated.

TYSABRI

®

(natalizumab)

TYSABRI is approved for the treatment of relapsing forms of MS.
    Under the terms of a collaboration agreement with Elan
    Corporation plc, or Elan, we are solely responsible for the
    manufacture of TYSABRI, and we collaborate with Elan on the
    product’s marketing, commercial distribution and on-going
    development activities. The collaboration agreement with Elan is
    designed to effect an equal sharing of profits and losses
    generated by the activities of the collaboration between Elan
    and us.

ZEVALIN

®

(ibritumomab tiuxetan)

The ZEVALIN therapeutic regimen, which features the ZEVALIN
    antibody, is a radioimmunotherapy that is approved for the
    treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory low-grade,
    follicular, or transformed B-cell NHL, including patients with
    RITUXAN refractory NHL. During the third quarter of 2006, we
    began executing a plan to divest our ZEVALIN product line.

FUMADERM

®

(dimethylfumarate and monoethylfumarate salts)

FUMADERM was acquired with the purchase of Fumapharm AG, or
    Fumapharm, in June 2006. FUMADERM acts as an immunomudulator and
    has been approved in Germany for the treatment of severe
    psoriasis since 1994.

Other
    Revenue and Programs

In 2006, we recorded product revenues from sales of

AMEVIVE

®

(alefacept)

prior to our sale of this product line in April
    2006.  AMEVIVE is approved in the U.S. and other countries for
    the treatment of adult patients with

moderate-to-severe

chronic plaque psoriasis who are candidates for systemic therapy
    or phototherapy.



We also receive royalty revenues on sales by our licensees of a
    number of products covered under patents that we control. In
    addition, we have a pipeline of research and development
    products in our core therapeutic areas and in other areas of
    interest.

We devote significant resources to internal research and
    development programs, and intend to commit significant
    additional resources to external research and development
    opportunities. We intend to focus our research and development
    efforts on finding novel therapeutics in areas of high unmet
    medical need, both within our current focus areas of oncology,
    neurology and immunology as well as in new therapeutic areas.
    Our current late stage efforts include our collaboration with
    Elan on the development of TYSABRI as a potential treatment for
    Crohn’s disease; our work with Genentech and Roche on the
    development of RITUXAN in additional oncology indications, RA,
    MS and lupus and the co-development of additional anti-CD-20
    antibody products: BG-12 for relapsing forms of MS in
    Phase III; galiximab for NHL in Phase III; and
    lumiliximab for chronic lymphocytic leukemia, or CLL, in
    Phase IIb and our collaboration with PDL BioPharma, Inc.,
    or PDL, on development of two Phase II antibody products in
    a variety of indications.

Merger

On November 12, 2003, Bridges Merger Corporation, a wholly
    owned subsidiary of IDEC Pharmaceuticals Corporation, was merged
    with and into Biogen, Inc. with Biogen, Inc. continuing as the
    surviving corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of IDEC
    Pharmaceuticals Corporation. At the same time, IDEC
    Pharmaceuticals Corporation changed its name to Biogen Idec Inc.
    The merger and name change were made under an Agreement and Plan
    of Merger dated as of June 20, 2003.

AVONEX

We currently market and sell AVONEX worldwide for the treatment
    of relapsing forms of MS. In 2006, sales of AVONEX generated
    worldwide revenues of $1.7 billion as compared to worldwide
    revenues of $1.5 billion in 2005.

MS is a progressive neurological disease in which the body loses
    the ability to transmit messages along nerve cells, leading to a
    loss of muscle control, paralysis and, in some cases, death.
    Patients with active relapsing MS experience an uneven pattern
    of disease progression characterized by periods of stability
    that are interrupted by

flare-ups

of
    the disease after which the patient returns to a new baseline of
    functioning. AVONEX is a recombinant form of a protein produced
    in the body by fibroblast cells in response to viral infection.
    AVONEX has been shown in clinical trials in relapsing forms of
    MS both to slow the accumulation of disability and to reduce the
    frequency of

flare-ups.

AVONEX is approved to treat relapsing forms of MS, including
    patients with a first clinical episode and MRI features
    consistent with MS. Biogen, Inc. began selling AVONEX in the
    U.S. in 1996, and in the EU in 1997. AVONEX is on the
    market in 70 countries. Based on data from an independent third
    party research organization, information from our distributors
    and internal analysis, we believe that AVONEX is the most
    prescribed therapeutic product for the treatment of MS
    worldwide. Globally over 135,000 patients use AVONEX.

We continue to work to expand the data available about AVONEX
    and MS treatments. In September 2006, we presented at the
    European Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple
    Sclerosis, or ECTRIMS, Congress results from the Global
    Adherence Project, or GAP, the largest multi-national study of
    its kind to date to evaluate patient adherence to long-term
    treatments for MS in a real-world setting. GAP is a global
    multi-center, cross-sectional observational study that
    investigated factors that influence non-adherence to MS
    therapies. The study enrolled 2,566 patients with relapsing
    remitting MS at 176 sites in 22 countries taking one of the
    following therapies: AVONEX,
    Betaseron

®

(Interferon beta-1b),
    Copaxone

®

(glatiramer acetate), or
    Rebif

®

(Interferon beta-1a). Patients were evaluated through a
    validated MS quality of life scale, as well as a self-reported
    questionnaire that collected data on disease status, treatment,
    and factors that may have affected adherence to treatment during
    the



course of their therapy. Overall 25% of patients reported
    non-adherence, with patients on AVONEX reporting statistically
    significantly better adherence than any of the other therapies.

We have also extended the Controlled High Risk AVONEX Multiple
    Sclerosis Prevention Study In Ongoing Neurological Surveillance,
    or CHAMPIONS. CHAMPIONS was originally designed to determine
    whether the effect of early treatment with AVONEX in delaying
    relapses and reducing the accumulation of MS brain lesions could
    be sustained for up to five years. The study results showed that
    AVONEX altered the long-term course of MS in patients who began
    treatment immediately after their initial MS attack compared to
    initiation of treatment more than two years after onset of
    symptoms. The five-year study extension is intended to determine
    if the effects of early treatment with AVONEX can be sustained
    for up to ten years. We also continue to support Phase IV
    investigator-run studies evaluating AVONEX in combination with
    other therapies.

In November 2006, we launched AVONEX in Japan, following the
    approval of the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare
    of AVONEX for the prevention of MS relapse. AVONEX is the first
    new MS treatment available in Japan in six years. It is the
    second disease-modifying therapy approved to treat MS in Japan
    and the only one that can be administered once a week.

RITUXAN

RITUXAN is approved worldwide for the treatment of relapsed or
    refractory low-grade or follicular, CD20-positive, B-cell NHLs,
    which comprise approximately half of the B-cell NHLs diagnosed
    in the U.S. In the U.S., RITUXAN is approved for NHL with
    the following label indications:

•

The treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory, low-grade
    or follicular, CD20-positive, B-cell non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma;

•

The first-line treatment of patients with diffuse large B-cell,
    CD20-positive, non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (or
    “DLBCL”) in combination with CHOP (cyclophosphamide,
    doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone) or other
    anthracycline-based chemotherapy regimens;

•

The first line treatment of previously untreated patients with
    follicular, CD20-positive, B-cell NHL in combination with CVP
    (cyclophosphamide, vincristine and prednisone) chemotherapy;

•

The treatment of low grade CD20-positive, B-cell NHL in patients
    with stable disease or who achieve a partial or complete
    response following first line treatment with CVP chemotherapy.

In addition, in February 2006, the FDA approved the RITUXAN sBLA
    for use of RITUXAN, in combination with methotrexate, for
    reducing signs and symptoms in adult patients with

moderately-to-severely

active rheumatoid arthritis, or RA, who have had an inadequate
    response to one or more TNF antagonist therapies.

Our interest in RITUXAN is recognized as revenue from
    unconsolidated joint business, and is made up of three
    components:

•

We copromote RITUXAN in the U.S. in collaboration with
    Genentech. All U.S. sales of RITUXAN are recognized by
    Genentech, and we record our share of the pretax copromotion
    profits on a quarterly basis. In 2006, RITUXAN generated
    U.S. net sales of $2.1 billion, of which we recorded
    $555.8 million as our share of copromotion profits, as
    compared to U.S. net sales of $1.8 billion in 2005, of
    which we recorded $513.8 million as our share of
    copromotion profits;

•

Roche sells RITUXAN outside the U.S., except in Japan where it
    co-markets RITUXAN in collaboration with Zenyaku Kogyo Co. Ltd.,
    or Zenyaku. We received royalties through Genentech on sales of
    RITUXAN outside of the U.S. of $194.0 million in 2006
    as compared to $147.5 million in 2005;

•

Finally, we receive reimbursement from Genentech for our selling
    and development expenses.

In the U.S., we share responsibility with Genentech for
    continued development. Such continued development includes
    conducting supportive research and post-approval clinical
    studies and seeking potential approval for additional
    indications. Genentech provides the support functions for the
    commercialization of RITUXAN in the U.S. and has worldwide
    manufacturing responsibilities. See “Sales, Marketing and
    Distribution — RITUXAN and



ZEVALIN” and “Manufacturing and Raw Materials.”
    We also have the right to collaborate with Genentech on the
    development of other humanized anti-CD20 antibodies targeting
    B-cell disorders for a broad range of indications, and to
    copromote with Genentech any new products resulting from such
    development in the U.S. The most advanced such humanized
    anti-CD20 antibody under development has finished a
    Phase II trial for use in RA, and has entered a
    Phase III program.

RITUXAN
    in Oncology

We believe that RITUXAN is the top-selling oncology therapeutic
    in the United States and has had more than 960,000 patient
    exposures worldwide. RITUXAN is generally administered as
    outpatient therapy by personnel trained in administering
    chemotherapies or biologics. RITUXAN is unique in the treatment
    of B-cell NHLs due to its specificity for the antigen CD20,
    which is expressed only on the surface of normal B-cells and
    malignant B-cells. Stem cells (including B-cell progenitors or
    precursor B-cells) in bone marrow lack the CD20 antigen. This
    allows healthy

B-cells

to
    regenerate after treatment with RITUXAN and to return to normal
    levels within several months. RITUXAN’s mechanism of
    action, in part, utilizes the body’s own immune system as
    compared to conventional lymphoma therapies. In 2006, the FDA
    approved RITUXAN for three additional uses in NHL: (1) for
    the treatment of previously untreated patients with diffuse,
    large B-cell NHL in combination with anthracycline-based
    chemotherapy regimens (February), (2) for first-line
    treatment of previously-untreated patients with follicular NHL
    in combination with CVP chemotherapy (September), and
    (3) for the treatment of low-grade NHL in patients with
    stable disease or who achieve a partial or complete response
    following first-line treatment with CVP chemotherapy
    (September). A summary of important clinical data follows:

•

A randomized Phase III study, known as ECOG 4494, of
    patients age 60 or older with newly diagnosed, diffuse,
    large B-cell, or aggressive non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma,
    comparing CHOP alone to a regimen of RITUXAN plus CHOP, also
    known as R-CHOP, as a front-line or induction therapy followed
    by RITUXAN maintenance therapy or observation for those patients
    who responded positively to either R-CHOP or CHOP alone. The
    study is a U.S. Intergroup study led by the Eastern
    Cooperative Oncology Group, or ECOG, and enrolled 632 subjects.
    The primary endpoint of the induction and maintenance phases of
    the study was time to treatment failure. Due to the observed
    interaction between RITUXAN maintenance and induction therapy,
    additional analyses were performed to compare induction therapy
    with R-CHOP versus CHOP alone, removing the effects of
    subsequent RITUXAN maintenance therapy. Based on these
    additional analyses, the investigators concluded that patients
    who received R-CHOP induction therapy experienced prolonged time
    to treatment failure and overall survival compared to patients
    who received induction therapy with CHOP alone. In the
    maintenance phase of the study, patients treated with RITUXAN
    maintenance therapy for up to an additional two years after
    completing induction therapy had a statistically significant
    delay in time to treatment failure compared to patients who did
    not receive RITUXAN maintenance therapy following induction.
    This advantage appears predominantly confined to patients who
    received CHOP alone during the induction phase;

•

A large Phase III randomized study of 823 patients,
    known as MinT, designed to evaluate RITUXAN in combination with
    chemotherapy as a front-line treatment for aggressive large,
    B-cell NHL in patients age 18 to 60. This study, which was
    conducted by an international cooperative group and sponsored by
    Roche, met its pre-specified primary efficacy endpoint early.
    Positive results from the study were announced in June 2004. The
    study authors concluded that data from the study demonstrated a
    significant improvement in time to treatment failure, the
    primary endpoint of the study. At two years, 81% of patients who
    received RITUXAN and chemotherapy did not experience treatment
    failure compared to 58% of patients who received chemotherapy
    alone. An analysis performed in 2005 showed a survival advantage
    to adding RITUXAN to chemotherapy; and

•

The Group d’Etude des Lymphome d’Adulte study, also
    known as the GELA trial, designed to evaluate the efficacy and
    safety of R-CHOP in patients 60 years of age or older with
    diffuse, large B-cell lymphoma. Previously untreated patients
    were randomized to receive eight cycles of CHOP alone or eight
    doses of R-CHOP. In this multi-center trial, with median

follow-up

of
    five years, overall survival for patients who had received
    RITUXAN plus CHOP was significantly prolonged compared with
    those who had received CHOP alone.



•

A randomized Phase III study of the addition of RITUXAN to
    a chemotherapy regimen of CVP in previously untreated, or front
    line patients with indolent non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. In this
    investigator-run study, 322 patients who had not received
    previous treatment for CD20-positive follicular or indolent
    non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma were randomized to receive either
    CVP alone or CVP with RITUXAN. Results of the study updated in
    2005 indicated that the addition of RITUXAN to CVP prolonged
    time to treatment failure, the primary endpoint of the study, to
    34 months compared to 15 months for patients treated
    with CVP alone;

•

A multi-center, randomized Phase II study of
    114 patients with relapsed indolent non-Hodgkin’s
    lymphoma designed to compare the efficacy of RITUXAN maintenance
    therapy to retreatment with RITUXAN. Maintenance therapy was
    defined as treatment with RITUXAN every six months for two years
    with the objective of keeping lymphoma from returning or
    progressing. Retreatment was defined as waiting until the
    disease progressed prior to administering another course of
    RITUXAN. The initial results of this investigator-run study
    showed that patients who received RITUXAN maintenance therapy
    experienced 31 months of progression-free survival as
    compared to 8 months of progression-free survival for those
    patients who received retreatment; and

•

A Phase III study, known as E1496, designed to compare
    RITUXAN maintenance therapy versus observation in patients with
    previously untreated indolent non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma who
    achieved stable disease or better after induction therapy with
    CVP. The study, which was led by ECOG, met its pre-specified
    primary efficacy endpoint early. Positive results from the study
    were announced in June 2004. The study authors concluded that
    there was a significant improvement in progression free
    survival, the primary endpoint of the study. The authors
    estimated that 56% of patients who received RITUXAN maintenance
    therapy were free of disease progression and alive at
    4 years compared to 32% of patients who received no further
    treatment. In this trial, maintenance therapy began four weeks
    after the last cycle of chemotherapy and was defined as four
    doses of RITUXAN every six months for two years.

In an effort to identify additional applications for RITUXAN,
    we, in conjunction with Genentech and Roche, continue to support
    RITUXAN post-marketing studies. We, along with Genentech and
    Roche, are also conducting a multi-center global Phase III
    registrational study in patients with relapsed chronic
    lymphocytic leukemia, or CLL, comparing the use of fludarabine,
    cyclophosphamide and RITUXAN together, known as FCR, versus
    fludarabine and cyclophosphamide alone. This study is open at
    multiple sites worldwide. Additional clinical studies are
    ongoing in other B-cell malignancies such as lymphoproliferative
    disorders associated with solid organ transplant therapies,
    relapsed aggressive non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and mantle cell
    non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma.

RITUXAN
    in RA

In February 2006, the FDA approved the sBLA for use of RITUXAN,
    in combination with methotrexate, for reducing signs and
    symptoms in adult patients with

moderately-to-severely

active RA who have had an inadequate response to one or more TNF
    antagonist therapies. The sBLA was based primarily on the
    results of a Phase III study known as REFLEX (Random
    Evaluation of Long-Term Efficacy of Rituximab in RA), announced
    in April 2005, which met its primary endpoint of a greater
    proportion of RITUXAN-treated patients achieving an American
    College of Rheumatology (ACR) 20 response at week 24,
    compared to placebo. REFLEX included patients with active RA who
    had an inadequate response or were intolerant prior to treatment
    with one or more anti-TNF therapies. In November 2005, we, along
    with Roche, announced the following additional

24-week

efficacy data from REFLEX: 51% of patients achieved ACR 20,
    the primary endpoint of the study, versus 18% of placebo
    patients; 27% of patients achieved ACR 50, versus 5% of placebo
    patients; and 12% of patients achieved ACR 70, versus 1% of
    placebo patients. We, along with Genentech and Roche, initiated
    a Phase III program of RITUXAN in RA patients who are
    inadequate responders to disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs,
    or DMARDs, in the first half of 2006.

RITUXAN
    in Other Immunology Indications

Based primarily on results from the studies of RITUXAN in RA, as
    well as other small investigator-sponsored studies in various
    autoimmune-mediated diseases, we, along with Genentech, are
    conducting Phase III clinical



studies of RITUXAN in MS and Systemic Lupus Erythematosus, SLE.
    In August 2006, we and Genentech announced that a Phase II
    study of RITUXAN in relapsing-remitting MS met its primary
    endpoint. The study of 104 patients showed a statistically
    significant reduction in the total number of gadolinium
    enhancing T1 lesions observed on serial MRI scans of the brain
    at weeks 12, 16, 20 and 24 in the RITUXAN-treated group
    compared to placebo. Genentech and Biogen Idec will continue to
    analyze the study results and has been accepted for presentation
    at an upcoming medical meeting in the first half of 2007.

In December 2006, we and Genentech issued a dear healthcare
    provider letter informing healthcare providers that two cases of
    progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, or PML, resulting in
    death were reported in patients receiving RITUXAN for treatment
    of SLE, an indication where RITUXAN is not approved for
    treatment. We are working with regulatory authorities to update
    the prescribing information for RITUXAN.

TYSABRI

TYSABRI is approved for the treatment of relapsing forms of MS.
    On June 5, 2006, we and Elan announced the FDA’s
    approval of the sBLA for the reintroduction of TYSABRI as a
    monotherapy treatment for relapsing forms of MS to slow the
    progression of disability and reduce the frequency of clinical
    relapses. On June 29, 2006, we and Elan announced that the
    EMEA had approved TYSABRI as a similar treatment.

TYSABRI was initially approved by the FDA in November 2004 to
    treat relapsing forms of MS to reduce the frequency of clinical
    relapses. In February 2005, in consultation with the FDA, we and
    Elan voluntarily suspended the marketing and commercial
    distribution of TYSABRI based on reports of cases of progressive
    multifocal leukoencephalopathy, or PML, a rare and frequently
    fatal demyelinating disease of the central nervous system, in
    patients treated with TYSABRI in clinical studies. In
    consideration of these events, TYSABRI is marketed under risk
    management or minimization plans as agreed with local regulatory
    authorities. In the U.S. TYSABRI was reintroduced with a
    risk minimization action plan, or RiskMAP, known as the TYSABRI
    Outreach: Unified Commitment to Health, or TOUCH, Prescribing
    Program, a rigorous system intended to educate physicians and
    patients about the risks involved and assure appropriate use of
    the product.

In September 2004, Elan submitted a Marketing Authorisation
    Application, or MAA, to the EMEA for approval of TYSABRI as a
    treatment for Crohn’s disease. The filing is based on the
    results of three randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
    multi-center trials of TYSABRI assessing the safety and efficacy
    as both an induction and maintenance therapy — ENCORE
    (Efficacy of Natalizumab in Crohn’s Disease Response and
    Remission), ENACT-1 (Efficacy of Natalizumab as Active
    Crohn’s Therapy) and ENACT-2 (Evaluation of Natalizumab As
    Continuous Therapy). In December 2006, Elan submitted an sBLA to
    the FDA seeking approval to market TYSABRI as a treatment for
    patients with moderately to severely active Crohn’s disease
    based on the same data as the European filing. The filing also
    includes proposed labeling and a risk management plan, both of
    which are similar to those approved for the MS indication. One
    of the confirmed cases of PML was in a patient who was in a
    clinical study of TYSABRI in Crohn’s disease. The review of
    the safety database conducted by us and Elan after the TYSABRI
    suspension led to a serious adverse event previously reported as
    malignant astrocytoma by a clinical investigator in a clinical
    study of TYSABRI in Crohn’s disease to be reassessed as
    PML. We anticipate regulatory action by the EMEA in the first
    half of 2007.

TYSABRI binds to adhesion molecules on the immune cell surface
    known as alpha-4 integrin. Adhesion molecules on the surface of
    the immune cells play an important role in the migration of the
    immune cells in the inflammatory process. Research suggests that
    by binding to alpha-4 integrin, TYSABRI prevents immune cells
    from migrating from the bloodstream into tissue where they can
    cause inflammation and potentially damage nerve fibers and their
    insulation.

Under the terms of the collaboration, we are solely responsible
    for the manufacture of TYSABRI, and we collaborate with Elan on
    the product’s marketing, commercial distribution and
    ongoing development activities. The collaboration agreement with
    Elan is designed to effect an equal sharing of profits and
    losses generated by the activities of the collaboration between
    Elan and us. Under our agreement with Elan, however, in the
    event that sales of TYSABRI exceed specified thresholds, Elan is
    required to make milestone payments to us in order to continue
    sharing equally in the collaboration’s results.



In the U.S., we sell TYSABRI to Elan who sells the product to
    third party distributors. Elan and we co-market the product. The
    sales price to Elan in the U.S. is set at the beginning of
    each quarterly period to effect an approximate equal sharing of
    the gross margin between Elan and us. In addition, both parties
    share equally in the operating costs, which include research and
    development, selling, general and administrative expenses and
    other similar costs. Sales of TYSABRI to Elan are reported as
    revenues and are recognized upon Elan’s shipment of the
    product to third party distributors, at which time all revenue
    recognition criteria have been met. As of December 31,
    2006, we had deferred revenue of $5.0 million for shipments
    to Elan that remained in Elan’s ending inventory as of
    December 31, 2006. Elan’s reimbursement of TYSABRI
    operating costs is reflected as a reduction of the respective
    costs within our consolidated statement of income.

For sales outside of the U.S., we are responsible for
    distributing TYSABRI to customers and are primarily responsible
    for all operating activities. Both parties share equally in the
    operating results of TYSABRI outside the U.S. Sales of
    TYSABRI are reported as revenue and are recognized at the time
    of product delivery to our customer, at which time all revenue
    recognition criteria have been met. Payments from Elan for their
    share of the collaboration operating losses relating to sales
    outside the U.S. are reflected in the collaboration profit
    (loss) sharing line in our consolidated statement of income. For
    2006, we recognized $9.7 million in income related to
    reimbursements made in connection with this arrangement.

In July 2006, we began to ship TYSABRI in both the United States
    and Europe. In 2006, we recorded sales of TYSABRI in the U.S.
    and Europe relating to current activity of $11.9 million
    and $10.0 million, respectively. Prior to the suspension of
    TYSABRI in 2005, we shipped product to Elan in the U.S. and
    recognized revenue in accordance with the policy described
    above. As a result of the suspension of TYSABRI, we deferred
    $14.0 million in revenue from Elan as of March 31,
    2005 related to TYSABRI product that remained in Elan’s
    ending inventory. This amount was paid by Elan during 2005 and
    was subsequently recognized as revenue during 2006, as the
    uncertainty about the ultimate disposition of the product was
    eliminated. As a result, we recognized total revenue for
    U.S. related TYSABRI activities of $25.9 million in
    2006.

PHASE III
    Studies of TYSABRI in MS

Prior to the suspension of dosing in clinical studies of TYSABRI
    we, along with Elan, completed the AFFIRM study and the SENTINEL
    study. The AFFIRM study was designed to evaluate the ability of
    natalizumab to slow the progression of disability in MS and
    reduce the rate of clinical relapses. The SENTINEL study was
    designed to evaluate the effect of the combination of
    natalizumab and AVONEX compared to treatment with AVONEX alone
    in slowing progression of disability and reducing the rate of
    clinical relapses. Both studies were two-year studies which had
    protocols that included a one-year analysis of the data.

The
    AFFIRM study

The one-year data from the AFFIRM study showed that TYSABRI
    reduced the rate of clinical relapses by 66% relative to
    placebo, the primary endpoint at one year. AFFIRM also met all
    one-year secondary endpoints, including MRI measures. In the
    TYSABRI treated group, 60% of patients developed no new or newly
    enlarging T2 hyperintense lesions compared to 22% of placebo
    treated patients. On the one-year MRI scan, 96% of TYSABRI
    treated patients had no gadolinium enhancing lesions compared to
    68% of placebo treated patients. The proportion of patients who
    remained relapse free was 76% in the TYSABRI treated group
    compared to 53% in the placebo treated group. In February 2005,
    we and Elan announced that the AFFIRM study also achieved the
    two-year primary endpoint of slowing the progression of
    disability in patients with relapsing forms of MS. In the
    TYSABRI treated group, there was a 42% reduction in the risk of
    disability progression relative to placebo, and a 67% reduction
    in the rate of clinical relapses over two years relative to
    placebo which was sustained and consistent with the one-year
    results. Other efficacy data, including MRI measures, were
    similar to the one-year results.

The
    SENTINEL study

The one-year data from the SENTINEL combination study also
    showed that the study achieved its one-year primary endpoint.
    The addition of TYSABRI to AVONEX resulted in a 54% reduction in
    the rate of clinical relapses over the effect of AVONEX alone.
    SENTINEL also met all secondary endpoints, including MRI
    measures. In the



group treated with TYSABRI plus AVONEX, 67% of the patients
    developed no new or newly enlarging T2 hyperintense lesions
    compared to 40% in the AVONEX plus placebo group. On the
    one-year MRI scan, 96% of TYSABRI plus AVONEX treated patients
    had no gadolinium enhancing lesions compared to 76% of AVONEX
    plus placebo treated patients. The proportion of patients who
    remained relapse free was 67% in the TYSABRI plus AVONEX treated
    group compared to 46% in the AVONEX plus placebo treated group.
    In the TYSABRI treated group, 60% of patients developed no new
    or newly enlarging T2 hyperintense lesions compared to 22% of
    placebo treated patients. On the one-year MRI scan, 96% of
    TYSABRI treated patients had no gadolinium enhancing lesions
    compared to 68% of placebo treated patients. In July 2005, we
    and Elan announced that the SENTINEL study also achieved the
    two-year primary endpoint of slowing the progression of
    disability in patients with relapsing forms of MS. The addition
    of TYSABRI to AVONEX resulted in a 24% reduction in the risk of
    disability progression compared to the effect of AVONEX alone,
    and a 56% reduction in the rate of clinical relapses over two
    years compared to that provided by AVONEX alone. Other efficacy
    data, including MRI measures, were similar to the one-year
    results.

Phase III
    Studies of TYSABRI in Crohn’s Disease

We, along with Elan, have completed three Phase III studies
    of TYSABRI in Crohn’s disease. The three completed
    Phase III studies are known as ENACT-2 (Evaluation of
    Natalizumab as Continuous Therapy-2), ENACT-1 (Evaluation of
    Natalizumab as Continuous Therapy-1), and ENCORE (Efficacy of
    Natalizumab for Crohn’s Disease Response and Remission).

ENACT-1/ENACT-2

In ENACT-2, 339 patients who were responders in ENACT-1,
    the Phase III induction study, were re-randomized to one of
    two treatment groups, TYSABRI or placebo, both administered
    monthly for a total of 12 months. In ENACT-1, the primary
    endpoint of “response,” as defined by a 70-point
    decrease in the Crohn’s Disease Activity Index, or CDAI, at
    week 10, was not met. In ENACT-2, the primary endpoint,
    which was met, was maintenance of response through six
    additional months of therapy. A loss of response was defined as
    a greater than 70 point increase in CDAI score and a total CDAI
    score above 220 or any rescue intervention. Through month six,
    there was a significant treatment difference of greater than 30%
    in favor of patients taking TYSABRI compared to those taking
    placebo. Twelve-month data from ENACT-2 showed a sustained and
    clinically significant response throughout twelve months of
    extended TYSABRI infusion therapy, confirming findings in
    patients who had previously shown a sustained response
    throughout six months. Maintenance of response was defined by a
    CDAI score of less than 220, and less than 70-point increase
    from baseline, in the absence of rescue intervention throughout
    the study. Response was maintained by 54% of patients treated
    with natalizumab compared to 20% of those treated with placebo.
    In addition, 39% of patients on TYSABRI maintained clinical
    remission during the study period, versus 15% of those on
    placebo. By the end of month twelve, 49% of patients treated
    with TYSABRI who had previously been treated with
    corticosteroids were able to withdraw from steroid therapy
    compared to 20% of placebo-treated patients.

The
    ENCORE study

In June 2005, we and Elan announced that ENCORE, the second
    Phase III induction trial of TYSABRI for the treatment of
    moderately to severely active Crohn’s disease in patients
    with evidence of active inflammation, met the primary endpoint
    of clinical response as defined by a 70-point decrease in
    baseline CDAI score at both weeks 8 and 12. The study also met
    all of its secondary endpoints, including clinical remission at
    both weeks 8 and 12. Clinical remission was defined as achieving
    a CDAI score of equal to or less than 150 at weeks 8 and 12. At
    the time of the TYSABRI suspension, all ENCORE study patients
    had completed dosing based on the study protocol and collection
    of data and analysis followed.

ZEVALIN

The ZEVALIN therapeutic regimen is a radioimmunotherapy and part
    of a regimen that is approved for the treatment of patients with
    relapsed or refractory low-grade, follicular, or transformed
    B-cell NHL, including patients with RITUXAN relapsed or
    refractory non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. In 2006, sales of
    ZEVALIN in the



U.S. generated revenues of $16.4 million as compared
    to revenues of $19.4 million in 2005. ZEVALIN is approved
    in the EU for the treatment of adult patients with CD20-positive
    follicular B-cell NHL who are refractory to or have relapsed
    following RITUXAN therapy. We sell ZEVALIN to Schering AG for
    distribution in the EU, and receive royalty revenues from
    Schering AG on sales of ZEVALIN in the EU. Rest of world product
    sales for ZEVALIN in 2006 and 2005 were $1.4 million.
    During the third quarter of 2006, we began executing a plan to
    divest our ZEVALIN product line.

FUMADERM

FUMADERM (dimethylfumarate and monoethylfumarate salts) was
    acquired with the purchase of Fumapharm in June 2006. FUMADERM
    acts as an immunomudulator and is approved in Germany for the
    treatment of severe psoriasis. In 2006, sales of FUMADERM in
    Germany totaled $9.5 million, which we recorded from the
    date acquisition of Fumapharm. The product has been in
    commercial use in Germany for approximately eleven years and is
    the most prescribed oral systemic treatment for severe psoriasis
    in Germany.

AMEVIVE

AMEVIVE is approved in the U.S. and other countries for the
    treatment of adult patients with

moderate-to-severe

chronic plaque psoriasis who are candidates for systemic therapy
    or phototherapy. In 2006, sales of AMEVIVE generated worldwide
    revenues of $11.5 million, until we sold all rights in the
    product to Astellas Pharma US, Inc., or Astellas, in the second
    quarter of 2006. Under the terms of the agreement with, we will
    continue to manufacture AMEVIVE and supply product to Astellas
    for a period of up to 11 years. Under the terms of the
    supply agreement, we charge Astellas fixed amounts based on
    volume. Such amounts will be recognized as corporate partner
    revenue and are not expected to be significant.

BG-12

BG-12 is a second-generation oral fumarate with an
    immunomodulatory mechanism of action, which we acquired with the
    purchase of Fumapharm in June 2006. We completed a Phase 2b
    clinical study of BG-12 in patients with relapsing-remitting MS
    in October 2005. In January 2006, we announced that this study
    had its achieved its primary efficacy endpoint. Based on the
    results of the Phase 2 study, we announced that we
    initiated a Phase 3 program of BG-12 in MS in January 2007.
    Fumapharm has also completed a small Phase III study of
    BG-12 in psoriasis.

ANTI-CD80
    Antibody/(galiximab)

The CD80 antigen is expressed on the surface of follicular and
    other lymphoma cells, and is also known as B7.1. In the fourth
    quarter of 2005, we completed a Phase IIa study designed to
    evaluate the anti-CD80 antibody that we developed using our
    Primatized

®

antibody technology in patients with non-Hodgkin’s
    lymphoma. The antibody was well tolerated, with observation of
    clinical responses in patients treated with higher doses. Based
    on the results of the Phase IIa study, we announced that we
    initiated a Phase III study of the antibody in front line
    non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma in combination with RITUXAN and
    standard chemotherapy in January 2007.

ANTI-CD23
    Antibody/(lumiliximab)

The CD23 antigen is expressed on the surface of mature B-cells
    and other immune system cells, and is also known as Fc epsilon
    RII. We have completed a Phase IIa study designed to
    evaluate the anti-CD23 antibody that we developed using our
    Primatized

®

antibody technology in patients with chronic lymphocytic
    leukemia, or CLL. The antibody was well tolerated, with
    observation of clinical complete responses in patients. Based on
    the results of the Phase IIa study, we announced that we
    initiated a Phase IIb study of the antibody in relapsed or
    refractory CLL in January 2007.

Our Other
    Research and Development Programs

We intend to commit significant resources to both internal and
    external research and development opportunities. We intend to
    focus our research and development efforts on finding novel
    therapeutics in areas of high



unmet medical need. Our core focus areas are in oncology,
    neurobiology and autoimmune disease, but our research and
    development efforts may extend to additional therapeutic areas
    outside of these. Below is a brief summary of some of our early
    stage product candidates.

Patents
    and Other Proprietary Rights

We have filed numerous patent applications in the U.S. and
    various other countries seeking protection of inventions
    originating from our research and development, including a
    number of our processes and products. Patents have been issued
    on many of these applications. We have also obtained rights to
    various patents and patent applications under licenses with
    third parties, which provide for the payment of royalties by us.
    The ultimate degree of patent protection that will be afforded
    to biotechnology products and processes, including ours, in the
    U.S. and in other important markets remains uncertain and is
    dependent upon the scope of protection decided upon by the
    patent offices, courts and lawmakers in these countries. There
    is no certainty that our existing patents or others, if
    obtained, will afford us substantial protection or commercial
    benefit. Similarly, there is no assurance that our pending
    patent applications or patent applications licensed from third
    parties will ultimately be granted as patents or that those
    patents that have been issued or are issued in the future will
    stand if they are challenged in court.

A substantial number of patents have already been issued to
    other biotechnology and biopharmaceutical companies. Competitors
    may have filed applications for, or have been issued patents and
    may obtain additional patents and proprietary rights that may
    relate to products or processes competitive with or similar to
    our products and processes. Moreover, the patent laws of the
    U.S. and foreign countries are distinct and decisions as to
    patenting, validity of patents and infringement of patents may
    be resolved differently in different countries. In general, we
    try to obtain licenses to third party patents, which we deem
    necessary or desirable for the manufacture, use and sale of our
    products. We are currently unable to assess the extent to which
    we may wish to or may be required to acquire rights under such
    patents and the availability and cost of acquiring such rights,
    or whether a license to such patents will be available on
    acceptable terms or at all. There may be patents in the
    U.S. or in foreign countries or patents issued in the
    future that are unavailable to license on acceptable terms. Our
    inability to obtain such licenses may hinder our ability to
    market our products.



We are aware that others, including various universities and
    companies working in the biotechnology field, have filed patent
    applications and have been granted patents in the U.S. and in
    other countries claiming subject matter potentially useful to
    our business. Some of those patents and patent applications
    claim only specific products or methods of making such products,
    while others claim more general processes or techniques useful
    or now used in the biotechnology industry. There is considerable
    uncertainty within the biotechnology industry about the
    validity, scope and enforceability of many issued patents in the
    U.S. and elsewhere in the world, and, to date, there is no
    consistent policy regarding the breadth of claims allowed in
    biotechnology patents. We cannot currently determine the
    ultimate scope and validity of patents which may be granted to
    third parties in the future or which patents might be asserted
    to be infringed by the manufacture, use and sale of our products.

There has been, and we expect that there may continue to be,
    significant litigation in the industry regarding patents and
    other intellectual property rights. We expect that litigation
    may be necessary in some instances to determine the validity and
    scope of certain of our proprietary rights. Conversely,
    litigation may be necessary in some instances to determine the
    validity, scope

and/or

noninfringement of certain patent rights claimed by third
    parties to be pertinent to the manufacture, use or sale of our
    products. Intellectual property litigation could therefore
    create business uncertainty and consume substantial financial
    and human resources. Ultimately, the outcome of such litigation
    could adversely affect the validity and scope of our patent or
    other proprietary rights, or, conversely, hinder our ability to
    market our products. See “Item 3 — Legal
    Proceedings” for a description of our patent litigation.

Our trademarks RITUXAN, AVONEX, and ZEVALIN are important to us
    and are generally covered by trademark applications or
    registrations owned or controlled by us in the U.S. Patent
    and Trademark Office and in other countries. We employ other
    trademarks in the conduct of our business under license by third
    parties, for example, we utilize the mark TYSABRI under license
    from Elan.

Recombinant
    Beta Interferon

Third parties have pending patent applications or issued patents
    in the U.S., Europe and other countries with claims to key
    intermediates in the production of beta interferon. These are
    known as the Taniguchi patents. Third parties also have pending
    patent applications or issued patents with claims to beta
    interferon itself. These are known as the Roche patents and the
    Rentschler patents, respectively. We have obtained non-exclusive
    rights in various countries of the world, including the U.S.,
    Japan and Europe, to manufacture, use and sell AVONEX, our brand
    of recombinant beta interferon, under the Taniguchi, Roche and
    Rentschler issued patents. The last of the Taniguchi patents
    expire in the U.S. in May 2013 and have expired already in
    other countries of the world. The Roche patents expire in the
    U.S. in May 2008 and also have generally expired elsewhere
    in the world. The Rentschler EU patent expires in July 2012.

RITUXAN,
    ZEVALIN and Anti-CD20 Antibodies

We have several issued U.S. patents and U.S. patent
    applications, and numerous corresponding foreign counterparts
    directed to anti-CD20 antibody technology, including RITUXAN and
    ZEVALIN. We have also been granted patents covering RITUXAN and
    ZEVALIN by the European and Japanese Patent Offices. In the
    U.S. our principal patents covering the drugs or their uses
    expire between 2015 and 2018. With regard to the rest of the
    world, our principal patents covering the drug products expire
    in 2013 subject to potential patent term extensions in countries
    where such extensions are available. Our recently-granted patent
    in certain European countries claiming the treatment with
    anti-CD-20 antibodies of certain auto-immune indications,
    including rheumatoid arthritis, has been opposed by numerous
    third parties. This opposition proceeding is likely to be
    protracted and its outcome is uncertain at this time.

In addition Genentech, our collaborative partner for RITUXAN,
    has secured an exclusive license to five U.S. patents and
    counterpart U.S. and foreign patent applications assigned to
    Xoma Corporation that relate to chimeric antibodies against the
    CD20 antigen. These patents expire between 2007 and 2014.
    Genentech has granted us a non-exclusive sublicense to make,
    have made, use and sell RITUXAN under these patents and patent
    applications. We, along with Genentech, share the cost of any
    royalties due to Xoma in the Genentech/Biogen Idec copromotion
    territory on sales of RITUXAN. In addition, we and our
    collaborator, Genentech, have filed numerous



patent applications directed to anti-CD-20 antibodies and their
    uses to treat various diseases. These pending patent
    applications have the potential of issuing as patents in the
    U.S. and abroad covering anti-CD-20 antibody molecules for
    periods beyond that stated above for RITUXAN and ZEVALIN.

AMEVIVE

AMEVIVE is presently claimed in a number of patents granted in
    the U.S. and the EU, which cover LFA-3 polypeptides and
    DNA, LFA-3 fusion proteins and DNA, host cells, manufacturing
    methods and pharmaceutical compositions. We have obtained
    previously composition of matter patent coverage for the
    commercial product and important intermediates in the
    manufacturing process. The patent portfolio also included
    patents granted in the U.S. and the EU, which cover the use of
    LFA-3 polypeptides and LFA-3 fusion proteins in methods to
    inhibit T cell responses and use of LFA-3 polypeptides and
    fusion proteins to treat skin diseases, specifically including
    psoriasis. The patent portfolio further included pending patent
    applications, which seek coverage for the use of LFA-3
    polypeptides and fusion proteins in the treatment of other
    indications of possible future interest as well for certain
    combination therapy treatments of potential interest and
    utility. Patents issued or which may be issued on these various
    patent applications expire between 2007 (for patents relating to
    manufacturing intermediates) and 2021 (in the case of recently
    filed patent applications). The principal patents covering the
    drug product expire in 2013 subject to potential patent term
    extensions in countries where such extensions are available and
    by supplemental protection certificates in countries of the EU
    where such certificates may be obtained if and when approval of
    the product in the EU is obtained. Method of use patent
    protection for the product to treat skin diseases, including
    psoriasis, extends until 2017 in the U.S. and generally until
    2015 in the rest of the world. The foregoing patent portfolio
    has been sold to Astellas as part of the sale of the product
    which was consummated in the second quarter of 2006.

Recombinant
    Alpha Interferon

In 1979, we granted an exclusive worldwide license to
    Schering-Plough under our alpha interferon patents. Most of our
    alpha interferon patents have since expired, including
    expiration of patents in the U.S., Japan and all countries of
    Europe. We had obtained a supplementary protection certificate
    in Italy extending the coverage until 2007, but the Italian
    Legislature implemented legislation that shortened this period
    to December 31, 2005. We appealed the decision of the
    Italian Patent & Trademark Office to recalculate the
    duration of this supplementary protection certificate but our
    appeal has been denied, and the supplemental protection
    certificate has expired as a result of the new legislation.
    Schering-Plough pays us royalty payments on U.S. sales of
    alpha interferon products under an interference settlement
    entered into in 1998. Under the terms of the interference
    settlement, Schering-Plough agreed to pay us royalties under
    certain patents to be issued to Roche and Genentech in
    consideration of our assignment to Schering-Plough of the alpha
    interferon patent application that had been the subject of a
    settled interference with respect to a Roche/Genentech patent.
    Schering-Plough entered into an agreement with Roche as part of
    settlement of the interference. The first of the Roche/Genentech
    patents was issued on November 19, 2002 and has a
    seventeen-year term.

Recombinant
    Hepatitis B Antigens

We have obtained numerous patents in countries around the world,
    including in the U.S. and in European countries, covering the
    recombinant production of hepatitis B surface, core and
    “e” antigens. We have licensed our recombinant
    hepatitis B antigen patent rights to manufacturers and marketers
    of hepatitis B vaccines and diagnostic test kits, and receive
    royalties on sales of the vaccines and test kits by our
    licensees. See “Principal Licensed Products.” The
    obligation of GlaxoSmithKline and Merck to pay royalties on
    sales of hepatitis B vaccines and the obligation of our other
    licensees under our hepatitis B patents to pay royalties on
    sales of diagnostic products will terminate upon expiration of
    our hepatitis B patents in each licensed country. Following the
    conclusion of a successful interference proceeding in the U.S.,
    we were granted patents in the U.S. expiring in 2018. These
    patents claim hepatitis B virus polypeptides and vaccines and
    diagnostics containing such polypeptides. Our European hepatitis
    B patents expired at the end of 1999 and have also since expired
    in those countries in which we have obtained supplementary
    protection certificates. See “Item 3 — Legal
    Proceedings” for a description of our litigation with
    Classen Immunotherapies, Inc.



TYSABRI

We are developing TYSABRI in collaboration with Elan. TYSABRI is
    presently claimed in a number of pending patent applications and
    issued patents held by both companies in the U.S. and abroad.
    These patent applications and patents cover the protein, DNA
    encoding the protein, manufacturing methods and pharmaceutical
    compositions, as well as various methods of treatment using the
    product. In the U.S. the principal patents covering the
    product and methods of manufacturing the product generally
    expire between 2014 and 2020, subject to any available patent
    term extensions. In the remainder of the world patents on the
    product and methods of manufacturing the product generally
    expire between 2014 and 2016, subject to any supplemental
    protection certificates that may be obtained. Both companies
    have method of treatment patents for a variety of indications
    including the treatment of MS and Crohn’s disease and
    treatments of inflammation. These patents expire in the
    U.S. generally between 2012 and 2020 and outside the
    U.S. generally between 2012 and 2016, subject to any
    available patent term extensions

and/or

supplemental protection certificates extending such terms.

Trade
    Secrets and Confidential Know-How

We also rely upon unpatented trade secrets, and we cannot assure
    that others will not independently develop substantially
    equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise
    gain access to our trade secrets or disclose such technology, or
    that we can meaningfully protect such rights. We require our
    employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators,
    scientists whose research we sponsor and other advisers to
    execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of
    employment or consulting relationships with us. These agreements
    provide that all confidential information developed or made
    known to the individual during the course of the
    individual’s relationship with us is to be kept
    confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in
    specific circumstances. In the case of our employees, the
    agreement provides that all inventions conceived by such
    employees shall be our exclusive property. These agreements may
    not provide meaningful protection or adequate remedies for our
    trade secrets in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of
    such information.

Sales,
    Marketing and Distribution

Our sales and marketing efforts are generally focused on
    specialist physicians in private practice or at major medical
    centers. We utilize common pharmaceutical company practices to
    market our products and to educate physicians, including sales
    representatives calling on individual physicians,
    advertisements, professional symposia, direct mail, selling
    initiatives, public relations and other methods. We provide
    customer service and other related programs for our products,
    such as disease and product-specific websites, insurance
    research services and order, delivery and fulfillment services.
    We have also established programs in the U.S., which provide
    qualified uninsured or underinsured patients with commercial
    products at no charge. Specifics concerning the sales, marketing
    and distribution of each of our commercialized products are as
    follows:

AVONEX

We continue to focus our marketing and sales activities on
    maximizing the potential of AVONEX in the U.S. and the EU in the
    face of increased competition. In the U.S., Canada, Australia
    and most of the major countries of the EU and a number of other
    countries, we use our own sales forces and marketing groups to
    market and sell AVONEX. In these countries, we distribute AVONEX
    principally through wholesale distributors of pharmaceutical
    products, mail order specialty distributors or shipping service
    providers. In countries outside the U.S., Canada, Australia and
    the major countries of the EU, we sell AVONEX to distribution
    partners who are then responsible for most marketing and
    distribution activities. In November 2006, we launched AVONEX in
    Japan and as with the U.S. and major countries in the EU, we use
    our own sales forces and marketing groups to market and sell
    AVONEX.

TYSABRI

We use our own sales force and marketing group to market TYSABRI
    in the U.S., and Elan distributes TYSABRI in the U.S. We
    use our own sales force and marketing group to market TYSABRI in
    Europe, and we distribute TYSABRI in Europe.



RITUXAN
    AND ZEVALIN

RITUXAN

We market and sell RITUXAN in the U.S. in collaboration
    with Genentech. We, along with Genentech, have sales and
    marketing staffs dedicated to RITUXAN. Sales efforts for RITUXAN
    as a treatment for B-cell NHLs are focused on hematologists and
    medical oncologists in private practice, at community hospitals
    and at major medical centers in the U.S. Sales efforts for
    RITUXAN as a treatment for RA are focused on rheumatologists in
    private practice, at community hospitals and at major medical
    centers in the U.S.

Most B-cell NHLs are treated today in community-based group
    oncology practices. RITUXAN fits well into the community
    practice, as generally no special equipment, training or
    licensing is required for its administration or for management
    of treatment- related side effects. To date ZEVALIN has been
    primarily administered by nuclear medicine specialists or
    radiation oncologists at medical or cancer centers that are
    licensed and equipped for the handling, administration and
    disposal of radioisotopes.

RITUXAN is generally sold to wholesalers and specialty
    distributors and directly to hospital pharmacies. We rely on
    Genentech to supply marketing support services for RITUXAN
    including customer service, order entry, shipping, billing,
    insurance verification assistance, managed care sales support,
    medical information and sales training. Under our agreement with
    Genentech, all U.S. sales of RITUXAN are recognized by
    Genentech and we record our share of the pretax copromotion
    profits on a quarterly basis.

ZEVALIN

We use our own sales force and marketing group to market and
    sell ZEVALIN in the U.S. We generally focus our sales and
    marketing activities on educating physicians about
    ZEVALIN’s efficacy in relapsed indolent lymphoma, its
    safety profile and patient tolerance. In the U.S., we sell
    ZEVALIN to radiopharmacies that radiolabel, or combine, the
    ZEVALIN antibody with an indium-111 isotope or an yttrium-90
    radioisotope and then distribute the finished product to
    hospitals or licensed treatment facilities for administration.
    In the EU, we sell ZEVALIN to Bayer Schering Pharma AG, our
    exclusive licensee for ZEVALIN outside the U.S. Bayer
    Schering Pharma AG is responsible for sales, marketing and
    distribution activities for ZEVALIN outside the U.S. We
    have appointed MDS (Canada) Inc., or MDS (Canada), as our
    exclusive supplier of the yttrium-90 radioisotope required for
    therapeutic use of ZEVALIN to radiopharmacies. MDS (Canada) is
    the only supplier of the yttrium-90 radioisotope that is
    approved by the FDA. Radiopharmacies independently obtain the
    indium-111 isotope required for the imaging use of ZEVALIN from
    one of the two third party suppliers currently approved by the
    FDA to supply the indium-111 isotope. During the third quarter
    of 2006, we began executing a plan to divest our ZEVALIN product
    line.

FUMADERM

FUMADERM has been approved in Germany since 1994 for the
    treatment of severe psoriasis. FUMADERM is produced by
    Fumapharm, which we acquired in June 2006. We recently settled
    certain agreements with Fumedica Arzneimittel AG and Fumedica
    Arzneimittel GmbH, collectively, Fumedica, under which we bought
    the distribution rights to FUMADERM in Germany. Fumedica will
    continue to distribute FUMADERM until April 30, 2007, along
    with co-promotion partner Hermal. As of May 1, 2007, we
    expect that we will continue to co-promote FUMADERM in
    Germany together with a third party.

AMEVIVE

We sold the rights in the product to Astellas in the second
    quarter of 2006. Under the terms of the sale agreement with
    Astellas, we will continue to manufacture AMEVIVE and supply
    product to Astellas for a period of up to 11 years.

Competition

Competition in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries
    is intense and comes from many and varied sources. We do not
    believe that any of the industry leaders can be considered
    dominant in view of the rapid



technological change in the industry. We experience significant
    competition from specialized biotechnology firms in the U.S.,
    the EU and elsewhere and from many large pharmaceutical,
    chemical and other companies. Certain of these companies have
    substantially greater financial, marketing, research and
    development and human resources than we do. Most large
    pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies have considerable
    experience in undertaking clinical trials and in obtaining
    regulatory approval to market pharmaceutical products.

We believe that competition and leadership in the industry will
    be based on managerial and technological superiority and
    establishing proprietary positions through research and
    development. Leadership in the industry may also be influenced
    significantly by patents and other forms of protection of
    proprietary information. A key aspect of such competition is
    recruiting and retaining qualified scientists and technicians.
    We believe that we have been successful in attracting skilled
    and experienced scientific personnel. The achievement of a
    leadership position also depends largely upon our ability to
    identify and exploit commercially the products resulting from
    research and the availability of adequate financial resources to
    fund facilities, equipment, personnel, clinical testing,
    manufacturing and marketing.

Competition among products approved for sale may be based, among
    other things, on patent position, product efficacy, safety,
    convenience, reliability, availability and price. Many of our
    competitors are working to develop products similar to those
    that we are developing. The timing of the entry of a new
    pharmaceutical product into the market can be an important
    factor in determining the product’s eventual success and
    profitability. Early entry may have important advantages in
    gaining product acceptance and market share. Moreover, under the
    Orphan Drug Act, the FDA is prevented for a period of seven
    years from approving more than one application for the
    “same” product for the same indication in certain
    diseases with limited patient populations, unless a later
    product is considered clinically superior. The EU has similar
    laws and other jurisdictions have or are considering such laws.
    Accordingly, the relative speed with which we can develop
    products, complete the testing and approval process and supply
    commercial quantities of the product to the market will have an
    important impact on our competitive position.

After a patent expiry for a product, an abbreviated process
    exists for approval of small molecule drugs in the
    U.S. that are comparable to existing products, also known
    as generics. It is possible that legislative and regulatory
    bodies in the U.S. and Europe may provide a similar abbreviated
    process for comparable biologic products.

AVONEX
    AND TYSABRI

AVONEX, which generated $1.7 billion of worldwide revenues
    in 2006, and TYSABRI, which generated $35.8 million of
    worldwide revenues for us in 2006, both compete primarily with
    three other products:

•

REBIF, which is co-promoted by Merck Serono and Pfizer in the
    U.S. and sold by Merck Serono in Europe. REBIF generated
    worldwide revenues of approximately $1.3 billion in 2005.

•

BETASERON, sold by Berlex (an affiliate of Bayer Schering Pharma
    AG) in the U.S. and sold under the name
    BETAFERON

®

by Bayer Schering Pharma AG in the EU. BETASERON and BETAFERON
    together generated worldwide revenues of approximately
    $1.1 billion in 2005.

•

COPAXONE, sold by Teva Neuroscience, Inc., or Teva, in the U.S.
    and co-promoted by Teva and Sanofi-Aventis in Europe. COPAXONE
    generated worldwide revenues of approximately $1.4 billion
    in 2006.

Along with us, a number of companies are working to develop
    products to treat MS that may in the future compete with AVONEX
    and TYSABRI. Some of our current competitors are also working to
    develop alternative formulations for delivery of their products,
    which may in the future compete with AVONEX.

AVONEX also faces competition from off-label uses of drugs
    approved for other indications. Some of our current competitors
    are also working to develop alternative formulations for
    delivery of their products, which may in the future compete with
    AVONEX.

RITUXAN
    AND ZEVALIN — B-CELL NHLs

RITUXAN is typically used after patients fail to respond or
    relapse after treatment with traditional radiation therapy or
    standard chemotherapy regimes, such as CVP and CHOP. ZEVALIN is
    typically used after patients fail to respond or relapse
    following treatment with RITUXAN. ZEVALIN received designation
    as an Orphan Drug from



the FDA for the treatment of relapsed or refractory low grade,
    follicular, or transformed B-cell NHLs, including patients with
    RITUXAN refractory follicular NHL. Marketing exclusivity
    resulting from this Orphan Drug designation will expire in
    February 2009. ZEVALIN competes with
    BEXXAR

®

(tositumomab, iodine I-131 tositumomab), a radiolabeled molecule
    developed by Corixa Corporation which is being developed and
    commercialized by GlaxoSmithKline. BEXXAR is approved to treat
    patients with CD20+, follicular, non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma,
    with and without transformation, whose disease is refractory to
    RITUXAN and has relapsed following chemotherapy.

A number of other companies, including us, are working to
    develop products to treat B-cell NHLs and other forms of
    non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma that may ultimately compete with
    RITUXAN and ZEVALIN. Other potential competitors include
    Campath

®

(Berlex, Inc.), which is indicated for B-cell chronic
    lymphocytic leukemia (an unapproved use of RITUXAN),
    Velcade

®

(Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) which is indicated for
    multiple myeloma (an unapproved use of RITUXAN), and Humax CD20
    (GenMab) which is in late-stage development for refractory CLL
    and NHL. In addition to the foregoing products, we are aware of
    other anti-CD20 molecules in development that, if successfully
    developed and registered, may compete with RITUXAN.

RITUXAN
    IN RA

In February 2006, the FDA approved the sBLA for use of RITUXAN,
    in combination with methotrexate, for reducing signs and
    symptoms in adult patients with

moderately-to-severely

active RA who have had an inadequate response to one or more TNF
    antagonist therapies. RITUXAN will compete with several
    different types of therapies in the RA market, including:

•

traditional therapies for RA, including disease-modifying
    anti-rheumatic drugs, such as steroids, methotrexate and
    cyclosporine, and pain relievers such as acetaminophen;

•

anti-TNF therapies, such as
    REMICADE

®

(infliximab), a drug sold worldwide by Centocor, Inc., a
    subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson,
    HUMIRA

®

(adalimumab), a drug sold by Abbott Laboratories, and
    ENBREL

®

(etanercept), a drug sold by Amgen, Inc. and Wyeth
    Pharmaceuticals, Inc.;

•

ORENCIA

®

(abatacept), a drug developed by Bristol-Myers Squibb Company,
    which was approved by the FDA to treat

moderate-to-severe

RA in December 2005;

•

drugs in late-stage development for RA; and

•

drugs approved for other indications that are used to treat RA.

In addition, a number of other companies, including us, are
    working to develop products to treat RA that may ultimately
    compete with RITUXAN in the RA marketplace.

Regulatory

Our current and contemplated activities and the products and
    processes that will result from such activities are subject to
    substantial government regulation.

Before new pharmaceutical products may be sold in the U.S. and
    other countries, clinical trials of the products must be
    conducted and the results submitted to appropriate regulatory
    agencies for approval. Clinical trial programs must establish
    efficacy, determine an appropriate dose and regimen, and define
    the conditions for safe use, a high-risk process that requires
    stepwise clinical studies in which the candidate product must
    successfully meet predetermined endpoints. The results of the
    preclinical and clinical testing of a product are then submitted
    to the FDA in the form of a Biologics License Application, or
    BLA, or a New Drug Approval Application, or NDA. In response to
    a BLA or NDA, the FDA may grant marketing approval, request
    additional information or deny the application if it determines
    the application does not provide an adequate basis for approval.
    Similar submissions are required by authorities in other
    jurisdictions who independently assess the product and may reach
    the same or different conclusions. The receipt of regulatory
    approval often takes a number of years, involving the
    expenditure of substantial resources and depends on a number of
    factors, including the severity of the disease in question, the
    availability of alternative treatments and the risks and
    benefits demonstrated in clinical trials. On occasion,
    regulatory authorities may require larger or additional studies,
    leading to unanticipated delay or expense. Even after



initial FDA approval or approvals from other regulatory agencies
    have been obtained, further clinical trials may be required to
    provide additional data on safety and effectiveness and are
    required to gain clearance for the use of a product as a
    treatment for indications other than those initially approved.
    The FDA may grant “accelerated approval” status to
    products that treat serious or life-threatening illnesses and
    that provide meaningful therapeutic benefits to patients over
    existing treatments. Under this pathway, the FDA may approve a
    product based on surrogate endpoints, or clinical endpoints
    other than survival or irreversible morbidity, or when the
    product is shown to be effective but safe conditions of use can
    only be ensured by restricting access or distribution. Products
    approved under accelerated approval are required to satisfy
    additional commitments. When approval is based on surrogate
    endpoints or clinical endpoints other than survival or
    morbidity, the sponsor will be required to conduct clinical
    studies to verify and describe clinical benefit. When
    accelerated approval requires restricted use or distribution,
    the sponsor may be required to establish rigorous systems to
    assure use of the product under safe conditions, including use
    of a RiskMAP. In addition, for all products approved under
    accelerated approval, sponsors must submit all copies of its
    promotional materials, including advertisements, to the FDA at
    least thirty days prior to their initial dissemination. The FDA
    may also withdraw approval under accelerated approval after a
    hearing if, for instance, post-marketing studies fail to verify
    any clinical benefit or it becomes clear that restrictions on
    the distribution of the product are inadequate to ensure its
    safe use. Approval of ZEVALIN was granted under the accelerated
    approval provisions. The sBLA for TYSABRI in MS was granted
    accelerated approval under a restricted distribution program,
    and if approved, a supplemental BLA for Crohn’s disease
    would also likely fall under accelerated approval and a
    restricted distribution program. We cannot be certain that the
    FDA will approve any products for the proposed indications
    whether under accelerated approval or another pathway. If the
    FDA approves products or new indications, the agency may require
    us to conduct additional post-marketing studies. If we fail to
    conduct the required studies or otherwise fail to comply with
    the conditions of accelerated approval, the FDA may take action
    to seek to withdraw that approval. In Europe, the EMEA has new
    powers of sanction for non-completion of post marketing
    commitments. These range from a fine of 10% of global revenue to
    removal of the product from the market.

Regulatory authorities track information on side effects and
    adverse events reported during clinical studies and after
    marketing approval. Non-compliance with FDA safety reporting
    requirements may result in FDA regulatory action that may
    include civil action or criminal penalties. Side effects or
    adverse events that are reported during clinical trials can
    delay, impede, or prevent marketing approval. Similarly, adverse
    events that are reported after marketing approval can result in
    additional limitations being placed on the product’s use
    and, potentially, withdrawal or suspension of the product from
    the market. For example, in February 2005, in consultation with
    the FDA, we and Elan voluntarily suspended the marketing and
    commercial distribution of TYSABRI, and informed physicians that
    they should suspend dosing of TYSABRI until further
    notification. In addition, we suspended dosing in clinical
    studies of TYSABRI in MS, Crohn’s disease and RA. These
    decisions were based on reports of two cases of PML, a rare and
    frequently fatal, demyelinating disease of the central nervous
    system, that occurred in patients treated with TYSABRI in
    clinical studies. See “Our Products — Approved
    Indications and Ongoing Development — TYSABRI.”
    Any adverse event, either before or after marketing approval,
    could result in product liability claims against us. For
    example, in July 2005, a complaint was filed against us and Elan
    by the estate and husband of Anita Smith, a patient from the
    TYSABRI Phase III clinical study in combination with
    AVONEX, known as SENTINEL, who died after developing PML, a rare
    and frequently fatal, demyelinating disease of the central
    nervous system. See “Item 3 — Legal
    Proceedings” and the sections of
    “Item 1A — Risk Factors” entitled
    “Our near terms success depends on the market acceptance
    and successful launch of our third product TYSABRI” and
    “Pending and future product liability claims may adversely
    affect our business and our reputation.”

If we seek to make certain changes to an approved product, such
    as adding a new indication, making certain manufacturing
    changes, or changing manufacturers or suppliers of certain
    ingredients or components, we will need review and approval by
    regulatory authorities, including FDA and EMEA, before certain
    changes can be implemented.

Under the U.S. Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug
    designation to drugs intended to treat a “rare disease or
    condition,” which generally is a disease or condition that
    affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. Orphan
    drug designation must be requested before submitting a BLA or
    NDA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the generic
    identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use
    are publicly disclosed by



the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage
    in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and
    approval process. If a product which has an orphan drug
    designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the
    indication for which it has such designation, the product is
    entitled to orphan exclusivity, i.e., the FDA may not approve
    any other applications to market the same drug for the same
    indication for a period of seven years following marketing
    approval, except in certain very limited circumstances,
    including a showing of clinical superiority. ZEVALIN received
    orphan drug exclusivity in the U.S., which will expire in
    February 2009.

Most of our marketed products, including AVONEX, RITUXAN,
    ZEVALIN and TYSABRI, are licensed under the Public Health
    Service Act as biological products. Currently, all biological
    products (including follow-on biologics) must submit a full
    biologics license application (BLA) to the FDA and undergo
    rigorous review prior to approval. Unlike small molecule generic
    drugs subject to the generic drug provisions (Hatch-Waxman Act)
    of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as described below,
    there currently is no process in the US for the submission of
    applications based upon abbreviated data packages like those
    submitted to form the approval of a generic drug for follow-on
    biologics. In Europe, the EMEA has issued guidelines and the
    first biosimilar has been approved. The US government has also
    begun a process to determine the scientific and statutory basis
    upon which follow-on biologics could be marketed in the US. The
    FDA is engaged in an ongoing public dialogue regarding the
    appropriate scientific standards for these products. Key members
    of the U.S. Congress are considering legislation to allow
    for the approval of follow-on biologics but have not yet
    formally introduced legislation. We cannot be certain when, or
    if, Congress will pass such a law. We cannot predict what
    impact, if any, the approval of follow-on biologics will have on
    the sales of our products.

We are developing small molecule products. If development is
    successful, these products may be approved as drugs under the
    Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Under the Drug Price
    Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, also known
    as the Hatch-Waxman Act, Congress created an abbreviated FDA
    review process for generic versions of pioneer (brand name)
    small molecule drug products. The Hatch-Waxman Act created two
    pathways for abbreviated FDA review in the Federal Food, Drug,
    and Cosmetic Act. The first is the abbreviated new drug
    application (ANDA), a type of application in which approval is
    based on a showing of “sameness” to an already
    approved drug product. ANDAs do not need to contain full reports
    of safety and effectiveness, as do new drug applications (NDAs),
    but rather are required to demonstrate that their proposed
    products are “the same as” reference products with
    regard to their conditions of use, active ingredient(s), route
    of administration, dosage form, strength, and labeling. ANDA
    applicants are also required to demonstrate the
    “bioequivalence” of their products to the reference
    product. The second is a 505(b)(2) application, or an NDA for
    which one or more of the investigations relied upon by the
    applicant for approval was not conducted by or for the applicant
    and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of
    reference or use from the person by or for whom the
    investigation was conducted. The FDA has determined that
    505(b)(2) applications may be submitted for products that
    represent changes from approved products in conditions of use,
    active ingredient(s), route of administration, dosage form,
    strength, or bioavailability. A 505(b)(2) applicant must provide
    the FDA with any additional clinical data necessary to
    demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the product with the
    proposed change(s).

In addition to providing for the abbreviated review process, the
    Hatch-Waxman Act also provides for the restoration of a portion
    of the patent term lost during small molecule product
    development. In addition, the statute establishes a complex set
    of processes for notifying sponsors of pioneer products of ANDA
    and 505(b)(2) applicants that may infringe patents and to permit
    sponsors of pioneer drugs an opportunity to pursue patent
    litigation prior to FDA approval of the generic product. The
    Hatch-Waxman Act also awards non-patent marketing exclusivities
    to qualifying pioneer drug products. For example, the first
    applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a product that does not
    contain an active ingredient found in any other approved product
    is awarded five years of “new chemical entity”
    marketing exclusivity. Where this exclusivity is awarded, the
    FDA is prohibited from accepting any ANDAs or 505(b)(2)
    applications during the five-year period. The Hatch-Waxman Act
    also provides three years of “new use” marketing
    exclusivity for the approval of NDAs, 505(b)(2) applications,
    and supplements, where those applications contain the results of
    new clinical investigations (other than bioavailability studies)
    essential to the FDA’s approval of the applications.
    Provided that the new clinical investigations are essential to
    the FDA’s approval of the change, this three-year
    exclusivity prohibits the final approval of ANDAs or 505(b)(2)
    applications for products with the specific changes associated
    with those clinical investigations.



The FDA, the EMEA and other regulatory agencies regulate and
    inspect equipment, facilities, and processes used in the
    manufacturing of pharmaceutical and biologic products prior to
    providing approval to market a product. If after receiving
    clearance from regulatory agencies, a material change is made in
    manufacturing equipment, location, or process, additional
    regulatory review and approval may be required. We also must
    adhere to current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, and
    product-specific regulations enforced by the FDA through its
    facilities inspection program. The FDA, the EMEA and other
    regulatory agencies also conduct regular, periodic visits to
    re-inspect equipment, facilities, and processes following the
    initial approval. If, as a result of these inspections, it is
    determined that our equipment, facilities, or processes do not
    comply with applicable regulations and conditions of product
    approval, regulatory agencies may seek civil, criminal, or
    administrative sanctions

and/or

remedies against us, including the suspension of our
    manufacturing operations. In addition, the FDA regulates all
    advertising and promotion activities for products under its
    jurisdiction both prior to and after approval. Companies must
    comply with all applicable FDA requirements. If they do not,
    they are subject to the full range of civil and criminal
    penalties available to the FDA.

In the EU, Canada, and Australia, regulatory requirements and
    approval processes are similar in principle to those in the
    U.S. depending on the type of drug for which approval is
    sought. There are currently three potential tracks for marketing
    approval in EU countries: mutual recognition, decentralized and
    centralized procedures. These review mechanisms may ultimately
    lead to approval in all EU countries, but each method grants all
    participating countries some decision-making authority in
    product approval.

In the U.S., the federal government regularly considers
    reforming health care coverage and costs. For example, recent
    reforms to Medicare have reduced the reimbursement rates for
    many of our products. Effective January 1, 2005, Medicare
    pays physicians and suppliers that furnish our products under a
    new payment methodology using average sales price, or ASP,
    information. Manufacturers, including us, are required to
    provide ASP information to Centers for Medicare and Medicaid
    Services on a quarterly basis. The manufacturer submitted
    information is used to compute Medicare payment rates, which are
    set at ASP plus 6 percent, updated quarterly. There is a
    mechanism for comparison of such payment rates to widely
    available market prices, which could cause further decreases in
    Medicare payment rates, although this mechanism has yet to be
    utilized. Effective January 1, 2006, Medicare began to use
    the same ASP plus 6 percent payment methodology to
    determine Medicare rates paid for products furnished by hospital
    outpatient departments. If a manufacturer is found to have made
    a misrepresentation in the reporting of ASP, the statute
    provides for civil monetary penalties of up to $10,000 for each
    misrepresentation and for each day in which the
    misrepresentation was applied.

Another payment reform is the addition of an expanded
    prescription drug benefit for all Medicare beneficiaries known
    as Medicare Part D. This is a voluntary benefit that is
    being implemented through private plans under contractual
    arrangements with the federal government. Like pharmaceutical
    coverage through private health insurance, Part D plans
    establish formularies that govern the drugs and biologicals that
    will be offered and the

out-of-pocket

obligations for such products. In addition, plans are expected
    to negotiate discounts from drug manufacturers and pass on some
    of those savings to Medicare beneficiaries.

Future legislation or regulatory actions implementing recent or
    future legislation may have a significant effect on our
    business. Our ability to successfully commercialize products may
    depend in part on the extent to which reimbursement for the
    costs of our products and related treatments will be available
    in the U.S. and worldwide from government health administration
    authorities, private health insurers and other organizations.
    Substantial uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of
    newly approved health care products by third party payors.

We also participate in the Medicaid rebate program established
    by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990, and under
    amendments of that law that became effective in 1993. Under the
    Medicaid rebate program, we pay a rebate for each unit of
    product reimbursed by Medicaid. The amount of the rebate for
    each product is set by law as a minimum 15.1% of the average
    manufacturer price, or AMP, of that product, or if it is
    greater, the difference between AMP and the best price available
    from us to any commercial or non-governmental customer. The
    rebate amount also includes an inflation adjustment if AMP
    increases faster than inflation. Pending federal legislation
    would revise the calculation of AMP in a way that may lead to an
    increase in rebate amounts effective in 2007. The rebate amount
    is required to be recomputed each quarter based on our reports
    of current average manufacturer price and best price for each of
    our products to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.
    The terms of our



participation in the program impose an obligation to correct the
    prices reported in previous quarters, as may be necessary, for
    up to three years. Any such corrections could result in an
    overage or underage in our rebate liability for past quarters,
    depending on the direction of the correction. In addition to
    retroactive rebates, if we were found to have knowingly
    submitted false information to the government, in addition to
    other penalties available to the government, the statute
    provides for civil monetary penalties in the amount of
    $100,000 per item of false information. Participation in
    the Medicaid rebate program includes extending discounts under
    the Public Health Service, or PHS, pharmaceutical pricing
    program. The PHS pricing program extends discounts to a variety
    of community health clinics and other entities that receive
    health services grants from the PHS, as well as hospitals that
    serve a disproportionate share of poor Medicare beneficiaries.

We also make our products available for purchase by authorized
    users off of our Federal Supply Schedule, or FSS, contract with
    the Department of Veterans Affairs. As a result of the Veterans
    Health Care Act of 1992, or the VHC Act, federal law requires
    that FSS contract prices for our products for purchases by the
    Veterans Administration, the Department of Defense, Coast Guard,
    and the PHS (including the Indian Health Service) be capped at
    “federal ceiling prices,” or FCPs. FCPs are computed
    by taking, at a minimum, a 24% reduction off the
    “non-federal average manufacturer price,” or non-FAMP.
    Our reported non-FAMPs and FCPs for our various products are
    used in establishing the FSS prices available to these
    government agencies. The accuracy of the reported non-FAMPs and
    FCPs may be audited by the government under applicable federal
    procurement laws. Among the remedies available to the government
    for infractions of these laws is recoupment of any overages paid
    by FSS users during the audited years. In addition, if we were
    found to have knowingly reported a false non-FAMP or FCP, the
    VHC Act provides for civil monetary penalties of
    $100,000 per item of false information.

We are also subject to various federal and state laws pertaining
    to health care “fraud and abuse,” including
    anti-kickback laws and false claims laws. Anti-kickback laws
    make it illegal for a prescription drug manufacturer to solicit,
    offer, receive, or pay any remuneration in exchange for, or to
    induce, the referral of business, including the purchase or
    prescription of a particular drug. Due to the breadth of the
    statutory provisions and the absence of guidance in the form of
    regulations and very few court decisions addressing industry
    practices, it is possible that our practices might be challenged
    under anti-kickback or similar laws. False claims laws prohibit
    anyone from knowingly and willingly presenting, or causing to be
    presented for payment to third party payors (including Medicare
    and Medicaid) claims for reimbursed drugs or services that are
    false or fraudulent, claims for items or services not provided
    as claimed, or claims for medically unnecessary items or
    services. Our activities relating to the sale and marketing of
    our products may be subject to scrutiny under these laws.
    Violations of fraud and abuse laws may be punishable by criminal

and/or

civil
    sanctions, including fines and civil monetary penalties, as well
    as the possibility of exclusion from federal health care
    programs (including Medicare and Medicaid). If the government
    were to allege or convict us of violating these laws, our
    business could be harmed. In addition, there is an ability for
    private individuals to bring similar actions. For a description
    of litigation in this area in which we are currently involved,
    see “Item 3 — Legal Proceedings.”

Our activities could be subject to challenge for the reasons
    discussed above and due to the broad scope of these laws and the
    increasing attention being given to them by law enforcement
    authorities. Further, there are an increasing number of state
    laws that require manufacturers to make reports to states on
    pricing and marketing information. Many of these laws contain
    ambiguities as to what is required to comply with the laws.
    Given the lack of clarity in laws and their implementation, our
    reporting actions could be subject to the penalty provisions of
    the pertinent state authorities.

We are also subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices
    Act which prohibits corporations and individuals from paying,
    offering to pay, or authorizing the payment of anything of value
    to any foreign government official, government staff member,
    political party, or political candidate in an attempt to obtain
    or retain business or to otherwise influence a person working in
    an official capacity.

We conduct relevant research at all of our research facilities
    in the U.S. in compliance with the current
    U.S. National Institutes of Health Guidelines for Research
    Involving Recombinant DNA Molecules, or the NIH Guidelines, and
    all other applicable federal and state regulations. By local
    ordinance, we are required to, among other things, comply with
    the NIH Guidelines in relation to our facilities in Cambridge,
    Massachusetts, and San Diego, California, and are required
    to operate pursuant to certain permits.



Our present and future business has been and will continue to be
    subject to various other laws and regulations. Various laws,
    regulations and recommendations relating to safe working
    conditions, laboratory practices, the experimental use of
    animals, and the purchase, storage, movement, import and export
    and use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous
    substances, including radioactive compounds and infectious
    disease agents, used in connection with our research work are or
    may be applicable to our activities. Certain agreements entered
    into by us involving exclusive license rights may be subject to
    national or supranational antitrust regulatory control, the
    effect of which also cannot be predicted. The extent of
    government regulation, which might result from future
    legislation or administrative action, cannot accurately be
    predicted.

Manufacturing
    and Raw Materials

We currently produce all of our bulk AVONEX and TYSABRI, as well
    as AMEVIVE on a contract basis for Astellas, at our
    manufacturing facilities located in Research Triangle Park,
    North Carolina and Cambridge, Massachusetts. We manufacture the
    commercial requirements of the antibody for ZEVALIN at our
    manufacturing facilities in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Genentech
    is responsible for all worldwide manufacturing activities for
    bulk RITUXAN and has sourced the manufacturing of certain bulk
    RITUXAN requirements to an independent third party. We
    manufacture clinical products in Research Triangle Park, North
    Carolina and Cambridge, Massachusetts.

In August 2004, we restarted construction of our large-scale
    biologic manufacturing facility in Hillerod, Denmark to be used
    to manufacture TYSABRI and other products in our pipeline. After
    our voluntary suspension of TYSABRI, we reconsidered our
    construction plans and determined that we would proceed with the
    bulk manufacturing component of the large-scale biologic
    manufacturing facility and add a labeling and packaging
    component to the project. We decided not to proceed with the
    fill-finish component of the large-scale biological
    manufacturing facility. See “Item 1A — Risk
    Factors — We are committing to a significant
    investment in the expansion of a manufacturing facility the
    success of which relies upon continued demand for our
    products.”

We source all of our fill-finish and the majority of final
    product storage operations for our products, along with a
    substantial part of our packaging operations, to a concentrated
    group of third party contractors. Many of the raw materials and
    supplies required for the production of AVONEX, ZEVALIN, AMEVIVE
    and TYSABRI are available from various suppliers in quantities
    adequate to meet our needs. However, due to the unique nature of
    the production of our products, we do have several single source
    providers of raw materials. We make efforts to qualify new
    vendors and to develop contingency plans so that production is
    not impacted by short-term issues associated with single source
    providers. Each of our third party service providers, suppliers
    and manufacturers are subject to continuing inspection by the
    FDA or comparable agencies in other jurisdictions. Any delay,
    interruption or other issues that arise in the manufacture,
    fill-finish, packaging, or storage of our products, including as
    a result of a failure of our facilities or the facilities or
    operations of third parties to pass any regulatory agency
    inspection, could significantly impair our ability to sell our
    products. See the sections of “Item 1A —
    Risk Factors” entitled “Manufacturing problems could
    result in our inability to deliver products, inventory
    shortages, product recalls and increased costs”, “We
    rely on third parties to provide services in connection with the
    manufacture of our products and, in some instances, the
    manufacture of the product itself,” and “If we fail to
    meet the stringent requirements of governmental regulation in
    the manufacture of our products, we could incur substantial
    remedial costs and a reduction in sales.”

We believe that our existing manufacturing facilities and
    outside sources will allow us to meet our near-term and
    long-term manufacturing needs for our current commercial
    products and our other products currently in clinical trials.
    Our existing licensed manufacturing facilities operate under
    multiple licenses from the FDA, regulatory authorities in the EU
    and other regulatory authorities. For a discussion of risks
    related to our ability to meet our manufacturing needs for our
    commercial products and our other products currently in clinical
    trials, see the sections of “Item 1A — Risk
    Factors” entitled “Manufacturing problems could result
    in our inability to deliver products, inventory shortages,
    product recalls and increased costs”, “We rely on
    third parties to provide services in connection with the
    manufacture of our products and, in some instances, the
    manufacture of the product itself,” and “If we fail to
    meet the stringent requirements of governmental regulation in
    the manufacture of our products, we could incur substantial
    remedial costs and a reduction in sales.”



Additional manufacturing facilities and outside sources may be
    required to meet our long-term research, development and
    commercial production needs.

Item 1A.

Risk
    Factors

We are
    substantially dependent on revenues from our two principal
    products

Our current and future revenues depend substantially upon
    continued sales of our two principal products, AVONEX and
    RITUXAN, which represented approximately 94% of our total
    revenues in 2006. Any significant negative developments relating
    to these two products, such as safety or efficacy issues, the
    introduction or greater acceptance of competing products
    (including greater than anticipated substitution of TYSABRI for
    AVONEX) or adverse regulatory or legislative developments, would
    have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
    Although we have developed and continue to develop additional
    products for commercial introduction, we expect to be
    substantially dependent on sales from these two products for
    many years. A decline in sales from either of these two products
    would adversely affect our business.

Our
    long-term success depends upon the successful development and
    commercialization of other products from our research and
    development activities

Our long-term viability and growth will depend upon the
    successful development and commercialization of other products
    from our research and development activities. We, along with
    Genentech, continue to expand our development efforts related to
    additional uses for RITUXAN and follow on anti-CD20 product
    candidates, and we are independently expanding development
    efforts around other potential products in our pipeline. Product
    development and commercialization are very expensive and involve
    a high degree of risk. Only a small number of research and
    development programs result in the commercialization of a
    product. Success in early stage clinical trials or preclinical
    work does not ensure that later stage or larger scale clinical
    trials will be successful. Even if later stage clinical trials
    are successful, the risk remains that unexpected concerns may
    arise from additional data or analysis or that obstacles may
    arise or issues may be identified in connection with review of
    clinical data with regulatory authorities or that regulatory
    authorities may disagree with our view of the data or require
    additional data or information or additional studies.

If we are unable to introduce new products to the market
    successfully or are unable to expand the indicated uses of
    approved products such as RITUXAN and TYSABRI, our results of
    operations would be adversely affected.

Adverse
    safety events can negatively affect our assets, product sales,
    operations and products in development

Even after we receive marketing approval for a product, adverse
    event reports may have a negative impact on our
    commercialization efforts. Our voluntary withdrawal of TYSABRI
    from the market in February 2005 following reports of cases of
    PML resulted in a significant reduction in expected revenues as
    well as significant expense and management time required to
    address the legal and regulatory issues arising from the
    withdrawal, including revised labeling and enhanced risk
    management programs. Later discovery of safety issues with our
    products that were not known at the time of their approval by
    the FDA could cause product liability events, additional
    regulatory scrutiny and requirements for additional labeling,
    withdrawal of products from the market and the imposition of
    fines or criminal penalties. Any of these actions could result
    in, among other things, material write-offs of inventory and
    impairments of intangible assets, goodwill and fixed assets.

Our
    near-term success depends on the market acceptance and
    successful launch of our third product TYSABRI

A substantial portion of our growth in the near-term is
    dependent on anticipated sales of TYSABRI. We received
    regulatory approval to market TYSABRI in the U.S. and the EU for
    relapsing forms of MS in June of 2006. We re-introduced TYSABRI
    in the U.S. and launched TYSABRI for the first time in Europe in
    the second half of 2006. TYSABRI is expected to meaningfully
    diversify our product offerings and revenues, and to drive
    additional revenue growth over the next several years. Failure
    to launch the drug successfully would result in a significant
    reduction in diversification and expected revenues, and
    adversely affect our business.

The success of the reintroduction of TYSABRI into the
    U.S. market and launch in the EU will depend upon its
    acceptance by the medical community and patients, which cannot
    be certain given the significant restrictions on use



and the significant safety warnings in the label. Additional
    cases of the known side effect PML at a higher rate than
    indicated in the prescribing information, or the occurrence of
    other unexpected side effects could harm acceptance and limit
    TYSABRI sales. Any significant lack of acceptance of TYSABRI by
    the medical community or patients would materially and adversely
    affect our growth and our plans for the future.

As a new entrant to a relatively mature MS market, TYSABRI sales
    may be more sensitive to additional new competing products. A
    number of such products are expected to be approved for use in
    MS in the coming years. If these products have a similar or more
    attractive overall profile in terms of efficacy, convenience and
    safety, future sales of TYSABRI could be limited.

If we
    do not successfully execute our strategy of growth through the
    acquisition, partnering and in-licensing of products,
    technologies or companies, our future performance could be
    adversely affected

In addition to the expansion of our pipeline through spending on
    internal development projects, we plan to grow through external
    growth opportunities, which include the acquisition, partnering
    and in-licensing of products, technologies and companies or the
    entry into strategic alliances and collaborations. If we are
    unable to complete or manage these external growth opportunities
    successfully, we will not be able to grow our business in the
    way that we currently expect. The availability of high quality
    opportunities is limited and we are not certain that we will be
    able to identify suitable candidates or complete transactions on
    terms that are acceptable to us. In addition, even if we are
    able to successfully identify and complete acquisitions, we may
    not be able to integrate them or take full advantage of them and
    therefore may not realize the benefits that we expect. If we are
    unsuccessful in our external growth program, we may not be able
    to grow our business significantly and we may incur asset
    impairment charges as a result of acquisitions that are not
    successful.

If we
    fail to compete effectively, our business and market position
    would suffer

The biotechnology industry is intensely competitive. We compete
    in the marketing and sale of our products, the development of
    new products and processes, the acquisition of rights to new
    products with commercial potential and the hiring and retention
    of personnel. We compete with biotechnology and pharmaceutical
    companies that have a greater number of products on the market,
    greater financial and other resources and other technological or
    competitive advantages. We cannot be certain that one or more of
    our competitors will not receive patent protection that
    dominates, blocks or adversely affects our product development
    or business, will not benefit from significantly greater sales
    and marketing capabilities, or will not develop products that
    are accepted more widely than ours. The introduction of
    alternatives to our products that offer advantages in efficacy,
    safety or ease of use could negatively affect our revenues and
    reduce the value of our product development efforts. In
    addition, potential governmental action in the future could
    provide a means for competition from developers of follow-on
    biologics, which could compete on price and differentiation with
    products that we now or could in the future market.

In addition to competing directly with products that are
    marketed by substantial pharmaceutical competitors, both AVONEX
    and RITUXAN also face competition from off-label uses of drugs
    approved for other indications. Some of our current competitors
    are also working to develop alternative formulations for
    delivery of their products, which may in the future compete with
    ours.

We
    depend on collaborators for both product and royalty revenue and
    the clinical development of future collaboration products, two
    important parts of our business outside of our full
    control

Collaborations between companies on products or programs are a
    common business practice in the biotechnology industry.
    Out-licensing typically allows a partner to collect up front
    payments and future milestone payments, share the costs of
    clinical development and risk of failure at various points, and
    access sales and marketing infrastructure and expertise in
    exchange for certain financial rights to the product or program
    going to the in-licensing partner. In addition, the obligation
    of in-licensees to pay royalties or share profits generally
    terminates upon expiration of the related patents. We have a
    number of collaborators and partners, and have both in-licensed
    and out-licensed several products and programs. These
    collaborations include several risks:

•

we are not fully in control of the royalty or profit sharing
    revenues we receive from collaborators, and we cannot be certain
    of the timing or potential impact of factors including patent
    expirations, pricing or health



care reforms, other legal and regulatory developments, failure
    of our partners to comply with applicable laws and regulatory
    requirements, the introduction of competitive products, and new
    indication approvals which may affect the sales of collaboration
    products;

•

where we co-promote and co-market products with our
    collaboration partners, any failure on their part to comply with
    applicable laws in the sale and marketing of our products could
    have an adverse effect on our revenues as well as involve us in
    possible legal proceedings;

•

collaborations often require the parties to cooperate, and
    failure to do so effectively could have an impact on product
    sales by our collaborators and partners, as well as an impact on
    the clinical development of shared products or programs under
    joint control.

In addition, the successful development and commercialization of
    new anti-CD20 product candidates in our collaboration with
    Genentech (which also includes RITUXAN) will decrease our
    participation in the operating profits from the collaboration
    (including as to RITUXAN).

We
    depend, to a significant extent, on reimbursement from third
    party payors and a reduction in the extent of reimbursement
    could negatively affect our product sales and
    revenue

Sales of our products are dependent, in large part, on the
    availability and extent of reimbursement from government health
    administration authorities, private health insurers and other
    organizations. U.S. and foreign government regulations mandating
    price controls and limitations on patient access to our products
    impact our business and our future results could be adversely
    affected by changes in such regulations. In addition, states may
    more aggressively seek Medicaid rebates as a result of
    legislation enacted in 2006, which rebate activity could
    adversely affect our results of operations.

In the U.S., many of our products are subject to increasing
    pricing pressures. Such pressures may increase as a result of
    the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act
    of 2003. Managed care organizations as well as Medicaid and
    other government health administration authorities continue to
    seek price discounts. Government efforts to reduce Medicaid
    expenses may continue to increase the use of managed care
    organizations. This may result in managed care organizations
    influencing prescription decisions for a larger segment of the
    population and a corresponding constraint on prices and
    reimbursement for our products. In addition, some states have
    implemented and other states are considering price controls or
    patient-access constraints under the Medicaid program and some
    states are considering price-control regimes that would apply to
    broader segments of their populations that are not Medicaid
    eligible. Other matters also could be the subject of
    U.S. federal or state legislative or regulatory action that
    could adversely affect our business, including the importation
    of prescription drugs that are marketed outside the U.S. and
    sold at lower prices as a result of drug price regulations by
    the governments of various foreign countries.

We encounter similar regulatory and legislative issues in most
    other countries. In the EU and some other international markets,
    the government provides health care at low cost to consumers and
    regulates pharmaceutical prices, patient eligibility or
    reimbursement levels to control costs for the
    government-sponsored health care system. This international
    patchwork of price regulations may lead to inconsistent prices.
    Within the EU and other countries some third party trade in our
    products occurs from markets with lower prices —
    thereby undermining our sales in some markets with higher
    prices. Additionally, certain countries reference the prices in
    other countries where our products are marketed. Thus, inability
    to secure adequate prices in a particular country may also
    impair our ability to obtain acceptable prices in existing and
    potential new markets. This may create the opportunity for the
    third party cross border trade previously mentioned or our
    decision not to sell the product thus affecting our geographic
    expansion plans.

When a new medical product is approved, the availability of
    government and private reimbursement for that product is
    uncertain, as is the amount for which that product will be
    reimbursed. We cannot predict the availability or amount of
    reimbursement for our product candidates.



Our
    business is subject to extensive governmental regulation and
    oversight and changes in laws could adversely affect our
    revenues and profitability

Our business is in a highly regulated industry. As a result,
    governmental actions may adversely affect our business,
    operations or financial condition, including:

•

new laws, regulations or judicial decisions, or new
    interpretations of existing laws, regulations or decisions,
    related to health care availability, method of delivery and
    payment for health care products and services;

•

changes in the FDA and foreign regulatory approval processes
    that may delay or prevent the approval of new products and
    result in lost market opportunity;

•

changes in FDA and foreign regulations that may require
    additional safety monitoring after the introduction of our
    products to market, which could increase our costs of doing
    business and adversely affect the future permitted uses of
    approved products,

•

new laws, regulations and judicial decisions affecting pricing
    or marketing; and

•

changes in the tax laws relating to our operations.

The enactment in the U.S. of the Medicare Prescription Drug
    Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, possible legislation
    which could ease the entry of competing follow-on biologics in
    the marketplace, and importation of lower-cost competing drugs
    from other jurisdictions are examples of changes and possible
    changes in laws that could adversely affect our business.

If we
    fail to comply with the extensive legal and regulatory
    requirements affecting the healthcare industry, we could face
    increased costs, penalties and a loss of business

Our activities, including the sale and marketing of our
    products, are subject to extensive government regulation and
    oversight, including regulation under the U.S. Food, Drug
    and Cosmetic Act and other federal and state statutes and
    similar laws in foreign jurisdictions. Pharmaceutical and
    biotechnology companies have been the target of lawsuits and
    investigations alleging violations of government regulation,
    including claims asserting antitrust violations and violations
    of the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or other violations
    related to environmental matters. Violations of governmental
    regulation may be punishable by criminal and civil sanctions,
    including fines and civil monetary penalties and exclusion from
    participation in government programs. Whether or not we have
    complied with the law, an investigation into alleged unlawful
    conduct could increase our expenses, damage our reputation,
    divert management time and attention and adversely affect our
    business.

The Medicare/Medicaid anti-kickback law, and several similar
    state laws, prohibit payments intended to induce physicians or
    others either to purchase or arrange for or recommend the
    purchase of healthcare products or services. These laws
    constrain the sales, marketing and other promotional activities
    of manufacturers of drugs and biologicals, such as us, by
    limiting the kinds of financial arrangements, including sales
    programs, with hospitals, physicians, and other potential
    purchasers of drugs and biologicals. Other federal and state
    laws generally prohibit individuals or entities from knowingly
    presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from
    Medicare, Medicaid, or other third party payors that are false
    or fraudulent, or are for items or services that were not
    provided as claimed. Anti-kickback and false claims laws
    prescribe civil and criminal penalties for noncompliance that
    can be substantial, including the possibility of exclusion from
    federal healthcare programs (including Medicare and Medicaid).

Manufacturing
    problems could result in our inability to deliver products,
    inventory shortages, product recalls and increased
    costs

We manufacture and expect to continue to manufacture our own
    commercial requirements of bulk AVONEX and TYSABRI. Our products
    are difficult to manufacture and problems in our manufacturing
    processes can occur. Our inability to manufacture successfully
    bulk product and to maintain regulatory approvals of our
    manufacturing facilities would harm our ability to produce
    timely sufficient quantities of commercial supplies of AVONEX
    and TYSABRI to meet demand. Problems with manufacturing
    processes could result in product defects or manufacturing
    failures, which could require us to delay shipment of products,
    recall, or withdraw products previously



shipped, or impair our ability to expand into new markets or
    supply products in existing markets. In the past, we have had to
    write down and incur other charges and expenses for products
    that failed to meet specifications. Similar charges may occur in
    the future.

We currently manufacture TYSABRI at our manufacturing facility
    in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, or RTP. Although we
    are proceeding with construction of the bulk manufacturing
    component of our large-scale biologic manufacturing facility in
    Hillerod, Denmark and have added a labeling and packaging
    component to the project, we currently rely exclusively on our
    RTP facility for the manufacture of TYSABRI.

If we cannot produce sufficient commercial requirements of bulk
    product to meet demand, we would need to rely on third party
    contract manufacturers, of which there are only a limited number
    capable of manufacturing bulk products of the type we require.
    We cannot be certain that we could reach agreement on reasonable
    terms, if at all, with those manufacturers. Even if we were to
    reach agreement, the transition of the manufacturing process to
    a third party to enable commercial supplies could take a
    significant amount of time. Our ability to supply products in
    sufficient capacity to meet demand is also dependent upon third
    party contractors to fill-finish, package and store such
    products. Any prolonged interruption in the operations of our
    existing manufacturing facilities could result in cancellations
    of shipments or loss of product in the process of being
    manufactured. Because our manufacturing processes are highly
    complex and are subject to a lengthy FDA approval process,
    alternative qualified production capacity may not be available
    on a timely basis or at all.

We
    rely on third parties to provide services in connection with the
    manufacture of our products and, in some instances, the
    manufacture of the product itself

We rely on Genentech for all RITUXAN manufacturing. Genentech
    relies on a third party to manufacture certain bulk RITUXAN
    requirements. If Genentech or any third party upon which it
    relies does not manufacture or fill-finish RITUXAN in sufficient
    quantities and on a timely and cost-effective basis, or if
    Genentech or any third party does not obtain and maintain all
    required manufacturing approvals, our business could be harmed.

We also source all of our fill-finish and the majority of our
    final product storage operations, along with a substantial
    portion of our packaging operations of the components used with
    our products, to a concentrated group of third party
    contractors. The manufacture of products and product components,
    fill-finish, packaging and storage of our products require
    successful coordination among ourselves and multiple third party
    providers. Our inability to coordinate these efforts, the lack
    of capacity available at a third party contractor or any other
    problems with the operations of these third party contractors
    could require us to delay shipment of saleable products, recall
    products previously shipped or impair our ability to supply
    products at all. This could increase our costs, cause us to lose
    revenue or market share, and damage our reputation. Any third
    party we use to fill-finish, package or store our products to be
    sold in the U.S. must be licensed by the FDA. As a result,
    alternative third party providers may not be readily available
    on a timely basis.

Due to the unique nature of the production of our products,
    there are several single source providers of raw materials. We
    make every effort to qualify new vendors and to develop
    contingency plans so that production is not impacted by
    short-term issues associated with single source providers.
    Nonetheless, our business could be materially impacted by long
    term or chronic issues associated with single source providers.

If we
    fail to meet the stringent requirements of governmental
    regulation in the manufacture of our products, we could incur
    substantial remedial costs and a reduction in
    sales

We and our third party providers are generally required to
    maintain compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practice, or
    cGMP, and are subject to inspections by the FDA or comparable
    agencies in other jurisdictions to confirm such compliance. Any
    changes of suppliers or modifications of methods of
    manufacturing require amending our application to the FDA and
    acceptance of the change by the FDA prior to release of product
    to the marketplace. Our inability, or the inability of our third
    party service providers, to demonstrate ongoing cGMP compliance
    could require us to withdraw or recall product and interrupt
    commercial supply of our products. Any delay, interruption or
    other issues that arise in the manufacture, fill-finish,
    packaging, or storage of our products as a result of a failure
    of our facilities or the facilities or operations of third
    parties to pass any regulatory agency



inspection could significantly impair our ability to develop and
    commercialize our products. This non-compliance could increase
    our costs, cause us to lose revenue or market share and damage
    our reputation.

We are
    committing to a significant investment in the expansion of a
    manufacturing facility the success of which relies upon
    continued demand for our products

We are proceeding with the second phase of our large-scale
    biologic manufacturing facility in Hillerod, Denmark and our
    Board of Directors has authorized an additional
    $225 million to be spent on the project in addition to the
    $275 million we have spent to date. In the event that we
    fail to manage the projects, or other unforeseen events occur,
    we may incur additional costs to complete the project.
    Additionally, any costs incurred may not be recoverable in the
    event that projection of the demand for future manufacturing
    volumes, including the demand for TYSABRI, are not achieved.

If we
    are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel and key
    relationships, the growth of our business could be
    harmed

Our success will depend, to a great extent, upon our ability to
    attract and retain qualified scientific, manufacturing, sales
    and marketing and executive personnel and our ability to develop
    and maintain relationships with qualified clinical researchers
    and key distributors. Competition for these people and
    relationships is intense and we compete with numerous
    pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies as well as with
    universities and non-profit research organizations. Any
    inability we experience to continue to attract and retain
    qualified personnel or develop and maintain key relationships
    could have an adverse effect on our ability to accomplish our
    research, development and external growth objectives.

Our
    operating results are subject to significant
    fluctuations

Our quarterly revenues, expenses and net income (loss) have
    fluctuated in the past and are likely to fluctuate significantly
    in the future due to the timing of charges and expenses that we
    may take. In recent periods, for instance, we have recorded
    charges that include:

•

acquired in-process research and development at the time we make
    an acquisition;

•

impairments that we are required to take with respect to
    investments;

•

impairments that we are required to take with respect to fixed
    assets, including those that are recorded in connection with the
    sale of fixed assets;

•

the cost of restructurings.

Additionally, net income may fluctuate due to the impact of
    charges we may be required to take with respect to foreign
    currency hedge transactions. In particular, we may incur higher
    charges from hedge ineffectiveness than we expect or from the
    termination of a hedge relationship.

These examples are only illustrative and other risks, including
    those discussed in these “Risk Factors,” could also
    cause fluctuations in our reported earnings. In addition, our
    operating results during any one quarter do not necessarily
    suggest the anticipated results of future quarters.

If we
    are unable to adequately protect and enforce our intellectual
    property rights, our competitors may take advantage of our
    development efforts or our acquired technology

We have filed numerous patent applications in the U.S. and
    various other countries seeking protection of inventions
    originating from our research and development, including a
    number of our processes and products. Patents have been issued
    on many of these applications. We have also obtained rights to
    various patents and patent applications under licenses with
    third parties, which provide for the payment of royalties by us.
    The ultimate degree of patent protection that will be afforded
    to biotechnology products and processes, including ours, in the
    U.S. and in other important markets remains uncertain and is
    dependent upon the scope of protection decided upon by the
    patent offices, courts and lawmakers in these countries. Our
    patents may not afford us substantial protection or commercial
    benefit. Similarly, our pending patent applications or patent
    applications licensed from third parties may not



ultimately be granted as patents and we may not prevail if
    patents that have been issued to us are challenged in court. If
    we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights and
    prevent others from exploiting our inventions, we will not
    derive the benefit from them that we currently expect.

If our
    products infringe the intellectual property rights of others, we
    may incur damages and be required to incur the expense of
    obtaining a license

A substantial number of patents have already been issued to
    other biotechnology and biopharmaceutical companies. Competitors
    may have filed applications for, or have been issued patents and
    may obtain additional patents and proprietary rights that may
    relate to products or processes competitive with or similar to
    our products and processes. Moreover, the patent laws of the
    U.S. and foreign countries are distinct and decisions as to
    patenting, validity of patents and infringement of patents may
    be resolved differently in different countries. In general, we
    obtain licenses to third party patents that we deem necessary or
    desirable for the manufacture, use and sale of our products. We
    are currently unable to assess the extent to which we may wish
    or be required to acquire rights under such patents and the
    availability and cost of acquiring such rights, or whether a
    license to such patents will be available on acceptable terms or
    at all. There may be patents in the U.S. or in foreign
    countries or patents issued in the future that are unavailable
    to license on acceptable terms. Our inability to obtain such
    licenses may hinder our ability to market our products.

Uncertainty
    over intellectual property in the biotechnology industry has
    been the source of litigation, which is inherently costly and
    unpredictable

We are aware that others, including various universities and
    companies working in the biotechnology field, have filed patent
    applications and have been granted patents in the U.S. and in
    other countries claiming subject matter potentially useful to
    our business. Some of those patents and patent applications
    claim only specific products or methods of making such products,
    while others claim more general processes or techniques useful
    or now used in the biotechnology industry. There is considerable
    uncertainty within the biotechnology industry about the
    validity, scope and enforceability of many issued patents in the
    U.S. and elsewhere in the world, and, to date, there is no
    consistent policy regarding the breadth of claims allowed in
    biotechnology patents. We cannot currently determine the
    ultimate scope and validity of patents which may be granted to
    third parties in the future or which patents might be asserted
    to be infringed by the manufacture, use and sale of our products.

There has been, and we expect that there may continue to be
    significant litigation in the industry regarding patents and
    other intellectual property rights. Litigation and
    administrative proceedings concerning patents and other
    intellectual property rights may be protracted, expensive and
    distracting to management. Competitors may sue us as a way of
    delaying the introduction of our products. Any litigation,
    including any interference proceedings to determine priority of
    inventions, oppositions to patents in foreign countries or
    litigation against our partners, may be costly and time
    consuming and could harm our business. We expect that litigation
    may be necessary in some instances to determine the validity and
    scope of certain of our proprietary rights. Litigation may be
    necessary in other instances to determine the validity, scope

and/or

noninfringement of certain patent rights claimed by third
    parties to be pertinent to the manufacture, use or sale of our
    products. Ultimately, the outcome of such litigation could
    adversely affect the validity and scope of our patent or other
    proprietary rights, or, conversely, hinder our ability to market
    our products.

Pending
    and future product liability claims may adversely affect our
    business and our reputation

The administration of drugs in humans, whether in clinical
    studies or commercially, carries the inherent risk of product
    liability claims whether or not the drugs are actually the cause
    of an injury. Our products or product candidates may cause, or
    may appear to have caused, injury or dangerous drug interactions
    and we may not learn about or understand those effects until the
    product or product candidate has been administered to patients
    for a prolonged period of time. For example, we may face
    lawsuits with product liability and other related claims by
    patients treated with TYSABRI or related to TYSABRI, including
    lawsuits already filed by patients who have had serious adverse
    events while using TYSABRI.



We cannot predict with certainty the eventual outcome of any
    pending or future litigation. We may not be successful in
    defending ourselves in the litigation and, as a result, our
    business could be materially harmed. These lawsuits may result
    in large judgments or settlements against us, any of which could
    have a negative effect on our financial condition and business.
    Additionally, lawsuits can be expensive to defend, whether or
    not they have merit, and the defense of these actions may divert
    the attention of our management and other resources that would
    otherwise be engaged in running our business.

Our
    business involves environmental risks, which include the cost of
    compliance and the risk of contamination or injury

Our business and the business of several of our strategic
    partners, including Genentech and Elan, involve the controlled
    use of hazardous materials, chemicals, biologics and radioactive
    compounds. Biologics manufacturing is extremely susceptible to
    product loss due to microbial or viral contamination, material
    equipment failure, or vendor or operator error. Although we
    believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of
    such materials comply with state and federal standards, there
    will always be the risk of accidental contamination or injury.
    In addition, microbial or viral contamination may cause the
    closure of a manufacturing facility for an extended period of
    time. By law, radioactive materials may only be disposed of at
    state-approved facilities. We currently store radioactive
    materials from our California operation

on-site

because the approval of a disposal site in California for all
    California-based companies has been delayed indefinitely. If and
    when a disposal site is approved, we may incur substantial costs
    related to the disposal of these materials. If we were to become
    liable for an accident, or if we were to suffer an extended
    facility shutdown, we could incur significant costs, damages and
    penalties that could harm our business.

Our
    international sales and operations are subject to the risks of
    doing business abroad

We are increasing our presence in international markets, which
    subjects us to many risks, such as:

•

economic problems that disrupt foreign healthcare payment
    systems;

•

fluctuations in currency exchange rates;

•

the imposition of governmental controls;

•

less favorable intellectual property or other applicable laws;

•

the inability to obtain any necessary foreign regulatory or
    pricing approvals of products in a timely manner;

•

restrictions on direct investments by foreign entities and trade
    restrictions;

•

changes in tax laws and tariffs;

•

difficulties in staffing and managing international
    operations; and

•

longer payment cycles.

Our operations and marketing practices are also subject to
    regulation and scrutiny by the governments of the other
    countries in which we operate. In addition, the Foreign Corrupt
    Practices Act, or FCPA, prohibits U.S. companies and their
    representatives from offering, promising, authorizing or making
    payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or
    retaining business abroad. In many countries, the healthcare
    professionals we regularly interact with meet the definition of
    a foreign official for purposes of the FCPA. Additionally, we
    are subject to other U.S. laws in our international
    operations. Failure to comply with domestic or foreign laws
    could result in various adverse consequences, including possible
    delay in approval or refusal to approve a product, recalls,
    seizures, withdrawal of an approved product from the market,

and/or

the
    imposition of civil or criminal sanctions.



A portion of our business is conducted in currencies other than
    our reporting currency, the U.S. dollar. We recognize
    foreign currency gains or losses arising from our operations in
    the period in which we incur those gains or losses. As a result,
    currency fluctuations among the U.S. dollar and the
    currencies in which we do business have caused foreign currency
    transaction gains and losses in the past and will likely do so
    in the future. Because of the number of currencies involved, the
    variability of currency exposures and the potential volatility
    of currency exchange rates, we may suffer significant foreign
    currency transaction losses in the future due to the effect of
    exchange rate fluctuations.

Our
    investments in marketable securities are significant and are
    subject to interest and credit risk that may reduce their
    value

We maintain a significant portfolio of investments in marketable
    securities. Our earnings may be adversely affected by changes in
    the value of this portfolio. In particular, the value of our
    investments may be adversely affected by increases in interest
    rates, downgrades in the corporate bonds included in the
    portfolio and by other than temporary declines in value. Each of
    these events may cause us to record charges to reduce the
    carrying value of our investment portfolio.

We may
    incur liabilities to tax authorities in excess of amounts that
    have been accrued

The preparation of our financial statements requires estimates
    of the amount of tax that will become payable in each of the
    jurisdictions in which we operate. Accordingly, we determine our
    estimated liability for Federal, state and local taxes (in the
    U.S.) and in connection with our tax liability in several
    overseas jurisdictions. We may be challenged by any of these
    taxing authorities and, in the event that we are not able to
    defend our position, we may incur liabilities with respect to
    the taxing authority and such amounts could be significant.

Several
    aspects of our corporate governance and our collaboration
    agreements may discourage a third party from attempting to
    acquire us

Several factors might discourage a takeover attempt that could
    be viewed as beneficial to stockholders who wish to receive a
    premium for their shares from a potential bidder. For example:

•

we are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General
    Corporation Law, which provides that we may not enter into a
    business combination with an interested stockholder for a period
    of three years after the date of the transaction in which the
    person became an interested stockholder, unless the business
    combination is approved in the manner prescribed in
    Section 203;

•

our stockholder rights plan is designed to cause substantial
    dilution to a person who attempts to acquire us on terms not
    approved by our board of directors;

•

our board of directors has the authority to issue, without a
    vote or action of stockholders, up to 8,000,000 shares of
    preferred stock and to fix the price, rights, preferences and
    privileges of those shares, each of which could be superior to
    the rights of holders of common stock;

•

our amended and restated collaboration agreement with Genentech
    provides that, in the event we undergo a change of control,
    within ninety (90) days Genentech may present an offer to
    us to purchase our rights to RITUXAN. Recently, in an
    arbitration proceeding brought by Biogen Idec relating to the
    collaboration agreement, Genentech alleged for the first time
    that the November 2003 transaction in which Idec acquired Biogen
    and became Biogen Idec constituted such a change of control, an
    assertion with which we strongly disagree. It is our position
    that the Biogen Idec merger did not constitute a change of
    control under our agreement with Genentech and that, even if it
    did, Genentech’s rights under the change of control
    provision have long since expired. We intend to vigorously
    assert our position if Genentech persists in making this claim.
    If the arbitrators decide this issue in favor of Genentech, or
    if a change of control were to occur in the



future and Genentech were to present an offer for the RITUXAN
    rights, we must either accept Genentech’s offer or purchase
    Genentech’s rights to RITUXAN on the same terms as its
    offer. If Genentech presents such an offer, then they will be
    deemed concurrently to have exercised a right, in exchange for a
    share in the operating profits or net sales in the U.S. of
    any other anti CD-20 products developed under the agreement, to
    purchase our interest in each such product. The rights of
    Genentech described in this paragraph may limit our
    attractiveness to potential acquirers;our collaboration
    agreement with Elan provides Elan with the option to buy the
    rights to TYSABRI in the event that we undergo a change of
    control, which may limit our attractiveness to potential
    acquirers;

•

our directors are elected to staggered terms, which prevents the
    entire board from being replaced in any single year; and

•

advance notice is required for nomination of candidates for
    election as a director and for proposals to be brought before an
    annual meeting of stock holders.

    43 acres of land upon which we have our oncology research
    and development campus. The campus consists of five
    interconnected buildings, which primarily contain laboratory and
    office space, totaling approximately 350,000 square feet.
    We also have two lots in Oceanside, California, totaling
    approximately 27 acres of land, which are held for sale.

Research
    Triangle Park, North Carolina

In Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, we own approximately
    530,000 square feet of real estate space. This includes a

    232,000 square foot large scale manufacturing plant, a
    second large-scale purification facility of 42,000 square
    feet, and a 150,000 square foot laboratory office building.
    We manufacture bulk AVONEX at the biologics manufacturing
    facility. We manufacture bulk TYSABRI at the large scale
    manufacturing facility. We plan to use this facility to
    manufacture other products in our pipeline and to meet any
    obligation to manufacture AMEVIVE resulting from our sale of
    that product to Astellas. We are continuing further expansion in
    Research Triangle Park with ongoing construction of several
    projects to increase our manufacturing flexibility. In addition,
    we lease approximately 45,000 square feet of office space

    of property in Hillerod, Denmark. In August 2004, we restarted
    construction of our large-scale biologic manufacturing facility
    in Hillerod, Denmark to be used to manufacture TYSABRI and other
    products in our pipeline. After our voluntary suspension of
    TYSABRI, we reconsidered our construction plans and determined
    that we would proceed with the bulk manufacturing component of
    the large-scale biologic manufacturing facility and add a
    labeling and packaging component to the project. We decided not
    to proceed with the fill-finish component of the large-scale
    biological manufacturing facility. For a discussion of our plans
    for the Hillerod, Denmark large-scale manufacturing facility,
    see “Item 1A Risk Factors — “We are
    committing to a significant investment in the expansion of a
    manufacturing facility the success of which relies upon
    continued demand for our products.”

Item 3.

Legal
    Proceedings

On March 2, 2005, we, along with William H. Rastetter, our
    former Executive Chairman, and James C. Mullen, our Chief
    Executive Officer, were named as defendants in a purported class
    action lawsuit, captioned Brown v. Biogen Idec Inc.,
    et al. (“Brown”), filed in the U.S. District
    Court for the District of Massachusetts (the “Court”).
    The complaint alleges violations of Sections 10(b) and
    20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and

Rule 10b-5



promulgated thereunder. The action is purportedly brought on
    behalf of all purchasers of our publicly-traded securities
    between February 18, 2004 and February 25, 2005. The
    plaintiff alleges that the defendants made materially false and
    misleading statements regarding potentially serious side effects
    of TYSABRI in order to gain accelerated approval from the FDA
    for the product’s distribution and sale. The plaintiff
    alleges that these materially false and misleading statements
    harmed the purported class by artificially inflating our stock
    price during the purported class period and that company
    insiders benefited personally from the inflated price by selling
    our stock. The plaintiff seeks unspecified damages, as well as
    interest, costs and attorneys’ fees. Substantially similar
    actions, captioned Grill v. Biogen Idec Inc., et al. and
    Lobel v. Biogen Idec Inc., et al., were filed on
    March 10, 2005 and April 21, 2005, respectively, in
    the same court by other purported class representatives. Those
    actions have been consolidated with the Brown case. On
    October 13, 2006, the plaintiffs filed an amended
    consolidated complaint which, among other amendments to the
    allegations, adds as defendants Peter N. Kellogg, our Chief
    Financial Officer, William R. Rohn, our former Chief Operating
    Officer, Burt A. Adelman, our Executive Vice President,
    Portfolio Strategy, and Thomas J. Bucknum, our former General
    Counsel. On November 15, 2006, we and all the other
    defendants who had been served as of that date filed a motion to
    dismiss the amended consolidated complaint. The plaintiffs’
    opposition to our Motion to Dismiss was filed on
    December 18, 2006. We believe that the actions are without
    merit and intend to contest them vigorously. At this early stage
    of litigation, we cannot make any estimate of a potential loss
    or range of loss.

On March 9, 2005, two purported shareholder derivative
    actions, captioned Carmona v. Mullen, et al.
    (“Carmona”) and Fink v. Mullen, et al.
    (“Fink”), were brought in the Superior Court of the
    State of California, County of San Diego (the
    “California Court”), on our behalf, against us as
    nominal defendant, our Board of Directors and our chief
    financial officer. The plaintiffs derivatively claim breach of
    fiduciary duties, abuse of control, gross mismanagement, waste
    of corporate assets and unjust enrichment against all
    defendants. The plaintiffs also derivatively claim insider
    selling in violation of California Corporations Code
    § 25402 and breach of fiduciary duty and
    misappropriation of information against certain defendants who
    sold our securities during the period of February 18, 2004
    to the date of the complaints. The plaintiffs seek unspecified
    damages, treble damages for the purported insider trading in
    violation of California Corporate Code § 25402,
    equitable relief including restriction of the defendants’
    trading proceeds or other assets, restitution, disgorgement and
    costs, including attorneys’ fees and expenses. On
    May 9, 2006, final judgment was entered in favor of the
    defendants. On July 17, 2006, Plaintiffs filed a notice of
    appeal in the California Court to the Court of Appeal, Fourth
    Appellate District, Division 1 (the “Court of
    Appeal”). On November 8, 2006, the plaintiffs filed a
    request for dismissal of the appeal, which the Court of Appeal
    allowed on November 13, 2006. Since this matter is now
    concluded, we will no longer include disclosure of this case in
    future reports.

On April 21, 2005, we received a formal order of
    investigation from the Boston District Office of the SEC. The
    SEC is investigating whether any violations of the federal
    securities laws occurred in connection with the suspension of
    marketing and commercial distribution of TYSABRI. We have
    cooperated fully with the SEC in this investigation. We are
    unable to predict the outcome of this investigation or the
    timing of its resolution at this time.

On June 9, 2005, we, along with numerous other companies,
    received a request for information from the U.S. Senate
    Committee on Finance, or the Committee, concerning the
    Committee’s review of issues relating to the Medicare and
    Medicaid programs’ coverage of prescription drug benefits.
    On January 9, 2006, we, along with numerous other
    companies, received a further request for information from the
    Committee. We filed a timely response to the request on
    March 6, 2006 and are cooperating fully with the
    Committee’s information requests. We are unable to predict
    the outcome of this review or the timing of its resolution at
    this time.

On October 4, 2004, Genentech Inc. received a subpoena from
    the U.S. Department of Justice requesting documents related
    to the promotion of RITUXAN. We market RITUXAN in the
    U.S. in collaboration with Genentech. Genentech has
    disclosed that it is cooperating with the associated
    investigation which they disclosed that they have been advised
    is both civil and criminal in nature. Genentech has reported
    further that the government has called and is expected to call
    former and current Genentech employees to appear before a grand
    jury in connection with this investigation. We are cooperating
    with the U.S. Department of Justice in its investigation of
    Genentech. The potential outcome of this matter and its impact
    on us cannot be determined at this time.



Along with several other major pharmaceutical and biotechnology
    companies, Biogen, Inc. (now Biogen Idec MA, Inc., one of our
    wholly-owned subsidiaries) or, in certain cases, Biogen Idec
    Inc., was named as a defendant in lawsuits filed by the City of
    New York and numerous Counties of the State of New York. All of
    the cases, except for the County of Erie, County of Nassau,
    County of Oswego and County of Schenectady, are the subject of a
    Consolidated Complaint (“Consolidated Complaint”),
    which was filed on June 15, 2005 in U.S. District
    Court for the District of Massachusetts in Multi-District
    Litigation No. 1456. The County of Nassau, which originally
    filed its complaint on November 24, 2004, filed an amended
    complaint on March 24, 2005 and that case is also pending
    in the U.S. District Court for the District of
    Massachusetts. The County of Erie, County of Oswego and County
    of Schenectady cases have been removed and conditionally
    transferred to the U.S. District Court for the District of
    Massachusetts, and are currently subject to motions to remand
    and oppositions to the conditional transfer.

All of the complaints allege that the defendants
    (i) fraudulently reported the Average Wholesale Price for
    certain drugs for which Medicaid provides reimbursement, also
    referred to as Covered Drugs; (ii) marketed and promoted
    the sale of Covered Drugs to providers based on the
    providers’ ability to collect inflated payments from the
    government and Medicaid beneficiaries that exceeded payments
    possible for competing drugs; (iii) provided financing
    incentives to providers to over-prescribe Covered Drugs or to
    prescribe Covered Drugs in place of competing drugs; and
    (iv) overcharged Medicaid for illegally inflated Covered
    Drugs reimbursements. The complaints allege violations of New
    York state law and advance common law claims for unfair trade
    practices, fraud, and unjust enrichment. In addition, the
    Consolidated Complaint and County of Nassau complaint allege
    that the defendants failed to accurately report the “best
    price” on the Covered Drugs to the Secretary of Health and
    Human Services pursuant to rebate agreements entered into with
    the Secretary of Health and Human Services, and excluded from
    their reporting certain drugs offered at discounts and other
    rebates that would have reduced the “best price.” We,
    along with the other defendants, have filed motions to dismiss
    the Consolidated Complaint and the complaint by the County of
    Nassau. These motions are currently pending. Biogen Idec has
    answered the complaints filed by the Counties of Erie, Oswego
    and Schenectady. Biogen Idec intends to defend itself vigorously
    against all of the allegations and claims in these lawsuits. At
    this stage of the litigation, we cannot make any estimate of a
    potential loss or range of loss.

We, along with several other major pharmaceutical and
    biotechnology companies, were also named as a defendant in a
    lawsuit filed by the Attorney General of Arizona. The lawsuit
    was filed in the Superior Court of the State of Arizona on
    December 6, 2005. The complaint alleges that the defendants
    fraudulently reported the Average Wholesale Price for certain
    drugs covered by the State of Arizona’s Medicare and
    Medicaid programs, and marketed these drugs to providers based
    on the providers’ ability to collect inflated payments from
    the government and other third-party payors. The complaint
    alleges violations of Arizona state law based on consumer fraud
    and racketeering. The defendants have removed this case to
    federal court and the Joint Panel on Multi-District Litigation
    has transferred the case to Multi-District Litigation
    No. 1456 pending in the U.S. District Court for the
    District of Massachusetts. The parties have stipulated that
    defendants’ motions to dismiss will be briefed in February
    and March 2007. We intend to defend ourselves vigorously against
    all of the allegations and claims in this lawsuit. At this stage
    of the litigation, we cannot make any estimate of a potential
    loss or range of loss.

On January 6, 2006, we were served with a lawsuit,
    captioned United States of America ex rel. Paul P.
    McDermott v. Genentech, Inc. and Biogen Idec Inc., filed in
    the United States District Court of the District of Maine
    (“Court”). The lawsuit was filed under seal on
    July 29, 2005 by a former employee of our co-defendant
    Genentech pursuant to the False Claims Act, 31 U.S.C.
    section 3729 et. seq. On December 20, 2005, the
    U.S. government elected not to intervene, and the complaint
    was subsequently unsealed and served. On April 4, 2006, the
    plaintiff filed his first amended complaint alleging, among
    other things, that we directly solicited physicians and their
    staff members to illegally market off-label uses of RITUXAN for
    treating rheumatoid arthritis, provided illegal kickbacks to
    physicians to promote off-label uses, trained our employees in
    methods of avoiding the detection of these off-label sales and
    marketing activities, formed a network of employees whose
    assigned duties involved off-label promotion of RITUXAN,
    intended and caused the off-label promotion of RITUXAN to result
    in the submission of false claims to the government, and
    conspired with Genentech to defraud the government. The
    plaintiff seeks entry of judgment on behalf of the United States
    of America against the defendants, an award to the plaintiff as
    relator, and all costs, expenses, attorneys’ fees, interest
    and other appropriate relief. On May 4, 2006, we filed a
    motion to dismiss the first amended complaint on the grounds
    that the Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, the complaint
    fails to state a claim and the claims were not pleaded with
    particularity. On December 14, 2006, the Magistrate Judge
    recommended that the Court dismiss the case based on our and
    Genentech’s Motion to Dismiss. The Plaintiff filed
    objections to this recommendation and the matter awaits decision
    by the District Court Judge. At this stage of the litigation, we
    cannot make any estimate of a potential loss or range of loss.



On June 17, 2006, Biogen Idec filed a Demand for
    Arbitration against Genentech, Inc. with the American
    Arbitration Association (“AAA”). In the Demand for
    Arbitration, Biogen Idec alleged that Genentech breached the
    parties’ Amended and Restated Collaboration Agreement dated
    June 19, 2003 (the “Collaboration Agreement”), by
    failing to honor Biogen Idec’s contractual right to
    participate in strategic decisions affecting the parties’
    joint development and commercialization of certain
    pharmaceutical products, including humanized anti-CD20
    antibodies. The original Demand for Arbitration filed by Biogen
    Idec focused primarily on Genentech’s unilateral
    development of an anti-CD20 product known as a second generation
    anti-CD20 molecule to treat Neuromyelitis Optica
    (“NMO”), a relatively rare disorder of the central
    nervous system. Genentech filed an Answering Statement in
    response to Biogen Idec’s Demand in which Genentech denied
    that it had breached the Collaboration Agreement and alleged
    that Biogen Idec had breached the Collaboration Agreement.
    Genentech also asserted for the first time that the November
    2003 transaction in which Idec acquired Biogen and became Biogen
    Idec was a change of control of our company under the
    Collaboration Agreement, a position with which we disagree
    strongly. It is our position that the Biogen Idec merger did not
    constitute a change of control under the Collaboration Agreement
    and that, even if it did, Genentech’s rights under the
    change of control provision, which must be asserted within
    ninety (90) days of the change of control event, have long
    since expired. We intend to vigorously assert that position if
    Genentech persists in making this claim. On December 5,
    2006, Biogen Idec filed an Amended Demand for Arbitration with
    the AAA to make clear that the parties’ dispute also
    includes a disagreement over Genentech’s unilateral
    development of another collaboration product — a third
    generation anti-CD20 molecule to treat certain oncology
    indications. A three-member arbitration panel has been selected
    to decide this matter. The arbitration is in a very early stage
    and we cannot make a determination as to the likely outcome.

On August 10, 2004, Classen Immunotherapies, Inc. filed
    suit against us, GlaxoSmithKline, Chiron Corporation,
    Merck & Co., Inc., and Kaiser-Permanente, Inc. in the
    U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland contending
    that we induced infringement of U.S. Patent Nos, 6,420,139,
    6,638,739, 5,728,383, and 5,723,283, all of which are directed
    to various methods of immunization or determination of
    immunization schedules. All Counts asserted against us by
    Classen were dismissed by the Court upon various motions filed
    by the Parties. In early December, Classen filed its initial
    appeal brief with the United States Court of Appeals for the
    Federal Circuit. In that brief, Classen argues for the first
    time that Biogen has no reporting duties and no activities
    related to FDA reporting regarding Hepatitis B vaccines and
    hence can have no claim to a safe harbor protection under
    Section 271(e)1. Classen asserts, however, that we are
    inducing infringement by having users consider risk prior to
    choosing an immunization schedule. Although our opposing brief
    will not be filed for several months, we will likely argue that
    Classen has waived this argument by not raising it in the
    district court and, moreover, that the argument lacks merit
    because we cannot induce infringement if there has been no
    actual infringement. We are unable, however, to predict the
    outcome of this appeal.

On January, 30, 2007, the Estate of Thaddeus Leoniak
    commenced a civil lawsuit in the Court of Common Pleas,
    Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania, against Biogen Idec, the Fox
    Chase Cancer Center and three physicians. The Complaint alleges
    that Thaddeus Leoniak died as a result of taking the drug
    ZEVALIN, and seeks to hold Biogen Idec strictly liable for
    placing an allegedly “unreasonably dangerous” product
    in the stream of commerce without proper warnings. The Complaint
    also seeks to hold the Company liable for alleged negligence in
    the design, manufacture, advertising, marketing, promoting,
    distributing, supplying and selling of ZEVALIN. The lawsuit
    seeks damages for pecuniary losses suffered by the
    decedent’s survivors and for compensatory damages for
    decedent’s pain and suffering, loss of earnings and
    deprivation of normal activities, all in an amount “in
    excess of $50,000.” On January 31, 2007, the
    Plaintiff’s counsel demanded $7.0 million to settle
    the lawsuit. Biogen Idec has not formed an opinion that an
    unfavorable outcome is either “probable” or
    “remote” and does not express an opinion at this time
    as to the likely outcome of the matter or as to the magnitude or
    range of any potential loss. The Company believes that it has
    good and valid defenses to the Complaint and intends to
    vigorously defend the case.

In addition, we are involved in product liability claims and
    other legal proceedings generally incidental to our normal
    business activities. While the outcome of any of these
    proceedings cannot be accurately predicted, we do not believe
    the ultimate resolution of any of these existing matters would
    have a material adverse effect on our business or financial
    condition.

    Factors” in Part I of this report and elsewhere in
    this report. Unless required by law, we do not undertake any
    obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements.

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our
    consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing
    elsewhere in this

Form 10-K,

beginning on

page F-1.

Overview

Biogen Idec Inc. was formed in 2003 upon the acquisition of
    Biogen, Inc. by IDEC Pharmaceutical Corporation in a merger
    transaction, or the Merger. Biogen Idec Inc. is an international
    biotechnology company that creates new standards of care in
    oncology, neurology, immunology and other specialty areas of
    unmet medical need.

We currently have five products:

•

AVONEX

®

(interferon beta-1a);

•

RITUXAN

®

(rituximab);

•

TYSABRI

®

(natalizumab);

•

FUMADERM

®

(dimethylfumarate and monoethylfumarate salts); and,

•

ZEVALIN

®

(ibritumomab tiuxetan). During the third quarter of 2006, we
    began executing a plan to divest our ZEVALIN product line.

Additionally, through April 2006, we recorded product revenues
    from sales of
    AMEVIVE

®

(alefacept). In April 2006, we sold the worldwide rights to this
    product to Astellas Pharma US, Inc., or Astellas. We will
    continue to manufacture and supply this product to Astellas for
    a period of up to 11 years. Under the terms of the supply
    agreement, we charge Astellas fixed amounts based on volume.
    Such amounts will be recognized as corporate partner revenue and
    are not expected to be significant.

Significant
    Events

The significant events that occurred during 2006 were as follows:

•

Reintroduction of TYSABRI: TYSABRI was reapproved for sale in
    the United States and approved for sale in Europe in June 2006.
    No product was shipped or revenue recorded during the six months
    ended June 30, 2006, but we began shipping product and
    recognizing revenue from TYSABRI sales of product in the third
    quarter of 2006.

•

Acquisition of Fumapharm AG, or Fumapharm: In June 2006, we
    completed the acquisition of Fumapharm. The most significant
    financial statement impact resulting from this purchase was the
    recognition of an



acquired in-process research and development, or IPR&D,
    charge of approximately $207.4 million. The charge was
    offset by a gain of $34.2 million on the settlement of a
    pre-existing associated license agreement.

•

Acquisition of Conforma Therapeutics Corporation, or Conforma:
    In May 2006, we completed the acquisition of Conforma. The most
    significant financial statement impact resulting from this
    purchase was the recognition of an IPR&D charge of
    approximately $123.1 million.

•

Sale of AMEVIVE: As noted above, in April 2006, we sold the
    worldwide rights to AMEVIVE, including inventory on-hand, to
    Astellas.

•

Planned divestiture of ZEVALIN: During the third quarter of
    2006, we began executing a plan to divest our ZEVALIN product
    line.

•

Collaborations and Other Agreements: During the third quarter of
    2006 we entered into collaboration agreements with mondoBIOTECH
    AG, or mondo, Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Alnylam, and
    UCB, S.A., or UCB. Upfront payments made or payable under the
    collaboration agreements totaled $42.5 million, all of
    which have been expensed as research and development expense
    during 2006. Additionally, during the fourth quarter of 2006, we
    entered into settlement agreements with Fumedica Arzneimittel AG
    and Fumedica Arzneimittel GmbH, collectively, Fumedica. A loss
    of $28.1 million was recognized in connection with one of
    the agreements.

•

We sold other non-core assets, including:

•

NICO — In February 2006, we sold our clinical
    manufacturing facility, known as NICO; and

•

Bio 1 — In December 2006, we sold a research facility,
    known as Bio 1, and recognized a pre-tax gain of
    $15.6 million.

Outlook

Most of our revenues are currently dependent on two products:
    AVONEX and RITUXAN. In the near term, we are dependent on the
    successful reintroduction of TYSABRI to grow our overall
    revenues and diversify our product offerings. In the longer
    term, our revenue growth is dependent on the successful clinical
    development, regulatory approval and launch of current pipeline
    products and in-licensed or acquired products and programs.

We expect to use our cash, cash equivalents and investments for
    working capital and general corporate purposes, including the
    acquisition of businesses, products, product rights, or
    technologies. At this time, we cannot accurately predict the
    effect of certain developments on the rate of revenue growth in
    2007 and beyond, such as the degree of market acceptance, the
    impact of competition, the effectiveness of our sales and
    marketing efforts and the outcome of our current efforts to
    develop, receive approval for and successfully launch our
    near-term product candidates.

Marketed
    Products

Continued growth of global AVONEX sales is dependent on
    maintaining AVONEX’s position as the most prescribed
    multiple sclerosis, or MS, therapy in the U.S. and growing
    AVONEX market share outside the U.S. In both the U.S. and
    globally, we face increasing competition in the MS market from
    currently marketed products and future products in late stage
    development. We continue to generate data showing AVONEX to be
    an effective and safe choice for MS patients and physicians.

The majority of RITUXAN sales are currently from use in the
    oncology setting. We believe there is additional room for
    RITUXAN sales growth in oncology, particularly in the so-called
    “maintenance” setting of Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma,
    or NHL, approved in 2006. However, we believe a more significant
    driver of revenue growth in the future will be the immunology
    setting, where RITUXAN is currently indicated for anti-TNF
    (tumor necrosis factor), refractory rheumatoid arthritis, or RA,
    patients. Additional immunology indications for RITUXAN we are
    investigating include earlier stage disease-modifying
    anti-rheumatic drugs RA, or DMARD refractory RA, MS and lupus.



The U.S. and European TYSABRI launches are underway. After
    establishing the TOUCH risk minimization action plan, or
    RiskMAP, program in the U.S. and providing extensive safety
    education in the U.S. and Europe, we are now positioned to
    deliver the strong efficacy message to the market. Successful
    reintroduction and sales growth will be dependent on acceptance
    by physicians and MS patients.

Clinical
    Studies

Over the past few years, we have incurred significant
    expenditures related to conducting clinical studies to develop
    new pharmaceutical products and exploring the utility of our
    existing products in treating disorders beyond those currently
    approved in their respective labels. For 2007, we expect to
    continue to incur significant levels of research and development
    expenditures. Three pipeline products have advanced to late
    stage registrational trials:

•

BG-12 for relapsing forms of MS in Phase III;

•

galiximab for NHL in Phase III; and

•

lumiliximab for chronic lymphocytic leukemia, or CLL, in
    Phase IIb.

In addition to the expense associated with these late stage
    trials, other pipeline products are expected to enter proof of
    concept trials in 2007, driving additional research and
    development expense.

Manufacturing,
    Selling and Marketing Efforts

In 2007, we expect to incur significant expenditures associated
    with manufacturing, selling and marketing our products. The
    aggregate amount of our sales and marketing expenses in 2007
    will likely be higher than that incurred in 2006, primarily as a
    result of higher expenses for the ongoing TYSABRI launch in the
    U.S. and Europe.

Business
    Development

As part of our business strategy, we plan to consider and, as
    appropriate, make acquisitions of other businesses, products,
    product rights or technologies. Our cash reserves and other
    liquid assets may be inadequate to consummate such acquisitions,
    and it may be necessary for us to raise substantial additional
    funds in the future to complete future transactions. In
    addition, as a result of our acquisition efforts, we are likely
    to experience significant charges to earnings for merger and
    related expenses (whether or not our efforts are successful)
    that may include transaction costs, closure costs or acquired
    in-process research and development charges.

Other

We may experience significant fluctuations in quarterly results
    based primarily on the level and timing of:

•

product revenues;

•

cost of product sales;

•

collaboration revenues;

•

cost and timing of clinical trials, regulatory approvals and
    product approvals;

•

marketing and other expenses;

•

manufacturing or supply disruptions; and

•

costs associated with the operations of recently-acquired
    businesses and technologies.

For 2006 compared to 2005, U.S. sales of AVONEX increased
    $83.5 million, or 8.9%, due principally to the impact of
    price increases and a reduction in discounts associated with the
    introduction of the Medicare Part D prescription drug
    benefit. These increases were offset by lower volume. For 2006
    compared to 2005, international sales of AVONEX increased
    $80.1 million, or 13.3%, primarily due to increases in
    volume and price, including the impact of patient mix. Foreign
    exchange accounted for a 0.6% increase in reported revenues; on
    a local currency basis, international sales increased 12.7%.

For 2005 compared to 2004, U.S. sales of AVONEX increased
    $16.1 million, or 1.7%, due to price increases, offset by
    lower volume. For 2005 compared to 2004, international sales of
    AVONEX increased $109.8 million, or 22.2%, primarily due to
    increases in volume and price, including the impact of patient
    mix. Foreign exchange accounted for a 2.1% increase in reported
    revenues; on a local currency basis, international sales
    increased 20.1%.



We expect to face increasing competition in the MS marketplace
    in and outside the U.S. from existing and new MS
    treatments, including TYSABRI, which may impact sales of AVONEX.
    We expect future sales of AVONEX to be dependent to a large
    extent on our ability to compete successfully with the products
    of our competitors.

    2006, 2005, and 2004 were as follows (in thousands):

Under the terms of a collaboration agreement with Elan
    Corporation plc, or Elan, we manufacture TYSABRI and collaborate
    with Elan on the product’s marketing, commercial
    distribution and on-going development activities. We recognize
    revenue for sales of TYSABRI in the U.S. upon Elan’s
    shipment of the product to third party distributors. We
    recognize revenue for sales of TYSABRI outside the U.S. at the
    time of product delivery to our customers.

In November 2004, TYSABRI was approved by the U.S. Food and
    Drug Administration, or FDA, as a treatment for relapsing forms
    of MS to reduce the frequency of clinical relapses. In February
    2005, in consultation with the FDA, we and Elan voluntarily
    suspended the marketing and commercial distribution of TYSABRI,
    and we informed physicians that they should suspend dosing of
    TYSABRI until further notification. In 2005, our net revenue
    associated with sales of TYSABRI was $4.7 million, which
    consisted of revenue of $15.1 million from sales that
    occurred prior to our voluntary suspension, offset by an
    allowance for sales returns of $10.4 million related to
    returns of product sold prior to the suspension.

On June 5, 2006, the FDA approved a supplemental Biologics
    License Application, or sBLA, for the reintroduction of TYSABRI
    as a monotherapy treatment for relapsing forms of MS to slow the
    progression of disability and reduce the frequency of clinical
    relapses. On June 29, 2006, we and Elan announced that the
    European Medicines Agency, or EMEA, had approved TYSABRI as a
    similar treatment. In July 2006, we began to ship TYSABRI in
    both the United States and Europe. In 2006, we have recorded
    revenue on sales of TYSABRI in the U.S. and Europe relating to
    current activity of $11.9 million and $10.0 million,
    respectively. Prior to the suspension of TYSABRI in 2005, we
    shipped product to Elan in the U.S. and recognized revenue in
    accordance with the policy described above. As a result of the
    suspension of TYSABRI, we had deferred $14.0 million in
    revenue related to TYSABRI product that remained in Elan’s
    ending inventory. This amount was paid by Elan during 2005 and
    was subsequently recognized as revenue during 2006, as the
    uncertainty about the ultimate disposition of the product was
    eliminated.

AMEVIVE

In 2006, 2005 and 2004, sales of AMEVIVE were
    $11.5 million, $48.5 million, and $43.0 million,
    respectively, of which $5.0 million, $34.9 million,
    and $41.6 million, respectively, was generated in the
    U.S. The decrease in total AMEVIVE sales for 2006 compared
    to 2005 was due to the sale, in April 2006, of our worldwide
    rights and infrastructure related to sales, production, and
    marketing of AMEVIVE. The increase in sales in 2005 compared to
    2004 was due to higher sales volumes.

Although we sold the rights to this product, we continue to
    report a small amount of product revenues related to shipments
    made by certain of our overseas joint ventures.

ZEVALIN

In 2006, 2005, and 2004 sales of ZEVALIN were
    $17.8 million, $20.8 million, and $23.0 million,
    respectively, of which $16.4 million, $19.4 million
    and $18.7 million, respectively, were generated in the U.S.



FUMADERM

FUMADERM is a new product being sold by us for the first time
    beginning in the third quarter of 2006. This product line was
    acquired in our acquisition of Fumapharm in June 2006. Sales for
    2006 were $9.5 million, all of which were generated in
    Germany.

Provisions
    for Discounts and Allowances

Revenues from product sales are recognized when product is
    shipped and title and risk of loss has passed to the customer,
    typically upon delivery. Revenues are recorded net of applicable
    allowances for trade term discounts, wholesaler incentives,
    Medicaid rebates, Veteran’s Administration, or VA, rebates,
    managed care, patient assistance, product returns and other
    applicable allowances. The estimates we make with respect to
    these allowances represent significant judgments that we make
    with regard to revenue recognition.

Provisions for discounts and allowances reduced gross product
    revenues as follows (in millions):

Our product revenue reserves are based on estimates of the
    amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales. These
    estimates take into consideration our historical experience,
    current contractual and statutory requirements, specific known
    market events and trends and forecasted customer buying
    patterns. If actual results vary, we may need to adjust these
    estimates, which could have an effect on earnings in the period
    of the adjustment.

Product revenue reserves are categorized as follows: discounts,
    contractual adjustments and returns.

Discount reserves include trade term discounts, wholesaler
    incentives and patient assistance. For 2006 compared to 2005,
    discounts decreased $3.6 million, or 3.4%, reflecting lower
    amounts of AVONEX distributed through our patient assistance
    program. For 2005 compared to 2004, discounts increased
    $28.5 million, or 36.5%, due, principally, to patient
    assistance providing AVONEX at higher levels for patients that
    had been using TYSABRI prior to its suspension.

Contractual adjustment reserves relate to Medicaid rebates, VA
    rebates and managed care.  For 2006 compared to 2005,
    contractual adjustments were constant reflecting more activity
    in the managed care markets, offset by a reduction in Medicaid
    activity due to the introduction of Medicare Part D, the
    expanded prescription drug benefit program. For 2005 compared to
    2004, contractual adjustments increased $18.5 million, or
    24.6% due, principally, to the impact of higher reserves for
    managed care (associated with higher level of activity with
    respect to rebates) and Medicaid programs (associated with price
    increases).

Product return reserves are established for returns made by
    wholesalers and patients. In accordance with contractual terms,
    wholesalers are permitted to return product for reasons such as
    damaged or expired product. We also accept returns from our
    patients for various reasons. For 2006 compared to 2005, returns
    increased $12.7 million, or 48.8%, as a result of an
    adjustment of $6.9 million to increase reserve levels to
    correct prior period errors, and higher return experience in
    2006. These increases were offset by the impact of returns made
    in connection with the suspension of TYSABRI in 2005. For 2005
    compared to 2004, returns increased $7.3 million, or 39.0%,
    due, principally, to the expense of $9.7 million recorded
    in 2005 related to the suspension of TYSABRI.

Reserves for product returns are recorded in the period the
    related revenue is recognized, resulting in a reduction to
    product sales. The majority of wholesaler returns are due to
    product expiration. Expired product return reserves are
    estimated through a comparison of historical return data to
    their related sales on a production lot basis. Historical rates
    of return are determined for each product and are adjusted for
    known or expected changes in the marketplace specific to each
    product.



During the second quarter of 2006, we recorded an increase in
    our allowance for expired products of $12.3 million to
    correct for prior period errors. This increase in the allowance
    was recorded through an out of period reduction in net product
    revenue of $6.9 million and an increase in goodwill of
    $5.4 million. We identified and quantified the errors
    through an analysis of the historical rate for returns based on
    volumes of returns and the amount of credit granted to the
    returning distributors in past periods. At the time of Merger
    with Biogen, Inc. in 2003, Biogen, Inc. had understated its
    allowance for expired product by an estimated $5.4 million
    due to an incorrect methodology applied in calculating its
    reserve balance. Had we identified this error at the time of the
    Merger, the recorded goodwill would have been approximately
    $5.4 million higher than has been previously reflected.
    Biogen, Inc.’s methodology was in error because it did not
    utilize known information in determining critical assumptions
    used in the basis of calculation. Our application of this
    incorrect methodology in the post-Merger period resulted in
    understating this reserve by an additional $6.9 million. In
    all cases, the correctly calculated rate of return is less than
    one percent of related gross product revenues. We have
    determined that the out of period correction of this error in
    2006 is not material to our reported results. Additionally, we
    have determined that the error at the merger date is not
    material to any prior period balance sheet amounts and the error
    in the post-merger period is not material to any prior period
    reported results.

Unconsolidated
    Joint Business Revenues

We copromote RITUXAN in the U.S. in collaboration with
    Genentech, Inc., or Genentech, under a collaboration agreement
    between the parties. Under the collaboration agreement, we
    granted Genentech a worldwide license to develop, commercialize
    and market RITUXAN in multiple indications. In exchange for
    these worldwide rights, we have copromotion rights in the U.S.
    and a contractual arrangement under which Genentech shares a
    portion of the pretax U.S. copromotion profits of RITUXAN
    with us. This collaboration was created through a contractual
    arrangement, not through a joint venture or other legal entity.
    In June 2003, we amended and restated our collaboration
    agreement with Genentech to include the development and
    commercialization of one or more anti-CD20 antibodies targeting
    B-cell disorders, in addition to RITUXAN, for a broad range of
    indications.

In the U.S., we contribute resources to selling and the
    continued development of RITUXAN. Genentech is responsible for
    worldwide manufacturing of RITUXAN. Genentech also is
    responsible for the primary support functions for the
    commercialization of RITUXAN in the U.S. including selling
    and marketing, customer service, order entry, distribution,
    shipping and billing. Genentech also incurs the majority of
    continuing development costs for RITUXAN. Under the arrangement,
    we have a limited sales force as well as limited development
    activity.

Under the terms of separate sublicense agreements between
    Genentech and F. Hoffman-La Roche Ltd., or Roche,
    commercialization of RITUXAN outside the U.S. is the
    responsibility of Roche, except in Japan where Roche copromotes
    RITUXAN in collaboration with Zenyaku Kogyo Co Ltd., or Zenyaku.
    There is no direct contractual arrangement between us and Roche
    or Zenyaku.

Revenue from unconsolidated joint business consists of our share
    of pretax copromotion profits, which is calculated by Genentech,
    and includes consideration of our RITUXAN-related sales force
    and development expenses, and royalty revenue from sales of
    RITUXAN outside the U.S. by Roche and Zenyaku. Pre-tax
    copromotion profit consists of U.S. sales of RITUXAN to
    third-party customers net of discounts and allowances and less
    the cost to manufacture RITUXAN, third-party royalty expenses,
    distribution, selling and marketing expenses, and joint
    development expenses incurred by Genentech and us.

Under the amended and restated collaboration agreement, our
    current pretax copromotion profit-sharing formula, which resets
    annually, is as follows:

Biogen Idec’s Share

Copromotion Operating Profits

Greater than $50 million

In 2006, 2005, and 2004, the 40% threshold was met during the
    first quarter.

For each calendar year or portion thereof following the approval
    date of the first new anti-CD20 product, the pretax copromotion
    profit-sharing formula for RITUXAN and other anti-CD20 products
    sold by us and Genentech will change. (See Note 16 to the
    consolidated financial statements for further detail).



Copromotion profits for the years ended December 31, 2006,

Net sales of RITUXAN to third-party customers in the
    U.S. recorded by Genentech for 2006 were approximately
    $2.1 billion compared to $1.8 billion in 2005 and
    $1.6 billion in 2004. The increase in 2006 is due,
    principally, to the approval by the FDA of RITUXAN for two new
    indications, RA, and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, and an
    increase in wholesale prices. The increase in 2005 from 2004 was
    due, principally, to increased market penetration in treatments
    of B-cell NHLs and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and increases
    in the wholesale price of RITUXAN.

Revenues from unconsolidated joint business for the years ended
    December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, consist of the following

For 2006 compared to 2005, reimbursement of selling and
    development expenses increased $13.5 million, or 28.3%. For
    2005 compared to 2004, such reimbursements increased
    $9.9 million, or 26.2%. In both cases the increase was due,
    principally, to the expansion of the oncology sales force and
    development costs we incurred related to the development of
    RITUXAN for RA.

Our royalty revenue on sales of RITUXAN outside the U.S. is
    based on Roche and Zenyaku’s net sales to third-party
    customers and is recorded on a cash basis. Royalty revenues in
    2006 compared to 2005 increased $46.5 million, or 31.5%,
    due to increased market penetration and increase in prices.
    Royalty revenues in 2005 compared to 2004 increased
    $26.5 million, or 21.9% due to increased sales of RITUXAN
    outside the U.S, offset by a $11.3 million royalty credit
    to Genentech in 2005. The royalty period with respect to all
    products is 11 years from the first commercial sale of such
    product on a country by country basis. RITUXAN was launched in
    1998 in most European countries and in 2001 in Japan.

Under the amended and restated collaboration agreement, we will
    receive lower royalty revenue from Genentech on sales by Roche
    and Zenyaku of new anti-CD20 products, if and when commercially
    available, as compared to royalty revenue received on sales of
    RITUXAN.

Royalty
    Revenue

We receive revenues from royalties on sales by our licensees of
    a number of products covered under patents that we control. Our
    royalty revenues on sales of RITUXAN outside the U.S. are
    included in revenues from unconsolidated joint business in the
    accompanying consolidated statements of income.

For 2006 compared to 2005, royalty revenue decreased
    $7.0 million, or 7.5%. For 2005 compared to 2004, royalty
    revenues decreased $5.8 million, or 5.8%. In both cases the
    decreases were due, principally, to decreases in sales levels of
    products under license and to the expiration of certain
    contracts.

We receive royalties from Schering-Plough Corporation, or
    Schering-Plough, on sales of its alpha interferon products in
    the U.S. under an exclusive license to our alpha interferon
    patents and patent applications. Schering-Plough sells its
    INTRON

®

A (interferon alfa-2b) brand of alpha interferon in the
    U.S. for a number of indications, including the treatment
    of chronic hepatitis B and hepatitis C. Schering-Plough
    also sells other alpha interferon products for the treatment of
    hepatitis C, including
    REBETRON

®

Combination Therapy containing INTRON A and
    REBETOL

®

(ribavirin, USP),
    PEG-INTRON

®

(peginterferon alfa-2b), a pegylated form of alpha interferon,
    and PEG-INTRON in combination with REBETOL. Beginning in 2006,
    we no longer receive royalties on sales that are made in Italy.

We hold several patents related to hepatitis B antigens produced
    by genetic engineering techniques. These antigens are used in
    recombinant hepatitis B vaccines and in diagnostic test kits
    used to detect hepatitis B infection. We receive royalties from
    sales of hepatitis B vaccines in several countries, including
    the U.S., from GlaxoSmithKline plc and Merck and Co. Inc. We
    have also licensed our proprietary hepatitis B rights, on an

antigen-by-antigen

and nonexclusive basis, to several diagnostic kit manufacturers,
    including Abbott Laboratories, the major worldwide marketer of
    hepatitis B diagnostic kits.

We receive ongoing royalties on sales of
    ANGIOMAX

®

(bivalirudin) by The Medicines Company, or TMC. TMC sells
    ANGIOMAX in the U.S. for use as an anticoagulant in
    combination with aspirin in patients with unstable angina
    undergoing percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. TMC
    sells ANGIOMAX through distributors in Europe, Canada and Latin
    America. Sales levels, and accordingly, royalty revenues,
    increased during 2006.

Finally, we hold several patents in Japan and Taiwan related to
    the production of synthetic Interleukin — 2.
    Interleukin — 2 is a substance made in the human body
    that stimulates the proliferation of suppressor cells and is
    used in the treatment of several types of cancer and chronic
    viral infections. Shionogi & Co., Ltd. pays us
    royalties for use of these patented production techniques.

We anticipate that total royalty revenues in future years will
    continue to represent a lower proportion of our total revenues.
    Royalty revenues may fluctuate as a result of fluctuations in
    sales levels of products sold by our licensees from quarter to
    quarter due to the timing and extent of major events such as new
    indication approvals or government-sponsored programs.

Corporate
    Partner Revenues

Corporate partner revenues represent contract revenues and
    license fees.

In 2004, we received a $10.0 million payment from Schering
    AG for the EMEA grant of marketing approval of ZEVALIN in the
    EU. The payment represented, in part, a milestone payment to
    compensate us for preparing, generating, and collecting data
    that was critical to the EMEA marketing approval process as to
    which we have no continuing involvement.

AVONEX

For 2006 compared to 2005, cost of product revenue for AVONEX
    increased $6.2 million, or 2.7%, in line with increased
    sales levels but slightly lower as a percent of revenue due to
    lower costs associated with failures of quality specifications
    in 2006 compared to 2005. For 2005 compared to 2004, cost of
    product revenue decreased



$251.5 million, or 52.4%, due, principally, to the 2004
    impact of the difference between the cost of AVONEX inventory
    recorded at the Merger date and its historical manufacturing
    cost. A substantial portion of this amount, $277.5 million,
    was recognized as cost of sales when the acquired inventory was
    sold or written-down in 2004. All of the AVONEX inventory
    acquired in the Merger was sold or written off by
    December 31, 2004.

TYSABRI

Sales of TYSABRI resumed in July 2006 following FDA approval to
    reintroduce the product for certain indications. Because of the
    suspension in 2005, no product was shipped in 2005 subsequent to
    February 2005. The cost of product revenues for 2005 is due,
    principally, to write-offs of inventory associated with the
    suspension of TYSABRI in 2005. The cost of goods sold in 2006
    represents, principally, the cost of shipments made since July
    2006 in the U.S. and Europe.

We manufactured TYSABRI during the first and second quarter of
    2005 and completed our scheduled production of TYSABRI during
    July 2005. Because of the uncertain future commercial
    availability of TYSABRI at the time, and our inability to
    predict to the required degree of certainty that TYSABRI
    inventory would be realized in commercial sales prior to the
    expiration of its shelf life, we expensed $23.2 million of
    costs related to the manufacture of TYSABRI in the first quarter
    of 2005 to cost of product revenues. At the time of production,
    the inventory was believed to be commercially saleable.
    Beginning in the second quarter of 2005, as we worked with
    clinical investigators to understand the possible risks of
    progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, or PML, we charged
    the costs related to the manufacture of TYSABRI to research and
    development expense. As a result, we expensed $21.5 million
    related to the manufacture of TYSABRI to research and
    development expense during 2005. At December 31, 2005,
    there was no carrying value of TYSABRI inventory on our
    consolidated balance sheet.

As of December 31, 2006, $41.3 million and
    $0.6 million of TYSABRI inventory value is included in work
    in process and finished goods, respectively. In addition, we
    have product on hand that was written-down due to the
    uncertainties surrounding the TYSABRI suspension but which is
    available to fill future orders. The approximate value of such
    product, based on its cost of manufacture, was
    $36.9 million. As we sell TYSABRI, we are realizing lower
    than normal cost of sales and, therefore, higher margins, as we
    ship the inventory that was previously written down. For 2006,
    cost of sales was approximately $2.6 million lower due to
    the sale of TYSABRI that had been previously written-off.

AMEVIVE

For 2006 compared to 2005, cost of product revenue for AMEVIVE
    decreased $84.0 million, or 89.4%, due to the disposition
    of our worldwide rights to the product in April 2006. For 2005
    compared to 2004, cost of product revenue increased
    $66.2 million, or 238.1%. Of this increase, approximately
    $66.0 million represented the difference between the cost
    of AMEVIVE inventory recorded at the time of the Merger and its
    historical cost which was recognized as cost of product revenues
    when the inventory was sold or written-off in 2005.
    Additionally, in connection with the divestiture of AMEVIVE we
    recorded charges of $31.8 million to write-down AMEVIVE
    inventory to its net realizable value. This amount was entirely
    related to the inventory

“step-up”

recorded at the time of the Merger.

ZEVALIN

For 2006 compared to 2005, cost of product revenue for ZEVALIN
    decreased $6.7 million, or 29.2%, due, principally, to the
    impairment of certain capitalized patents in 2005 and decline in
    sales volumes. For 2005 compared to 2004, cost of product
    revenue for ZEVALIN increased $3.8 million, or 20.0%, due
    to inventory write-offs and impairments.

FUMADERM

Cost of product revenues for FUMADERM was $3.2 million,
    which includes the impact of an inventory fair value “step
    up” adjustment of $2.9 million in connection with
    purchase accounting for the Fumapharm acquisition during 2006.



Inventory
    Write-Offs

We periodically review our inventories for excess or obsolete
    inventory and write-down obsolete or otherwise unmarketable
    inventory to its estimated net realizable value. If the actual
    net realizable value is less than that estimated by us, or if
    there are further determinations that inventory will not be
    marketable based on estimates of demand, additional inventory
    write-downs may be required. Additionally, our products are
    subject to strict quality control and monitoring which we
    perform throughout the manufacturing process. Periodically,
    certain batches or units of product may no longer meet quality
    specifications or may expire. As a result, included in product
    cost of revenues were write-downs of commercial inventory that
    did not meet quality specifications or that became obsolete due
    to dating expiration. In all cases this product inventory was
    written-down to its net realizable value.

Included in cost of product revenues are inventory write-downs

In 2005, write-downs of AVONEX inventory included
    $8.4 million for remaining supplies of the alternative
    presentations of AVONEX that were no longer needed after the FDA
    approved a new component for the pre-filled syringe formulation
    of AVONEX in March 2005. The ZEVALIN inventory was written-down
    when it was determined that it would not be marketable based on
    estimates of demand. Additionally, in the third quarter of 2005,
    we recorded a charge of $5.7 million to cost of product
    revenues related to an impairment of certain capitalized ZEVALIN
    patents, to reflect the adjustment to net realizable value.

Cost
    of Royalty Revenues

For 2006, 2005 and 2004, cost of royalty revenues were
    $4.4 million, $4.4 million, and $5.6 million,
    respectively. Gross margin on royalty revenues were
    approximately 95%, 95%, and 94%, respectively. We expect that
    gross margins on royalty revenues will fluctuate in the future
    based on changes in sales volumes for specific products from
    which we receive royalties.

Research
    and Development Expenses

Research and development expenses totaled $718.4 million in
    2006 compared to $747.7 million in 2005 and
    $685.9 million in 2004.

For 2006 compared to 2005, research and development expenses
    decreased $29.3 million, or 3.9%, due, principally, to:
    reductions in salary and benefit expense arising from headcount
    reductions in 2005 ($61.5 million); the elimination of
    costs related to the NIMO facility that was sold in the second
    quarter of 2005 ($20.0 million); and lower expenses for
    clinical trials, primarily related to TYSABRI and AMEVIVE
    ($23.0 million). These decreases were offset by an increase
    in expenses for new collaborations during the year
    ($11.2 million); higher clinical manufacturing expense
    ($10.8 million); and the impact of share-based compensation
    recognized under SFAS 123(R) in 2006 ($51.5 million).



For 2006, share-based compensation expense included in research
    and development, computed under APB 25, would have been
    $32.9 million.

For 2005 compared to 2004, research and development expenses
    increased $61.8 million, or 9.0%, due, principally, to:
    upfront licensing fee and milestones related to a collaboration
    with PDL BioPharma, Inc., or PDL ($50.0 million);
    biopharmaceutical operations and global quality initiatives for
    our manufacturing activities, including expenses related to the
    manufacture of TYSABRI ($11.1 million); increased
    depreciation and infrastructure expenses ($16.7 million);
    discovery research initiatives ($7.1 million); and
    increased pre-clinical research activities ($9.4 million).
    These increases were offset by a decrease in expenses for our
    ongoing clinical trials, primarily related to lower than
    expected clinical trial expenses for TYSABRI and AMEVIVE
    ($31.4 million).

We expect that research and development expenses will increase
    in 2007 for a number of reasons, including our plans to commit
    significant additional investments in business development and
    research opportunities.

Acquired
    In-Process Research and Development, or IPR&D

During the quarter ended June 30, 2006, we recorded expense
    related to IPR&D of $330.5 million. Of this amount,
    $207.4 million related to acquired IPR&D from the
    acquisition of Fumapharm and $123.1 million related to
    acquired IPR&D from the acquisition of Conforma. See
    Note 2, Acquisitions and Other Agreements, of the
    consolidated financial statements for details on future
    expenditures with respect to IPR&D.

Since completing these acquisitions in the second quarter of
    2006, we have spent $17.0 million related to the Fumapharm
    IPR&D, and $4.2 million on the Conforma IPR&D.

The major risks and uncertainties associated with the timely and
    successful completion of these projects are that we will not be
    able to confirm the safety and efficacy of the technology with
    data from clinical trials and that we will not be able to obtain
    necessary regulatory approvals. No assurance can be given that
    the underlying assumptions used to forecast the cash flows or
    the timely and successful completion of such projects will
    materialize, as estimated. For these reasons, among others,
    actual results may vary significantly from estimated results.

Selling,
    General and Administrative Expenses

Selling, general and administrative expenses totaled
    $685.1 million in 2006 compared to $644.8 million in
    2005 and $580.3 million in 2004.

For 2006 compared to 2005, selling, general and administrative
    expenses increased $40.3 million, or 6.3%, due,
    principally, to: higher expenses related to RITUXAN in RA
    ($21.5 million); increased expenses for the re-launch of
    TYSABRI ($20.3 million); lower reimbursements of costs
    related to collaboration agreements ($4.3 million); and
    higher costs related to share-based compensation recognized
    under SFAS 123(R) in 2006 ($45.2 million). These
    increases were offset by: lower expenses for AMEVIVE due to its
    divestiture ($31.0 million); a decrease in expenses for
    ZEVALIN ($20.0 million), due in part to the planned
    divestiture, and also due to the impact of a charge taken in
    2005 related to a write-down of remaining prepaid expense
    associated with our arrangement with MDS (Canada).

For 2006, approximately $80.8 million of share-based
    compensation is included in selling, general and administrative
    expenses in connection with the adoption of SFAS 123(R) in
    2006.

For 2006, share-based compensation expense included in selling,
    general and administrative expense, computed under APB 25
    would have been $51.5 million.

For 2005 compared to 2004, selling, general and administrative
    expenses increased $64.5 million, or 11.1%, due,
    principally, to: the neurology sales force expansion in the
    U.S. ($8.0 million); increased international neurology
    sales activities primarily in the EU ($10.6 million);
    customer service initiatives ($7.2 million); oncology sales
    and marketing initiatives primarily due to a charge of
    $12.9 million related to a write-down of remaining prepaid
    expense associated with our arrangement with MDS (Canada)
    ($19.7 million). These increases were partially offset by a
    decrease in our immunology sales and marketing programs largely
    due to the pending AMEVIVE divestiture ($7.4 million).
    Included in the increase of selling, general and administrative
    fees for 2005



were administrative expenses, primarily related to consulting
    fees and grants ($15.7 million), information technology
    primarily compensation and consulting costs ($8.6 million),
    and compensation and other costs associated with the retirement
    of our former Executive Chairman in December 2005
    ($7.1 million).

We anticipate that total selling, general, and administrative
    expenses in 2007 will be higher than 2006 due to sales and
    marketing and other general and administrative expenses to
    primarily support AVONEX and TYSABRI.

Share-based
    Payments

Our share-based compensation programs consist of share-based
    awards granted to employees including stock options, restricted
    stock, performance share units and restricted stock units, or
    RSUs, as well as our employee stock purchase plan, or ESPP.

Effective January 1, 2006, we adopted Statement of
    Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised
    2004) —

Share-based Payment

, or
    SFAS 123(R). This Statement requires compensation cost
    relating to share-based awards to be recognized in the financial
    statements using a fair-value measurement method. Under the fair
    value method, the estimated fair value of awards is charged
    against income over the requisite service period, which is
    generally the vesting period. We selected the modified
    prospective method as prescribed in SFAS 123(R) and,
    therefore, prior periods were not restated. Under the modified
    prospective method, this Statement was applied to new awards
    granted in 2006, as well as to the unvested portion of
    previously granted equity-based awards for which the requisite
    service had not been rendered as of December 31, 2005.

The fair value of performance based stock units is based on the
    market price of our stock on the date of grant and assumes that
    the performance criteria will be met and the target payout level
    will be achieved. Compensation expense is adjusted for
    subsequent changes in the outcome of performance-related
    conditions until the vesting date. In the year ended
    December 31, 2006, we recorded share-based compensation
    expense of $126.8 million associated with the
    SFAS 123(R) adoption. This expense is net of a cumulative
    effect pre-tax adjustment of $5.6 million, or
    $3.8 million after-tax. The cumulative effect results from
    the application of an estimated forfeiture rate for current and
    prior period unvested restricted stock awards. In the year ended
    December 31, 2005, we recorded share-based compensation
    expense of $36.9 million.

Severance
    and Other Restructuring Costs

    Strategic Plan

In September 2005, we began implementing a comprehensive
    strategic plan, or the 2005 Strategic Plan, in conjunction with
    which we consolidated or eliminated certain internal management
    layers and staff functions, resulting in the reduction of our
    workforce that represented approximately 17%, or approximately
    650 positions worldwide at that time. These adjustments took
    place across company functions, departments and sites, and were
    substantially implemented by the end of 2005. We recorded
    restructuring charges of $31.4 million in connection with these
    activities, of which $28.3 million related to severance and
    other employee termination costs, including health benefits,
    outplacement and bonuses. Other costs were $3.1 million and
    included write-downs of certain research assets that will no
    longer be utilized, consulting costs in connection with the
    restructuring effort, and costs related to the acceleration of
    restricted stock, offset by the reversal of previously
    recognized compensation due to unvested restricted stock
    cancellations.

    Restructurings

During 2006, we incurred additional restructuring costs
    associated with acquisitions and planned dispositions. We
    incurred $1.2 million in severance costs associated with
    the acquisition of Conforma during 2006 and $1.7 million
    related in headcount reductions related to the planned
    disposition of our ZEVALIN product line.

For 2006, $3.6 million of restructuring charges are
    included in selling, general and administrative expenses. Costs
    not yet paid as of December 31, 2006, were
    $2.1 million, and are included in accrued expenses and
    other on our consolidated balance sheet. See Note 21,
    Severance and Other Restructuring Costs, of the consolidated
    financial statements, for details on the change in reserve
    levels related to severance.



We may have additional charges in future periods. The amount of
    those future charges cannot be determined at this time.

Other

On December 16, 2005, Dr. William H. Rastetter, our
    former Executive Chairman, entered into a letter agreement
    confirming Dr. Rastetter’s retirement as Executive
    Chairman and Chairman of the Board and his resignation from the
    Board, all effective as of December 30, 2005. As a result,
    Dr. Rastetter was entitled to, among other things, payments
    equal to his 2005 target bonus and three times the sum of his
    annual salary and target bonus, immediate vesting of his
    unvested stock options and restricted stock awards. These
    charges related to Dr. Rastetter’s retirement amounted
    to $7.1 million, and no liability related to
    Dr. Rastetter’s retirement remains.

In 2004, we recorded charges of $4.4 million related to
    severance obligations for certain employees affected by the
    Merger in our San Diego facilities, $2.3 million of
    restructuring costs related to the relocation of our European
    headquarters, and $1.0 million related to severance
    obligations for certain employees affected by the Merger in our
    Cambridge facilities. At December 31, 2006, we have no
    significant remaining liabilities related to the 2004
    obligations.

Facility
    Impairments and (Gain) Loss on Disposition, net

As of March 31, 2005, after our voluntary suspension of
    TYSABRI, we reconsidered our construction plans and determined
    that we would proceed with the bulk manufacturing component of
    our large-scale biologic manufacturing facility in Hillerod,
    Denmark. Additionally, we added a labeling and packaging
    component to the project, but determined that we would no longer
    proceed with the fill-finish component of the large-scale
    biological manufacturing facility. As a result, we recorded an
    impairment charge of approximately $6.2 million in 2005
    related to the fill-finish component that had previously been
    capitalized.

In June 2005, we sold our large-scale biologics manufacturing
    facility in Oceanside, California, known as NIMO, along with
    approximately 60 acres of real property located in
    Oceanside, California upon which NIMO is located, together with
    improvements, related property rights, and certain personal
    property intangibles and contracts at or related to the real
    property. Total consideration for the sale was
    $408.1 million. The loss from this transaction was
    $83.5 million which consisted primarily of the write-down
    of NIMO to net selling price, sales and transfer taxes, and
    other associated transaction costs.

In February 2006, we sold our clinical manufacturing facility in
    Oceanside, California, known as NICO. The assets associated with
    the facility were included in assets held for sale on our
    consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2005. Total
    consideration was $29.0 million. In 2005, we recorded
    impairment charges totaling $28.0 million to reduce the
    carrying value of NICO to its net realizable value. No
    additional loss resulted from completion of the sale.

In December 2006, we completed the sale of one of the buildings
    in our Cambridge, Massachusetts facility, known as Bio 1.
    Proceeds from the sale were approximately $39.5 million. We
    recorded a pre-tax gain of approximately $15.6 million on
    the sale. We will continue to occupy a minor portion of the

    future commitment under the leaseback arrangement.

Gain

Fumapharm

During 2006, we recorded a gain of $34.2 million coincident
    with the acquisition of Fumapharm in accordance with EITF

04-1,

Accounting for Preexisting Relationships between the Parties
    to a Business Combination.

The gain related to the
    settlement of a preexisting collaboration agreement between
    Fumapharm and us. The collaboration agreement had been entered
    into in October 2003 and required payments to Fumapharm of
    certain royalty amounts. The market rate for such payments was
    determined to have been higher at the acquisition date due,
    principally, to the increased technical feasibility of BG-12.
    The gain relates to the difference between the royalty rates at
    the time



the agreement was entered into as compared to the rates at the
    time the agreement was effectively settled by virtue of our
    acquisition of Fumapharm.

Fumedica

During 2006, we recorded a charge of $28.1 million in
    connection with a settlement agreement with Fumedica. The charge
    related to the settlement of the agreement with Fumedica under
    which we were contingently obligated to make royalty payments
    with respect to a successful launch of BG-12 for psoriasis in
    Germany. Under the terms of the settlement agreement, we will
    not be required to make any royalty payments to Fumedica if
    BG-12 is successfully launched for psoriasis in Germany. The
    $28.1 million amount has been expensed as it relates to a
    product that has not reached technological feasibility.

Amortization
    of Intangible Assets

For 2006, 2005 and 2004, amortization expense was
    $267.0 million, $302.3 million and
    $347.7 million, respectively.

For 2006 compared to 2005, amortization expense decreased
    $35.3 million, or 11.7%, due, principally, to the impact of
    a change in amortization for core technology in accordance with
    our policy from economic consumption in 2005 to the
    straight-line method in the third quarter of 2006. This change
    accounted for a decrease of approximately $18 million.
    Additionally, approximately $5 million of the decrease
    relates to the impact of lower amortization as a result of the
    revised economic consumption forecast for 2006 versus 2005 that
    impacted the first six months of 2006. Additionally, in 2005, a
    charge of $7.9 million had been recorded to write-down
    certain core technology intangible assets to net realizable
    value.

As of September 30, 2006, in connection with the
    establishment of our annual Long Range Plan, we reforecasted the
    economic consumption of AVONEX, based on our revised forecasts
    of future sales. Additionally, based on our policy, we began to
    calculate amortization under the straight-line method as it
    resulted in a greater amount than the amount computed under the
    economic use method. The straight-line calculation will be
    applied until our remeasurement in conjunction with the 2008
    Long Range Plan in the third quarter of 2007.

For 2005 compared to 2004, amortization expense decreased
    $45.4 million, or 13.1%, due, principally, to a change in
    estimate in the calculation of economic consumption for core
    technology, offset by a $8.0 million charge to write-down
    certain core technology intangible assets to net realizable
    value in 2005.

In the third quarter of 2005, we completed a review of our
    business opportunities in each of the relevant commercial
    markets in which our products are sold and determined their
    expected profitability. As a result of this review, in the third
    quarter of 2005, management determined that certain clinical
    trials would not continue which indicated that the carrying
    value of certain technology intangible assets related to future
    sales of AVONEX in Japan may not be recoverable. As a result, we
    recorded a charge of approximately $7.9 million to
    amortization of acquired intangible assets, which reflects the
    adjustment to net realizable value of technology intangible
    assets related to AVONEX.

In the third quarter of 2004, management determined that certain
    clinical trials would not continue which indicated that the
    carrying value of certain core technology intangible assets
    related to AMEVIVE may not be recoverable. As a result, in the
    third quarter of 2004, we recorded an impairment charge of
    approximately $27.8 million to amortization of acquired
    intangible assets, which reflects the adjustment to net
    realizable value of core technology intangible assets related to
    AMEVIVE.

We review our intangible assets for impairment periodically and
    whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
    carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. If future
    events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of
    these assets may not be recoverable, we may be required to
    record additional charges to our results of operations.

Our effective tax rate varied from the U.S. federal
    statutory rate due, principally, to the impact of foreign taxes,
    fair value adjustments, and IPR&D. The fair value
    adjustments relate to the impact of the tax treatment of the
    amortization of acquired intangible assets in foreign
    jurisdictions. Foreign taxes adjustments relate, principally, to
    the impact of significantly lower tax rates in foreign
    jurisdictions. The impact of IPR&D relate to the write-off
    of IPR&D in connection with the acquisitions of Conforma and
    Fumapharm, which was non-deductible for income tax purposes.

We have tax credit carryforwards for federal and state income
    tax purposes available to offset future taxable income. The
    utilization of our tax credits may be subject to an annual
    limitation under the Internal Revenue Code due to a cumulative
    change of ownership of more than 50% in prior years. However, we
    anticipate that this annual limitation will result only in a
    slight deferral in the utilization of our net tax credits. Based
    upon the level of historical taxable income and income tax
    liabilities and projections for future taxable income over the
    periods that our deferred tax assets are either tax deductible
    or to which our tax credits may be carried, we believe it is
    more likely than not that we will realize the entire benefits of
    our deferred tax assets. In the event that actual results differ
    from our estimates of future taxable income or we adjust our
    estimates in future periods, we may need to establish a
    valuation allowance, which could materially impact our financial
    position and results of operations in that period.

On October 22, 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act of
    2004, or the Act, was signed into law. The Act created a
    temporary incentive, which expired on December 31, 2005,
    for U.S. multinationals to repatriate accumulated income
    earned outside the U.S. at an effective tax rate that could
    be as low as 5.25%. On December 21, 2004, the Financial
    Accounting Standards Board, or FASB issued FASB staff position

109-2,

Accounting and Disclosure Guidance for the Foreign Earnings
    Repatriation Provision within the American Jobs Creation Act of

, or FSP

109-2.

FSP

109-2

allowed companies additional time to evaluate the effect of the
    law on whether unrepatriated foreign earnings continue to
    qualify for SFAS 109’s exception to recognizing
    deferred tax liabilities. We completed our evaluation during the
    fourth quarter of 2005 and decided to take advantage of this
    temporary tax incentive. A total distribution of
    $196.0 million was made by one of our foreign subsidiaries
    to one of our U.S. subsidiaries in December 2005. We
    incurred a charge to our consolidated results of operations of
    $11.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2005 for the tax
    cost related to the distribution. The Act also provides a
    deduction for domestic manufacturing, which reduced our
    effective tax rate by approximately 1.3% for 2005. We estimate
    that the deduction will reduce our effective tax rate by a
    higher amount in future years, as the deduction is phased-in.

During the fourth quarter of 2005, the Internal Revenue Service,
    or IRS, completed its examination of legacy Biogen, Inc.’s,
    now Biogen Idec MA, Inc.’s, consolidated federal income tax
    returns for the fiscal years 2001 and 2002 and issued an
    assessment. We subsequently paid the majority of the amounts
    assessed and are appealing one issue. As a result of this and
    other income tax audit activity, Biogen Idec MA, Inc. reassessed
    its liability for income



tax contingencies to reflect the IRS findings and recorded a
    $13.8 million reduction in these liabilities during the
    fourth quarter of 2005. The corresponding effects of the
    adjustments to the liability for income tax contingencies
    through 2004 resulted in a reduction in goodwill of
    $20.7 million for amounts related to periods prior to the
    Merger and an increase in income tax expense associated with
    continuing operations of $6.9 million in 2005.

Contingency

On September 12, 2006, we received a Notice of Assessment
    from the Massachusetts Department of Revenue for
    $38.9 million, including penalties and interest, with
    respect to the 2001, 2002 and 2003 tax years. We believe that we
    have meritorious defenses to the proposed adjustment and will
    vigorously oppose the assessment. We believe that the assessment
    does not impact the level of our liabilities for income taxes.
    However, there is a possibility that we may not prevail in all
    of our assertions. If this is resolved unfavorably in the future
    based on facts and conditions currently not available to us,
    this could have a material impact on our future effective tax
    rate and our results of operations in the period, or periods, in
    which an event would occur.

FIN 48
    Assessment

We are currently evaluating the impact of FIN 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes — an
    interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109

, on our
    financial statements.

Financial
    Condition

We have financed our operating and investing activities
    principally through cash flows from our operations. We expect to
    finance our current and planned operating requirements
    principally through cash from operations, as well as existing
    cash resources. We believe that these funds will be sufficient
    to meet our operating requirements for the foreseeable future.
    However, we may, from time to time, seek additional funding
    through a combination of new collaborative agreements, strategic
    alliances and additional equity and debt financings or from
    other sources. Our working capital and capital requirements will
    depend upon numerous factors, including:

•

the continued commercial success of AVONEX and RITUXAN;

•

the commercial success of TYSABRI;

•

the timing and expense of obtaining regulatory approvals for
    products in development;

•

the cost of launching new products, and the success of those
    products;

•

funding and timing of payments related to several significant
    capital projects;

•

the progress of our preclinical and clinical testing;

•

fluctuating or increasing manufacturing requirements and
    research and development programs;

•

levels of resources that we need to devote to the development of
    manufacturing, sales and marketing capabilities, including
    resources devoted to the marketing of AVONEX, RITUXAN, FUMADERM,
    TYSABRI and future products;

•

technological advances;

•

status of products being developed by competitors;

•

our ability to establish collaborative arrangements with other
    organizations;

•

working capital required to satisfy the options of holders of
    our senior notes and subordinated notes who may require us to
    repurchase their notes on specified terms or upon the occurrence
    of specified events.

In connection with the strategic plan that we announced in
    September 2005, we intend to commit significant additional
    capital to external research and development opportunities. To
    date, we have financed our external growth initiatives through
    existing cash resources. We expect to finance our future growth
    initiative requirements either through existing cash resources
    or a combination of existing cash resources and debt financings.



Until required for operations, we invest our cash reserves in
    bank deposits, certificates of deposit, commercial paper,
    corporate notes, foreign and U.S. government instruments
    and other readily marketable debt instruments in accordance with
    our investment policy.

Operating
    activities

In 2006, 2005, and 2004, net cash provided by operations was
    $841.3 million, $889.5 million, $728.0 million,
    respectively.

For 2006 compared to 2005, net cash provided by operations
    decreased $48.2 million or 5.4%. The decrease in cash
    provided by operations is primarily attributable to increases in
    asset accounts and reduction in liabilities, offset by higher
    earnings. Specifically, cash used to finance movements in
    working capital accounts gave rise to a use of funds in the
    current year of $96.5 million as compared to a source of
    funds of $139.8 million in the prior year. The current year
    includes higher non-cash expenses in 2006 as compared to 2005.
    The principal components of the increase in non-cash charges
    were acquired in-process research and development of
    $330.5 million related to the 2006 acquisitions of
    Fumapharm and Conforma, offset by a decrease in impairments
    expense of $134.6 million for 2006 as compared to 2005.

For 2005 compared to 2004, net cash provided by operations
    increased $161.5 million or 22.2%. The increase is
    primarily attributable to increases in non-cash impairment
    expense of $115.5 million offset by increases in asset
    accounts and reduction in liabilities. Specifically, cash used
    to finance movements in working capital asset and liability
    accounts gave rise to a source of funds in 2005 of
    $139.8 million as compared to a source of funds in 2004 of
    $258.7 million.

Investing
    activities

In 2006, 2005, and 2004 investing activities were a net source
    (use) of cash of ($599.8) million, $417.7 million and
    ($382.4) million, respectively.

In 2006, our major uses of cash for investing activities were
    for the acquisitions of Fumapharm and Conforma of approximately
    $363.3 million, net purchases of marketable securities of
    $162.8 million, and net property, plant and equipment
    additions of $124.1 million offset by proceeds from the
    disposition of AMEVIVE of $59.8 million. In 2005, our major
    sources of cash consisted of $408.1 million of proceeds
    from the sale of our Oceanside, California manufacturing
    facility. Additionally, approximately $447.9 million of net
    cash was provided from proceeds from sales of marketable
    securities. We sold marketable securities in the second quarter
    of 2005 to fund the repurchase of our senior notes, discussed
    below. Cash used for investing activities consisted of
    $318.4 million to fund construction projects and purchase
    property and equipment, including our research and development
    and administration campus in San Diego and manufacturing
    facility in Oceanside, and $119.9 million for investments
    in marketable securities of PDL, Sunesis Pharmaceuticals, Inc.,
    or Sunesis, and other strategic investments. In 2004, the major
    use of cash was acquisitions of property plant and equipment of
    $361.0 million.

Financing
    activities

In 2006, 2005, and 2004, net cash used in financing activities
    was $148.4 million, $948.5, and $451.0 million,
    respectively.

In 2006, the primary use of cash was $320.3 million for
    repurchase of common stock under our stock repurchase program,
    offset by $147.0 million in proceeds from the issuance of
    treasury stock in connection with stock based compensation
    arrangements. The primary uses of cash in 2005 were for the
    repurchase of senior notes



of $746.4 million and $322.6 million for repurchase of
    common stock under our stock repurchase program, offset by
    $119.6 million for issuance of treasury stock in connection
    with stock based compensation arrangements.

In 2004, the major use of cash was for the purchase of treasury
    stock of $734.4 million offset by cash inflows from the
    issuance of both common and treasury stock for stock based
    compensation arrangements of $273.5 million.

In April and May 2002, we raised approximately $696 million
    through the issuance of our senior notes, net of underwriting
    commissions and expenses of $18.4 million. The senior notes
    are zero coupon and were priced with a yield to maturity of
    1.75% annually. On April 29, 2005, holders of 99.2% of the
    outstanding senior notes exercised their right under the
    indenture governing the senior notes to require us to repurchase
    their senior notes. On May 2, 2005, we paid
    $746.4 million in cash to repurchase those senior notes
    with an aggregate principal amount at maturity of approximately
    $1.2 billion. The purchase price for the senior notes was
    $624.73 in cash per $1,000 principal amount at maturity, and was
    based on the requirements of the indenture and the senior notes.
    Additionally, we made a cash payment in 2005 of approximately
    $62 million for the payment of tax related to additional
    deductible interest expense for which deferred tax liabilities
    had been previously established. As of December 31, 2006,
    our remaining indebtedness under the senior notes was
    approximately $10.2 million at maturity.

In February 1999, we raised approximately $113 million
    through the issuance of our subordinated notes,  net of
    underwriting commissions and expenses of $3.9 million. The
    subordinated notes are zero coupon and were priced with a yield
    to maturity of 5.5% annually. Upon maturity, the subordinated
    notes would have had an aggregate principal face value of
    $345.0 million. As of December 31, 2006, our remaining
    indebtedness under the subordinated notes was approximately
    $75.4 million at maturity, due to conversion of
    subordinated notes into common stock.

Each $1,000 aggregate principal face value subordinated note is
    convertible at the holder’s option at any time through
    maturity into 40.404 shares of our common stock at an
    initial conversion price of $8.36 per share. During 2005,
    holders of the subordinated notes with a face value of
    approximately $143.8 million elected to convert their
    subordinated notes to approximately 5.8 million shares of
    our common stock. The remaining holders of the subordinated
    notes may require us to purchase the subordinated notes on
    February 16, 2009 or 2014 at a price equal to the issue
    price plus accrued original issue discount to the date of
    purchase with us having the option to repay the subordinated
    notes plus accrued original issue discount in cash, common stock
    or a combination of cash and stock.

Biogen-Dompe

In October 2006, Biogen-Dompe SRL, or the joint venture, a
    consolidated joint venture in which we are a 50% partner,
    obtained a 24 million Euros line of credit from us and
    Dompé Farmaceutici SpA, or Dompé, at a rate of
    3 month LIBOR plus 25 basis points. The interest rate
    is reset quarterly and payable quarterly in arrears. As of
    December 31, 2006, the balance of the joint venture loan
    was 18 million Euros ($23.8 million), half of which
    has been eliminated as it is an intercompany loan for purposes
    of presenting our consolidated financial position. Borrowings
    are to be made equally between the partners, and any repayments
    are to be paid in a similar manner. The loan replaced a previous
    advance that had been made by Dompe. Any borrowings on the line
    of credit are due June 1, 2009.

Notes Payable
    to Fumedica

In December 2006, in connection with the settlement of various
    agreements associated with Fumedica, we entered into two notes
    payable, the aggregate amount of which, at present value, was
    47.7 million Swiss Francs ($39.2 million). The notes
    are non-interest bearing, are being accreted at a rate of 5.75%
    and are payable in a series of payments over the period from
    2008 to 2018. (See Note 2, Acquisitions and Other
    Agreements, of the consolidated financial statements).

Commitments

In August 2004, we restarted construction of our large-scale
    biologic manufacturing facility in Hillerod, Denmark. In March
    2005, after our voluntary suspension of TYSABRI, we reconsidered
    our construction plans and determined that we would proceed with
    the bulk-manufacturing component of our large-scale biologic
    manufacturing facility in Hillerod, Denmark. Additionally, we
    added a labeling and packaging component to the project. We



also determined that we would no longer proceed with the
    fill-finish component of that facility. The original cost of the
    revised project was expected to be $372.0 million. As of
    December 31, 2006, we had committed approximately
    $304.4 million to the project, of which $275.3 million
    had been paid. The administrative building is already in use.
    The lab facility and the label and packaging facility were
    substantially completed in 2006 and will be licensed for
    operation in 2007. The second phase of the project, a
    large-scale manufacturing facility, is expected to be completed
    in 2008. In October 2006, our Board of Directors approved the
    second phase of the project, which is expected to cost an
    additional $225.0 million.

In October 2004, our Board of Directors authorized the
    repurchase of up to 20.0 million shares of our common
    stock. This repurchase program expired October 4, 2006.
    During 2006, we repurchased 7.5 million shares at a cost of
    $320.3 million. During 2005, we repurchased
    7.5 million shares at a cost of $324.3 million.

In October 2006, our Board of Directors authorized the
    repurchase of up to an additional 20.0 million shares of
    our common stock. The repurchased stock will provide us with
    treasury shares for general corporate purposes, such as common
    stock to be issued under our employee equity and stock purchase
    plans. This repurchase program does not have an expiration date.
    No shares have been repurchased under the program as of
    December 31, 2006.

    Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

The following summarizes our contractual obligations (excluding
    contingent milestone payments totaling $1.5 billion under
    our collaboration and license agreements, and construction

All material intercompany balances and transactions have been
    eliminated. We do not have any other significant relationships
    with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as
    entities often referred to as structured finance or special
    purpose entities, which would have been established for the
    purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other
    contractually narrow or limited purposes. As such, we are not
    exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that
    could arise if we had engaged in such relationships.
    Additionally, holders of our subordinated notes may elect to
    convert their notes into shares of our common stock at any time.

Collaboration
    and License Agreements

In connection with our research and development efforts, we have
    entered into various collaboration arrangements which provide us
    with rights to develop, produce and market products using
    certain know-how, technology and patent rights maintained by the
    parties. Terms of the various license agreements may require us
    to make milestone payments upon the achievement of certain
    product development objectives and pay royalties on future
    sales, if any, of commercial products resulting from the
    collaboration.

See Note 15, Research Collaborations and Strategic
    Investments, to the consolidated financial statements.

Critical
    Accounting Estimates

The preparation of our consolidated financial statements
    requires us to make estimates and judgments that may affect the
    reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses,
    and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On
    an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those
    related to:

•

product revenue and related allowances;

•

royalty revenues;

•

marketable securities and other investments;

•

inventory;

•

income taxes;

•

research and development;

•

in-process research and development;

•

derivative and hedging activities;

•

long-lived assets;

•

goodwill;

•

contingencies and litigation; and

•

share-based payments.

We base our estimates on historical experience and on various
    other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the
    circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making
    judgments about revenue and expense recognition and carrying
    values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent
    from other sources. Actual results may differ from these
    estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

We believe the following critical accounting estimates affect
    our more significant judgments and estimates used in the
    preparation of our consolidated financial statements:

Revenue
    Recognition and Accounts Receivable

Product
    Revenues

We recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met:
    persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; delivery has
    occurred or services have been rendered; the seller’s price
    to the buyer is fixed or determinable; collectibility is
    reasonably assured; and title and the risk and rewards of
    ownership have transferred to the buyer.

Except for revenues from sales of TYSABRI in the U.S., revenues
    from product sales are recognized when title and risk of loss
    have passed to the customer, which is typically upon delivery.
    Sales of TYSABRI in the U.S. are recognized on the
    “sell-through” model, that is, upon shipment of the
    product by Elan to its third party distributors.

Revenues are recorded net of applicable reserves for trade term
    discounts, wholesaler incentives, Medicaid rebates,
    Veteran’s Administration, or VA rebates, managed care,
    patient assistance, product returns and other applicable
    allowances and the estimates we make with respect to these
    allowances represent the most significant judgments that we make
    with regard to revenue recognition.

Our product revenue reserves are based on estimates of the
    amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales. These
    estimates take into consideration our historical experience,
    current contractual and statutory requirements, specific known
    market events and trends and forecasted customer buying
    patterns. If actual results vary, we may need to adjust these
    estimates, which could have an effect on earnings in the period
    of the adjustment.

Product revenue reserves are categorized as follows: discounts,
    contractual adjustments and returns.

Discounts

Discount reserves include trade term discounts, wholesaler
    incentives and patient assistance.



Trade term discounts and wholesaler incentive reserves primarily
    relate to estimated obligations for credits to be granted to
    wholesalers for remitting payment on their purchases within
    established incentive periods and credits to be granted to
    wholesalers for compliance with various contractually-defined
    inventory management practices, respectively. We determine these
    reserves based on our experience, including the timing of
    customer payments.

Patient assistance reserves are established to cover no-charge
    product that we distribute to qualifying patients under our
    indigent program, Patient Access. The program is administered
    through one of our distribution partners, who ship product for
    qualifying patients from their own inventory that was purchased
    from us. The distributor receives a credit at the end of each
    period for product that was administered during the period, and
    an accrual is established through a reduction of product
    revenues for sales made to the distributor which may be used to
    administer our patient assistance program. We determine this
    reserve based on our experience with the amount of activity
    under the program.

Contractual
    Adjustments

Contractual adjustment reserves relate to Medicaid rebates, VA
    rebates and managed care.

Medicaid rebates reserves relate to our estimated obligations to
    states under established reimbursement arrangements. Rebate
    accruals are recorded in the same period the related revenue is
    recognized resulting in a reduction to product sales revenue and
    the establishment of a liability. Rebate amounts are generally
    determined at the time of resale to the state, and we generally
    make cash payments for such amounts within a few weeks of
    receiving notification from the state.

VA rebates or chargeback reserves represent our estimated
    obligations resulting from contractual commitments to sell
    products to qualified health care providers at prices lower than
    the list prices we charge the wholesalers who provide them those
    products. The wholesaler charges us for the difference between
    what the wholesaler pays us for the products and the selling
    price to the qualified healthcare providers. Rebate accruals are
    established in the same period as the related revenue is
    recognized resulting in a reduction in product revenue.
    Chargeback amounts are generally determined at the time of
    resale to the qualified healthcare provider, and we generally
    issue credits for such amounts within a few weeks of receiving
    notification from the wholesaler.

Managed care reserves represent our estimated obligations to
    third parties, primarily pharmacy benefit managers. Rebate
    accruals are recorded in the same period the related revenue is
    recognized resulting in a reduction to product revenue and the
    establishment of a liability which is included in other accrued
    liabilities. These rebates result from performance-based offers
    that are primarily based on attaining contractually specified
    sales volumes and growth. As a result, the calculation of the
    accrual for these rebates requires an estimate of the
    customer’s buying patterns and the resulting applicable
    contractual rebate rate(s) to be earned over a contractual
    period.

In 2006, our estimates required an adjustment of
    $3.1 million relating to prior years.

Returns

Product return revenues are established for returns made by
    wholesalers and patients. In accordance with contractual terms,
    wholesalers are permitted to return product for reasons such as
    damaged or expired product. We also accept returns from our
    patients for various reasons.

Revenues for product returns are recorded in the period the
    related revenue is recognized, resulting in a reduction to
    product sales. The patient return program is administered by the
    same distribution partner as the patient assistance program.
    Revenue related to product sold to this distribution partner
    that is used to satisfy patient returns is fully reserved. The
    majority of wholesaler returns are due to product expiration.
    Expired product return reserves are estimated through a
    comparison of historical return data to their related sales on
    production lot basis. Historical rates of return are determined
    for each product and are adjusted for known or expected changes
    in the marketplace specific to each product. As noted below, we
    have recorded adjustments to the amount of reserves for product
    returns.

During the second quarter of 2006, we recorded an increase in
    our allowance for expired products of $12.3 million to
    correct for prior period errors. This increase in the allowance
    was recorded through an out of period



reduction in net product revenue of $6.9 million and an
    increase in goodwill of $5.4 million. We identified and
    quantified the errors through an analysis of the historical rate
    for returns based on volumes of returns and the amount of credit
    granted to the returning distributors in past periods. At the
    time of Merger with Biogen, Inc. in 2003, Biogen, Inc. had
    understated its allowance for expired product by an estimated
    $5.4 million due to an incorrect methodology applied in
    calculating its reserve balance. Had we identified this error at
    the time of the Merger, the recorded goodwill would have been
    approximately $5.4 million higher than has been previously
    reflected. Biogen, Inc.’s methodology was in error because
    it did not utilize known information in determining critical
    assumptions used in the basis of calculation. Our application of
    this incorrect methodology in the post-Merger period resulted in
    understating this reserve by an additional $6.9 million. In
    all cases, the correctly calculated rate of return is less than
    one percent of related gross product revenues. We have
    determined that the out of period correction of this error in
    2006 is not material to our reported results. Additionally, we
    have determined that the error at the merger date is not
    material to any prior period balance sheet amounts and the error
    in the post-merger period is not material to any prior period
    reported results.

Other

We closely monitor levels of inventory in our distribution
    channel. At December 31, 2006, we had approximately
    2 weeks of inventory in our distribution channel. The shelf
    life associated with our products is, generally between 15 and
    48 months, depending on the product. Obsolescence due to
    dating expiration has not been a historical concern, given the
    rapidity in which our products move through the channel. Changes
    due to our competitors’ price movements have not adversely
    affected us. We do not provide incentives to our distributors to
    assume additional inventory levels beyond what is customary in
    their ordinary course of business.

Royalties

We receive royalty revenues under license agreements with a
    number of third parties that sell products based on technology
    developed by us or to which we have rights. The license
    agreements provide for the payment of royalties to us based on
    sales of the licensed product. We record these revenues based on
    estimates of the sales that occurred during the relevant period.
    The relevant period estimates of sales are based on interim data
    provided by licensees and analysis of historical royalties paid
    to us, adjusted for any changes in facts and circumstances, as
    appropriate. We maintain regular communication with our
    licensees in order to gauge the reasonableness of our estimates.
    Differences between actual royalty revenues and estimated
    royalty revenues are reconciled and adjusted for in the period
    which they become known, typically the following quarter.
    Historically, adjustments have not been material based on actual
    amounts paid by licensees. There are no future performance
    obligations on our part under these license agreements. Under
    this policy, revenue can vary due to factors such as resolution
    of royalty disputes and arbitration.

Marketable
    Securities and Investments

We invest in various types of securities, including:

•

short-term and long-term marketable securities, principally
    corporate notes and government securities, in which our excess
    cash balances are invested;

•

equity securities in certain publicly-traded biotechnology
    companies with which we have collaborative agreements; and

•

equity securities of certain companies whose securities are not
    publicly traded and where fair value is not readily available.

These investments are accounted for in accordance with Statement
    of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115, or
    SFAS 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and
    Equity Securities, or APB 18,

The Equity Method of
    Accounting for Investments in Common

, as appropriate.

In accounting for investments we evaluate if a decline in the
    fair value of a marketable security below our cost basis is

other-than-temporary,

and if so, we record an impairment charge in our consolidated
    statement of income. The factors that we consider in our
    assessments include the fair market value of the security, the
    duration of the



security’s decline, prospects for the investee, including
    favorable clinical trial results, new product initiatives and
    new collaborative agreements and our intent and ability to hold
    to recovery. The determination of whether a loss is other than
    temporary is highly judgmental and can have a material impact on
    our results.

During 2006, 2005 and 2004, we recorded charges related to
    impairments that were determined to be other than temporary, of
    $34.4 million, $15.4 million, and $18.5 million,
    respectively, related to equity securities.

Inventory

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost
    determined under the

first-in,

first-out, or FIFO, method. Included in inventory are raw
    materials used in the production of pre-clinical and clinical
    products, which are expensed as research and development costs
    when consumed.

Our policy is to capitalize inventory costs associated with our
    products prior to regulatory approval, when, based on
    management’s judgment, future commercialization is
    considered probable and the future economic benefit is expected
    to be realized. Our accounting policy addresses the attributes
    that should be considered in evaluating whether the costs to
    manufacture a product have met the definition of an asset as
    stipulated in FASB Concepts Statement No. 6. We assess the
    regulatory approval process and where the particular product
    stands in relation to that approval process including any known
    constraints and impediments to approval, including safety,
    efficacy and potential labeling restrictions. We evaluate our
    anticipated research and development initiatives and constraints
    relating to the product and the indication in which it will be
    used. We consider our manufacturing environment including our
    supply chain in determining logistical constraints that could
    possibly hamper approval or commercialization. We consider the
    shelf life of the product in relation to the expected timeline
    for approval and we consider patent related or contract issues
    that may prevent or cause delay in commercialization. We are
    sensitive to the significant commitment of capital to scale up
    production and to launch commercialization strategies. We also
    base our judgment on the viability of commercialization, trends
    in the marketplace and market acceptance criteria. Finally, we
    consider the reimbursement strategies that may prevail with
    respect to the product and assess the economic benefit that we
    are likely to realize.

There is a risk inherent in these judgments and any changes we
    make in these judgment may have a material impact on our results
    in future periods.

We periodically review our inventories for excess or obsolete
    inventory and write-down obsolete or otherwise unmarketable
    inventory to its estimated net realizable value. If the actual
    net realizable value is less than that estimated by us, or if
    there are any further determinations that inventory will not be
    marketable based on estimates of demand, additional inventory
    write-downs may be required. This periodic review led to the
    write-downs of TYSABRI inventory as of December 31, 2004
    and the expensing of TYSABRI during 2005, as described above,
    and may lead us to expense TYSABRI in subsequent periods.
    Additionally, our products are subject to strict quality control
    and monitoring throughout the manufacturing process.
    Periodically, certain batches or units of product may no longer
    meet quality specifications or may expire. As a result, included
    in product cost of revenues were write-downs of commercial
    inventory that did not meet quality specifications or became
    obsolete due to dating expiration, in all cases this product
    inventory was written-down to its net realizable value.

During 2006, 2005 and 2004, we incurred charges to write down
    inventory of $13.0 million, $75.6 million, and
    $46.7 million, respectively. Additionally, in 2005, in
    connection with the divestiture of AMEVIVE, we recorded a charge
    of $31.8 million to write-down AMEVIVE inventory to its net
    realizable value.

Income
    Taxes

Income tax expense includes a provision for income tax
    contingencies. We utilize a “best estimate” approach
    for establishing loss contingencies related to income tax
    uncertainties based on the definition of a liability in FASB
    Concept Statement No. 6. These provisions are adjusted when
    an event occurs or additional information becomes available that
    impacts the amounts of our estimates.

While we believe that the amount of the tax estimates is
    reasonable, it is possible that the ultimate outcome of current
    or future examinations may differ from provisions for
    contingencies, and these differences could be significant.



In preparing our consolidated financial statements, we estimate
    our income tax liability in each of the jurisdictions in which
    we operate by estimating our actual current tax expense together
    with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing
    treatment of items for tax and financial reporting purposes.
    These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities,
    which are included in our consolidated balance sheets.
    Significant management judgment is required in assessing the
    realizability of our deferred tax assets. In performing this
    assessment, we consider whether it is more likely than not that
    some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be
    realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is
    dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during
    the periods in which those temporary differences become
    deductible. In making this determination, under the applicable
    financial accounting standards, we are allowed to consider the
    scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future
    taxable income, and the effects of viable tax planning
    strategies. Our estimates of future taxable income include,
    among other items, our estimates of future income tax deductions
    related to the exercise of stock options. In the event that
    actual results differ from our estimates, we adjust our
    estimates in future periods we may need to establish a valuation
    allowance, which could materially impact our financial position
    and results of operations.

On September 12, 2006, we received a Notice of Assessment
    from the Massachusetts Department of Revenue for
    $38.9 million, including penalties and interest, with
    respect to the 2001, 2002 and 2003 tax years. We believe that we
    have meritorious defenses to the proposed adjustment and will
    vigorously oppose the assessment. We believe that the assessment
    does not impact the level of our liabilities for income tax
    contingencies. However, there is a possibility that we may not
    prevail in all of our assertions. If this is resolved
    unfavorably in the future based on facts and conditions
    currently not available to us, this could have a material impact
    on our future effective tax rate and our results of operations
    in the period in which an event would occur.

FIN 48
    Assessment

We are currently evaluating the impact of FIN 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes — an
    interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109

, on our
    financial statements.

Research
    and Development Expenses

Research and development expenses consist of upfront fees and
    milestones paid to collaborators and expenses incurred in
    performing research and development activities including
    salaries and benefits, facilities expenses, overhead expenses,
    clinical trial and related clinical manufacturing expenses,
    contract services and other outside expenses. Research and
    development expenses are expensed as incurred. The timing of
    upfront fees and milestone payments in the future may cause
    variability in future research and development expense. Clinical
    trial expenses include expenses associated with contract
    research organizations, or CROs. The invoicing from CROs for
    services rendered can lag several months. We accrue the cost of
    services rendered in connection with CRO activities based on our
    estimate of management fees, site management and site monitoring
    costs, and data management costs. We maintain regular
    communication with our CRO vendors to gauge the reasonableness
    of our estimates. Differences between actual clinical trial
    expenses and estimated clinical trial expenses have not been
    material and are adjusted for in the period which they become
    known.

We have entered into certain research agreements in which we
    share expenses with our collaborator. We have entered into other
    collaborations where we are reimbursed for work performed on
    behalf of our collaborative partners. We record these expenses
    as research and development expenses. If the arrangement is a
    cost-sharing arrangement and there is a period during which we
    receive payments from the collaborator, we record payments by
    the collaborator for their share of the development effort as a
    reduction of research and development expense.

Valuation
    of Acquired Intangible Assets and In-process Research and
    Development Expenses

We have acquired, and expect to continue to acquire, intangible
    assets primarily via the acquisition of biotechnology companies.
    These intangible assets primarily consist of technology
    associated with human therapeutic products and in-process
    product candidates, as well as goodwill arising in business
    combinations. When significant identifiable intangible assets
    are acquired, an independent third-party valuation firm is
    engaged to assist in determining the fair values of these assets
    as of the acquisition date. Discounted cash flow models are
    typically



used in these valuations, and these models require the use of
    significant estimates and assumptions including but not limited
    to:

•

estimating the timing and expected costs to complete the
    in-process projects;

•

projecting regulatory approvals;

•

estimating future cash flows from product sales resulting from
    completed products and in-process projects; and

•

developing appropriate discount rates and probability rates by
    project.

We believe the fair values assigned to the intangible assets
    acquired are based upon reasonable estimates and assumptions
    given available facts and circumstances as of the acquisition
    dates.

Derivatives
    and Hedging Activities

We have operations in Europe, Japan, Australia and Canada in
    connection with the sale of AVONEX. We also receive royalty
    revenues based on worldwide product sales by our licensees. As a
    result, our financial position, results of operations and cash
    flows can be affected by fluctuations in foreign currency
    exchange rates (primarily Euro, Swedish krona, British pound,
    Japanese yen, Swiss franc and Canadian dollar).

We use foreign currency forward contracts to manage foreign
    currency risk, but do not engage in currency speculation. We use
    these forward contracts to hedge certain forecasted transactions
    denominated in foreign currencies. SFAS 133,

Accounting
    for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,

or
    SFAS 133, requires that all derivatives be recognized on
    the balance sheet at their fair value. Changes in the fair value
    of derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or
    other comprehensive income, depending on whether a derivative is
    designated as part of a hedge transaction and, if it is, the
    type of hedge transaction. We assess, both at their inception
    and on an on-going basis, whether the derivatives that are used
    in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting the
    changes in cash flows of hedged items. We also assess hedge
    ineffectiveness on a quarterly basis and record the gain or loss
    related to the ineffective portion to current earnings to the
    extent significant. If we determine that a forecasted
    transaction is no longer probable of occurring, we discontinue
    hedge accounting for the affected portion of the hedge
    instrument, and any related unrealized gain or loss on the
    contract is recognized in current earnings. Under this policy,
    and in accordance with SFAS 133, earnings may vary if the
    forecasted transaction does not occur, or if there is material
    hedge ineffectiveness or if the hedge ceases to be highly
    effective.

Long-Lived
    Assets

Long-lived assets to be held and used, including intangible
    assets, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes
    in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets
    might not be recoverable. Conditions that would necessitate an
    impairment assessment include a significant decline in the
    observable market value of an asset, a significant change in the
    extent or manner in which an asset is used, or a significant
    adverse change that would indicate that the carrying amount of
    an asset or group of assets is not recoverable. Determination of
    recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted future
    cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual
    disposition. In the event that such cash flows are not expected
    to be sufficient to recover the carrying amount of the assets,
    the assets are written-down to their estimated fair values.
    Long-lived assets to be disposed of are carried at fair value
    less costs to sell.

During 2005, we incurred charges to write down fixed assets of
    $118.1 million. No charges were recognized in 2006 and 2004.

During 2005 and 2004, we incurred charges to write down
    intangibles of $13.6 million and $27.8 million,
    respectively. No impairment charges were incurred in 2006.

Goodwill

We regularly assess our goodwill balance to determine whether
    any impairment in this asset may exist and, if so, the extent of
    such impairment. To do this, in the case of goodwill we estimate
    the fair value of each of our



reporting units and compare it to the book value of their net
    assets. Calculating fair value as well as future cash flows
    requires that we make a number of critical legal, economic,
    market and business assumptions that reflect our best estimates
    as of the testing date. We believe the methods we use to
    determine these underlying assumptions and estimates are
    reasonable and reflective of common practice. Notwithstanding
    this, our assumptions and estimates may differ significantly
    from actual results, or circumstances could change that would
    cause us to conclude that an impairment now exists or that we
    previously understated the extent of impairment.

Contingencies
    and Litigation

There has been, and we expect there may be significant
    litigation in the industry regarding commercial practices,
    regulatory issues, pricing, and patents and other intellectual
    property rights. Certain adverse unfavorable rulings or
    decisions in the future, including in the litigation described
    under “Legal Matters,” could create variability or
    have a material adverse effect on our future results of
    operations and financial position.

Share-based
    Payments

We make certain assumptions in order to value and expense our
    various share-based payment awards. In connection with valuing
    stock options and our employee stock purchase plan, we use the
    Black-Scholes model, which requires us to estimate certain
    subjective assumptions. The key assumptions we make are: the
    expected volatility of our stock; the expected term of the
    award; and the expected forfeiture rate. In connection with our
    restricted stock programs we make assumptions principally
    related to the forfeiture rate.

We review our valuation assumptions periodically and, as a
    result, we may change our valuation assumptions used to value
    stock based awards granted in future periods. Such changes may
    lead to a significant change in the expense we recognize in
    connection with share-based payments.

New
    Accounting Standards

Please refer to Note 25, New Accounting Pronouncements, of
    the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a
    discussion of new accounting standards.

Disclosure
    Controls and Procedures and Internal Control over Financial
    Reporting

Controls
    and Procedures

We have carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and the
    participation of our management, including our principal
    executive officer and principal financial officer, of the
    effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure
    controls and procedures (as defined in

Rules 13a-15(e)

and

15d-15(e)

under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the
    Securities Exchange Act), as of December 31, 2006. Based
    upon that evaluation, our principal executive officer and
    principal financial officer concluded that, as of the end of
    that period, our disclosure controls and procedures are
    effective in providing reasonable assurance that (a) the
    information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that
    we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act is recorded,
    processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
    specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and (b) such
    information is accumulated and communicated to our management,
    including our principal executive officer and principal
    financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions
    regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating our
    disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognized
    that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed
    and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving
    the desired control objectives, and our management necessarily
    was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the
    cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.

Changes
    in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

We evaluate the effectiveness of our internal control over
    financial reporting in order to comply with Section 404 of
    the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Section 404 requires us to
    evaluate annually the effectiveness of our



internal controls over financial reporting as of the end of each
    fiscal year, and to include a management report assessing the
    effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
    in all annual reports. We have not made any changes in our
    internal control over financial reporting during 2006 that have
    materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
    affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Management’s
    Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial
    Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
    adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal
    control over financial reporting is defined in

Rules 13a-15(f)

and

15d-15(f)

under the Securities Exchange Act as a process designed by, or
    under the supervision of, a company’s principal executive
    and principal financial officers and effected by a
    company’s board of directors, management and other
    personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. Our internal control
    over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures
    that:

•

pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable
    detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
    dispositions of our assets;

•

provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
    necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
    accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and
    that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in
    accordance with authorizations of our management and
    directors; and

•

provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
    detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our
    assets that could have a material effect on the financial
    statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods
    are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate
    because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
    compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal
    control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006.
    In making this assessment, management used the criteria set
    forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
    Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control —
    Integrated Framework.

Based on our assessment, our management has concluded that, as
    of December 31, 2006, our internal control over financial
    reporting is effective based on those criteria. Our
    management’s assessment of the effectiveness of our
    internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2006 has been audited by
    PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public
    accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears on

page F-61

of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Item 7A.

Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

We have operations in Europe, Japan, Australia and Canada in
    connection with the sale of AVONEX and TYSABRI. We also receive
    royalty revenues based on worldwide product sales by our
    licensees and through Genentech on sales of RITUXAN outside of
    the U.S. As a result, our financial position, results of
    operations and cash flows can be affected by market fluctuations
    in foreign currency exchange rates (primarily Euro, Swedish
    krona, British pound, Japanese yen, Canadian dollar and Swiss
    franc).

We use foreign currency forward contracts to manage foreign
    currency risk but do not engage in currency speculation. We use
    these forward contracts to hedge certain forecasted transactions
    denominated in foreign currencies. A hypothetical adverse 10%
    movement in foreign exchange rates compared to the
    U.S. dollar across all maturities (for example, a
    strengthening of the Euro) would result in a hypothetical loss
    in fair value of approximately $26.9 million. Our use of
    this methodology to quantify the market risk of such instruments
    should not be construed as an endorsement of its accuracy or the
    accuracy of the related assumptions. The quantitative
    information about market risk is necessarily limited because it
    does not take into account operating transactions.



In addition, the fair value of our marketable securities is
    subject to change as a result of potential changes in market
    interest rates. The potential change in fair value for interest
    rate sensitive instruments has been assessed on a hypothetical
    100 basis point adverse movement across all maturities. We
    estimate that such hypothetical adverse 100 basis point
    movement would result in a hypothetical loss in fair value of
    approximately $19.9 million to our interest rate sensitive
    instruments.

We are exposed to equity price risks on the marketable portion
    of equity securities included in our portfolio of investments
    entered into for the promotion of business and strategic
    objectives. These investments are generally in small
    capitalization stocks in the biotechnology industry sector. We
    regularly review the market prices of these investments for
    impairment purposes. A hypothetical adverse 10% movement in
    market values would result in a hypothetical loss in fair value
    of approximately $11.7 million.

BIOGEN
    IDEC INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.

Business
    Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting
    Policies

Overview

Biogen Idec Inc. was formed in 2003 upon the acquisition of
    Biogen, Inc. by IDEC Pharmaceuticals Corporation in a merger
    transaction, or the Merger. Biogen Idec Inc. is an international
    biotechnology company that creates new standards of care in
    oncology, neurology, immunology and other specialty areas of
    unmet medical need. We currently have five products:
    AVONEX

®

;
    RITUXAN

®

;
    TYSABRI

®

;
    FUMADERM

®

;
    and
    ZEVALIN

®

.

Principles
    of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include our financial
    statements and those of our wholly owned subsidiaries, as well
    as joint ventures in Italy and Switzerland, in which we are the
    primary beneficiary. We also consolidate a limited partnership
    investment, in which we are the majority investor. All material
    intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.

Use of
    Estimates

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in
    accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
    requires our management to make estimates and judgments that may
    affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and
    expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and
    liabilities. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates,
    including those related to revenue recognition and related
    allowances, marketable securities, derivatives and hedging
    activities, inventory, impairments of long-lived assets,
    including intangible assets, impairments of goodwill, income
    taxes including the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets,
    valuation of long-lived assets and investments, research and
    development, contingencies and litigation, and share-based
    payments. We base our estimates on historical experience and on
    various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable,
    the results of which form the basis for making judgments about
    the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results
    may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or
    conditions.

Translation
    of Foreign Currencies

The functional currency for most of our foreign subsidiaries is
    the local currency. Assets and liabilities are translated at
    current rates of exchange. Income and expense items are
    translated at the average exchange rates for the year.
    Adjustments resulting from the translation of the financial
    statements of our foreign operations into U.S. dollars are
    excluded from the determination of net income and are
    accumulated in a separate component of shareholders’ equity.

Foreign exchange transaction gains and losses are included in
    the results of operations in other income (expense), net. We had
    foreign exchange gains of $4.9 million in 2006, losses of
    $8.7 million in 2005 and gains of $5.4 million in 2004.

Cash
    and Cash Equivalents

We consider only those investments which are highly liquid,
    readily convertible to cash and which mature within three months
    from date of purchase to be cash equivalents.

Fair
    Value of Financial Instruments

The carrying amounts reflected in the consolidated balance
    sheets for cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, due
    from unconsolidated joint business, other current assets,
    accounts payable, and accrued expenses and other, approximate
    fair value due to their short-term maturities. Our marketable
    securities, all of which are

available-for-sale,

are carried at fair value based on quoted market prices. The
    fair values of our foreign currency forward contracts are based
    on quoted market prices or pricing models using current market
    rates.

Inventory

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost
    determined under the

first-in,

first-out, or FIFO, method. Included in inventory are raw
    materials used in the production of pre-clinical and clinical
    products, which are charged to research and development expense
    when consumed.

The components of inventories as of December 31 are as
    follows (in thousands):

Capitalization
    of Inventory Costs

We capitalize inventory costs associated with our products prior
    to regulatory approval when, based on management’s
    judgment, future commercialization is considered probable and
    the future economic benefit is expected to be realized. We
    consider numerous attributes in evaluating whether the costs to
    manufacture a particular product should be capitalized as an
    asset. We assess the regulatory approval process and where the
    product stands in relation to that approval process including
    any known constraints and impediments to approval, including
    safety, efficacy and potential labeling restrictions. We
    evaluate our anticipated research and development initiatives
    and constraints relating to the particular product and the
    indication in which it will be used. We consider our
    manufacturing environment including our supply chain in
    determining logistical constraints that could possibly hamper
    approval or commercialization. We consider the shelf life of the
    product in relation to the expected timeline for approval and we
    consider patent related or contract issues that may prevent or
    cause delay in commercialization. We are sensitive to the
    significant commitment of capital to scale up production and to
    launch commercialization strategies. We also base our judgment
    on the viability of commercialization, trends in the marketplace
    and market acceptance criteria. Finally, we consider the
    reimbursement strategies that may prevail with respect to the
    product and assess the economic benefit that we are likely to
    realize. We would be required to expense previously capitalized
    costs related to pre-approval inventory upon a change in such
    judgment, due to, among other potential factors, a denial or
    delay of approval by necessary regulatory bodies.

As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, the carrying value of our
    inventory did not include any costs associated with products
    that had not yet received regulatory approval.

TYSABRI

We manufactured TYSABRI during the first and second quarters of
    2005 and completed our scheduled production of TYSABRI during
    July 2005. Because of the uncertain future commercial
    availability of TYSABRI at the time, and our inability to
    predict to the required degree of certainty that TYSABRI
    inventory would be realized in commercial sales prior to the
    expiration of its shelf life, we expensed $23.2 million of
    costs related to the manufacture of TYSABRI in the first quarter
    of 2005 to cost of product revenues. At the time of production,
    the inventory was believed to be commercially saleable.
    Beginning in the second quarter of 2005, as we worked with
    clinical investigators to understand the possible risks of
    progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, or PML, we charged
    the costs related to the manufacture of TYSABRI to research and
    development expense. As a result, we expensed $21.5 million
    related to the manufacture of TYSABRI to research and
    development expense during 2005. At December 31, 2005,
    there was no carrying value of TYSABRI inventory on our
    consolidated balance sheet.

In the first quarter of 2006, in light of expectations of the
    re-introduction of TYSABRI, we began a new manufacturing
    campaign. The costs associated with this campaign were
    capitalized in accordance with our policy. On June 5, 2006,
    the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, approved the
    reintroduction of TYSABRI as a

monotherapy treatment for relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis,
    or MS, to slow the progression of disability and reduce the
    frequency of clinical relapses. On June 29, 2006, we and
    Elan Corporation plc, or Elan, announced the European Medicines
    Agency’s, or EMEA’s, approval of TYSABRI as a similar
    treatment. In July 2006, we began to ship TYSABRI in both the
    United States and Europe.

As of December 31, 2006, $41.3 million and
    $0.6 million of TYSABRI inventory value is included in work
    in process and finished goods, respectively. In addition, we
    have product on hand that was written-down in 2005 due to the
    uncertainties surrounding the TYSABRI suspension, but which is
    available to fill future orders. The approximate value of this
    product, based on its original cost of manufacture, was
    $36.9 million. As a result, we are recognizing lower than
    normal cost of sales and, therefore, higher margins.

TYSABRI currently has an approved shelf life of up to
    48 months and, based on our sales forecasts for TYSABRI, we
    expect the carrying value of the TYSABRI inventory to be
    realized.

Inventory
    Write-Offs

We periodically review our inventories for excess or obsolete
    inventory and write-down obsolete or otherwise unmarketable
    inventory to its estimated net realizable value. If the actual
    realizable value is less than that estimated by us, or if there
    are further determinations that inventory will not be marketable
    based on estimates of demand, additional inventory write-downs
    may be required. This periodic review led to the write-downs of
    TYSABRI inventory as of December 31, 2004 and the expensing
    of TYSABRI during 2005.

Our products are subject to strict quality control and
    monitoring which we perform throughout the manufacturing
    process. Periodically, certain batches or units of product may
    no longer meet quality specifications or may expire. As a
    result, included in product cost of product revenues were
    write-downs of commercial inventory that did not meet quality
    specifications or that became obsolete due to dating expiration.
    In all cases this product inventory was written-down to its net
    realizable value.

We have written-down the following unmarketable inventory, which
    was charged to cost of sales (in thousands):

    approved a new component for the pre-filled syringe formulation
    of AVONEX in March 2005. The ZEVALIN inventory was written-down
    when it was determined that it would not be marketable based on
    estimates of demand. Additionally, in the third quarter of 2005,

we recorded a charge of $5.7 million to cost of product
    revenues related to an impairment of certain capitalized ZEVALIN
    patents, to reflect the adjustment to net realizable value.

In addition to the write-downs noted above, in connection with
    the divestiture of AMEVIVE we recorded charges of
    $31.8 million in 2005 to write-down AMEVIVE inventory to
    its net realizable value.

Marketable
    Securities and Investments

Marketable
    Securities, including Strategic Investments

We invest our excess cash balances in marketable debt
    securities, primarily U.S. government securities and
    corporate bonds and notes, with strong credit ratings. We limit
    the amount of investment exposure as to institution, maturity
    and investment type. At December 31, 2006, substantially
    all of these securities were classified as

“available-for-sale”

in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    No. 115,

Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and
    Equity Securities

, or SFAS 115. In accordance with
    SFAS 115, all

available-for-sale

securities are recorded at fair market value and, to the extent
    deemed temporary, unrealized gains and losses are included in
    accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in
    shareholders’ equity, net of related tax effects. Realized
    gains and losses and declines in value, if any, judged to be
    other than temporary on available for sale securities are
    reported in other expense. The cost of

available-for-sale

securities sold is based on the specific identification method.

We have established guidelines that maintain credit quality and
    provide adequate liquidity in our

available-for-sale

portfolio. These guidelines are periodically reviewed and
    modified to take advantage of trends in yields and interest
    rates. In 2006, we recognized no charges for unrealized losses
    on

available-for-sale

securities that were determined to be

other-than-temporary.

For 2005 and 2004, we recognized impairment charges of
    $3.1 million and $5.7 million, respectively, related
    to unrealized losses on available for sale securities that had
    been determined to be other than temporary.

As part of our strategic product development efforts, we invest
    in equity securities of certain biotechnology companies with
    which we have collaborative agreements. Such investments are
    known as strategic investments and are classified as available
    for sale and accounted for as marketable securities. When
    assessing whether a decline in the fair value of a strategic
    investment below our cost basis is

other-than-temporary,

we consider the fair market value of the security, the duration
    of the security’s decline, and prospects for the underlying
    business, including favorable clinical trial results, new
    product initiatives and new collaborative agreements. In 2006,
    2005, and 2004 we recognized $30.5 million,
    $13.8 million, and $12.7 million in charges,
    respectively, for the impairment of investments that were
    determined to be

other-than-temporary

following a decline in value of the strategic investment. At
    December 31, 2006 and 2005, we had $8.6 million, and
    $8.8 million, respectively, of net unrealized gains related
    to these marketable securities. Additionally, in 2006, we
    recorded realized gains of $2.9 million related to these
    investments. There were no gains realized in 2005 or 2004. The
    fair market value of our strategic investments totaled
    $116.9 million and $143.6 million at December 31,
    2006 and 2005, respectively.

Non-Marketable
    Securities

We also invest in equity securities of companies whose
    securities are not publicly traded and where fair value is not
    readily available. These investments are recorded using either
    the cost method of accounting or the equity method, depending on
    our percentage ownership interest and other factors indicating
    significant influence, as required by Accounting Principles
    Board Opinion No. 18, or APB 18,

The Equity Method
    of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock.

We monitor
    these investments to evaluate whether any impairment in their
    value has occurred that would be other than temporary, based on
    the implied value from any recent rounds of financing completed
    by the investee, market prices of comparable public companies,
    and general market conditions. At December 31, 2006 and
    2005, we held $32.6 million and $25.8 million,
    respectively, of investments in non-public

securities, which is included in investments and other assets in
    the accompanying consolidated balance sheet, at cost.

In 2006 and 2005, we recorded $3.9 million and
    $1.6 million, respectively, in charges for the impairment
    of investments that were determined to be

other-than-temporary.

There were no significant charges in 2004 for impairments on
    these investments. Additionally, in 2006, we reported gains of
    $1.0 million on these investments. There were no gains
    realized in 2005 or 2004.

Additional recognition of impairments on any of our investments
    may cause variability in earnings.

Property
    and Equipment

Property and equipment are carried at cost, subject to review
    for impairment of significant assets whenever events or changes
    in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset
    may not be recoverable. Depreciation is calculated on the
    straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the
    assets. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of
    the useful life or the term of the respective lease. Maintenance
    costs are expensed as incurred. Buildings and building
    components are depreciated over estimated useful lives ranging
    from 15 to 40 years, machinery and equipment from 6 to
    15 years, furniture and fixtures for 7 years and
    computer software and hardware from 3 to 5 years. We
    capitalize certain incremental costs associated with the
    validation effort required for licensing by the FDA of
    manufacturing equipment for the production of a commercially
    approved drug. These costs include primarily direct labor and
    material and are incurred in preparing the equipment for its
    intended use. The validation costs are amortized over the life
    of the related equipment.

Impairment
    of Long-Lived Assets

Long-lived assets to be held and used, including intangible
    assets, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes
    in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets
    might not be recoverable. Conditions that would necessitate an
    impairment assessment include a significant decline in the
    observable market value of an asset, a significant change in the
    extent or manner in which an asset is used, or a significant
    adverse change that would indicate that the carrying amount of
    an asset or group of assets is not recoverable. Determination of
    recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted future
    cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual
    disposition. In the event that such cash flows are not expected
    to be sufficient to recover the carrying amount of the assets,
    the assets are written-down to their estimated fair values.
    Long-lived assets to be disposed of are carried at fair value
    less costs to sell.

Intangible
    Assets, excluding Goodwill

Our intangible assets consist of patents, trademarks and
    tradenames, core technology, licenses, assembled workforce and
    distribution rights, the majority of which arose in connection
    with the Merger. These intangible assets were recorded at fair
    value and are stated net of accumulated amortization and
    impairments.

Intangible assets related to patents, core technology, licenses,
    assembled workforce and distribution rights are amortized over
    their remaining estimated useful lives, ranging from 2 to
    20 years, based on the greater of the straight-line method
    or economic consumption each period. In the quarter ended
    September 30, 2006, we determined that the amortization of
    a core technology asset would be higher on the straight-line
    basis than on the economic consumption method that had been
    previously applied. Accordingly, in accordance with our policy,
    we calculated amortization on the straight-line method beginning
    in that period. The straight-line calculation will be applied
    until our remeasurement in the third quarter of 2007.

Intangible assets related to trademarks and tradenames have
    indefinite lives, and as a result are not amortized, but are
    subject to review for impairment. We review our intangible
    assets for impairment annually, as of October 31, and
    whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
    carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable.

Goodwill

Goodwill relates largely to amounts that arose in connection
    with the Merger and represents the difference between the
    purchase price and the fair value of the identifiable tangible
    and intangible net assets when accounted for using the purchase
    method of accounting. Goodwill is not amortized, but is subject
    to periodic review for impairment. Goodwill is reviewed
    annually, as of October 31, and whenever events or changes
    in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the
    goodwill might not be recoverable.

Income
    Taxes

The provision for income taxes includes federal, state, local
    and foreign taxes. Income taxes are accounted for under the
    liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
    recognized for the estimated future tax consequences of
    temporary differences between the financial statement carrying
    amounts and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and
    liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to
    apply to taxable income in the year in which the temporary
    differences are expected to be recovered or settled. We evaluate
    the realizability of our deferred tax assets and establish a
    valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that all or
    a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized.

We periodically estimate our probable tax obligations using
    historical experience in tax jurisdictions and informed
    judgments. There are inherent uncertainties related to the
    interpretation of tax regulations in the jurisdictions in which
    we transact business. The judgments and estimates made at a
    point in time may change based on the outcome of tax audits, as
    well as changes to, or further interpretations of, regulations.
    We adjust our income tax expense in the period in which these
    events occur.

Derivatives
    and Hedging Activities

Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133,

Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
    Activities,

or SFAS 133, requires that all derivatives
    be recognized on the balance sheet at their fair value. Changes
    in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in
    current earnings or other comprehensive (loss) income, depending
    on whether a derivative is designated as part of a hedge
    transaction and, if it is, the type of hedge transaction. We
    assess, both at inception and on an on-going basis, whether the
    derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly
    effective in offsetting the changes in cash flows of hedged
    items. We also assess hedge ineffectiveness on a quarterly basis
    and record the gain or loss related to the ineffective portion
    to current earnings to the extent significant. If we determine
    that a forecasted transaction is no longer probable of
    occurring, we discontinue hedge accounting for the affected
    portion of the hedge instrument, and any related unrealized gain
    or loss on the contract is recognized in current earnings.

Comprehensive
    Income (Loss)

Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 130,

Reporting Comprehensive Income,

or SFAS 130,
    requires us to display comprehensive income (loss) and its
    components as part of our financial statements. Comprehensive
    income (loss) is comprised of net income (loss) and other
    comprehensive (loss) income. Other comprehensive (loss) income
    includes changes in equity that are excluded from net income
    (loss), such as translation adjustments and unrealized holding
    gains and losses on

available-for-sale

marketable securities and certain derivative instruments, and,
    effective December 31, 2006, the unfunded amount of our
    postretirement and pension plans. All of these changes in equity
    are reflected net of tax, as appropriate.

Segment
    Information

Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 131,

Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related
    Information,

or SFAS 131, establishes standards for
    reporting information on operating segments in interim and
    annual financial statements. We operate in one segment, which is
    the business of development, manufacturing

and commercialization of novel therapeutics for human health
    care. Our chief operating decision-maker reviews our operating
    results on an aggregate basis and manages our operations as a
    single operating segment.

Revenue
    Recognition

Product
    Revenues

We recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met:
    persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; delivery has
    occurred or services have been rendered; the seller’s price
    to the buyer is fixed or determinable; collectibility is
    reasonably assured; and title and the risk and rewards of
    ownership have transferred to the buyer.

Except for revenues from sales of TYSABRI in the U.S., revenues
    from product sales are recognized when title and risk of loss
    have passed to the customer which is typically upon delivery.
    Sales of TYSABRI in the U.S. are recognized on the
    “sell-through” model, that is, upon shipment of the
    product by Elan to its third party distributor.

Revenues are recorded net of applicable allowances for trade
    term discounts, wholesaler incentives, Medicaid rebates,
    Veteran’s Administration, or VA rebates, managed care,
    patient assistance, product returns and other applicable
    allowances.

The timing of distributor orders and shipments can cause
    variability in earnings.

TYSABRI

Subsequent to the approval of TYSABRI for sale in both the U.S.
    and Europe, we began to ship TYSABRI into both regions in the
    third quarter of 2006. The collaboration agreement with Elan is
    designed to effect an equal sharing of profits and losses
    generated by the activities of the collaboration between us and
    Elan. Under our agreement with Elan, however, in the event that
    sales of TYSABRI exceed specified thresholds, Elan is required
    to make milestone payments to us in order to continue sharing
    equally in the collaboration’s results. We manufacture
    TYSABRI and collaborate with Elan on the product’s
    marketing, distribution and on-going development activities.

In the U.S., we sell TYSABRI to Elan who sells the product to
    third party distributors. We and Elan co-market the product. The
    sales price to Elan in the U.S. is set at the beginning of
    each quarterly period to effect an approximate equal sharing of
    the gross margin between Elan and us. In addition, both parties
    share equally in the operating costs, which include research and
    development, selling, general and administrative expenses and
    other similar costs. Sales of TYSABRI to Elan are reported as
    revenues and are recognized upon Elan’s shipment of the
    product to third party distributors, at which time all revenue
    recognition criteria have been met. As of December 31,
    2006, we had deferred revenue of $5.0 million for shipments
    to Elan that remained in Elan’s ending inventory as of
    December 31, 2006. Elan’s reimbursement of TYSABRI
    operating costs is reflected as a reduction of the respective
    costs within our consolidated statement of income.

For sales outside the U.S., we are responsible for distributing
    TYSABRI to customers and are primarily responsible for all
    operating activities. Both parties share equally in the
    operating results of TYSABRI outside the U.S. Sales of
    TYSABRI are reported as revenue and are recognized at the time
    of product delivery to our customer, at which time all revenue
    recognition criteria have been met. Payments to or from Elan for
    their share of collaboration net operating profits or losses
    relating to sales outside the U.S. are reflected in the
    collaboration profit (loss) sharing line in our consolidated
    statement of income. For 2006, we recognized $9.7 million
    in income related to reimbursements made in connection with this
    arrangement.

Prior to the suspension of TYSABRI in 2005, we shipped product
    to Elan in the U.S. and recognized revenue in accordance with
    the policy described above. As a result of the suspension of
    TYSABRI, we deferred $14.0 million in revenue from Elan as
    of March 31, 2005 related to TYSABRI product that Elan had
    not yet shipped to third party distributors. This amount was
    paid by Elan during 2005 and was subsequently recognized as
    revenue during 2006, as the uncertainty about the ultimate
    disposition of the product was eliminated.

    for Discounts and Allowances

We establish reserves for trade term discounts, wholesaler

The reserves are based on estimates of the amounts earned or to
    be claimed on the related sales. These estimates take into
    consideration our historical experience, current contractual and
    statutory requirements, specific known market events and trends
    and forecasted customer buying patterns. If actual future
    results vary, we may need to adjust these estimates, which could
    have an effect on earnings in the period of the adjustment.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Product revenue reserve are categorized as follows: discounts,
    contractual adjustments and returns.

Discounts

Discount reserves include trade term discounts, wholesaler
    incentives and patient assistance.

Trade term discounts and wholesaler incentive reserves primarily
    relate to estimated obligations for credits to be granted to
    wholesalers for remitting payment on their purchases within
    established incentive periods and credits to be granted to
    wholesalers for compliance with various contractually-defined
    inventory management practices, respectively. We determine these
    reserves based on our experience, including the timing of
    customer payments.

Patient assistance reserves are established to cover no-charge
    product that we distribute to qualifying patients under our
    indigent program, Patient Access. The program is administered
    through one of our distribution partners, who ship product for
    qualifying patients from their own inventory that was purchased
    from us. The distributor receives a credit at the end of each
    period for product that was administered during the period, and
    an accrual is established through a reduction of product
    revenues for sales made to the distributor which may be used to
    administer our patient assistance program. We determine this
    reserve based on our experience with the amount of activity
    under the program.

Contractual
    Adjustments

Contractual adjustment reserves relate to Medicaid rebates, VA
    rebates and managed care.

Medicaid rebates reserves relate to our estimated obligations to
    states under established reimbursement arrangements. Rebate
    accruals are recorded in the same period the related revenue is
    recognized resulting in a reduction to product sales revenue and
    the establishment of a liability. Rebate amounts are generally
    determined at the time of resale to the state, and we generally
    make cash payments for such amounts within a few weeks of
    receiving notification from the state.

VA rebates or chargeback reserves represent our estimated
    obligations resulting from contractual commitments to sell
    products to qualified health care providers at prices lower than
    the list prices we charge the wholesalers who provide them those
    products. The wholesaler charges us for the difference between
    what the wholesaler pays us for the products and the selling
    price to the qualified healthcare providers. Rebate accruals are
    established in the same period as the related revenue is
    recognized resulting in a reduction in product revenue.
    Chargeback amounts are generally determined at the time of
    resale to the qualified healthcare provider, and we generally
    issue credits for such amounts within a few weeks of receiving
    notification from the wholesaler.

Managed care reserves represent our estimated obligations to
    third parties, primarily pharmacy benefit managers. Rebate
    accruals are recorded in the same period the related revenue is
    recognized resulting in a reduction to product revenue and the
    establishment of a liability which is included in other accrued
    liabilities. These rebates result from performance-based offers
    that are primarily based on attaining contractually specified
    sales volumes and growth. As a result, the calculation of the
    accrual for these rebates requires an estimate of the
    customer’s buying patterns and the resulting applicable
    contractual rebate rate(s) to be earned over a contractual
    period.

Returns

Allowances for product returns are established for returns made
    by wholesalers and patients. In accordance with contractual
    terms, wholesalers are permitted to return product for reasons
    such as damaged or expired product. We also accept returns from
    our patients for various reasons.

Reserves for product returns are recorded in the period the
    related revenue is recognized, resulting in a reduction to
    product revenue. The patient return program is administered by
    the same distribution partner as the patient assistance program.
    Revenue related to product sold to this distribution partner
    that is used to satisfy patient returns is fully reserved. The
    majority of wholesaler returns are due to product expiration.
    Expired product return

reserves are estimated through a comparison of historical return
    data to their related sales on a production lot basis.
    Historical rates of return are determined for each product and
    are adjusted for known or expected changes in the marketplace
    specific to each product.

During the second quarter of 2006, we recorded an increase in
    our allowance for expired products of $12.3 million to
    correct for prior period errors. This increase in the allowance
    was recorded through an out of period reduction in net product
    revenue of $6.9 million and an increase in goodwill of
    $5.4 million. We identified and quantified the errors
    through an analysis of the historical rate for returns based on
    volumes of returns and the amount of credit granted to the
    returning distributors in past periods. At the time of Merger
    with Biogen, Inc. in 2003, Biogen, Inc. had understated its
    allowance for expired product by an estimated $5.4 million
    due to an incorrect methodology applied in calculating its
    reserve balance. Had we identified this error at the time of the
    Merger, the recorded goodwill would have been approximately
    $5.4 million higher than has been previously reflected.
    Biogen, Inc.’s methodology was in error because it did not
    utilize known information in determining critical assumptions
    used in the basis of calculation. Our application of this
    incorrect methodology in the post-Merger period resulted in
    understating this reserve by an additional $6.9 million. In
    all cases, the correctly calculated rate of return is less than
    one percent of related gross product revenues. We have
    determined that the out of period correction of this error in
    2006 is not material to our reported results. Additionally, we
    have determined that the error at the merger date is not
    material to any prior period balance sheet amounts and the error
    in the post-merger period is not material to any prior period
    reported results.

Other

Bad debt reserves are based on our estimated uncollectible
    accounts receivable. Given our historical experiences with bad
    debts, combined with our credit management policies and
    practices, we do not presently maintain significant bad debt
    reserves. The amount of such reserves as of December 31,
    2006, and 2005, was $1.7 million.

We have various contracts with distributors that provide for
    discounts and rebates. These discounts and rebates are
    classified as a reduction of revenue. We also maintain select
    customer service contracts with distributors and other customers
    in the distribution channel. We have established the fair value
    of these services and classified these customer service
    contracts as sales and marketing expense. If we had concluded
    that sufficient evidence of the fair value did not exist for
    these services, we would have been required to classify these
    costs as a reduction of revenue.

Revenues
    from Unconsolidated Joint Business

Revenues from unconsolidated joint business consist of our share
    of the pretax copromotion profits generated from our copromotion
    arrangement with Genentech, Inc., or Genentech, reimbursement
    from Genentech of our RITUXAN-related sales force and
    development expenses and royalties from Genentech for sales of
    RITUXAN outside the U.S. by F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd.,
    or Roche, and Zenyaku Kogyo Co. Ltd., or Zenyaku. Under the
    copromotion arrangement, all U.S. sales of RITUXAN and
    associated costs and expenses are recognized by Genentech and we
    record our share of the pretax copromotion profits as defined in
    our amended and restated collaboration agreement with Genentech.
    Pretax copromotion profits under the copromotion arrangement are
    derived by taking U.S. net sales of RITUXAN to third-party
    customers less cost of sales, third-party royalty expenses,
    distribution, selling and marketing expenses and joint
    development expenses incurred by Genentech and us. We record
    royalty revenue on sales of RITUXAN outside the U.S. on a
    cash basis.

Royalty
    Revenues

We receive royalty revenues under license agreements with a
    number of third parties that sell products based on technology
    we have developed or to which we have rights. The license
    agreements provide for the payment of royalties to us based on
    sales of the licensed product. We record these revenues based on
    estimates of the sales that occurred during the relevant period.
    The relevant period estimates of sales are based on interim data
    provided by

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

licensees and analysis of historical royalties we have been paid
    (adjusted for any changes in facts and circumstances, as
    appropriate). We maintain regular communication with our
    licensees in order to gauge the reasonableness of our estimates.
    Differences between actual royalty revenues and estimated
    royalty revenues are reconciled and adjusted for in the period
    in which they become known, typically the following quarter.
    Historically, adjustments have not been material based on actual
    amounts paid by licensees. There are no future performance
    obligations on our part under these license agreements. To the
    extent we do not have sufficient ability to accurately estimate
    revenue, we record it on a cash basis.

Research
    and Development Expenses

Research and development expenses consist of upfront fees and
    milestones paid to collaborators and expenses incurred in
    performing research and development activities including
    salaries and benefits, facilities expenses, overhead expenses,
    clinical trial and related clinical manufacturing expenses,
    contract services and other outside expenses. Research and
    development expenses are expensed as incurred. We have entered
    into certain research agreements in which we share expenses with
    our collaborator. We have entered into other collaborations
    where we are reimbursed for work performed on behalf of our
    collaborative partners. We record these expenses as research and
    development expenses. If the arrangement is a cost-sharing
    arrangement and there is a period during which we receive
    payments from the collaborator, we record payments by the
    collaborator for their share of the development effort as a
    reduction of research and development expense. If the
    arrangement is a reimbursement of research and development
    expenses, we record the reimbursement as corporate partner
    revenue.

Under Financial Accounting Standard Board Interpretation No 46
    (revised),

Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities,

we are required to assess new business development
    collaborations upon the occurrence of certain events, some of
    which are outside our control, reassess the accounting treatment
    of our existing business development collaborations based on the
    nature and extent of our financial interests as well as our
    ability to exercise influence in such collaborations. While this
    standard has not had any material effect on our financial
    results during 2006, 2005, and 2004, future events may result in
    our consolidation of companies or related entities with which we
    have a collaborative arrangement and this may have a material
    effect on our financial condition

and/or

results of operation in future periods.

Acquired
    In-Process Research and Development

Acquired in-process research and development, or IPR&D,
    represents the fair value assigned to research and development
    projects that we acquire which have not been completed at the
    date of acquisition and which have no future alternative use.
    Accordingly, the fair value of such projects is recorded as
    research and development expense as of the acquisition date.

The value assigned to acquired IPR&D is determined by
    estimating the costs to develop the acquired technology into
    commercially viable products, estimating the resulting net cash
    flows from the projects, and discounting the net cash flows to
    present value. The revenue and costs projections used to value
    IPR&D were, as applicable, reduced based on the probability
    of developing a new drug. Additionally, the projections
    considered the relevant market sizes and growth factors,
    expected trends in technology, and the nature and expected
    timing of new product introductions by us and our competitors.
    The resulting net cash flows from such projects are based on
    management’s estimates of cost of sales, operating
    expenses, and income taxes from such projects. The rates
    utilized to discount the net cash flows to their present value
    were based on estimated cost of capital calculations.

If these projects are not successfully developed, the sales and
    profitability of the company may be adversely affected in future
    periods. Additionally, the value of other acquired intangible
    assets may become impaired. We believe that the foregoing
    assumptions used in the IPR&D analysis were reasonable at
    the time of the respective acquisition. No assurance can be
    given, however, that the underlying assumptions used to estimate
    expected project sales, development costs or profitability, or
    the events associated with such projects, will transpire as
    estimated.

Earnings
    per Share

We calculate earnings per share in accordance with Statement of
    Financial Accounting Standards No. 128, Earnings per Share,
    or SFAS 128, and EITF

03-06,

Participating Securities and the Two —
    Class Method Under SFAS 128

or EITF

SFAS 128 and EITF

03-06

together require the presentation of “basic” earnings
    per share and “diluted” earnings per share.

Basic earnings per share is computed using the two-class method.
    Under the two-class method, undistributed net income is
    allocated to common stock and participating securities based on
    their respective rights to share in dividends. We have
    determined that our preferred shares meet the definition of
    participating securities, and have allocated a portion of net
    income to our preferred shares on a pro rata basis. Net income
    allocated to preferred shares is excluded from the calculation
    of basic earnings per share. For basic earnings per share, net
    income available to holders of common stock is divided by the
    weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding.
    For purposes of calculating diluted earnings per share, net
    income is adjusted for the after-tax amount of interest
    associated with convertible debt and net income allocable to
    preferred shares, and the denominator includes both the weighted
    average number of shares of common stock outstanding and
    potential dilutive shares of common stock from stock options,
    unvested restricted stock awards, restricted stock units and
    other convertible securities, to the extent they are dilutive.

Accounting
    for Share-based Compensation

Our share-based compensation programs consist of share-based
    awards granted to employees including stock options, restricted
    stock, performance and time-vested restricted stock units, as
    well as our employee stock purchase plan, or ESPP.

Until December 31, 2005, we applied APB Opinion
    No. 25,

Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,

in
    accounting for our plans and applied Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards No. 123,

Accounting for Stock
    Issued to Employees,

or SFAS 123, as amended by
    Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 148,

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation —
    Transition and Disclosure,

or SFAS 148, for disclosure
    purposes only. The SFAS 123 disclosures included pro forma
    net income and earnings per share as if the fair value-based
    method of accounting had been used. Stock-based compensation
    issued to non-employees was accounted for in accordance with
    SFAS 123 and related interpretations.

Effective January 1, 2006, we adopted Statement of
    Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004),

Share-based Payment,

or SFAS 123(R), which replaced
    SFAS 123 and superseded APB Opinion No. 25.
    SFAS 123(R) requires compensation cost relating to
    share-based payment transactions to be recognized in the
    financial statements using a fair-value measurement method.
    Under the fair value method, the estimated fair value of awards
    is charged against income over the requisite service period,
    which is generally the vesting period. We selected the modified
    prospective method as prescribed in SFAS 123(R) and,
    therefore, prior periods were not restated. Under the modified
    prospective application, SFAS 123(R) was applied to new
    awards granted in 2006, as well as to the unvested portion of
    previously granted share-based awards for which the requisite
    service had not been rendered as of December 31, 2005.
    Where awards are made with non-substantive vesting periods (for
    instance, where a portion of the award vests upon retirement
    eligibility), we estimate and recognize expense based on the
    period from the grant date to the date on which the employee is
    retirement eligible. For our ESPP, we apply a graded vesting
    approach because the ESPP provides for multiple purchase periods
    and is, in substance, a series of linked awards.

The fair value of the stock option grants is based on estimates
    as of the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option valuation
    model. The fair value of all time vested restricted units and
    restricted stock is based on the market value of our stock on
    the date of grant. Compensation expense for restricted stock and
    restricted stock units, including the effect of forfeitures, is
    recognized over the applicable service period. The fair value of
    performance based stock units is based on the market price of
    our stock on the date of grant and assumes that the performance

criteria will be met and the target payout level will be
    achieved. Compensation cost is adjusted for subsequent changes
    in the outcome of performance-related conditions until the
    vesting dates.

Change
    in Accounting Principle Related to Accounting for Tax Effects of
    Share-based Payment Awards

In November 2005, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position
    FAS 123(R) – 3

Transition Election Related to
    Accounting for Tax Effects of Share-based Payment Awards,

or
    FSP FAS 123(R) – 3. In accordance with FSP
    FAS 123(R) – 3, entities can choose to follow
    either the transitional guidance of SFAS 123(R) or the
    alternative transition method described in FSP
    FAS 123(R) – 3. Effective in the fourth quarter
    of 2006, we elected to adopt the alternative transition method
    for calculating the tax effects of stock-based compensation
    pursuant to SFAS 123(R). The alternative transition method
    includes simplified methods to establish the beginning balance
    of the additional paid-in capital pool, or APIC pool or
    windfall, related to the tax effects of employee stock-based
    compensation, and to determine the subsequent impact on the APIC
    pool and consolidated statements of cash flows of the tax
    effects of employee-stock based compensation awards that are
    outstanding upon adoption of SFAS 123(R). Electing the
    alternative transition method constitutes a change in accounting
    principle, which requires retrospective application to the 2006
    quarterly financial statements.

As a result of the adoption of FSP FAS 123(R) –
    3, the presentation of income taxes in the consolidated
    statement of cash flows and stockholders equity has changed.

The retrospective application to prior period financial
    statements had the effect of changing the amounts of cash flows
    from operations and from financing from those previously
    reported in our

Forms 10-Q.

Specifically, for the nine months ended September 30, 2006,
    both cash flows from operating activities, and cash used in
    financing activities would have been lower by $9.2 million.
    For the six months ended by June 30, 2006 both cash flows
    from operating activities, and cash used in financing activities
    would have been lower by $8.0 million. The change to the
    amounts reported in the

Form 10-Q

for the quarter ending March 31, 2006, was not material.

Consistent with the election to use the alternative method, we
    have excluded the impact of pro forma deferred tax assets in
    determining the assumed proceeds under the treasury method for
    purposes of calculating earnings per share.

Assets
    Held for Sale

We consider certain real property and certain other
    miscellaneous assets as held for sale when they meet the
    criteria set out in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    No. 144,

Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of
    Long-Lived Assets

.

As of December 31, 2006, assets held for sale were
    $9.3 million that comprised certain land and real property
    in San Diego, CA. As of December 31, 2005, assets held
    for sale were $58.4 million which comprised, principally,
    land and real property related to the facility known as NICO
    ($29.0 million) and intangible assets and real property
    related to AMEVIVE ($13.4 million). Assets held for sale
    are included in other current assets in the accompanying
    consolidated balance sheets.

Sale
    of Assets and Product Line

In December 2006, we completed the sale of one of our research
    buildings at our Cambridge, Massachusetts facility, known as Bio
    1. Proceeds from the sale were approximately $39.5 million.
    We recorded a pre-tax gain of approximately $15.6 million
    on the sale. We will continue to occupy a minor portion of the
    building through December 31, 2007 under a leasing
    arrangement and have recorded prepaid rent of approximately
    $0.7 million at December 31, 2006.

In April 2006, we sold the worldwide rights and other assets of
    AMEVIVE for $59.8 million, including $43.7 million of
    inventory on hand, to Astellas Pharma US, Inc. As of
    December 31, 2005, our AMEVIVE assets

held for sale included $8.0 million, net, related to
    intangible assets, and $5.4 million of property, plant and
    equipment, net, and were reported separately in current assets
    on the consolidated balance sheet. The pre-tax gain on this sale
    of approximately $2.8 million was deferred and is being
    recognized over the period of a related long-term supply
    contract.

In February 2006, we sold our clinical manufacturing facility,
    known as NICO, in Oceanside, California. The assets associated
    with the facility were included in assets held for sale on our
    consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2005. Total
    consideration was $29.0 million. In 2005, we recorded
    impairment charges of $28.0 million to reduce the carrying
    value of NICO to its net realizable value. No additional loss
    resulted from completion of the sale.

In June 2005, we sold our large-scale biologics manufacturing
    facility, known as NIMO, in Oceanside, California, along with
    approximately 60 acres of real property located in
    Oceanside, California upon which NIMO is located, together with
    improvements, related property rights, and certain personal
    property intangibles and contracts at or related to the real
    property. Total consideration for the purchase was
    $408.1 million. For 2005, the loss from this transaction
    was $83.5 million which consisted primarily of the
    write-down of NIMO to net selling price, sales and transfer
    taxes, and other associated transaction costs.

Acquisitions
    and Other Agreements

During 2006, we acquired two entities, Fumapharm AG, or
    Fumapharm, and Conforma Therapeutics Corporation, or Conforma,
    and entered into settlement agreements with Fumedica
    Arzneimittel AG and Fumedica Arzneimittel GmbH, collectively,
    Fumedica.

Fumapharm

On June 15, 2006, we completed the acquisition of 100% of
    the stock of Fumapharm, a privately held pharmaceutical company
    based in Switzerland that develops therapeutics derived from
    fumaric acid esters. As part of the acquisition, we acquired:
    FUMADERM, a commercial product available in Germany for the
    treatment of psoriasis, and BG-12, a clinical-stage compound
    being studied for the treatment of MS and psoriasis that was
    being jointly developed by Fumapharm and us. The purpose of this
    acquisition was to support our goal of developing innovative
    therapeutic options for people living with MS.

As part of the acquisition, we agreed to pay
    $220.0 million, of which $218.0 million was paid at
    closing and $2.0 million was retained and will be paid upon
    satisfaction of customary representations and warranties. We
    agreed to additional payments of: i) $15.0 million upon
    achievement of certain regulatory approvals, and ii) up to
    an additional $300.0 million in the event that annual and
    cumulative sales targets, as defined, are achieved.

The acquisition was funded from our existing cash on hand and
    has been accounted for as a business combination. Assets and
    liabilities assumed have been recorded at their fair values as
    of the date of acquisition. The

The purchase price allocation was completed during the fourth
    quarter of 2006.

The amount allocated to in process research and development, or
    IPR&D, projects relates to the development of BG-12. BG-12
    had recently received positive results from a Phase II
    study of its efficacy and safety for patients with
    relapsing-remitting MS and, subsequent to the acquisition, we
    initiated Phase III clinical trials. Since the acquisition
    in June of 2006, we have incurred $17.0 million in research
    and development costs. We expect to incur approximately an
    additional $151 million to complete the development of
    BG-12. The estimated revenues from BG-12, if any, are expected
    to be recognized beginning in 2011. A discount rate of 12% was
    used to value the project, which we believe to be commensurate
    with the stage of development and the uncertainties in the
    economic estimates described above. At the date of acquisition,
    the development of BG-12 had not yet reached technological
    feasibility, and the research and development in progress had no
    alternative future uses. Accordingly, the $207.4 million in
    IPR&D was expensed in 2006.

The fair value of intangible assets was based on valuations
    using an income approach, with estimates and assumptions
    determined by management. The core technology asset represents a
    combination of Fumapharm’s processes and procedures related
    to the design and development of its application products. The
    developed technology relates to processes and procedures related
    to products that have reached technological feasibility. Core
    technology is being amortized over approximately 12 years
    and the developed technology over approximately 3 years.
    The excess of purchase price over tangible assets, identifiable
    intangible assets and assumed liabilities represents goodwill.
    None of the goodwill or intangible assets acquired is deductible
    for income tax purposes. As a result, we recorded a deferred tax
    liability of $2.8 million, based on the tax effect of the
    amount of the acquired intangible assets other than goodwill
    with no tax basis.

In addition to the assets acquired, a gain of $34.2 million
    was recognized coincident with the acquisition of Fumapharm in
    accordance with EITF

04-1,

Accounting for Preexisting Relationships between the Parties
    to a Business Combination.

The gain related to the
    settlement of a preexisting license agreement between Fumapharm
    and us. The license agreement in question had been entered into
    in October 2003 and required us to make payments to Fumapharm of
    certain royalty amounts. The market rate for such payments was
    determined to have increased due, principally, to the increased
    technical feasibility of BG-12. The gain relates, principally,
    to the difference

between i) the royalty rates at the time the agreement was
    entered into as compared to ii) the expected higher royalty
    rates that would result at the time the agreement was
    effectively settled by virtue of our acquisition of Fumapharm.

Future contingent consideration payments, if any, will be
    accounted for as increases to goodwill.

The historical financial results of the acquisition for the year
    ended December 31, 2005 and the six months ended
    June 30, 2006 were not material for comparative purposes.

Conforma

In May 2006, we completed the acquisition of 100% of the stock
    of Conforma, a privately-held development stage
    biopharmaceutical company based in California that focused on
    the design and development of drugs for the treatment of cancer.
    The goal of this acquisition was to enable us to broaden our
    therapeutic opportunities in the field of oncology.

We acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of the
    capital stock of Conforma for $150.0 million, paid at
    closing. Of this amount, $15.0 million has been escrowed by
    the sellers pending satisfaction of customary representations
    and warranties made by Conforma. Up to an additional
    $100.0 million could be payable to the sellers upon the
    achievement of certain future development milestones.
    Additionally, $0.5 million in transaction costs were
    incurred and loans of approximately $2.3 million were made
    to certain non-officer employees of Conforma which are included
    in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.
    Such loans are fully collateralized and were made for the
    purpose of assisting the employees in meeting tax liabilities.

The acquisition was funded from our existing cash on hand and
    was accounted for as an asset acquisition as Conforma is a
    development-stage company. As a result of the acquisition, we
    obtained the rights to two compounds in Phase I clinical
    trials: CNF1010, a proprietary form of the geldanamycin
    derivative

17-AAG;

and
    CNF2024, a totally synthetic, orally bioavailable heat shock
    protein 90 inhibitor.

The results of operations of Conforma are included from the date
    of acquisition. We have completed our purchase price allocation
    for the acquisition as set out below (in millions):

The amount allocated to IPR&D relates to the development of
    CNF2024, which is in Phase I clinical trials. Since the
    acquisition in June of 2006, we have incurred $4.2 million
    in research and development costs. We expect to incur
    approximately an additional $116 million to complete the
    development of CNF2024. The estimated revenues from CNF2024, if
    any, are expected to be recognized beginning in 2011. A discount
    rate of 12% was used to value the project, which we believe to
    be commensurate with the stage of development and the
    uncertainties in the economic estimates described above. At the
    date of acquisition, this compound had not reached technological
    feasibility and had no alternative future use. Accordingly, the
    $123.1 million in IPR&D was expensed in 2006.

Upon acquisition, we recognized a deferred tax asset of
    $24.0 million relating to US federal and state net
    operating losses and tax credit carryforwards that we acquired
    from Conforma. The amount allocated to deferred tax assets does
    not include certain tax attributes, such as net operating losses
    and research credits, that may not be

realized because they are subject to annual limitations under
    the Internal Revenue Code due to a cumulative ownership change
    of more than 50% which occurred in connection with our
    acquisition of Conforma.

Future contingent consideration payments, if any, will be
    expensed to research and development expenses.

In connection with this asset purchase, approximately
    $1.2 million of severance costs were incurred and are
    recorded in the consolidated statement of income. (See
    Note 21, Severance and Other Restructuring Costs).

The historical financial results of the acquisition for the year
    ended December 31, 2005 and the six months ended
    June 30, 2006 were not material for comparative purposes.

Fumedica
    Agreements

On December 22, 2006, we entered into an agreement with
    Fumedica. Fumedica is a privately held pharmaceutical company
    based in Germany and Switzerland that maintains distribution
    rights to FUMADERM and to whom we were contingently obligated to
    make royalty payments with respect to a successful launch of

BG-12

for
    psoriasis in Germany. Fumedica had the rights to distribute
    FUMADERM in Germany through April 2009. Under the terms of the
    agreement, we have obtained all distribution and marketing
    rights to FUMADERM effective May 2007. In addition, we had
    entered into a contingent royalty agreement with Fumedica in
    2004. At the present time no royalty payments are due under the
    agreement. Under the terms of the agreement, we will not be
    required to make any royalty payments to Fumedica if BG-12 is
    successfully launched for psoriasis in Germany.

In connection with this transaction, we committed to total
    payments of 61.4 million Swiss Francs ($50.5 million),
    which will be paid to Fumedica in varying amounts from June 2008
    through June 2018. The present value of these payments is
    $39.2 million. The fair value of the acquired FUMADERM
    distribution rights was approximately $11.1 million. This
    amount has been capitalized and included in intangible assets
    and will be amortized over approximately two years beginning in
    May 2007, based on the remaining term of the distribution
    agreement. The fair value of terminating the agreement requiring
    us to pay royalties upon the successful launch of BG-12 for
    psoriasis in Germany was approximately $28.1 million. This
    amount has been expensed as it relates to a product that has not
    reached technological feasibility.

The present value of the payments due under the agreements will
    be accreted to future value at an interest rate of 5.75%, our
    current incremental borrowing rate.

Acquisition
    of Syntonix Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

As discussed in Note 26, Subsequent Events, in January
    2007, we acquired Syntonix Pharmaceuticals Inc., or Syntonix, a
    privately held biopharmaceutical company based in Waltham,
    Massachusetts.

Financial
    Instruments

Financial instruments that potentially subject us to
    concentrations of credit risk are accounts receivable and
    marketable securities. Wholesale distributors and large
    pharmaceutical companies account for the majority of our
    accounts receivable and collateral is generally not required
    from these customers. To mitigate credit risk, we monitor the
    financial performance and credit worthiness of our customers.

Unrealized losses relate to various debt securities, including
    U.S. government issues, corporate bonds and asset-backed
    securities. The unrealized losses on these securities at
    December 31, 2006 were primarily caused by higher interest
    rates. We believe that these unrealized losses are not

other-than-temporary,

and have the intent and ability to hold these securities with
    unrealized losses to maturity or to recovery.

In 2005 and 2004, we recognized charges of $3.1 million and
    $5.7 million, respectively, for certain unrealized losses
    on

available-for-sale

securities that were determined to be

other-than-temporary.

No charges were recognized in 2006.

Strategic
    Investments

In 2006, 2005, and 2004 we recognized $30.5 million,
    $13.8 million, and $12.7 million in charges,
    respectively, for the impairment of investments that were
    determined to be

other-than-temporary

following a decline in value of the strategic investment.

Non-Marketable
    Securities

We hold other investments in equity securities of certain
    privately held biotechnology companies or biotechnology oriented
    venture capital funds. The cost of these strategic investments
    at December 31, 2006 and 2005 is $32.6 million and
    $25.8 million, respectively. In 2006 and 2005, we recorded
    $3.9 million and $1.6 million, respectively, in
    charges for the impairment of investments that were determined
    to be

other-than-temporary.

Additionally, in 2006, we recorded gains of $1.0 million on
    these investments. There were no gains in 2005 and 2004.

Forward
    Contracts

We have foreign currency forward contracts to hedge specific
    forecasted transactions denominated in foreign currencies. All
    foreign currency forward contracts in effect at
    December 31, 2006 had durations of 3 to 12 months.
    These contracts have been designated as cash flow hedges and
    accordingly, to the extent effective, any unrealized gains or
    losses on these foreign currency forward contracts are reported
    in other comprehensive income (loss). Realized gains and losses
    for the effective portion are recognized with the underlying
    hedge transaction. We assess hedge ineffectiveness on a
    quarterly basis and record the gain or loss related to the
    ineffective portion to current earnings to the extent
    significant. If we determine that a forecasted transaction is no
    longer probable of occurring, we discontinue hedge accounting
    for the affected portion of the hedge instrument and any related
    unrealized gain or loss on the contract is recognized in current
    earnings.

The notional settlement amount of the foreign currency forward
    contracts outstanding at December 31, 2006 was
    approximately $293.2 million. These contracts had a fair
    value of $0.2 million, representing an unrealized loss,

    IDEC INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

and was included in other current liabilities at
    December 31, 2006. The notional settlement amount of the
    foreign currency forward contracts outstanding at
    December 31, 2005 was approximately $214.0 million.
    These contracts had a fair value of $0.9 million,
    representing an unrealized loss, and were included in other
    current liabilities at December 31, 2005.

In 2006, we recognized $0.6 million of losses in earnings
    due to hedge ineffectiveness and $0.9 million of losses as
    a result of the discontinuance of cash flow hedge accounting
    because it was no longer probable that the hedge forecasted
    transaction would occur. We recognized $11.2 million of
    losses in product revenue for the settlement of certain
    effective cash flow hedge instruments at December 31, 2006.
    These settlements were recorded in the same period as the
    related forecasted transactions affecting earnings. We expect
    approximately $0.2 million of unrealized losses at
    December 31, 2006 to affect earnings in 2007 related to our
    foreign currency forward contracts.

In 2005, we recognized $1.0 million of gains in earnings
    due to hedge ineffectiveness and $0.3 million of gains as a
    result of the discontinuance of cash flow hedge accounting
    because it was no longer probable that the hedge forecasted
    transaction would occur. We recognized $0.1 million of
    losses in product revenue and $0.2 million of losses in
    royalty revenue for the settlement of certain effective cash
    flow hedge instruments at December 31, 2005. These
    settlements were recorded in the same period as the related
    forecasted transactions affecting earnings.

In 2004, approximately $0.9 million of losses were
    recognized in earnings due to hedge ineffectiveness. We
    recognized $5.5 million of losses in product revenue and
    $0.5 million of losses in royalty revenue for the
    settlement of certain effective cash flow hedge instruments at
    December 31, 2004. These settlements were recorded in the
    same period as the related forecasted transactions affecting
    earnings.

Share-based

Share-based
    compensation expense

For 2006, we recorded pre-tax share-based compensation expense
    of $126.8 million. The expense for the year is net of a
    cumulative effect pre-tax adjustment of $5.6 million, or
    $3.8 million after-tax, resulting from the application of
    an estimated forfeiture rate for prior period unvested
    restricted stock awards.

As a result of adopting SFAS 123(R) on January 1,
    2006, our net income before taxes was $47.9 million lower
    than if we had continued to account for stock-based employee
    compensation under APB 25. Basic and diluted earnings per
    share were both lower by $0.14.

For 2006, we capitalized total costs of $3.3 million
    associated with share-based compensation costs to inventory and
    fixed assets. We did not capitalize share-based compensation
    cost in our pro forma footnotes under SFAS 123(R). For
    2005, we recorded share-based compensation expense of
    approximately $36.9 million, which was due, principally, to
    expenses for restricted stock awards and performance-based
    restricted stock units.

In accordance with SFAS 123(R), windfall tax benefits from
    stock option exercises of $31.7 million were recorded as
    cash inflows from financing activities in our consolidated
    statement of cash flows for 2006. This amount has been
    calculated in accordance with the alternative transition method
    described in FSP FAS 123(R) — 3, which we adopted
    effective the fourth quarter of 2006.

The total amount of tax benefit realized during 2006 was
    $42.8 million. Cash received from the exercise of stock
    options in 2006 was approximately $131.8 million.

At December 31, 2006, unrecognized compensation costs
    relating to unvested share-based compensation was approximately
    $117.7 million. We expect to recognize the cost of these
    unvested awards over a weighted-average

period of one year. In accordance with SFAS 123(R),
    deferred share-based compensation is no longer reflected as a
    separate component of shareholders’ equity in the
    consolidated balance sheet. As a result, we reclassified our
    deferred share-based compensation of $42.9 million at
    December 31, 2005 to additional paid in capital during the
    first quarter of 2006.

Share-based
    Compensation Plans

We have three share-based compensation plans pursuant to which
    awards are currently being made: (i) our 2006 Non-Employee
    Directors Equity Plan, or the 2006 Directors Plan;
    (ii) our 2005 Omnibus Equity Plan, or the 2005 Omnibus

    ESPP. We have four share-based compensation plans pursuant to
    which outstanding awards have been made, but from which no
    further awards can or will be made: (i) our 1993
    Non-Employee Directors Stock Option Plan, or the

    (iii) the Biogen, Inc. 1985 Non-Qualified Stock Option

    or the 2003 Omnibus Plan, pursuant to which outstanding awards
    have been made. We have not made any awards from the 2003
    Omnibus Plan since our stockholders approved the 2005 Omnibus
    Plan and do not intend to make any awards from the 2003 Omnibus
    Plan in the future.

Directors Plan:

In May 2006, our stockholders
    approved the 2006 Directors Plan for share-based awards to
    our directors. Awards granted from the 2006 Directors Plan
    may include options, shares of restricted stock, restricted
    stock units, stock appreciation rights and other awards in such
    amounts and with such terms and conditions as may be determined
    by a committee of our Board of Directors, subject to the
    provisions of the plan. We have reserved a total of
    850,000 shares of common stock for issuance under the
    2006 Directors Plan. The 2006 Directors Plan provides
    that awards other than stock options and stock appreciation
    rights will be counted against the total number of shares
    reserved under the plan in a

1.5-to-1

ratio.

Omnibus Plans:

In June 2005, our stockholders
    approved the 2005 Omnibus Plan for share-based awards to our
    employees. Awards granted from the 2005 Omnibus Plan may include
    options, shares of restricted stock, restricted stock units,
    performance shares, shares of phantom stock, stock bonuses,
    stock appreciation rights and other awards in such amounts and
    with such terms and conditions as may be determined by a
    committee of our Board of Directors, subject to the provisions
    of the plan. Shares of common stock available for issuance under
    the 2005 Omnibus Plan consist of 15.0 million shares
    reserved for this purpose, plus shares of common stock that
    remained available for issuance under the 2003 Omnibus Plan on
    the date that our stockholders approved the 2005 Omnibus Plan,
    plus shares that are subject to awards under the 2003 Omnibus
    Plan which remain unissued upon the cancellation, surrender,
    exchange or termination of such awards. The 2005 Omnibus Plan
    provides that awards other than stock options and stock
    appreciation rights will be counted against the total number of
    shares available under the plan in a

1.5-to-1

ratio.

Stock
    options

All stock option grants to employees are for a ten-year term and
    generally vest one-fourth per year over four years on the
    anniversary of the date of grant, provided the employee remains
    continuously employed with us. Stock option grants to directors
    are for ten-year terms and generally vest as follows:
    (i) grants made on the date of a director’s initial
    election to our Board of Directors vest one-third per year over
    three years on the anniversary of the date of grant, and
    (ii) grants made for service on our Board of Directors vest
    on the first anniversary of the date of grant, provided in each
    case that the director continues to serve on our Board of
    Directors through the vesting date. Options granted under all
    plans are exercisable at a price per share not less than the
    fair market value of the underlying common stock on the date of
    grant. The estimated fair value of options, including the effect
    of estimated forfeitures, is recognized over the options’
    vesting periods. The fair value of the stock option grants
    awarded in

2006 was estimated as of the date of grant using a Black-Scholes

Risk-free interest rate

Expected volatility is based primarily upon implied volatility
    for our exchange-traded options and other factors, including
    historical volatility. After assessing all available information
    on either historical volatility, implied volatility, or both, we
    have concluded that a combination of both historical and implied
    volatility provides the best estimate of expected volatility.
    The expected term of options granted is derived using assumed
    exercise rates based on historical exercise patterns and
    represents the period of time that options granted are expected
    to be outstanding. The risk-free interest rate used is
    determined by the market yield curve based upon risk-free
    interest rates established by the Federal Reserve, or non-coupon
    bonds that have maturities equal to the expected term. The
    dividend yield of zero is based upon the fact that we have not
    historically granted cash dividends, and do not expect to issue
    dividends in the foreseeable future. Stock options granted prior
    to January 1, 2006 were valued based on the grant date fair
    value of those awards, using the Black-Scholes option pricing
    model, as previously calculated for pro-forma disclosures under
    SFAS 123. For 2006, we recorded $43.6 million of stock
    compensation related to stock options.

Time-Vested
    Restricted Stock Units

Time-vested restricted stock units, or RSUs, awarded to
    employees vest one-third per year over three years on the

    continuously employed with us. Shares of our common stock will
    be delivered to the employee upon vesting, subject to payment of
    applicable withholding taxes. Time-vested RSUs awarded to
    directors vest as follows: (i) awards made on the date of a
    director’s initial election to our Board of Directors vest
    one-third per year over three years on the anniversary of the
    date of award, and (ii) awards made for service on our
    Board of Directors vest on the first anniversary of the date of
    award, provided in each case that the director continues to
    serve on our Board of Directors through the vesting date. Shares
    of our common stock will be delivered to the director upon
    vesting. The fair value of all time-vested RSUs is based on the
    market value of our stock on the date of grant. Compensation
    expense, including the effect of forfeitures, is recognized over
    the applicable service period. For 2006, we recorded
    $31.3 million of stock compensation charges related to
    time-vested RSUs.

Performance-Based
    Restricted Stock Units

In the first quarter of 2006, our Board of Directors awarded
    100,000 RSUs to our CEO, under the 2005 Omnibus Plan, subject to
    certain 2006 financial performance criteria. In February 2007,
    our Board of Directors determined that the performance criteria
    had been attained and that 100,000 RSUs would convert into
    shares of our common stock.

During the third quarter of 2005, we granted 1.18 million
    performance-based RSUs, to be settled in shares of our common
    stock, to a group of approximately 200 senior employees
    excluding our CEO. The grants were made under the 2005 Omnibus
    Plan as part of an initiative to retain certain key personnel.
    The RSUs will convert into shares of our common stock, subject
    to attainment of certain performance goals and the
    employee’s continued employment. On September 14,
    2006, 70% of the RSUs for all employees still in active
    employment, or 758,262 shares, vested as the required
    performance goals had been determined to have been achieved. A
    total of 510,859 shares were issued, reflecting the fact
    that certain shares were withheld for income tax purposes.

On March 14, 2007, the remaining 30% of the RSUs will vest
    and convert into shares if the performance goals are attained
    and the employee is still in active employment. Shares of our
    common stock will be delivered to the employee upon vesting,
    subject to payment of applicable withholding taxes. In February
    2007, our Board of Directors determined that approximately 83%
    of these RSUs had been earned.

For 2006, we recorded compensation charges of approximately
    $33.6 million related to performance-based restricted stock
    units. For 2005, we recorded compensation charges of
    approximately $12.7 million, using variable accounting
    under APB 25 because the performance-based goals had not
    yet been met. However, we determined that it was probable that
    the performance-based goals would be met. The fair value of
    these units was based on the market value of our stock on the
    date of grant and assumes that the target payout level will be
    achieved. Compensation cost is adjusted quarterly for subsequent
    changes in the outcome of performance-related conditions until

Restricted
    Stock Awards

In 2005 and 2004, we awarded restricted common stock to our
    employees under the 2005 Omnibus Plan and the 2003 Omnibus Plan
    at no cost to the employees. The restricted stock awards, or
    RSAs, will vest in full on the third anniversary of the date of
    award, provided the employee remains continuously employed with
    us. During the vesting period, the recipient of the restricted
    stock has full voting rights as a stockholder, even though the
    restricted stock remains subject to transfer restrictions and
    will generally be forfeited upon termination of employment by
    the recipient prior to vesting.

For 2006, we recorded $21.9 million of stock compensation
    charges related to restricted stock awards, prior to a first
    quarter pre-tax cumulative effect

catch-up

credit of $5.6 million, or $3.8 million after-tax,
    resulting from the application of an estimated forfeiture rate
    for prior period unvested restricted stock awards. For 2005, we
    recorded $22.6 million of stock compensation charges
    related to the restricted stock. The fair value of all
    time-vested RSAs is based on the market value of our stock on
    the date of grant. Compensation expense, including the effect of
    forfeitures, is recognized over the applicable service period.

ESPP

Under the terms of the ESPP, employees can elect to have up to
    ten percent of their annual compensation (subject to certain
    dollar limits) withheld to purchase shares of our common stock.
    The purchase price of the common stock is equal to 85% of the
    lower of the fair market value of the common stock on the
    enrollment or purchase date under a look-back provision. In June
    2005, our stockholders approved the amendment and restatement of
    the ESPP, including an increase in the number of shares
    available for issuance under the ESPP from 4.2 million to
    6.2 million shares. At December 31, 2006, a total of
    5.4 million shares of our common stock were available for
    issuance. During 2006, 0.5 million shares were issued under
    the ESPP. During 2005 and 2004, 0.6 million and
    0.4 million shares, respectively, were issued under the
    ESPP. We utilize the Black-Scholes model to calculate the fair
    value of these discounted purchases. The fair value of the
    look-back provision plus the 15% discount amount is recognized
    as compensation expense over the purchase period. We apply a
    graded vesting approach because the plan provides for multiple
    purchase periods and is, in substance, a series of linked
    awards. In 2006, we recorded compensation charges of
    approximately $5.2 million.

Cash received under the ESPP in 2006 was approximately
    $15.2 million.

Other

On December 6, 2005, our Board of Directors approved the
    acceleration of vesting of unvested stock options then
    outstanding having an exercise price per share of $55.00 or
    higher, granted under our stock option plans that were held by
    current employees, including executive officers. Shares of
    common stock acquired by our executive officers upon the
    exercise of stock options whose vesting was so accelerated
    generally are subject to transfer restrictions until such time
    as the stock options otherwise would have vested. Options held
    by our non-employee directors were excluded from this vesting
    acceleration. As a result, the vesting of options granted
    predominantly from 2001 to 2005 with respect to approximately
    4,518,809 shares of our common stock was accelerated.

The purpose of this acceleration was to eliminate future
    compensation expense that we would otherwise have recognized in
    our results of operation upon adoption of SFAS 123(R) in
    2006. The approximate future expense eliminated by the
    acceleration, based on a Black-Scholes calculation, was
    estimated to be approximately $93.1 million between 2006
    and 2009 on a pre-tax basis. The acceleration did not result in
    any compensation expense being recorded in 2005.

Senior
    notes

In April and May 2002, we raised, through the issuance of our
    senior notes, approximately $696 million. The amount was
    net of underwriting commissions and expenses of
    $18.4 million. The senior notes are zero coupon and were
    priced with a yield to maturity of 1.75% annually. On
    April 29, 2005, holders of 99.2% of the outstanding senior
    notes exercised their right under the indenture governing the
    senior notes to require us to repurchase their senior notes. On
    May 2, 2005, we paid $746.4 million in cash to
    repurchase those senior notes. The purchased senior notes had an
    aggregate principal amount at maturity of approximately
    $1.2 billion. The purchase price for the senior notes was
    $624.73 in cash per $1,000 principal amount at maturity, and was
    based on the requirements of the indenture and the senior notes.
    Additionally, we made a cash payment in 2005 of approximately
    $62 million for the payment of tax related to additional
    deductible interest expense for which deferred tax liabilities
    had been previously established. As of December 31, 2006,
    our remaining indebtedness under the senior notes was
    $10.2 million at maturity.

Subordinated
    notes

In February 1999, we raised through the issuance of our
    subordinated notes, approximately $113 million, net of
    underwriting commissions and expenses of $3.9 million. The
    subordinated notes are zero coupon and were priced with a yield
    to maturity of 5.5% annually. At December 31, 2006, our
    remaining indebtedness under the subordinated notes was
    $75.4 million at maturity, due to conversion of
    subordinated notes into common stock.

Each $1,000 aggregate principal face value subordinated note is
    convertible at the holder’s option at any time through
    maturity into 40.404 shares of our common stock at an
    initial conversion price of $8.36 per share. During 2005,
    holders of the subordinated notes with a face value of
    approximately $143.8 million elected to convert their
    subordinated notes to approximately 5.8 million shares of
    our common stock. The remaining holders of the subordinated
    notes may require us to purchase the subordinated notes on
    February 16, 2009 or 2014 at a price equal to the issue
    price plus accrued original issue discount to the date of
    purchase with us having the option to repay the subordinated
    notes plus accrued original issue discount in cash, common stock
    or a combination of cash and stock. We have the right to redeem
    at a price equal to the issue price plus the accrued original
    issue discount to the date of redemption all or a portion of the
    subordinated notes for cash at any time.

Biogen-Dompe

In October 2006, Biogen-Dompe SRL, or the joint venture, a

    Dompé Farmaceutici SpA, or Dompé, at a rate of
    3 month LIBOR plus 25 basis points. The interest rate
    is reset quarterly and payable quarterly in arrears. As of
    December 31, 2006, the balance of the joint venture loan
    was 18 million Euros ($23.8 million), half of which
    has been eliminated as it is an intercompany loan for purposes
    of presenting our consolidated financial position. Borrowings
    are to be made equally between the partners, and any repayments
    are to be paid in a similar manner. The

Intangibles,
    other than Goodwill

In 2006, core/developed technology increased by
    $26.4 million as a result of the acquisition of Fumapharm.
    The assembled workforce intangible asset increased
    $1.4 million as a result of the acquisition of Conforma and
    we obtained $11.1 million of distribution rights in
    connection with the buy out of an agreement with Fumedica. See
    Note 2, Acquisitions and Other Agreements, for further
    discussion of these transactions.

During 2005, we recorded impairment charges of $7.9 million
    related to certain core technology and related to AVONEX in
    Japan and $5.7 million related to ZEVALIN patents. The
    AVONEX charge arose as a result of our decision to terminate
    certain clinical trials. As a result of the annual impairment
    analysis, the ZEVALIN patents were determined to be impaired. In
    both cases the charge reduced our carrying value to estimated
    net realizable value and was recorded as additional amortization
    expense.

During 2004, we recorded a charge of approximately
    $27.8 million related to certain core technology assets
    related to AMEVIVE. The charge arose form our decision to
    discontinue certain clinical trials. The charge reduced our
    carrying value to estimated net realizable value of acquired
    intangible assets and was recorded as additional amortization
    expense.

Amortization expense was $267.0 million,
    $302.3 million and $347.7 million for 2006, 2005 and
    2004, respectively.

Amortization on intangible assets is expected to be in the range
    of approximately $236.5 million to $310.9 million for
    each of the next five years.

Goodwill

Goodwill increased $18.5 million in 2006, due to the
    acquisition of Fumapharm in the second quarter. During the
    second quarter of 2006, we also recorded an increase to goodwill
    of $5.4 million to correct reserves for product returns at
    the time of the Merger in 2003. See discussion of our revenue
    recognition policy in Note 1, Business Overview and Summary
    of Significant Accounting Policies, for additional discussion of
    this adjustment.

During 2005, we reduced goodwill by $20.7 million for the
    impact of certain assessments from the Internal Revenue Service
    (See Note 14, Income Taxes).

During 2006 and 2005, we capitalized to construction in progress
    approximately $2.1 million and $8.4 million,
    respectively, of interest costs primarily related to the
    development of our West Coast headquarters and research and
    development campus in San Diego, California, our
    large-scale manufacturing facility in Oceanside, California, a
    research facility in Cambridge, Massachusetts and our
    large-scale biologic manufacturing facility in Hillerod, Denmark.

At December 31, 2006, $253.6 million of the
    construction in progress balance was related to construction of
    Hillerod, Denmark. The first phase is nearly complete and
    involved the construction of an administrative building, a label
    and pack facility, a lab facility, and a facility to provide
    utilities to the Hillerod campus. The administrative building is
    in use, and the label and packaging facility and lab facility
    are expected to be put into use in the first quarter of 2007.
    The utilities facility will be in partial use in the first
    quarter of 2007. The second phase of the project involves
    construction of a large-scale manufacturing facility, and is
    expected to be completed in 2008. The utilities facility is
    expected to be in full use upon completion of the second phase.

Employee
    Benefit Plans

401(k)
    Employee Savings Plan

We maintain a 401(k) Savings Plan, or 401(k) Plan, which is
    available to substantially all U.S. regular employees over
    the age of 21. Participants may make voluntary contributions. We
    make matching contributions according to the 401(k) Plan’s
    matching formula. The matching contributions vest over four
    years of service by the employee. The 401(k) Plan also provides
    for certain transition contributions on behalf of participants
    who previously participated in the Biogen, Inc. Retirement Plan.
    Employer contributions for 2006, 2005 and 2004 totaled
    $12.0 million, $16.8 million and $11.4 million,
    respectively.

Deferred
    Compensation Plan

We maintain a non-qualified deferred compensation plan that
    allows a select group of management and highly compensated
    U.S. employees to defer a portion of their compensation and
    that provides for certain company credits to participants’
    accounts. This arrangement is known as the Voluntary Executive
    Supplemental Savings Plan, or Savings Plan. The deferred
    compensation amounts are accrued when earned but are unfunded.
    Such deferred compensation is distributable in cash in
    accordance with the rules of the Savings Plan. Deferred
    compensation amounts under such plan at December 31, 2006
    and 2005, totaled approximately $47.8 million and
    $44.1 million, respectively, and are included in other
    long-term liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance
    sheets. Participant contributions vest immediately. Certain
    employer credits to participants’ accounts are subject to
    vesting schedules. Distributions to participants can be either
    in one lump sum payment or annual installments as elected by the
    participants.

Retiree
    Medical Plan

In 2003, we began to provide medical plan benefits to retirees
    under the age of 65. Our obligation, which is unfunded, was
    $6.8 million and $4.3 million at December 31,
    2006 and 2005, respectively. Net periodic benefit cost for 2006,
    2005 and 2004, was $1.4, million, $2.0 million and
    $1.8 million respectively, the majority of which related to
    service cost. Our liability at December 31, 2006 and 2005
    related to this benefit arrangement was approximately
    $6.8 million and $4.3 million, respectively.

Pension
    Plan

We currently maintain two retiree benefit plans: a Supplemental
    Employee Retirement Plan; and a defined benefit plan for certain
    employees in Germany. Additionally, through 2004, we maintained
    the Biogen, Inc.

    terminated during 2004.

The obligations under the remaining plans totaled
    $4.9 million and $3.7 million at December 31,
    2006 and 2005, respectively.

Net periodic pension cost for 2006, 2005 and 2004 was
    $1.2 million, $1.0 million and $1.1 million,
    respectively. The net periodic pension expense for 2004 included
    $3.0 million related to the cost of plan curtailment and
    termination of the Biogen Retirement Plan. The majority of the
    remaining net period pension cost related to service cost.

At December 31, 2006, we had net operating losses and
    general business credit carryforwards for federal income tax
    purposes of approximately $50 million and $1 million,
    respectively, which expire in 2021 and 2020, respectively.
    Additionally, for state income tax purposes, we had net
    operating losses and research credit carry forwards of
    approximately $49 million and $2 million,
    respectively, neither of which have prescribed expiration dates.

In assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets, we
    have considered whether it is more likely than not that some
    portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
    The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent
    upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods
    in which those temporary differences become deductible. In
    making this determination, under the applicable financial
    reporting standards, we are allowed to consider the scheduled
    reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable
    income, and tax planning strategies. Our estimates of future
    taxable income take into consideration, among other items, our
    estimates of future income tax deductions related to the
    exercise of stock options. Based upon the level of historical
    taxable income and income tax liability and projections for
    future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax
    assets are utilizable, we believe it is more likely than not
    that we will realize the benefits of our entire deferred tax
    assets. In the event that actual results differ from our
    estimates or we adjust our estimates in future periods, we may
    need to establish a valuation allowance, which could materially
    impact our financial position and results of operations.

As of December 31, 2006, undistributed foreign earnings of

non-U.S. subsidiaries

included in consolidated retained earnings aggregated
    approximately $798 million, exclusive of earnings that
    would result in little or no net income tax expense under
    current U.S. tax law. We intend to reinvest these earnings
    indefinitely in operations outside the U.S. It is not
    practicable to estimate the amount of additional tax that might
    be payable if such earnings were remitted to the U.S.

On October 22, 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act of
    2004, or the Act, was signed into law. The Act created a
    temporary incentive, which expired on December 31, 2005,
    for U.S. multinational companies to repatriate accumulated
    income earned outside the U.S. at an effective tax rate
    that could be as low as 5.25%. On December 21, 2004, the
    FASB issued FASB staff position

109-2,

Accounting and Disclosure Guidance for the Foreign Earnings
    Repatriation Provision within the American Jobs Creation Act of

, or FSP

FSP

allowed companies additional time to evaluate the effect of the
    law on whether unrepatriated foreign earnings continue to
    qualify for the SFAS 109 exception to recognizing deferred
    tax liabilities. A total distribution of $196 million was
    made by one of our foreign subsidiaries to one of our
    U.S. subsidiaries in December 2005. We incurred a charge to

our consolidated results of operations of approximately
    $11.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2005 for the tax
    cost related to the distribution.

IRS
    Settlement

During the fourth quarter of 2005, the Internal Revenue Service,
    or IRS, completed its examination of legacy Biogen, Inc.’s,
    now Biogen Idec MA Inc.’s, consolidated federal income tax
    returns for the fiscal years 2001 and 2002 and issued an
    assessment. We subsequently paid the majority of the amounts
    assessed and are appealing one issue. As a result of this and
    other income tax audit activity, Biogen Idec MA Inc. reassessed
    its liability for income tax contingencies to reflect the IRS
    findings and recorded a $13.8 million reduction in these
    liabilities during the fourth quarter of 2005. The corresponding
    effects of the adjustments to the liability for income tax
    contingencies through 2004 resulted in a reduction in goodwill
    of $20.7 million for amounts related to periods prior to
    the Merger and an increase in income tax expense associated with
    continuing operations of $6.9 million.

Contingency

On September 12, 2006, we received a Notice of Assessment
    from the Massachusetts Department of Revenue for
    $38.9 million, including penalties and interest, with
    respect to the 2001, 2002 and 2003 tax years. We believe that we
    have meritorious defenses to the proposed adjustment and will
    vigorously oppose the assessment. We believe that the assessment
    does not impact the level of our liabilities for income tax
    contingencies. However, there is a possibility that we may not
    prevail in all of our assertions. If this is resolved
    unfavorably in the future based on facts and conditions
    currently not available to us, this could have a material impact
    on our future effective tax rate and our results of operations
    in the period in which an event would occur.

Research
    Collaborations and Strategic Investments

In connection with our research and development efforts, we have
    entered into various collaboration arrangements which provide us
    with rights to develop, produce and market products using
    certain know-how, technology and patent rights maintained by the
    parties. Terms of the various license agreements may require us
    to make milestone payments upon the achievement of certain
    product development objectives and pay royalties on future
    sales, if any, of commercial products resulting from the
    collaboration.

mondo

On September 14, 2006, we entered into an exclusive
    collaboration and license agreement with mondoBIOTECH, AG, or
    mondo, a private Swiss biotechnology company, to develop,
    manufacture and commercialize Aviptadil, a clinical compound for
    the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension, or PAH. In
    accordance with the agreement, we will be responsible for the
    global manufacturing, clinical development, regulatory approval
    and commercialization of Aviptadil. We intend to finalize the
    development plan for Aviptadil and initiate additional clinical
    work in 2007.

Under the terms of the agreement, we paid mondo a
    $7.5 million upfront payment and will pay up to
    $30.0 million in milestones payments for successful
    development and commercialization of Aviptadil in PAH in the
    U.S. and Europe, as well as royalty payments on commercial
    sales. The $7.5 million upfront amount has been recorded as
    research and development expense in 2006.

Additionally, we have indicated our intention to make a minority
    equity investment of $5.0 million in mondo in the event
    that it undertakes an initial public offering.

We paid Alnylam an upfront payment of $5.0 million and
    agreed to additional payments of up to $51.3 million in
    milestone payments, plus royalties in the event of successful
    development and utilization of any product resulting from the
    collaboration. The $5.0 million upfront payment has been

    trials next year.

Under terms of the agreement, we paid UCB an upfront payment of
    $30.0 million and agreed to make development milestone
    payments to UCB for the first indication of up to
    $93.0 million, with total milestone payments of up to
    $71.3 million payable for any additional indications. We
    will also pay UCB up to $75.0 million in commercialization
    milestones and will contribute significantly to clinical costs
    for Phase II and Phase III studies. All
    commercialization costs and profits will be shared equally. The
    $30.0 million upfront payment has been recorded as research
    and development expense in 2006.

PDL

In August 2005, we entered in a collaborative agreement with PDL
    BioPharma, Inc., or PDL, for the joint development, manufacture
    and commercialization of three Phase II antibody products.
    Under this agreement, Biogen Idec and PDL will share in the
    development and commercialization of daclizumab in MS and
    indications other than transplant and respiratory diseases, and
    the development and commercialization of M200 (volociximab) and
    HuZAF (fontolizumab) in all indications. Fontolizumab was
    discontinued during 2006. Both companies will share equally the
    costs of all development activities and all operating profits
    from each collaboration product within the U.S. and Europe. We
    paid PDL a non-refundable upfront licensing fee of
    $40.0 million, which we concluded had no alternative future
    uses and was therefore included in research and development
    expenses in 2005. We also accrued $10.0 million in research
    and development expense in 2005 for future payments that were
    determined to be unavoidable. The terms of the collaborative
    agreement require us to make certain development and
    commercialization milestone payments upon the achievement of
    certain program objectives totaling up to $660.0 million
    over the life of the agreement, of which $560.0 million
    relates to development and $100.0 million relates to the
    commercialization of collaboration products.

In addition to the collaborative agreement, we purchased
    approximately $100.0 million of common stock, or 3.5% of
    its common stock, from PDL. We recorded an impairment charge of
    $18.3 million during 2006 to reflect an other than
    temporary impairment in the value of the stock we own.

Sunesis

In December 2002, Biogen, Inc. entered into a collaboration
    agreement with Sunesis Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Sunesis,
    related to the discovery and development of oral therapeutics
    for the treatment of inflammatory and

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

autoimmune diseases. In August 2004, we entered into a
    collaborative agreement with Sunesis to discover and develop
    small molecule cancer therapeutics targeting primarily kinases.
    Under the agreement, we acquired exclusive licenses to develop
    and commercialize certain compounds resulting from the
    collaboration. Upon signing the agreement, we paid Sunesis a
    non-refundable upfront license fee of $7.0 million, which
    was recorded in research and development expenses in 2004.
    During 2005, we recorded $1.0 million to research and
    development expense for milestones achieved through the
    collaboration with Sunesis, of which $0.5 million was paid
    to Sunesis in 2005.

We have committed to paying Sunesis additional amounts upon the
    completion of certain future research milestones and first and
    second indication development milestones. If all the milestones
    were to be achieved based on our plan of research, we would be
    required to pay up to an additional $302.0 million to
    Sunesis, excluding royalties.

Under the terms of the agreements, we purchased approximately
    4.2 million shares of preferred stock of Sunesis for
    $20.0 million and, in September 2005, we purchased
    $5.0 million of common stock of Sunesis as part of their
    initial public offering, or IPO. At the time of the IPO our
    preferred stock was converted into shares of Sunesis common
    stock and, based on the IPO valuation, we wrote-down the value
    of our investment in Sunesis by $4.6 million as we had
    determined that the impairment was other than temporary.

Following the IPO, we own approximately 2.9 million shares,
    or 9.9% of the common stock. We recorded an impairment charge of
    $7.2 million during 2006 to reflect an other than temporary
    impairment in the value of the stock we own.

Vernalis

In June 2004, we entered into a collaborative research and
    development agreement with Vernalis plc, or Vernalis, aimed at
    advancing research into Vernalis’ adenosine A2A receptor
    antagonist program, which targets Parkinson’s disease and
    other central nervous system disorders. Under the agreement, we
    received exclusive worldwide rights to develop and commercialize
    Vernalis’ lead compound, BIIB014, formerly V2006. We paid
    Vernalis an initial license fee of $10.0 million in July
    2004, which was recorded in research and development expenses in
    the second quarter of 2004. Terms of the collaborative agreement
    may require us to make milestone payments upon the achievement
    of certain program objectives and pay royalties on future sales,
    if any, of commercial products resulting from the collaboration.
    In June 2004, we made an investment of $5.5 million through
    subscription for approximately 6.2 million new Vernalis
    common shares, representing 4.19% of Vernalis’
    post-financing issued share capital, and committed to purchase
    an additional $4.0 million in the event of future Vernalis
    financing. In March 2005, we purchased approximately
    1.4 million additional shares under a qualified offering
    for $1.8 million, which fully satisfies our investment
    obligation to Vernalis. We now hold a total of approximately
    7.6 million shares of Vernalis, representing 2.4% of total
    shares outstanding. Our investment in Vernalis is included in
    investments and other assets and has a fair value of
    $9.3 million at December 31, 2006. We account for our
    investment in Vernalis using the cost method of accounting,
    subject to periodic review of impairment. We paid development
    milestones of $3.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2006.
    If all the milestones were to be achieved, we would be required
    to pay up to an additional $85.0 million, excluding
    royalties, over the remaining life of the agreement.

MPM

In May 2004, we entered into a limited partnership agreement as
    a limited partner with MPM Bioventures III GP, LP, to
    create MPM Bioventures Strategic Fund, LP, or the Strategic
    Fund. The purpose of the Strategic Fund is to make, manage, and
    supervise investments in biotechnology companies with novel
    products or technologies that fit strategically with Biogen
    Idec. The Strategic Fund takes only minority positions in the
    equity of its investments, and does not seek to engage in

day-to-day

management of the entities. In February 2006, we adjusted our

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

commitment to the Strategic Fund to approximately
    $32 million over a three-year period. Through
    December 31, 2006, we contributed $18.3 million to the
    Strategic Fund.

In April 2004, we became a limited partner in MPM
    Bioventures III-QP, LP, or the LP, a limited partnership
    that invests in entities that are engaged in the research,
    development, manufacture, marketing

and/or

sale
    of novel biological products or technologies. We have committed
    to contribute $4.0 million to the LP. Through
    December 31, 2006, we have contributed $3.4 million
    into the LP, which is included in investments and other assets
    in our consolidated balance sheets.

In February 2006, we became a limited partner in MPM Bioventures
    IV-QP, LP a limited partnership that invests in entities that
    are engaged in the research, development, manufacture, marketing

and/or

sale
    of novel biological products or technologies. We have committed
    to contribute up to $10.0 million to the LP and made an
    initial contribution of $1.0 million to the LP. Through
    December 31, 2006, we have contributed $1.8 million
    into the LP, which is included in investments and other assets
    in our consolidated balance sheets.

In May 2006, we became a limited partner in MPM Bioventures IV-
    Strategic Fund, LP, a limited partnership that invests in
    entities that are engaged in the research, development,
    manufacture, marketing

and/or

sale
    of novel biological products or technologies. We have committed
    to contribute up to $10.0 million to the LP and made an
    initial contribution of $1.1 million to the LP. Through
    December 31, 2006, we have contributed $1.1 million
    into the LP, which is included in investments and other assets
    in our consolidated balance sheets.

Vetter

In August 2003, Biogen, Inc. entered into a collaboration
    agreement with Vetter Pharma-Fertigung GmbH & Co. KG,
    or Vetter, for the fill-finish of our products, including liquid
    AVONEX and TYSABRI. As of December 31, 2006, we have made
    milestone payments to Vetter of 29.8 million euros in
    return for its reserving certain manufacturing capacity for us
    at its fill-finish facility. We have potential remaining
    payments of approximately 5.2 million Euros, which we
    expect to pay upon Vetter’s completion of the final
    milestone in the first quarter of 2007. Under the terms of the
    agreement, the ultimate total payments of 35 million euros
    will reduce payments due on our future purchases of inventory
    from Vetter over a seven-year period. Accordingly, we have
    recorded approximately $6.6 million and $29.0 million
    of these payments in other current assets and in investments and
    other assets, respectively, in our consolidated balance sheets.
    The related portion of the asset will be reclassified to
    inventory when purchases from Vetter are made, and will then be
    recognized as cost of product revenues in our consolidated
    statement of income as the inventory is sold.

Schering

In June 1999, we entered into a collaboration and license
    agreement with Schering AG, aimed at the development and
    commercialization of ZEVALIN. Under the terms of the agreement,
    we may receive milestone and research and development support
    payments totaling up to $47.5 million, subject to the
    attainment of product development objectives. Schering AG
    received exclusive marketing and distribution rights to ZEVALIN
    outside the U.S., and we will continue to receive royalties on
    product sales by Schering AG. Under the terms of a separate
    supply agreement, we are obligated to meet Schering AG’s
    clinical and commercial requirements for ZEVALIN. Schering AG
    may terminate these agreements for any reason. During 2004, we
    recognized revenues from our agreements with Schering AG of
    $10.0 million, which are included in corporate partner
    revenues. Under the above agreement, amounts earned by us and
    recognized as revenue for contract research and development
    approximate the research and development expenses incurred under
    the related agreement.

Targeted

We have no ongoing commitments with respect to Targeted Genetics
    Corporation, or Targeted. In connection with the expired
    agreements, however, we acquired shares of Targeted. At
    December 31, 2006, we own

F-46

    IDEC INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

approximately 2.2 million shares of Targeted’s common
    stock with a fair value of $11.7 million, which are
    included in investments and other assets in our consolidated
    balance sheets. In 2005, we recognized a $9.2 million
    charge for the impairment of our Targeted investment that was
    determined to be

other-than-temporary.

In 2006, we received one million shares of Targeted and
    $0.5 million in cash in exchange for forgiveness of
    $5.7 million of debt owed by Targeted to us. We recorded a
    gain of $3.4 million in respect of the exchange of shares
    and the cash payment for the loan. As a result of the
    transactions, as of December 31, 2006, we owned 19.9% of
    the outstanding shares of Targeted. We account for our
    investment in Targeted using the cost basis. We recorded an
    additional $0.6 million gain related to additional payments
    to which Targeted committed in December 2006.

Unconsolidated
    Joint Business Arrangement

We copromote RITUXAN with Genentech, and share responsibility
    with Genentech for continued development of RITUXAN, in the
    U.S. Such continued development includes conducting
    supportive research and post-approval clinical studies and
    seeking potential approval for additional indications. Genentech
    provides the support functions for the commercialization of
    RITUXAN in the U.S., including marketing, customer service,
    order entry, distribution, shipping and billing, as well as
    fulfilling all worldwide manufacturing responsibilities. We
    share responsibility with Genentech for development in the
    U.S. of any new products developed under the agreement, and
    we will also copromote with Genentech any such new products in
    the U.S.

This collaboration was created through a contractual
    arrangement, not through a joint venture or other legal entity.
    In June 2003, we amended and restated our collaboration
    agreement with Genentech to include the development and
    commercialization of one or more anti-CD20 antibodies targeting
    B-cell disorders, in addition to RITUXAN, for a broad range of
    indications.

Under the amended and restated collaboration agreement, our
    current pretax copromotion profit-sharing formula, which resets
    annually, is as follows:

Copromotion Operating Profits

Biogen Idec’s Share of Copromotion Profits

First $50 million


%

Greater than $50 million


%

In 2006, 2005 and 2004, the 40% threshold was met during the
    first quarter. For each calendar year or portion thereof
    following the approval date of the first new anti-CD20 product,
    the pretax copromotion profit-sharing formula for RITUXAN and
    other anti-CD20 products sold by us and Genentech will change to
    the following:

New Anti-CD20 U.S.

Biogen Idec’s Share

Copromotion Operating Profits

BIOGEN

NOTES TO

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Currently, we record our share of expenses incurred for the
    development of new anti-CD20 products in research and
    development expense until such time as a new product is
    approved, at which time we will record our share of pretax
    copromotion profits related to the new product in revenues from
    unconsolidated joint business. We record our royalty revenue on
    sales of RITUXAN outside the U.S. on a cash basis. Under
    the amended and restated collaboration agreement, we will
    receive lower royalty revenue from Genentech on sales by Roche
    and Zenyaku of new anti-CD20 products, as compared to royalty
    revenue received on sales of RITUXAN. The royalty period with
    respect to all products is 11 years from the first
    commercial sale of such product on a

country-by-country

basis.

The amended and restated collaboration agreement provides that,
    upon the occurrence of a Biogen Idec

change-in-control

as described in the agreement, within 90 days of that
    change-in-control, Genentech may present an offer to us to
    purchase our rights to RITUXAN. We must then accept
    Genentech’s offer or purchase Genentech’s rights to
    RITUXAN for an amount proportioned (using the profit sharing
    ratio between us) to Genentech’s offer. If Genentech
    presents such an offer in such a situation, then Genentech will
    be deemed concurrently to have exercised a right, in exchange
    for a share in the operating profits or net sales in the
    U.S. of any new products developed under the agreement, to
    purchase our interest in each such product. As discussed in
    Note 18, Litigation, Genentech asserted for the first time
    that the November 2003 transaction in which Idec acquired Biogen
    and became Biogen Idec was a change of control of our company
    under the Collaboration Agreement. We strongly disagree that the
    Merger was a change-in-control of our company, but if it was,
    our position is that Genentech’s rights under the
    change-in-control provision in the Collaboration Agreement have
    long since expired.

Concurrent with the original collaboration agreement, we also
    entered into an expression technology license agreement with
    Genentech (for a proprietary gene expression technology
    developed by us) and a preferred stock purchase agreement
    providing for certain equity investments in us by Genentech (see
    Note 19, Shareholders’ Equity).

Under the terms of separate agreements with Genentech,
    commercialization of RITUXAN outside the U.S. is the
    responsibility of Roche, except in Japan where it copromotes
    RITUXAN in collaboration with Zenyaku. We receive royalties from
    Genentech on sales by Roche and Zenyaku of RITUXAN outside the
    U.S., except in Canada. Royalties on sales of RITUXAN in Canada
    are received directly from Roche (and are included in revenues
    from unconsolidated joint business arrangement in the
    accompanying consolidated statements of income). Under our
    amended and restated collaborative agreement with Genentech, we
    will receive lower royalty revenue from Genentech on sales by
    Roche and Zenyaku of new anti-CD20 products and only for the
    first 11 years from the date of first commercial sale of
    such new anti-CD20 products.

Leases

We rent laboratory and office space and certain equipment under
    noncancellable operating leases. The rental expense under these
    leases, which terminate at various dates through 2015, amounted
    to $26.2 million in 2006, $32.2 million in 2005, and
    $35.4 million in 2004. The lease agreements contain various

Construction
    Commitments

In August 2004, we restarted construction of our large-scale
    biologic manufacturing facility in Hillerod, Denmark. In March
    2005, after our voluntary suspension of TYSABRI, we reconsidered
    our construction plans and determined that we would proceed with
    the bulk-manufacturing component of our large-scale biologic
    manufacturing facility in Hillerod, Denmark. Additionally, we
    added a labeling and packaging component to the project. We also
    determined that we would no longer proceed with the fill-finish
    component of that facility. The original cost of the revised
    project was expected to be $372.0 million. As of
    December 31, 2006, we had committed approximately
    $304.4 million to the project, of which $275.3 million
    had been paid. The administrative building is already in use.
    The lab facility and the label and packaging facility were
    substantially completed in 2006 and will be licensed for
    operation in 2007. The second phase of the project, a
    large-scale manufacturing facility, is expected to be completed
    in 2008. In October 2006, our Board of Directors approved the
    second phase of the project, which is expected to cost an
    additional $225 million.

Litigation

On March 2, 2005, we, along with William H. Rastetter, our
    former Executive Chairman, and James C. Mullen, our Chief
    Executive Officer, were named as defendants in a purported class
    action lawsuit, captioned Brown v. Biogen Idec Inc.,
    et al. (“Brown”), filed in the U.S. District
    Court for the District of Massachusetts (the “Court”).
    The complaint alleges violations of Sections 10(b) and
    20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and

Rule 10b-5

promulgated thereunder. The action is purportedly brought on
    behalf of all purchasers of our publicly-

F-49


BIOGEN
    IDEC INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

traded securities between February 18, 2004 and
    February 25, 2005. The plaintiff alleges that the
    defendants made materially false and misleading statements
    regarding potentially serious side effects of TYSABRI in order
    to gain accelerated approval from the FDA for the product’s
    distribution and sale. The plaintiff alleges that these
    materially false and misleading statements harmed the purported
    class by artificially inflating our stock price during the
    purported class period and that company insiders benefited
    personally from the inflated price by selling our stock. The
    plaintiff seeks unspecified damages, as well as interest, costs
    and attorneys’ fees. Substantially similar actions,
    captioned Grill v. Biogen Idec Inc., et al. and
    Lobel v. Biogen Idec Inc., et al., were filed on
    March 10, 2005 and April 21, 2005, respectively, in
    the same court by other purported class representatives. Those
    actions have been consolidated with the Brown case. On
    October 13, 2006, the plaintiffs filed an amended
    consolidated complaint which, among other amendments to the
    allegations, adds as defendants Peter N. Kellogg, our Chief
    Financial Officer, William R. Rohn, our former Chief Operating
    Officer, Burt A. Adelman, our Executive Vice President,
    Portfolio Strategy, and Thomas J. Bucknum, our former General
    Counsel. On November 15, 2006, we and all the other
    defendants who had been served as of that date filed a motion to
    dismiss the amended consolidated complaint. The plaintiffs’
    opposition to our Motion to Dismiss was filed on
    December 18, 2006. We believe that the actions are without
    merit and intend to contest them vigorously. At this early stage
    of litigation, we cannot make any estimate of a potential loss
    or range of loss.

On March 9, 2005, two purported shareholder derivative
    actions, captioned Carmona v. Mullen, et al.
    (“Carmona”) and Fink v. Mullen, et al.
    (“Fink”), were brought in the Superior Court of the
    State of California, County of San Diego (the
    “California Court”), on our behalf, against us as
    nominal defendant, our Board of Directors and our chief
    financial officer. The plaintiffs derivatively claim breach of
    fiduciary duties, abuse of control, gross mismanagement, waste
    of corporate assets and unjust enrichment against all
    defendants. The plaintiffs also derivatively claim insider
    selling in violation of California Corporations Code
    § 25402 and breach of fiduciary duty and
    misappropriation of information against certain defendants who
    sold our securities during the period of February 18, 2004
    to the date of the complaints. The plaintiffs seek unspecified
    damages, treble damages for the purported insider trading in
    violation of California Corporate Code § 25402,
    equitable relief including restriction of the defendants’
    trading proceeds or other assets, restitution, disgorgement and
    costs, including attorneys’ fees and expenses. On
    May 9, 2006, final judgment was entered in favor of the
    defendants. On July 17, 2006, Plaintiffs filed a notice of
    appeal in the California Court to the Court of Appeal, Fourth
    Appellate District, Division 1 (the “Court of
    Appeal”). On November 8, 2006, the plaintiffs filed a
    request for dismissal of the appeal, which the Court of Appeal
    allowed on November 13, 2006. Since this matter is now
    concluded, we will no longer include disclosure of this case in
    future reports.

On April 21, 2005, we received a formal order of
    investigation from the Boston District Office of the SEC. The
    SEC is investigating whether any violations of the federal
    securities laws occurred in connection with the suspension of
    marketing and commercial distribution of TYSABRI. We have
    cooperated fully with the SEC in this investigation. We are
    unable to predict the outcome of this investigation or the
    timing of its resolution at this time.

On June 9, 2005, we, along with numerous other companies,
    received a request for information from the U.S. Senate
    Committee on Finance, or the Committee, concerning the
    Committee’s review of issues relating to the Medicare and
    Medicaid programs’ coverage of prescription drug benefits.
    On January 9, 2006, we, along with numerous other
    companies, received a further request for information from the
    Committee. We filed a timely response to the request on
    March 6, 2006 and are cooperating fully with the
    Committee’s information requests. We are unable to predict
    the outcome of this review or the timing of its resolution at
    this time.

On October 4, 2004, Genentech Inc. received a subpoena from
    the U.S. Department of Justice requesting documents related
    to the promotion of RITUXAN. We market RITUXAN in the
    U.S. in collaboration with Genentech. Genentech has
    disclosed that it is cooperating with the associated
    investigation which they disclosed that they have been advised
    is both civil and criminal in nature. Genentech has reported
    further that the government has called and is expected to call
    former and current Genentech employees to appear before a grand
    jury in

connection with this investigation. We are cooperating with the
    U.S. Department of Justice in its investigation of
    Genentech. The potential outcome of this matter and its impact
    on us cannot be determined at this time.

Along with several other major pharmaceutical and biotechnology
    companies, Biogen, Inc. (now Biogen Idec MA, Inc., one of our
    wholly-owned subsidiaries) or, in certain cases, Biogen Idec
    Inc., was named as a defendant in lawsuits filed by the City of
    New York and numerous Counties of the State of New York. All of
    the cases, except for the County of Erie, County of Nassau,
    County of Oswego and County of Schenectady, are the subject of a
    Consolidated Complaint (“Consolidated Complaint”),
    which was filed on June 15, 2005 in U.S. District
    Court for the District of Massachusetts in Multi-District
    Litigation No. 1456. The County of Nassau, which originally
    filed its complaint on November 24, 2004, filed an amended
    complaint on March 24, 2005 and that case is also pending
    in the U.S. District Court for the District of
    Massachusetts. The County of Erie, County of Oswego and County
    of Schenectady cases have been removed and conditionally
    transferred to the U.S. District Court for the District of
    Massachusetts, and are currently subject to motions to remand
    and oppositions to the conditional transfer.

All of the complaints allege that the defendants
    (i) fraudulently reported the Average Wholesale Price for
    certain drugs for which Medicaid provides reimbursement, also
    referred to as Covered Drugs; (ii) marketed and promoted
    the sale of Covered Drugs to providers based on the
    providers’ ability to collect inflated payments from the
    government and Medicaid beneficiaries that exceeded payments
    possible for competing drugs; (iii) provided financing
    incentives to providers to over-prescribe Covered Drugs or to
    prescribe Covered Drugs in place of competing drugs; and
    (iv) overcharged Medicaid for illegally inflated Covered
    Drugs reimbursements. The complaints allege violations of New
    York state law and advance common law claims for unfair trade
    practices, fraud, and unjust enrichment. In addition, the
    Consolidated Complaint and County of Nassau complaint allege
    that the defendants failed to accurately report the “best
    price” on the Covered Drugs to the Secretary of Health and
    Human Services pursuant to rebate agreements entered into with
    the Secretary of Health and Human Services, and excluded from
    their reporting certain drugs offered at discounts and other
    rebates that would have reduced the “best price.” We,
    along with the other defendants, have filed motions to dismiss
    the Consolidated Complaint and the complaint by the County of
    Nassau. These motions are currently pending. Biogen Idec has
    answered the complaints filed by the Counties of Erie, Oswego
    and Schenectady. Biogen Idec intends to defend itself vigorously
    against all of the allegations and claims in these lawsuits. At
    this stage of the litigation, we cannot make any estimate of a
    potential loss or range of loss.

We, along with several other major pharmaceutical and
    biotechnology companies, were also named as a defendant in a
    lawsuit filed by the Attorney General of Arizona. The lawsuit
    was filed in the Superior Court of the State of Arizona on
    December 6, 2005. The complaint alleges that the defendants
    fraudulently reported the Average Wholesale Price for certain
    drugs covered by the State of Arizona’s Medicare and
    Medicaid programs, and marketed these drugs to providers based
    on the providers’ ability to collect inflated payments from
    the government and other third-party payors. The complaint
    alleges violations of Arizona state law based on consumer fraud
    and racketeering. The defendants have removed this case to
    federal court and the Joint Panel on Multi-District Litigation
    has transferred the case to Multi-District Litigation
    No. 1456 pending in the U.S. District Court for the
    District of Massachusetts. The parties have stipulated that
    defendants’ motions to dismiss will be briefed in February
    and March 2007. We intend to defend ourselves vigorously against
    all of the allegations and claims in this lawsuit. At this stage
    of the litigation, we cannot make any estimate of a potential
    loss or range of loss.

On January 6, 2006, we were served with a lawsuit,
    captioned United States of America ex rel. Paul P.
    McDermott v. Genentech, Inc. and Biogen-Idec, Inc., filed
    in the United States District Court of the District of Maine
    (“Court”). The lawsuit was filed under seal on
    July 29, 2005 by a former employee of our co-defendant
    Genentech pursuant to the False Claims Act, 31 U.S.C.
    section 3729 et. seq. On December 20, 2005, the
    U.S. government elected not to intervene, and the complaint
    was subsequently unsealed and served. On April 4, 2006, the
    plaintiff filed his first amended complaint alleging, among
    other things, that we directly solicited physicians and their
    staff members to illegally market off-label uses of RITUXAN for
    treating rheumatoid arthritis, provided illegal kickbacks to
    physicians to promote off-label uses, trained our employees in
    methods of avoiding

BIOGEN
    IDEC INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

the detection of these off-label sales and marketing activities,
    formed a network of employees whose assigned duties involved
    off-label promotion of RITUXAN, intended and caused the
    off-label promotion of RITUXAN to result in the submission of
    false claims to the government, and conspired with Genentech to
    defraud the government. The plaintiff seeks entry of judgment on
    behalf of the United States of America against the defendants,
    an award to the plaintiff as relator, and all costs, expenses,
    attorneys’ fees, interest and other appropriate relief. On
    May 4, 2006, we filed a motion to dismiss the first amended
    complaint on the grounds that the Court lacks subject matter
    jurisdiction, the complaint fails to state a claim and the
    claims were not pleaded with particularity. On December 14,
    2006, the Magistrate Judge recommended that the Court dismiss
    the case based on our and Genentech’s Motion to Dismiss.
    The Plaintiff filed objections to this recommendation and the
    matter awaits decision by the District Court Judge. At this
    stage of the litigation, we cannot make any estimate of a
    potential loss or range of loss.

On June 17, 2006, Biogen Idec filed a Demand for
    Arbitration against Genentech, Inc. with the American
    Arbitration Association (“AAA”). In the Demand for
    Arbitration, Biogen Idec alleged that Genentech breached the
    parties’ Amended and Restated Collaboration Agreement dated
    June 19, 2003 (the “Collaboration Agreement”), by
    failing to honor Biogen Idec’s contractual right to
    participate in strategic decisions affecting the parties’
    joint development and commercialization of certain
    pharmaceutical products, including humanized anti-CD20
    antibodies. The original Demand for Arbitration filed by Biogen
    Idec focused primarily on Genentech’s unilateral
    development of an anti-CD20 product known as a second generation
    anti-CD20 molecule to treat Neuromyelitis Optica
    (“NMO”), a relatively rare disorder of the central
    nervous system. Genentech filed an Answering Statement in
    response to Biogen Idec’s Demand in which Genentech denied
    that it had breached the Collaboration Agreement and alleged
    that Biogen Idec had breached the Collaboration Agreement.
    Genentech also asserted for the first time that the November
    2003 transaction in which Idec acquired Biogen and became Biogen
    Idec was a change of control of our company under the
    Collaboration Agreement, a position with which we disagree
    strongly. It is our position that the Biogen Idec merger did not
    constitute a change of control under the Collaboration Agreement
    and that, even if it did, Genentech’s rights under the
    change of control provision, which must be asserted within
    ninety (90) days of the change of control event, have long
    since expired. We intend to vigorously assert that position if
    Genentech persists in making this claim. On December 5,
    2006, Biogen Idec filed an Amended Demand for Arbitration with
    the AAA to make clear that the parties’ dispute also
    includes a disagreement over Genentech’s unilateral
    development of another collaboration product — a third
    generation anti-CD20 molecule to treat certain oncology
    indications. A three-member arbitration panel has been selected
    to decide this matter. The arbitration is in a very early stage
    and we cannot make a determination as to the likely outcome.

On August 10, 2004, Classen Immunotherapies, Inc. filed
    suit against us, GlaxoSmithKline, Chiron Corporation,
    Merck & Co., Inc., and Kaiser-Permanente, Inc. in the
    U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland contending
    that we induced infringement of U.S. Patent Nos, 6,420,139,
    6,638,739, 5,728,383, and 5,723,283, all of which are directed
    to various methods of immunization or determination of
    immunization schedules. All Counts asserted against us by
    Classen were dismissed by the Court upon various motions filed
    by the Parties. In early December, Classen filed its initial
    appeal brief with the United States Court of Appeals for the
    Federal Circuit. In that brief, Classen argues for the first
    time that Biogen has no reporting duties and no activities
    related to FDA reporting regarding Hepatitis B vaccines and
    hence can have no claim to a safe harbor protection under
    Section 271(e)1. Classen asserts, however, that we are
    inducing infringement by having users consider risk prior to
    choosing an immunization schedule. Although our opposing brief
    will not be filed for several months, we will likely argue that
    Classen has waived this argument by not raising it in the
    district court and, moreover, that the argument lacks merit
    because we cannot induce infringement if there has been no
    actual infringement. We are unable, however, to predict the
    outcome of this appeal.

On January, 30, 2007, the Estate of Thaddeus Leoniak
    commenced a civil lawsuit in the Court of Common Pleas,
    Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania, against Biogen Idec, the Fox
    Chase Cancer Center and three physicians. The Complaint alleges
    that Thaddeus Leoniak died as a result of taking the drug
    ZEVALIN, and seeks to hold Biogen Idec strictly liable for
    placing an allegedly “unreasonably dangerous” product
    in the stream of commerce

F-52


BIOGEN
    IDEC INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

without proper warnings. The Complaint also seeks to hold the
    Company liable for alleged negligence in the design,
    manufacture, advertising, marketing, promoting, distributing,
    supplying and selling of ZEVALIN. The lawsuit seeks damages for
    pecuniary losses suffered by the decedent’s survivors and
    for compensatory damages for decedent’s pain and suffering,
    loss of earnings and deprivation of normal activities, all in an
    amount “in excess of $50,000.” On January 31,
    2007, the Plaintiff’s counsel demanded $7.0 million to
    settle the lawsuit. Biogen Idec has not formed an opinion that
    an unfavorable outcome is either “probable” or
    “remote” and does not express an opinion at this time
    as to the likely outcome of the matter or as to the magnitude or
    range of any potential loss. The Company believes that it has
    good and valid defenses to the Complaint and intends to
    vigorously defend the case.

In addition, we are involved in product liability claims and
    other legal proceedings generally incidental to our normal
    business activities. While the outcome of any of these
    proceedings cannot be accurately predicted, we do not believe
    the ultimate resolution of any of these existing matters would
    have a material adverse effect on our business or financial
    condition.

    participating, optional or other special rights of the shares of
    each such class or series and any qualifications, limitations or
    restrictions thereon as set forth in the stock certificate. Any
    such Preferred Stock may rank prior to common stock as to
    dividend rights, liquidation preference or both, and may have
    full or limited voting rights and may be convertible into shares
    of common stock. As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, there

    share of Preferred Stock. No other shares of Preferred Stock
    were issued and outstanding as of December 31, 2006 and
    2005.

Stockholder
    Rights Plan

Effective July 26, 2001, our Board of Directors amended and
    restated the terms of our stockholder rights plan, originally
    adopted by the Board of Directors in 1997. Under the plan, we
    declared a dividend distribution of one “Right” for
    each outstanding share of our common stock to stockholders of
    record at the close of business on August 11, 1997. Since
    that time, we have issued one Right with each newly issued share
    of common stock. As amended, each Right, when exercisable,
    entitles the holder to purchase from us one one-thousandth of a
    share of our Series X Junior Participating Preferred Stock
    at a purchase price of $500.00. In general, under the amended
    and restated plan, if a person or affiliated group acquires
    beneficial ownership of 15% or more of our shares of common
    stock, then each Right (other than those held by such acquiring
    person or affiliated group) will entitle the holder to receive,
    upon exercise, shares of common stock (or, under certain
    circumstances, a combination of securities or other assets)
    having a value of twice the underlying purchase price of the
    Right. In addition, if following the

F-53

    IDEC INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

announcement of the existence of an acquiring person or
    affiliated group we are involved in a business combination or
    sale of 50% or more of our assets or earning power, each Right
    (other than those held by the acquiring person or affiliated
    group) will entitle the holder to receive, upon exercise, shares
    of common stock of the acquiring entity having a value of twice
    the underlying purchase price of the Right. The Board of
    Directors also has the right, after an acquiring person or
    affiliated group is identified, to cause each Right to be
    exchanged for common stock or substitute consideration. We may
    redeem the Rights at a price of $0.001 per Right prior to
    the identification of an acquiring person or affiliated group.
    The Rights expire on July 26, 2011.

Stock
    Repurchase Programs

In October 2004, our Board of Directors authorized the
    repurchase of up to 20.0 million shares of our common
    stock. The repurchased stock will provide us with treasury
    shares for general corporate purposes, such as common stock to
    be issued under our employee equity and stock purchase plans.
    This repurchase program expired October 4, 2006. During
    2006, we repurchased 7.5 million shares at a cost of
    $320.3 million. During 2005, we repurchased
    7.5 million shares at a cost of $324.3 million.

In October 2006, our Board of Directors authorized the
    repurchase of up to an additional 20.0 million shares of
    our common stock. The repurchased stock will provide us with
    treasury shares for general corporate purposes, such as common
    stock to be issued under our employee equity and stock purchase
    plans. This repurchase program does not have an expiration date.
    No shares have been repurchased under the program as of
    December 31, 2006.

    development, manufacturing and commercialization of novel
    therapeutics for human health care and, therefore, our chief
    operating decision-maker manages the operations of our Company
    as a single operating segment. Enterprise-wide disclosures about
    product revenues, other revenues and long-lived assets by
    geographic area and information relating to major customers are

Severance
    and Other Restructuring Costs

    Strategic Plan

In September 2005, we began implementing a comprehensive
    strategic plan, or the 2005 Strategic Plan, in conjunction with
    which we consolidated or eliminated certain internal management
    layers and staff functions, resulting in the reduction of our
    workforce that represented approximately 17%, or approximately
    650 positions worldwide at that time. These adjustments took
    place across company functions, departments and sites, and were
    substantially implemented by the end of 2005. We recorded
    restructuring charges of $31.4 million in connection with
    these activities, of which $28.3 million related to
    severance and other employee termination costs, including health
    benefits, outplacement and bonuses. Other costs were
    $3.1 million and included write-downs of certain research
    assets that will no longer be utilized, consulting costs in
    connection with the restructuring effort, and costs related to
    the acceleration of restricted stock, offset by the reversal of
    previously recognized compensation due to unvested restricted
    stock cancellations.

    Restructurings

During 2006, we incurred additional restructuring costs
    associated with acquisitions and planned dispositions.
    Specifically, we incurred $1.2 million in severance costs
    associated with the acquisition of Conforma during 2006, and
    $1.7 million related in headcount reductions related to the
    planned disposition of our ZEVALIN product line.

    confirming Dr. Rastetter’s retirement as Executive
    Chairman and Chairman of the Board and his resignation from the
    Board, all effective as of December 30, 2005. As a result,
    Dr. Rastetter was entitled to, among other things, payments
    equal to his 2005 target bonus and three times the sum of his
    annual salary and target bonus, immediate vesting of his
    unvested stock options and restricted stock awards. These
    charges related to Dr. Rastetter’s retirement amounted
    to $7.1 million, and no liability related to
    Dr. Rastetter’s retirement remained as of
    December 31, 2005.

In 2004, we recorded charges of $4.4 million related to
    severance obligations for certain employees affected by the
    Merger in our San Diego facilities, and $2.3 million
    of restructuring costs related to the relocation of our European
    headquarters. In 2003, we accrued $2.1 million of
    restructuring costs related to severance obligations for certain
    employees affected by the Merger in our Cambridge facilities,
    and accrued an additional $1.0 million of charges in 2004.
    Substantially all of these amounts had been paid out by
    December 31, 2005.

Guarantees

In November 2002, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation
    No. 45,

Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure
    Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of
    Indebtedness of Others, an interpretation of FASB Statements
    No. 5, 57, and 107 and Rescission of FASB Interpretation
    No. 34,

or FIN No. 45. FIN No. 45
    elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor inside
    its interim and annual financial statements about its
    obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued. It also
    requires that a guarantor recognize, at the inception of a
    guarantee, a liability for the fair value of certain guarantees.
    The initial recognition and initial measurement provisions of
    FIN No. 45 are applicable on a prospective basis to
    guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002.
    Since January 1, 2003, we have not issued or modified any
    guarantees as defined by FIN No. 45.

We enter into indemnification provisions under our agreements
    with other companies in the ordinary course of business,
    typically with business partners, contractors, clinical sites
    and customers. Under these provisions, we generally indemnify
    and hold harmless the indemnified party for losses suffered or
    incurred by the indemnified party as a result of our activities.
    These indemnification provisions generally survive termination
    of the underlying agreement. The maximum potential amount of
    future payments we could be required to make under these
    indemnification provisions is unlimited. However, to date we
    have not incurred material costs to defend lawsuits or settle
    claims related to these indemnification provisions. As a result,
    the estimated fair value of these agreements is minimal.
    Accordingly, we have no liabilities recorded for these
    agreements as of December 31, 2006.

In connection with the relocation from leased facilities to our
    new research and corporate campus in San Diego, California,
    we entered into a lease assignment, in January 2005, with Tanox
    West, Inc., or Tanox, for a

F-56

    IDEC INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

manufacturing facility in San Diego for which we have
    outstanding lease obligations through September 2008. Under the
    lease assignment, Tanox was assigned all of our rights, title,
    and interest in the amended lease and assumed all of the terms,
    covenants, conditions and obligations required to be kept,
    performed and fulfilled under the amended lease, including the
    making of all payments under the amended lease. However, if
    Tanox were to fail to perform under the lease assignment we
    would be responsible for all obligations under the amended lease
    through September 2008. At December 31, 2006, our estimate
    of the maximum potential of future payments under the amended
    lease through September 2008 is $8.7 million. Under the
    lease assignment, Tanox has agreed to indemnify and hold us
    harmless from and against any and all claims, proceedings and
    demands and all costs, expenses and liabilities arising out of
    their performance or failure to perform under the lease
    assignment.

23.

Facility
    Impairments and Loss (Gain) on Disposition

As of March 31, 2005, after our voluntary suspension of
    TYSABRI, we reconsidered our construction plans and determined
    that we would proceed with the bulk manufacturing component of
    our large-scale biologic manufacturing facility in Hillerod,
    Denmark. Additionally, we added a labeling and packaging
    component to the project, but determined that we would no longer
    proceed with the fill-finish component of the large-scale
    biological manufacturing facility. As a result, we recorded an
    impairment charge of approximately $6.2 million in 2005
    related to the fill-finish component that had previously been
    capitalized.

In June 2005, we sold our large-scale biologics manufacturing
    facility in Oceanside, California, known as NIMO, along with
    approximately 60 acres of real property located in
    Oceanside, California upon which NIMO is located, together with
    improvements, related property rights, and certain personal
    property intangibles and contracts at or related to the real
    property. Total consideration for the purchase was
    $408.1 million. The loss from this transaction was
    $83.5 million which consisted primarily of the write-down
    of NIMO to net selling price, sales and transfer taxes, and
    other associated transaction costs.

In February 2006, we sold our clinical manufacturing facility in
    Oceanside, California, known as NICO. The assets associated with
    the facility were included in assets held for sale on our
    consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2005. Total
    consideration was $29.0 million. In 2005, we recorded
    impairment charges totaling $28.0 million to reduce the
    carrying value of NICO to its net realizable value. No
    additional loss resulted from completion of the sale.

In December 2006, we completed the sale of a research building
    at our Cambridge, Massachusetts facility. Proceeds from the sale
    were approximately $39.5 million. We recorded a pre-tax
    gain of $15.6 million on the sale. We will continue to
    occupy a minor portion of the building through December 31,
    2007 under a leasing arrangement and have recorded prepaid rent
    of approximately $0.7 million at December 31, 2006.

New
    Accounting Pronouncements

In February 2006, the FASB issued FSP
    No. FAS 123(R) — 4,

Classification of
    Options and Similar Instruments Issued as Employee Compensation
    That Allow for Cash Settlement upon the Occurrence of a
    Contingent Event.

This FSP addresses the classification of
    options and similar instruments issued as employee compensation
    that allow for cash settlement upon the occurrence of a
    contingent event. The guidance in this FSP amends
    SFAS 123(R), so that a cash settlement feature that can be
    exercised only upon the occurrence of a contingent event that is
    outside the employee’s control does not require the option
    or similar instrument to be classified as a liability, unless it
    becomes probable that the event will occur. This FSP is
    effective in the first quarter of 2006, the same period we
    adopted SFAS 123(R). This FSP has not had any impact on our
    results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2006,
    nor do we expect it to have a significant impact in future
    periods.

In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS 151,

Inventory
    Costs, an amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4

,
    which amends the guidance in ARB No. 43, Chapter 4,

Inventory Pricing

, to clarify the accounting for abnormal
    amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs, and
    wasted material (spoilage). SFAS 151 clarifies that
    abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling
    costs, and wasted materials (spoilage) should be recognized as
    current-period charges. In addition, SFAS 151 requires that
    allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of
    conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production
    facilities. The provisions of SFAS 151 were effective for
    inventory costs incurred during our fiscal year beginning on
    January 1, 2006. We did not experience a significant impact
    on our results of operations in 2006 as a result of our adoption
    of SFAS 151. However, we may experience variability in
    future results of operations due to abnormal amounts of idle
    facility expense, freight, handling costs, and wasted material
    (spoilage).

In February 2006, the FASB issued SFAS 155,

Accounting
    for Certain Hybrid Financial Instruments

, or SFAS 155,
    which amends both SFAS 133,

Accounting for Derivative
    Instruments and Hedging Activities

, and SFAS 140,

Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets
    and Extinguishments of Liabilities.

SFAS 155
    allows the fair value remeasurement for any hybrid financial
    instrument that contains an embedded derivative that would
    otherwise required bifurcation. SFAS 155 will be effective
    for fiscal years beginning after September 15, 2006. We do
    not expect this statement to have any impact on our results of
    operations.

On July 13, 2006, FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes — An
    Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109

, was issued.
    FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income
    taxes recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements in
    accordance with FASB Statement No. 109,

Accounting for
    Income Taxes.

FIN 48 also prescribes a recognition
    threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement
    recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected
    to be taken in a tax return. The new FASB standard also provides
    guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and
    penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and
    transition and is effective for fiscal years beginning after
    December 15, 2006. We are currently evaluating the impact
    of this standard on our financial statements.

On September 6, 2006, FASB Statement No 157,

Fair Value
    Measurements

, or SFAS 157, was issued. This Statement
    defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair
    value in generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), and
    expands disclosures about fair value measurements. This
    Statement applies under other accounting pronouncements that
    require or permit fair value measurements, the Board having
    previously concluded in those accounting pronouncements that
    fair value is the relevant measurement attribute. Accordingly,
    this Statement does not require any new fair value measurements.
    The statement is effective for financial statements

issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007,
    and interim periods within those fiscal years. We are currently
    evaluating the impact of this standard on our financial
    statements.

On September 6, 2006, FASB Statement No 158,

Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and
    Other Postretirement Plans — an amendment of SASB
    Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R)

, or FASB 158,
    was issued. This Statement improves financial reporting by
    requiring an employer to recognize the overfunded or underfunded
    status of a defined benefit postretirement plan (other than a
    multiemployer plan) as an asset or liability in its statement of
    financial position and to recognize changes in that funded
    status in the year in which the changes occur through
    comprehensive income of a business entity or changes in
    unrestricted net assets of a

not-for-profit

organization. We adopted FASB 158 effective December 31,
    2006 and recorded a change in other comprehensive income of
    $1.2 million.

On September 13, 2006, the Securities and Exchange
    Commission issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108,

Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements When
    Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial
    Statements

, or SAB 108. SAB 108 provides guidance
    on how prior year misstatements should be taken into
    consideration when quantifying misstatements in current year
    financial statements for the purposes of determining whether the
    current year’s financial statements are materially
    misstated. SAB 108 becomes effective for accounting years
    ending after November 15, 2006. The adoption of this SAB
    did not have any impact on our financial statements.

Subsequent
    Events

Acquisition
    of Syntonix Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

In January 2007, we acquired Syntonix Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or
    Syntonix, a privately held biopharmaceutical company based in
    Waltham, Massachusetts, for $40.0 million. Syntonix focuses
    on discovering and developing long-acting therapeutic products
    to improve treatment regimens for chronic diseases, and has
    multiple pre-clinical programs in hemophilia. The purchase price
    is subject to increase to as much as $120.0 million if
    certain development milestones with respect to Syntonix’s
    lead product, FIX:Fc, a proprietary long-acting factor IX
    product for the treatment of hemophilia B, are achieved. We
    expect substantially all of the purchase price of Syntonix to be
    allocated to IPR&D.

Conversion
    of Senior Notes Due 2019

In January 2007, we issued 2.8 million shares of common
    stock for $70.5 million in face value of our 2019 senior
    notes that the holders had elected to convert into common stock.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Biogen Idec
    Inc.:

We have completed integrated audits of Biogen Idec’s
    consolidated financial statements and of its internal control
    over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, in
    accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
    Oversight Board (United States). Our opinions, based on our
    audits, are presented below.

Consolidated
    financial statements

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in
    the index appearing under Item 15(a)(1) present fairly, in
    all material respects, the financial position of Biogen Idec
    Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2006 and 2005,
    and the results of their operations and their cash flows for
    each of the three years in the period ended December 31,
    2006 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
    in the United States of America. These financial statements are
    the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
    responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
    statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these
    statements in accordance with the standards of the Public
    Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit of financial statements
    includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the
    amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing
    the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
    presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable
    basis for our opinion.

As discussed in Note 5 to the consolidated financial
    statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts
    for share-based compensation in 2006.

Internal
    control over financial reporting

Also, in our opinion, management’s assessment, included in
    Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial
    Reporting appearing under Item 7, that the Company
    maintained effective internal control over financial reporting
    as of December 31, 2006 based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission (COSO), is fairly stated, in all material respects,
    based on those criteria. Furthermore, in our opinion, the
    Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal
    control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006,
    based on criteria established in

Internal Control —
    Integrated Framework

issued by the COSO. The Company’s
    management is responsible for maintaining effective internal
    control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
    effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our
    responsibility is to express opinions on management’s
    assessment and on the effectiveness of the Company’s
    internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We
    conducted our audit of internal control over financial reporting
    in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
    Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards
    require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
    assurance about whether effective internal control over
    financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. An
    audit of internal control over financial reporting includes
    obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial
    reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and
    evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal
    control, and performing such other procedures as we consider
    necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit
    provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that
    transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
    financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
    company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide
    reasonable

F-61


assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
