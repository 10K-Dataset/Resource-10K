TABLE OF
    CONTENTS


PART I

Item 1.

Business

Overview

Biogen Idec creates new standards of care in therapeutic areas
    with high unmet medical needs. Biogen Idec is a global leader in
    the development, manufacturing, and commercialization of
    innovative therapies. Patients in more than 90 countries benefit
    from Biogen Idec’s significant products that address
    diseases such as multiple sclerosis, lymphoma and rheumatoid
    arthritis. We currently have four products:

AVONEX

®

(interferon beta-1a)

AVONEX is approved worldwide for the treatment of relapsing
    forms of multiple sclerosis, or MS, and is the most prescribed
    therapeutic product in MS worldwide. Globally over
    135,000 patients use AVONEX.

RITUXAN

®

(rituximab)

RITUXAN is approved worldwide for the treatment of relapsed or
    refractory low-grade or follicular, CD20-positive, B-cell
    non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas, or B-cell NHLs. The U.S. Food
    and Drug Administration, or FDA, has also approved RITUXAN for
    (1) the treatment of patients with previously untreated
    diffuse, large B-cell NHL in combination with
    anthracycline-based chemotherapy regimens, (2) treatment of
    patients with previously-untreated follicular NHL in combination
    with CVP (cyclophosphamide, vincristine and prednisone)
    chemotherapy, and (3) the treatment of patients with
    non-progressing (including stable disease) low grade B-cell NHL
    following first-line treatment with CVP chemotherapy. We believe
    that RITUXAN is the second highest-selling oncology therapeutic
    in the United States and has had more than
    1,000,000 patient exposures worldwide across all
    indications. In addition, RITUXAN, in combination with
    methotrexate, is also approved for reducing signs and symptoms
    and to slow the progression of structural damage in adult
    patients with

moderately-to-severely

active rheumatoid arthritis, or RA, who have had an inadequate
    response to one or more tumor necrosis factor, or TNF,
    antagonist therapies. We are working with Genentech and Roche on
    the development of RITUXAN in additional oncology, neurology and
    immunology indications.

RITUXAN is the trade name for the compound rituximab in the
    U.S., Canada and Japan. MabThera is the trade name for rituximab
    in the European Union, or EU. In this Annual Report, we refer to
    rituximab, RITUXAN, and MabThera collectively as RITUXAN, except
    where we have otherwise indicated.

TYSABRI

®

(natalizumab)

TYSABRI is approved for the treatment of relapsing forms of MS
    in the U.S. and other countries, and in the U.S. for
    inducing and maintaining clinical response and remission in
    adult patients with moderately to severely active Crohn’s
    disease, or CD, with evidence of inflammation who have had an
    inadequate response to, or are unable to tolerate, conventional
    CD therapies and inhibitors of TNF-alpha. Under the terms of a
    collaboration agreement with Elan Corporation plc, or Elan, we
    are solely responsible for the manufacture of TYSABRI, and we
    collaborate with Elan on the product’s marketing,
    commercial distribution and on-going development activities. The
    collaboration agreement with Elan is designed to effect an equal
    sharing of profits and losses generated by the activities of the
    collaboration between Elan and us.

FUMADERM

®

(dimethylfumarate and monoethylfumarate salts)

FUMADERM was acquired with the purchase of Fumapharm AG, or
    Fumapharm, in June 2006. In December 2006, we acquired the right
    to distribute FUMADERM in Germany from Fumedica effective
    May 1, 2007. FUMADERM acts as an immunomodulator and has
    been approved in Germany for the treatment of severe psoriasis
    since 1994.

Other
    Revenue and Programs

In 2007, we recorded product revenues from sales of

ZEVALIN

®

(ibritumomab tiuxetan)

prior to our sale of
    U.S. rights to this product line in December 2007.



We also receive royalty revenues on sales by our licensees of a
    number of products covered under patents that we control. In
    addition, we have a pipeline of research and development
    products in our core therapeutic areas and in other areas of
    interest.

We devote significant resources to research and development
    programs and external business and corporate development
    efforts. We intend to focus our research and development efforts
    on finding novel therapeutics in areas of high unmet medical
    need, both within our current focus areas of oncology,
    neurology, immunology and cardiology as well as in new
    therapeutic areas. Our current late stage efforts include our
    work with Genentech and Roche on the development of RITUXAN in
    additional oncology indications, RA, MS and lupus and the
    co-development of additional anti-CD20 antibody products
    including the humanized anti-CD20 antibody (ocrelizumab), which
    is in Phase 3 studies in rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus
    erythematosus; BG-12 for relapsing forms of MS in Phase 3;
    galiximab for NHL in Phase 3; and lumiliximab for chronic
    lymphocytic leukemia, or CLL, in Phase 2/3; and lixivaptan for
    acute hyponatremia, currently initiating Phase 3 clinical
    studies.

AVONEX

We currently market and sell AVONEX worldwide for the treatment
    of relapsing forms of MS. In 2007, sales of AVONEX generated
    worldwide revenues of $1,867.8 million as compared to
    worldwide revenues of $1,706.7 million in 2006.

MS is a progressive neurological disease in which the body loses
    the ability to transmit messages along nerve cells, leading to a
    loss of muscle control, paralysis and, in some cases, death.
    Patients with active relapsing MS experience an uneven pattern
    of disease progression characterized by periods of stability
    that are interrupted by

flare-ups

of
    the disease after which the patient returns to a new baseline of
    functioning. AVONEX is a recombinant form of a protein produced
    in the body by fibroblast cells in response to viral infection.
    AVONEX has been shown in clinical trials in relapsing forms of
    MS both to slow the accumulation of disability and to reduce the
    frequency of

flare-ups.

AVONEX is approved to treat relapsing forms of MS, including
    patients with a first clinical episode and MRI features
    consistent with MS. We began selling AVONEX in the U.S. in
    1996, and in the EU in 1997. AVONEX is on the market in over 70
    countries. Based on data from an independent third party
    research organization, information from our distributors and
    internal analysis, we believe that AVONEX is the most prescribed
    therapeutic product for the treatment of MS worldwide. Globally
    over 135,000 patients use AVONEX.

We continue to work to expand the data available about AVONEX
    and MS treatments. In October 2007, we presented at the Congress
    of the European Committee for Treatment and Research of Multiple
    Sclerosis, or ECTRIMS, in Prague, Czech Republic, on the final
    results from a worldwide comparative study (QUASIMS) of the
    efficacy and tolerability of interferon-beta products for the
    treatment of relapsing multiple sclerosis. This retrospective,
    observational study presented at ECTRIMS involved 7,542 MS
    patients. This geographically diverse



group from a range of clinical practice settings is the largest
    cohort of patients with relapsing remitting MS, or RRMS, that
    has been studied to evaluate and compare patient outcomes with
    interferon beta. The effects of all currently available
    interferon beta treatments were similar over 2 years in
    patients with RRMS. Even in patients with higher baseline
    annualized relapse rates or expanded disability status scale
    scores, there was no clear benefit of one interferon over
    another. This is in contrast to two earlier studies suggesting
    there were differences in efficacy between certain interferon
    beta formulations and dosing regimens (the Independent
    Comparison of Interferon (INCOMIN) and Evidence of Interferon
    Dose-Response and European — North American
    Comparative Efficacy (EVIDENCE) trials). Of the treatments
    studied, however, AVONEX requires the least frequent
    administration.

We have also extended the Controlled High Risk AVONEX Multiple
    Sclerosis Prevention Study In Ongoing Neurological Surveillance,
    or CHAMPIONS. CHAMPIONS was originally designed to determine
    whether the effect of early treatment with AVONEX in delaying
    relapses and reducing the accumulation of MS brain lesions could
    be sustained for up to five years. The study results showed that
    AVONEX altered the long-term course of MS in patients who began
    treatment immediately after their initial MS attack compared to
    initiation of treatment more than two years after onset of
    symptoms. The five-year study extension is intended to determine
    if the effects of early treatment with AVONEX can be sustained
    for up to ten years. We also continue to support Phase 4
    investigator-run studies evaluating AVONEX in combination with
    other therapies.

RITUXAN

RITUXAN is approved worldwide for the treatment of relapsed or
    refractory low-grade or follicular, CD20-positive, B-cell NHLs,
    which comprise approximately half of the B-cell NHLs diagnosed
    in the U.S. In the U.S., RITUXAN is approved for NHL with
    the following label indications:

•

The treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory, low-grade
    or follicular, CD20-positive, B-cell NHL as a single agent;

•

The treatment of patients with previously untreated diffuse
    large B-cell, CD20-positive, NHL, or DLBCL, in combination with
    CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone)
    or other anthracycline-based chemotherapy regimens;

•

The treatment of patients with previously untreated follicular,
    CD20-positive, B-cell NHL in combination with CVP
    (cyclophosphamide, vincristine and prednisone)
    chemotherapy; and

•

The treatment of patients with non-progressing (including stable
    disease), low grade CD20-positive, B-cell NHL, as a single
    agent, after first line CVP chemotherapy.

In addition, RITUXAN, in combination with methotrexate, is also
    approved for reducing signs and symptoms and to slow the
    progression of structural damage in adult patients with

moderately-to-severely

active rheumatoid arthritis, or RA, who have had an inadequate
    response to one or more TNF antagonist therapies.

Our interest in RITUXAN is recognized as revenue from
    unconsolidated joint business, and is made up of three
    components:

•

We copromote RITUXAN in the U.S. in collaboration with
    Genentech. All U.S. sales of RITUXAN are recognized by
    Genentech, and we record our share of the pretax copromotion
    profits on a quarterly basis. In 2007, RITUXAN generated
    U.S. net sales of $2.3 billion, of which we recorded
    $616.8 million as our share of copromotion profits, as
    compared to U.S. net sales of $2.1 billion in 2006, of
    which we recorded $555.8 million as our share of
    copromotion profits;

•

Roche sells RITUXAN outside the U.S., except in Japan where it
    co-markets RITUXAN in collaboration with Zenyaku Kogyo Co. Ltd.,
    or Zenyaku. We received royalties through Genentech on sales of
    RITUXAN outside of the U.S. of $250.8 million in 2007
    as compared to $194.0 million in 2006; and

•

Finally, we receive reimbursement from Genentech for our selling
    and development expenses.

In the U.S., we share responsibility with Genentech for
    continued development. Such continued development includes
    conducting supportive research and post-approval clinical
    studies and seeking potential approval for additional
    indications. Genentech provides the support functions for the
    commercialization of RITUXAN in the U.S. and has worldwide
    manufacturing responsibilities. See “Sales, Marketing and
    Distribution — RITUXAN” and “Manufacturing
    and Raw Materials.” We also have the right to collaborate
    with Genentech on the development of



other humanized anti-CD20 antibodies targeting B-cell disorders
    for a broad range of indications, and to copromote with
    Genentech any new products resulting from such development in
    the U.S. The most advanced such humanized anti-CD20
    antibody under development, ocrelizumab, is in Phase 3 trials in
    rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus. We are
    currently in arbitration with Genentech as to whether Genentech
    has the right to develop collaboration products, including the
    second-generation humanized anti-CD20 molecule, without our
    approval. See “Item 3 — Legal
    Proceedings” for a description of that arbitration. Our
    agreement with Genentech provides that the successful
    development and commercialization of new anti-CD20 product
    candidates in our collaboration (which also includes RITUXAN)
    will decrease our participation in the operating profits from
    the collaboration (including as to RITUXAN). See Consolidated
    Financial Statements Note 16, Unconsolidated Joint Business
    Arrangement.

RITUXAN
    in Oncology

We believe that RITUXAN is the second-highest-selling oncology
    therapeutic in the United States and has had more than
    1,000,000 patient exposures worldwide across all
    indications. RITUXAN is generally administered as outpatient
    therapy by personnel trained in administering chemotherapies or
    biologics. RITUXAN is unique in the treatment of B-cell NHLs due
    to its specificity for the antigen CD20, which is expressed only
    on the surface of normal B-cells and malignant B-cells. Stem
    cells (including B-cell progenitors or precursor B-cells) in
    bone marrow lack the CD20 antigen. This allows healthy B-cells
    to regenerate after treatment with RITUXAN and to return to
    normal levels within several months. RITUXAN’s mechanism of
    action, in part, utilizes the body’s own immune system as
    compared to conventional lymphoma therapies.

In an effort to identify additional applications for RITUXAN,
    we, in conjunction with Genentech and Roche, continue to support
    RITUXAN post-marketing studies. We, along with Genentech and
    Roche, are conducting a multi-center global Phase 3
    registrational study known as REACH in patients with relapsed
    chronic lymphocytic leukemia, or CLL, comparing the use of
    fludarabine, cyclophosphamide and RITUXAN together, known as
    FCR, versus fludarabine and cyclophosphamide alone. Enrollment
    for this study was completed in the third quarter of 2007. We,
    along with Genentech and Roche, are also conducting a trial
    known as PRIMA that is evaluating the added efficacy of RITUXAN
    maintenance therapy after previously untreated follicular
    non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma patients are given a combination of
    chemotherapy and RITUXAN. To date, the added benefit of RITUXAN
    has only been evaluated in relapsed patients. PRIMA completed
    enrollment in 2007. Additional clinical studies are ongoing in
    other B-cell malignancies such as lymphoproliferative disorders
    associated with solid organ transplant therapies, relapsed
    aggressive non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and mantle cell
    non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma.

RITUXAN
    in RA

RITUXAN, in combination with methotrexate, is approved for
    reducing signs and symptoms and to slow the progression of
    structural damage in adult patients with

moderately-to-severely

active rheumatoid arthritis who have had an inadequate response
    to one or more TNF antagonist therapies. We, along with
    Genentech and Roche, initiated a Phase 3 clinical study of
    RITUXAN in RA patients who are inadequate responders to
    disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs, or DMARDs, in 2006. In
    January 2008 we announced that the study, known as SERENE, met
    its primary endpoint of a significantly greater proportion of
    RITUXAN-treated patients achieving an American College of
    Rheumatology (ACR) 20 response (the proportion of patients who
    achieve at least 20% improvement) at week 24, compared to
    placebo. In this study patients who received either 500 mg
    or 1000 mg of RITUXAN as a single treatment course of two
    infusions in combination with a stable dose of methotrexate
    displayed a statistically significant improvement in symptoms
    compared to patients who received placebo in combination with
    methotrexate. Although the study was not designed to compare the
    RITUXAN doses, the efficacy of the two doses appeared to be
    similiar. Further analyses of the data are ongoing and will be
    submitted for presentation at an upcoming medical meeting. In
    2007 we received positive results from the Phase 3 study known
    as SUNRISE, investigating the controlled re-treatment of
    patients who are inadequate responders to TNF therapies.
    Patients who were not in remission at 24 weeks following
    administration of a course of RITUXAN were randomized to receive
    either a second course of RITUXAN or placebo. The primary
    endpoint, the proportion of retreated patients with an ACR 20
    response at Week 48 relative to baseline, was achieved with
    significantly more patients achieving an ACR 20 with RITUXAN
    retreatment compared to placebo. Genentech and Biogen Idec will
    continue to analyze the study results and we anticipate
    presenting the results at an upcoming meeting in 2008.



RITUXAN
    in Other Immunology Indications

Based primarily on results from the studies of RITUXAN in RA, as
    well as other small investigator-sponsored studies in various
    autoimmune-mediated diseases, we, along with Genentech, are
    conducting a Phase 3 clinical study of RITUXAN in primary
    progressive MS, or PPMS, and a registrational program in
    systemic lupus erythematosus, or SLE, comprised of a Phase 3
    study in lupus nephritis and a Phase 2/3 study in a general SLE
    population. We anticipate reporting results from the PPMS and
    SLE studies in the first half of 2008. Enrollment in the Lupus
    Nephritis study is still ongoing. In August 2006, we and
    Genentech announced that a Phase 2 study of RITUXAN in
    relapsing-remitting MS met its primary endpoint. Results were
    presented at the American Academy of Neurology annual meeting in
    May 2007. The study of 104 patients showed a statistically
    significant reduction in the total number of gadolinium
    enhancing T1 lesions observed on serial MRI scans of the brain
    at weeks 12, 16, 20 and 24 in the RITUXAN-treated group compared
    to placebo. At week 24, the total cumulative mean number of
    gadolinium lesions per patient was reduced by 91%, to 0.5 in the
    RITUXAN-treated group from 5.5 in the placebo group (p0.001). In
    addition, the proportion of patients with relapses over
    24 weeks in the RITUXAN-treated arm was 14.5% compared to
    34.3% in the placebo arm (58% relative reduction) (p=0.02). The
    result of statistical testing is often defined in terms of a
    “p-value,” with a level of 0.05 or less considered to
    be a statistically significant difference, which means the
    result is unlikely due to chance.

In December 2006, we and Genentech issued a dear healthcare
    provider letter informing healthcare providers that two cases of
    progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, or PML, a rare and
    frequently fatal demyelinating disease of the central nervous
    system, resulting in death were reported in patients receiving
    RITUXAN for treatment of SLE, an indication where RITUXAN is not
    approved for treatment. The prescribing information for RITUXAN
    has been updated to reflect these reports.

TYSABRI

TYSABRI is approved for the treatment of relapsing forms of MS.
    On June 5, 2006, we and Elan announced the FDA’s
    approval of the supplemental Biologics License Application, or
    sBLA, for the reintroduction of TYSABRI as a monotherapy
    treatment for relapsing forms of MS to slow the progression of
    disability and reduce the frequency of clinical relapses. On
    June 29, 2006, we and Elan announced that the European
    Medicines Agency, or EMEA, had approved TYSABRI as a similar
    treatment. TYSABRI is also approved for MS in Switzerland,
    Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Israel.

TYSABRI was initially approved by the FDA in November 2004 to
    treat relapsing forms of MS to reduce the frequency of clinical
    relapses. In February 2005, in consultation with the FDA, we and
    Elan voluntarily suspended the marketing and commercial
    distribution of TYSABRI based on reports of cases of PML in
    patients treated with TYSABRI in clinical studies. In
    consideration of these events, TYSABRI is marketed under risk
    management or minimization plans as agreed with local regulatory
    authorities. In the U.S., TYSABRI was reintroduced with a risk
    minimization action plan, or RiskMAP, known as the TYSABRI
    Outreach: Unified Commitment to Health, or TOUCH, Prescribing
    Program, a rigorous system intended to educate physicians and
    patients about the risks involved and assure appropriate use of
    the product.

As of late December 2007, more than 21,000 patients were on
    commercial and clinical TYSABRI therapy worldwide. As of
    mid-December 2007, up to 30,900 patients had been treated
    with TYSABRI cumulatively in the combined clinical trial and
    post-marketing settings. There have been no new cases of PML
    since relaunch in the U.S. and launch internationally in
    July 2006.

On January 14, 2008, we and Elan announced the FDA’s
    approval of the sBLA for use of TYSABRI for inducing and
    maintaining clinical response and remission in adult patients
    with moderately to severely active Crohn’s disease, or CD,
    with evidence of inflammation who have had an inadequate
    response to, or are unable to tolerate, conventional CD
    therapies and inhibitors of TNF-alpha. TYSABRI will be available
    for the treatment of CD upon the completion of key
    implementation activities related to the approved risk
    management plan. We anticipate TYSABRI will be available to
    Crohn’s patients by the end of the first quarter of 2008.

The FDA granted approval based on its review of overall safety
    data and the results of three randomized, double-blind,
    placebo-controlled, multi-center trials of TYSABRI assessing the
    safety and efficacy as both an induction and maintenance
    therapy — ENCORE (Efficacy of Natalizumab in
    Crohn’s Disease Response and Remission), ENACT-1 (Efficacy
    of Natalizumab as Active Crohn’s Therapy) and ENACT-2
    (Evaluation of



Natalizumab As Continuous Therapy). The approval contains
    labeling and a risk management plan, both of which are similar
    to those approved for the MS indication. One of the confirmed
    cases of PML was in a patient who was in a clinical study of
    TYSABRI in Crohn’s disease.

In September 2004, Elan submitted a Marketing Authorisation
    Application, or MAA, to the EMEA for approval of TYSABRI as a
    treatment for Crohn’s disease. A committee of the EMEA
    adopted a negative recommendation in November 2007. The European
    Commission affirmed the committee’s decision in the first
    quarter of 2008, which means that Crohn’s disease will not
    be included in our label for TYSABRI in the EU.

TYSABRI binds to adhesion molecules on the immune cell surface
    known as alpha-4 integrin. Adhesion molecules on the surface of
    the immune cells play an important role in the migration of the
    immune cells in the inflammatory process. Research suggests that
    by binding to alpha-4 integrin, TYSABRI prevents immune cells
    from migrating from the bloodstream into tissue where they can
    cause inflammation and potentially damage nerve fibers and their
    insulation.

Under the terms of the collaboration, we are solely responsible
    for the manufacture of TYSABRI, and we collaborate with Elan on
    the product’s marketing, commercial distribution and
    ongoing development activities. The collaboration agreement with
    Elan is designed to effect an equal sharing of profits and
    losses generated by the activities of the collaboration between
    Elan and us. Under our agreement with Elan, however, in the
    event that sales of TYSABRI exceed specified thresholds, Elan is
    required to make milestone payments to us in order to continue
    sharing equally in the collaboration’s results.

In the U.S., we sell TYSABRI to Elan who sells the product to
    third party distributors. Elan and we co-market the product. The
    sales price to Elan in the U.S. is set at the beginning of
    each quarterly period to effect an approximate equal sharing of
    the gross margin between Elan and us. In addition, both parties
    share equally in the operating costs, which include research and
    development, selling, general and administrative expenses and
    other similar costs. Sales of TYSABRI to Elan are reported as
    revenues and are recognized upon Elan’s shipment of the
    product to third party distributors, at which time all revenue
    recognition criteria have been met. As of December 31, 2007
    and 2006, we had deferred revenue of $9.0 and $5.0 million,
    respectively, for shipments to Elan that remained in Elan’s
    ending inventory. Elan’s reimbursement of TYSABRI operating
    costs is reflected as a reduction of the respective costs within
    our consolidated statement of income.

For sales outside of the U.S., we are responsible for
    distributing TYSABRI to customers and are primarily responsible
    for all operating activities. We and Elan share equally in the
    operating results of TYSABRI outside the U.S. Sales of
    TYSABRI are reported as revenue and are recognized at the time
    of product delivery to our customer, at which time all revenue
    recognition criteria have been met. Payments to or from Elan for
    their share of the collaboration operating losses relating to
    sales outside the U.S. are reflected in the collaboration
    profit (loss) sharing line in our consolidated statement of
    income. For 2007 and 2006, we provided and received net payments
    of $14.1 million and ($9.7) million, respectively,
    related to reimbursements made in connection with this
    arrangement.

In July 2006, we began to ship TYSABRI in both the United States
    and Europe. In 2007, we recorded sales of TYSABRI in the
    U.S. and Europe of $104.4 million and
    $125.5 million, respectively. In 2006, we recorded sales of
    TYSABRI in the U.S. and Europe relating to current activity
    of $11.9 million and $10.0 million, respectively.
    Prior to the suspension of TYSABRI in 2005, we shipped product
    to Elan in the U.S. and recognized revenue in accordance
    with the policy described above. As a result of the suspension
    of TYSABRI, we deferred $14.0 million in revenue from Elan
    as of March 31, 2005 related to TYSABRI product that
    remained in Elan’s ending inventory. This amount was paid
    by Elan during 2005 and was subsequently recognized as revenue
    during 2006, when the uncertainty about the ultimate disposition
    of the product was eliminated.

PHASE 3
    Studies of TYSABRI in MS

Prior to the suspension of dosing in clinical studies of TYSABRI
    we, along with Elan, completed the AFFIRM study and the SENTINEL
    study. The AFFIRM study was designed to evaluate the ability of
    natalizumab to slow the progression of disability in MS and
    reduce the rate of clinical relapses. The SENTINEL study was
    designed to evaluate the effect of the combination of
    natalizumab and AVONEX compared to treatment with AVONEX alone
    in slowing progression of disability and reducing the rate of
    clinical relapses. Both studies were two-year studies which had
    protocols that included a one-year analysis of the data.



The
    AFFIRM study

The one-year data from the AFFIRM study showed that TYSABRI
    reduced the rate of clinical relapses by 66% relative to
    placebo, the primary endpoint at one year. AFFIRM also met all
    one-year secondary endpoints, including MRI measures. In the
    TYSABRI treated group, 60% of patients developed no new or newly
    enlarging T2 hyperintense lesions compared to 22% of placebo
    treated patients. On the one-year MRI scan, 96% of TYSABRI
    treated patients had no gadolinium-enhancing lesions compared to
    68% of placebo treated patients. The proportion of patients who
    remained relapse free was 76% in the TYSABRI treated group
    compared to 53% in the placebo treated group. In February 2005,
    we and Elan announced that the AFFIRM study also achieved the
    two-year primary endpoint of slowing the progression of
    disability in patients with relapsing forms of MS. In the
    TYSABRI treated group, there was a 42% reduction in the risk of
    disability progression relative to placebo, and a 67% reduction
    in the rate of clinical relapses over two years relative to
    placebo which was sustained and consistent with the one-year
    results. Other efficacy data, including MRI measures, were
    similar to the one-year results.

In May 2007 at the annual meeting of the American Academy of
    Neurology in Boston, we presented extension study data that
    showed that TYSABRI has a sustained treatment effect on clinical
    relapses and the risk of disability progression in MS patients
    treated for up to three years. Patients who participated in the
    Phase 3 TYSABRI program (including the AFFIRM trial) were
    eligible to enroll in an open-label extension study that
    evaluated the therapy’s long-term effects. In the

intent-to-treat

analysis, the annualized relapse rate for patients treated with
    TYSABRI over the three-year period was 0.23, translating into an
    average of one relapse every 4.3 years. The relapse rate
    also continued to remain low over the three-year treatment
    period with TYSABRI: 0.27 during the first year; 0.20 during the
    second year; and 0.15 during the third year (based on
    531 patients who entered the extension study, which
    includes approximately 250 patients with nearly three years
    of continuous therapy). In addition, TYSABRI also decreased the
    cumulative probability of disability progression sustained for
    six months compared to placebo. The estimated proportion of
    patients who had 24-week sustained disability progression at two
    years was 11% in patients treated with TYSABRI compared to 23%
    in patients treated with placebo, a 54% relative reduction. This
    effect was maintained in patients treated with TYSABRI for up to
    three years with 13% showing 24-week sustained disability
    progression.

In October 2007 at the 23rd Congress of ECTRIMS in Prague,
    Czech Republic, we presented a poster on a post hoc analysis of
    the Phase 3 AFFIRM study. The study data suggest the proportion
    of disease-free patients over two years was significantly higher
    in the TYSABRI-treated group compared with the placebo group, as
    determined based upon both clinical and MRI criteria. Using
    clinical and MRI disease-free criteria combined, the most
    stringent definition of disease free, 36.7% of TYSABRI-treated
    patients had no relapses, disability progression or MRI activity
    compared with 7.2% of placebo patients (p0.0001). In the
    clinical analysis, 64.3% of TYSABRI-treated patients vs. 38.9%
    placebo-treated patients (p0.0001) were disease free or without
    relapses and disability progression. Using MRI measures, 57.7%
    of TYSABRI-treated patients vs. 14.2% placebo-treated patients
    (p0.0001) were disease free, or without gadolinium-enhancing
    lesions and new or enlarging T2-hyperintense lesions.

The
    SENTINEL study

The one-year data from the SENTINEL combination study also
    showed that the study achieved its one-year primary endpoint.
    The addition of TYSABRI to AVONEX resulted in a 54% reduction in
    the rate of clinical relapses over the effect of AVONEX alone.
    SENTINEL also met all secondary endpoints, including MRI
    measures. In the group treated with TYSABRI plus AVONEX, 67% of
    the patients developed no new or newly enlarging T2 hyperintense
    lesions compared to 40% in the AVONEX plus placebo group. On the
    one-year MRI scan, 96% of TYSABRI plus AVONEX-treated patients
    had no gadolinium-enhancing lesions compared to 76% of AVONEX
    plus placebo treated patients. The proportion of patients who
    remained relapse free was 67% in the TYSABRI plus AVONEX-treated
    group compared to 46% in the AVONEX plus placebo-treated group.
    In the TYSABRI-treated group, 60% of patients developed no new
    or newly enlarging T2 hyperintense lesions compared to 22% of
    placebo treated patients. On the one-year MRI scan, 96% of
    TYSABRI treated patients had no gadolinium-enhancing lesions
    compared to 68% of placebo treated patients. In July 2005, we
    and Elan announced that the SENTINEL study also achieved the
    two-year primary endpoint of slowing the progression of
    disability in patients with relapsing forms of MS. The addition
    of TYSABRI to AVONEX resulted in a 24% reduction in the risk of
    disability progression compared to the effect of AVONEX alone,
    and a 56% reduction in the rate of clinical relapses over two



years compared to that provided by AVONEX alone. Other efficacy
    data, including MRI measures, were similar to the one-year
    results.

Phase 3
    Studies of TYSABRI in Crohn’s Disease

We, along with Elan, have completed three Phase 3 studies of
    TYSABRI in Crohn’s disease, a chronic and progressive
    inflammatory disease of the gastrointestinal tract, which
    commonly affects both men and women. The three completed Phase 3
    studies are known as ENACT-2 (Evaluation of Natalizumab as
    Continuous Therapy-2), ENACT-1 (Evaluation of Natalizumab as
    Continuous Therapy-1), and ENCORE (Efficacy of Natalizumab for
    Crohn’s Disease Response and Remission).

ENACT-1/ENACT-2

In ENACT-2, 339 patients who were responders in ENACT-1,
    the Phase 3 induction study, were re-randomized to one of two
    treatment groups, TYSABRI or placebo, both administered monthly
    for a total of 12 months. In ENACT-1, the primary endpoint
    of “response,” as defined by a 70-point decrease in
    the Crohn’s Disease Activity Index, or CDAI, at week 10,
    was not met. In ENACT-2, the primary endpoint, which was met,
    was maintenance of response through six additional months of
    therapy. A loss of response was defined as a greater than 70
    point increase in CDAI score and a total CDAI score above 220 or
    any rescue intervention. Through month six, there was a
    significant treatment difference of greater than 30% in favor of
    patients taking TYSABRI compared to those taking placebo.
    Twelve-month data from ENACT-2 showed a sustained and clinically
    significant response throughout 12 months of extended
    TYSABRI infusion therapy, confirming findings in patients who
    had previously shown a sustained response throughout six months.
    Maintenance of response was defined by a CDAI score of less than
    220, and less than 70-point increase from baseline, in the
    absence of rescue intervention throughout the study. Response
    was maintained by 54% of patients treated with natalizumab
    compared to 20% of those treated with placebo (p0.001). In
    addition, 39% of patients on TYSABRI maintained clinical
    remission during the study period, versus 15% of those on
    placebo (p0.001). By the end of month six, 58% of patients
    treated with TYSABRI who had previously been treated with
    corticosteroids were able to withdraw from steroid therapy
    compared to 28% of placebo-treated patients.

The
    ENCORE study

In June 2005, we and Elan announced that ENCORE, the second
    Phase 3 induction trial of TYSABRI for the treatment of
    moderately to severely active Crohn’s disease in patients
    with evidence of active inflammation, met the primary endpoint
    of clinical response as defined by a 70-point decrease in
    baseline CDAI score at both weeks 8 and 12. The study also met
    all of its secondary endpoints, including clinical remission at
    both weeks 8 and 12. Clinical remission was defined as achieving
    a CDAI score of equal to or less than 150 at weeks 8 and 12. At
    the time of the TYSABRI suspension, all ENCORE study patients
    had completed dosing based on the study protocol and collection
    of data and analysis followed.

TYSABRI
    in Oncology

We plan to initiate a Phase 1/2 study of TYSABRI in multiple
    myeloma in 2008.

FUMADERM

FUMADERM (dimethylfumarate and monoethylfumarate salts) was
    acquired with the purchase of Fumapharm in June 2006. In
    December 2006, we acquired the right to distribute FUMADERM in
    Germany from Fumedica effective May 1, 2007. FUMADERM acts
    as an immunomodulator and is approved in Germany for the
    treatment of severe psoriasis. In 2007 and 2006, sales of
    FUMADERM in Germany totaled $21.5 million and
    $9.5 million, respectively, which we recorded from the date
    of acquisition of Fumapharm. The product has been in commercial
    use in Germany for approximately eleven years and is the most
    prescribed oral systemic treatment for severe psoriasis in
    Germany.

Late-Stage
    Product Candidates

BG-12

BG-12, an oral fumarate derivative, is an immunomodulatory with
    a novel mechanism of action with a combination of
    neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory properties. We acquired
    BG-12 with the purchase of



Fumapharm in June 2006. We completed a Phase 2b clinical study
    of BG-12 in patients with relapsing-remitting MS in October
    2005. In January 2006, we announced that this study had achieved
    its primary efficacy endpoint. Based on the results of the Phase
    2 study, we announced that we initiated a Phase 3 program of
    BG-12 in relapsing remitting MS in January 2007. Fumapharm has
    also completed a small Phase 3 study in Germany of BG-12 in
    psoriasis.

Galiximab/(ANTI-CD80
    Antibody)

The CD80 antigen is expressed on the surface of follicular and
    other lymphoma cells, and is also known as B7.1. In the fourth
    quarter of 2005, we completed a Phase 2a study designed to
    evaluate the anti-tumor activity of an anti-CD80 antibody,
    galiximab, that we developed using our
    Primatized

®

antibody technology in patients with relapsed non-Hodgkin’s
    lymphoma simultaneously receiving rituximab. In this study, the
    combination of the two antibodies was well tolerated, with
    observation of clinical responses in patients treated with
    higher doses. Based on the results of the Phase 2a study, we
    announced that we initiated a Phase 3 study of the antibody in
    relapsed non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma in combination with RITUXAN
    in January 2007. We anticipate initial data from a Cancer and
    Leukemia Group B trial using RITUXAN and galiximab combination
    therapy in previously untreated subjects with follicular
    non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma in 2008.

Lumiliximab/(ANTI-CD23
    Antibody)

The CD23 antigen is expressed on the surface of mature B-cells
    and other immune system cells, and is also known as Fc epsilon
    RII. We have completed a Phase 2a study designed to evaluate the
    anti-tumor activity of an anti-CD23 antibody that we developed
    using our
    Primatized

®

antibody technology when administered in combination with FCR, a
    standard chemotherapy, in patients with relapsed chronic
    lymphocytic leukemia, or CLL. In this study, the combination of
    lumiliximab with FCR was well tolerated, with observation of a
    high proportion of clinical complete responses in patients.
    Based on the results of the Phase 2a study, we announced that we
    initiated a Phase


/


study evaluating lumiximab plus FCR versus FCR alone in relapsed
    or refractory CLL in January 2007, which could lead to approval
    of the antibody if the study meets its endpoints.

Ocrelizumab/(Humanized
    ANTI-CD20 Antibody)

The second generation anti-CD20 (ocrelizumab) is a humanized
    monoclonal antibody directed against the CD20 surface antigen on
    human B-cells, the same antigen that RITUXAN targets. Anti-CD20
    antibodies work by binding to a particular protein (the CD20
    antigen) on the surface of normal and malignant B-cells. From
    there, they recruit the body’s natural defenses to attack
    and kill the marked B-cells. Genentech, with which we
    collaborate on this product candidate, initiated three Phase 3
    studies of ocrelizumab in rheumatoid arthritis in 2007, each
    targeting a separate patient group: those currently not on
    methotrexate, methotrexate inadequate responders and TNF
    inadequate responders. Genentech also initiated a Phase 3 study
    of ocrelizumab in SLE in the fourth quarter of 2007. We are
    currently in arbitration with Genentech as to whether Genentech
    has the right to develop collaboration products, including the
    second-generation humanized anti-CD20 molecule, without our
    approval. See “Item 3 — Legal
    Proceedings” for a description of that arbitration.

Lixivaptan

Lixivaptan is an oral compound for the potential treatment of
    hyponatremia. Cardiokine Biopharma LLC, with which we entered a
    collaboration in 2007, is planning a Phase 3 study of lixivaptan
    in congestive heart failure patients. Lixivaptan is a highly
    potent, non-peptide, selective V2 vasopressin receptor
    antagonist. It antagonizes the action of vasopressin (also known
    as antidiuretic hormone, ADH) on the V2 receptors in the
    kidney-collecting duct, causing water to be excreted from the
    kidney, without affecting sodium or other electrolytes. Based on
    this mechanism of action, lixivaptan shows promise in the
    treatment of disease states associated with water retention and
    electrolyte imbalance, including hyponatremia, which is the most
    common electrolyte disorder in clinical practice. Hyponatremia
    is recognized as an independent contributor to negative patient
    outcomes in many chronic diseases, most notably congestive heart
    failure, as well as cirrhosis and syndrome of inappropriate
    anti-diuretic hormone.

Pursuant to our 2007 collaboration, we made a $50 million
    upfront payment to Cardiokine Biopharma LLC and will make up to
    $170 million in additional milestone payments for
    successful development and global commercialization of
    lixivaptan, as well as royalties on commercial sales. We will be
    responsible for the global commercialization of lixivaptan, and
    Cardiokine Biopharma LLC has an option for limited copromotion
    in the United States.



Products
    We No Longer Sell

ZEVALIN

In December 2007, we sold the U.S. marketing, sales,
    manufacturing and development rights for ZEVALIN to Cell
    Therapeutics, Inc., or CTI, for an upfront purchase price of
    $10.0 million and up to an additional $20.0 million in
    milestone payments. In addition, we also will receive royalty
    payments on future sales of ZEVALIN. As part of the overall
    arrangement, we have entered into a contract with CTI to supply
    ZEVALIN product through 2014 and a related services and security
    agreement under which CTI has agreed to reimburse us for costs
    incurred in an ongoing randomized clinical trial for ZEVALIN
    with respect to aggressive non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. The
    $10.0 million upfront payment will be recognized in our
    consolidated statement of income over the term of the supply
    agreement. The royalty payments and proceeds from the supply
    contract are not expected to be significant.

The ZEVALIN therapeutic regimen is a radioimmunotherapy and part
    of a regimen that is approved for the treatment of patients with
    relapsed or refractory low-grade, or follicular, B-cell NHL,
    including patients with RITUXAN relapsed or refractory NHL. The
    current label also includes transformed B-cell NHL although we
    have asked the FDA to remove that indication as we found the
    post-marketing commitment studies necessary for that indication
    to not be feasible. ZEVALIN is approved in the EU for the
    treatment of adult patients with CD20-positive follicular B-cell
    NHL who are refractory to or have relapsed following RITUXAN
    therapy.

In 2007, sales of ZEVALIN in the U.S. generated revenues of
    $13.9 million, until we sold all U.S. rights in the
    product in December 2007 to CTI, as compared to revenues of
    $16.4 million in 2006. We will continue to sell ZEVALIN to
    Bayer Schering Pharma AG for distribution in the EU, and receive
    royalty revenues from Schering AG on sales of ZEVALIN in the EU.
    Rest of world product sales for ZEVALIN in 2007 and 2006 were
    $3.0 and $1.4 million, respectively.

AMEVIVE

We sold all rights in AMEVIVE to Astellas Pharma US, Inc., or
    Astellas, in the second quarter of 2006. AMEVIVE is approved in
    the U.S. and other countries for the treatment of adult
    patients with moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis who
    are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy. Under the
    terms of the agreement with Astellas, we will continue to
    manufacture AMEVIVE and supply product to Astellas for a period
    of up to 11 years. Under the terms of the supply agreement,
    we charge Astellas fixed amounts based on volume. Such amounts
    will be recognized as corporate partner revenue and are not
    expected to be significant.



Our Other
    Research and Development Programs

We intend to continue to commit significant resources to
    research and development opportunities. We intend to focus our
    research and development efforts on finding novel therapeutics
    in areas of high unmet medical need. Our core focus areas are in
    oncology, neurology, immunology and cardiology, but our research
    and development efforts extend to additional therapeutic areas

Research
    and Development Costs

For the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005, our
    research and development costs were $925.2 million,
    $718.4 million, and $747.7 million, respectively.
    Additionally, in 2007, we incurred $84.2 million in charges
    associated with acquired in-process research and development in
    connection with the acquisition of Syntonix and our
    collaborations with Cardiokine Biopharma LLC and Neurimmune
    SubOne AG.

Principal
    Licensed Products

As described above, we receive royalties on sales of RITUXAN
    outside the U.S. as part of our collaboration with
    Genentech and royalties on sales of ZEVALIN outside the
    U.S. from Bayer Schering Pharma AG and will



receive royalties on U.S. sales of ZEVALIN from CTI. We
    also receive royalties from sales by our licensees of a number
    of other products covered under patents that we control. For
    example:

•

We receive royalties from Schering-Plough Corporation, or
    Schering-Plough, on sales of its alpha interferon products in
    the U.S. under an exclusive license to our alpha interferon
    patents and patent applications. Schering-Plough sells its
    INTRON

®

A (interferon alfa-2b) brand of alpha interferon in the
    U.S. for a number of indications, including the treatment
    of chronic hepatitis B and hepatitis C. Schering-Plough
    also sells other alpha interferon products for the treatment of
    hepatitis C, including
    REBETRON

®

Combination Therapy containing INTRON A and
    REBETOL

®

(ribavirin, USP),
    PEG-INTRON

®

(peginterferon alfa-2b), a pegylated form of alpha interferon,
    and PEG-INTRON in combination with REBETOL. For a discussion of
    the length of royalty obligations of Schering-Plough, see
    “Patents and Other Proprietary Rights —
    Recombinant Alpha Interferon.”

•

We hold several patents related to hepatitis B antigens produced
    by genetic engineering techniques. See “Patents and Other
    Proprietary Rights — Recombinant Hepatitis B
    Antigens.” These antigens are used in recombinant hepatitis
    B vaccines and in diagnostic test kits used to detect hepatitis
    B infection. We receive royalties from sales of hepatitis B
    vaccines in several countries, including the U.S., from
    GlaxoSmithKline plc, or GlaxoSmithKline, and Merck and Co. Inc.,
    or Merck. We have also licensed our proprietary hepatitis B
    rights, on an

antigen-by-antigen

and nonexclusive basis, to several diagnostic kit manufacturers,
    including Abbott Laboratories, the major worldwide marketer of
    hepatitis B diagnostic kits. For a discussion of the length of
    the royalty obligation of GlaxoSmithKline and Merck on sales of
    hepatitis B vaccines and the obligation of our other licensees
    on sales of hepatitis B-related diagnostic products, see
    “Patents and Other Proprietary Rights —
    Recombinant Hepatitis B Antigens.”

•

We also receive ongoing royalties on sales of
    ANGIOMAX

®

(bivalirudin) by The Medicines Company, or TMC. TMC sells
    ANGIOMAX in the U.S., Europe, Canada and Latin America for use
    as an anticoagulant in combination with aspirin in patients with
    unstable angina undergoing percutaneous transluminal coronary
    angioplasty.

Patents
    and Other Proprietary Rights

We have filed numerous patent applications in the U.S. and
    various other countries seeking protection of inventions
    originating from our research and development, including a
    number of our processes and products. Patents have been issued
    on many of these applications. We have also obtained rights to
    various patents and patent applications under licenses with
    third parties, which provide for the payment of royalties by us.
    The ultimate degree of patent protection that will be afforded
    to biotechnology products and processes, including ours, in the
    U.S. and in other important markets remains uncertain and
    is dependent upon the scope of protection decided upon by the
    patent offices, courts and lawmakers in these countries. There
    is no certainty that our existing patents or others, if
    obtained, will afford us substantial protection or commercial
    benefit. Similarly, there is no assurance that our pending
    patent applications or patent applications licensed from third
    parties will ultimately be granted as patents or that those
    patents that have been issued or are issued in the future will
    stand if they are challenged in court.

A substantial number of patents have already been issued to
    other biotechnology and biopharmaceutical companies. Competitors
    may have filed applications for, or have been issued patents and
    may obtain additional patents and proprietary rights that may
    relate to products or processes competitive with or similar to
    our products and processes. Moreover, the patent laws of the
    U.S. and foreign countries are distinct and decisions as to
    patenting, validity of patents and infringement of patents may
    be resolved differently in different countries. In general, we
    try to obtain licenses to third party patents, which we deem
    necessary or desirable for the manufacture, use and sale of our
    products. We are currently unable to assess the extent to which
    we may wish to or may be required to acquire rights under such
    patents and the availability and cost of acquiring such rights,
    or whether a license to such patents will be available on
    acceptable terms or at all. There may be patents in the
    U.S. or in foreign countries or patents issued in the
    future that are unavailable to license on acceptable terms. Our
    inability to obtain such licenses may hinder our ability to
    market our products.

We are aware that others, including various universities and
    companies working in the biotechnology field, have filed patent
    applications and have been granted patents in the U.S. and
    in other countries claiming subject matter potentially useful to
    our business. Some of those patents and patent applications
    claim only specific products



or methods of making such products, while others claim more
    general processes or techniques useful or now used in the
    biotechnology industry. There is considerable uncertainty within
    the biotechnology industry about the validity, scope and
    enforceability of many issued patents in the U.S. and
    elsewhere in the world, and, to date, there is no consistent
    policy regarding the breadth of claims allowed in biotechnology
    patents. We cannot currently determine the ultimate scope and
    validity of patents which may be granted to third parties in the
    future or which patents might be asserted to be infringed by the
    manufacture, use and sale of our products.

There has been, and we expect that there may continue to be,
    significant litigation in the industry regarding patents and
    other intellectual property rights. We expect that litigation
    may be necessary in some instances to determine the validity and
    scope of certain of our proprietary rights. Conversely,
    litigation may be necessary in some instances to determine the
    validity, scope

and/or

noninfringement of certain patent rights claimed by third
    parties to be pertinent to the manufacture, use or sale of our
    products. Intellectual property litigation could therefore
    create business uncertainty and consume substantial financial
    and human resources. Ultimately, the outcome of such litigation
    could adversely affect the validity and scope of our patent or
    other proprietary rights, or, conversely, hinder our ability to
    market our products. See “Item 3 — Legal
    Proceedings” for a description of our patent litigation.

Our trademarks RITUXAN and AVONEX are important to us and are
    generally covered by trademark applications or registrations
    owned or controlled by us in the U.S. Patent and Trademark
    Office and in other countries. We employ other trademarks in the
    conduct of our business under license by third parties, for
    example, we utilize the mark TYSABRI under license from Elan.

Recombinant
    Beta Interferon

Third parties have pending patent applications or issued patents
    in the U.S., Europe and other countries with claims to key
    intermediates in the production of beta interferon. These are
    known as the Taniguchi patents. Third parties also have pending
    patent applications or issued patents with claims to beta
    interferon itself. These are known as the Roche patents and the
    Rentschler patents, respectively. We have obtained non-exclusive
    rights in various countries of the world, including the U.S.,
    Japan and Europe, to manufacture, use and sell AVONEX, our brand
    of recombinant beta interferon, under the Taniguchi, Roche and
    Rentschler issued patents. The last of the Taniguchi patents
    expire in the U.S. in May 2013 and have expired already in
    other countries of the world. The Roche patents expire in the
    U.S. in May 2008 and also have generally expired elsewhere
    in the world. The Rentschler EU patent expires in July 2012.

RITUXAN
    and Anti-CD20 Antibodies

We have several issued U.S. patents and U.S. patent
    applications, and numerous corresponding foreign counterparts
    directed to anti-CD20 antibody technology, including RITUXAN. We
    have also been granted patents covering RITUXAN by the European
    and Japanese Patent Offices. In the U.S. our principal
    patents covering the drugs or their uses expire between 2015 and
    2018. With regard to the rest of the world, our principal
    patents covering the drug products expire in 2013 subject to
    potential patent term extensions in countries where such
    extensions are available. Our recently-granted patent in certain
    European countries claiming the treatment with anti-CD20
    antibodies of certain auto-immune indications, including
    rheumatoid arthritis, has been opposed by numerous third
    parties. This opposition proceeding is likely to be protracted
    and its outcome is uncertain at this time.

In addition Genentech, our collaborative partner for RITUXAN,
    has secured an exclusive license to five U.S. patents and
    counterpart U.S. and foreign patent applications assigned
    to Xoma Corporation that relate to chimeric antibodies against
    the CD20 antigen. These patents expire between 2007 and 2014.
    Genentech has granted us a non-exclusive sublicense to make,
    have made, use and sell RITUXAN under these patents and patent
    applications. We, along with Genentech, share the cost of any
    royalties due to Xoma in the Genentech/Biogen Idec copromotion
    territory on sales of RITUXAN. In addition, we and our
    collaborator, Genentech, have filed numerous patent applications
    directed to anti-CD20 antibodies and their uses to treat various
    diseases. These pending patent applications have the potential
    of issuing as patents in the U.S. and abroad covering
    anti-CD20 antibody molecules for periods beyond that stated
    above for RITUXAN.

Recombinant
    Alpha Interferon

In 1979, we granted an exclusive worldwide license to
    Schering-Plough under our alpha interferon patents. Most of our
    alpha interferon patents have since expired, including
    expiration of patents in the U.S., Japan and all



countries of Europe. Schering-Plough pays us royalty payments on
    U.S. sales of alpha interferon products under an
    interference settlement entered into in 1998. Under the terms of
    the interference settlement, Schering-Plough agreed to pay us
    royalties under certain patents to be issued to Roche and
    Genentech in consideration of our assignment to Schering-Plough
    of the alpha interferon patent application that had been the
    subject of a settled interference with respect to a
    Roche/Genentech patent. Schering-Plough entered into an
    agreement with Roche as part of settlement of the interference.
    The first of the Roche/Genentech patents was issued on
    November 19, 2002 and has a seventeen-year term. In 2007,
    we received notice that our pending patent application in Canada
    was allowable and paid the issue fee. We expect the patent to
    issue in 2008. Upon issuance of the patent, Schering-Plough will
    be obligated to pay us royalties on sales of alpha interferon
    products in Canada until expiration of the patent in 2025.

Recombinant
    Hepatitis B Antigens

We have obtained numerous patents in countries around the world,
    including in the U.S. and in European countries, covering
    the recombinant production of hepatitis B surface, core and
    “e” antigens. We have licensed our recombinant
    hepatitis B antigen patent rights to manufacturers and marketers
    of hepatitis B vaccines and diagnostic test kits, and receive
    royalties on sales of the vaccines and test kits by our
    licensees. See “Principal Licensed Products.” The
    obligation of GlaxoSmithKline and Merck to pay royalties on
    sales of hepatitis B vaccines and the obligation of our other
    licensees under our hepatitis B patents to pay royalties on
    sales of diagnostic products will terminate upon expiration of
    our hepatitis B patents in each licensed country. Following the
    conclusion of a successful interference proceeding in the U.S.,
    we were granted patents in the U.S. expiring in 2018. These
    patents claim hepatitis B virus polypeptides and vaccines and
    diagnostics containing such polypeptides. Our European hepatitis
    B patents expired at the end of 1999 and have also since expired
    in those countries in which we have obtained supplementary
    protection certificates. See “Item 3 — Legal
    Proceedings” for a description of our litigation with
    Classen Immunotherapies, Inc.

TYSABRI

We are developing TYSABRI in collaboration with Elan. TYSABRI is
    presently claimed in a number of pending patent applications and
    issued patents held by both companies in the U.S. and
    abroad. These patent applications and patents cover the protein,
    DNA encoding the protein, manufacturing methods and
    pharmaceutical compositions, as well as various methods of
    treatment using the product. In the U.S. the principal
    patents covering the product and methods of manufacturing the
    product generally expire between 2014 and 2020, subject to any
    available patent term extensions. In the remainder of the world
    patents on the product and methods of manufacturing the product
    generally expire between 2014 and 2016, subject to any
    supplemental protection certificates that may be obtained. Both
    companies have method of treatment patents for a variety of
    indications including the treatment of MS and Crohn’s
    disease and treatments of inflammation. These patents expire in
    the U.S. generally between 2012 and 2020 and outside the
    U.S. generally between 2012 and 2016, subject to any
    available patent term extensions

and/or

supplemental protection certificates extending such terms.

Trade
    Secrets and Confidential Know-How

We also rely upon unpatented trade secrets, and we cannot assure
    that others will not independently develop substantially
    equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise
    gain access to our trade secrets or disclose such technology, or
    that we can meaningfully protect such rights. We require our
    employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators,
    scientists whose research we sponsor and other advisers to
    execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of
    employment or consulting relationships with us. These agreements
    provide that all confidential information developed or made
    known to the individual during the course of the
    individual’s relationship with us is to be kept
    confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in
    specific circumstances. In the case of our employees, the
    agreement provides that all inventions conceived by such
    employees shall be our exclusive property. These agreements may
    not provide meaningful protection or adequate remedies for our
    trade secrets in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of
    such information.

Sales,
    Marketing and Distribution

Our sales and marketing efforts are generally focused on
    specialist physicians in private practice or at major medical
    centers. We utilize common pharmaceutical company practices to
    market our products and to educate



physicians, including sales representatives calling on
    individual physicians, advertisements, professional symposia,
    direct mail, selling initiatives, public relations and other
    methods. We provide customer service and other related programs
    for our products, such as disease and product-specific websites,
    insurance research services and order, delivery and fulfillment
    services. We have also established programs in the U.S., which
    provide qualified uninsured or underinsured patients with
    commercial products at no charge. Specifics concerning the
    sales, marketing and distribution of each of our commercialized
    products are as follows:

AVONEX

We continue to focus our marketing and sales activities on
    maximizing the potential of AVONEX in the U.S. and the EU
    in the face of increased competition. In the U.S., Canada,
    Brazil, Australia, Japan and most of the major countries of the
    EU, we use our own sales forces and marketing groups to market
    and sell AVONEX. In these countries, we distribute AVONEX
    principally through wholesale distributors of pharmaceutical
    products, mail order specialty distributors or shipping service
    providers. In countries outside the U.S., Canada, Brazil,
    Australia and the major countries of the EU, we sell AVONEX to
    distribution partners who are then responsible for most
    marketing and distribution activities.

TYSABRI

The party principally responsible for marketing TYSABRI depends
    upon the indication. For multiple sclerosis, we have the lead
    and we use our own sales force and marketing group to market
    TYSABRI in the U.S. and Europe. Elan has the lead in
    Crohn’s disease and uses their sales force and marketing
    group to market TYSABRI in the U.S. Elan distributes
    TYSABRI in the U.S. and we distribute TYSABRI in Europe.

RITUXAN

We market and sell RITUXAN in the U.S. in collaboration
    with Genentech. We, along with Genentech, have sales and
    marketing staffs dedicated to RITUXAN. Sales efforts for RITUXAN
    as a treatment for B-cell NHLs are focused on hematologists and
    medical oncologists in private practice, at community hospitals
    and at major medical centers in the U.S. Sales efforts for
    RITUXAN as a treatment for RA are focused on rheumatologists in
    private practice, at community hospitals and at major medical
    centers in the U.S.

Most B-cell NHLs are treated today in community-based group
    oncology practices. RITUXAN fits well into the community
    practice, as generally no special equipment, training or
    licensing is required for its administration or for management
    of treatment-related side effects.

RITUXAN is generally sold to wholesalers and specialty
    distributors and directly to hospital pharmacies. Genentech
    provides marketing support services for RITUXAN including
    customer service, order entry, shipping, billing, insurance
    verification assistance, managed care sales support, medical
    information and sales training. Under our agreement with
    Genentech, all U.S. sales of RITUXAN are recognized by
    Genentech and we record our share of the pretax copromotion
    profits on a quarterly basis.

FUMADERM

FUMADERM has been approved in Germany since 1994 for the
    treatment of severe psoriasis. FUMADERM is produced by
    Fumapharm, which we acquired in June 2006. In December 2006, we
    acquired the right to distribute FUMADERM in Germany from
    Fumedica effective May 1, 2007. Fumedica continued to
    distribute the product until that time. Effective May 1,
    2007, we began to promote FUMADERM in Germany through Almirall,
    a third party service provider.

ZEVALIN

In December 2007, we sold the U.S. marketing, sales
    manufacturing and development rights to CTI. Under the terms of
    the sale, we have entered a contract with CTI to supply ZEVALIN
    product through 2014. In the EU, we sell ZEVALIN to Bayer
    Schering Pharma AG, our exclusive licensee for ZEVALIN outside
    the U.S.



AMEVIVE

We sold the rights in AMEVIVE to Astellas Pharma US, Inc. in the
    second quarter of 2006. Under the terms of the sale agreement
    with Astellas, we will continue to manufacture AMEVIVE and
    supply product to Astellas for a period of up to 11 years.

Competition

Competition in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries
    is intense and comes from many and varied sources. We do not
    believe that any of the industry leaders can be considered
    dominant in view of the rapid technological change in the
    industry. We experience significant competition from specialized
    biotechnology firms in the U.S., the EU and elsewhere and from
    many large pharmaceutical, chemical and other companies. Certain
    of these companies have substantially greater financial,
    marketing, research and development and human resources than we
    do. Most large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies have
    considerable experience in undertaking clinical trials and in
    obtaining regulatory approval to market pharmaceutical products.

We believe that competition and leadership in the industry will
    be based on managerial and technological superiority and
    establishing proprietary positions through research and
    development. Leadership in the industry may also be influenced
    significantly by patents and other forms of protection of
    proprietary information. A key aspect of such competition is
    recruiting and retaining qualified scientists and technicians.
    We believe that we have been successful in attracting skilled
    and experienced scientific personnel. The achievement of a
    leadership position also depends largely upon our ability to
    identify and exploit commercially the products resulting from
    research and the availability of adequate financial resources to
    fund facilities, equipment, personnel, clinical testing,
    manufacturing and marketing.

Competition among products approved for sale may be based, among
    other things, on patent position, product efficacy, safety,
    convenience, reliability, availability and price. Many of our
    competitors are working to develop products similar to those
    that we are developing. The timing of the entry of a new
    pharmaceutical product into the market can be an important
    factor in determining the product’s eventual success and
    profitability. Early entry may have important advantages in
    gaining product acceptance and market share. Moreover, under the
    Orphan Drug Act, the FDA is prevented for a period of seven
    years from approving more than one application for the
    “same” product for the same indication in certain
    diseases with limited patient populations, unless a later
    product is considered clinically superior. The EU has similar
    laws and other jurisdictions have or are considering such laws.
    Accordingly, the relative speed with which we can develop
    products, complete the testing and approval process and supply
    commercial quantities of the product to the market will have an
    important impact on our competitive position.

After a patent expiry for a product, an abbreviated process
    exists for approval of small molecule drugs in the
    U.S. that are comparable to existing products, also known
    as generics. In Europe, the EMEA has issued guidelines for
    approval, and the first biosimilars, or follow-on large molecule
    drugs, have been approved. It is possible that legislative and
    regulatory bodies in the U.S. may provide a similar
    abbreviated process for comparable biologic products. See
    “Regulatory — Regulation of
    Pharmaceuticals — Biosimilars.”

AVONEX
    AND TYSABRI

AVONEX, which generated $1.9 billion of worldwide revenues
    in 2007, and TYSABRI, which generated $230 million of
    worldwide revenues for us in 2007, both compete primarily with
    three other products:

•

REBIF (

interferon-beta-1a

), which is copromoted by EMD
    Serono (a subsidiary of Merck Serono) and Pfizer in the
    U.S. and sold by Merck Serono in Europe. REBIF generated
    worldwide revenues of approximately $1.5 billion in 2006.

•

BETASERON (

interferon-beta-1b

), sold by Bayer Healthcare
    Pharmaceuticals (the U.S. pharmaceuticals affiliate of
    Bayer Schering Pharma AG) in the U.S. and sold under the
    name

Along with us, a number of companies are working to develop
    products to treat MS that may in the future compete with AVONEX
    and TYSABRI. Some of our current competitors are also working to
    develop alternative formulations for delivery of their products,
    which may in the future compete with AVONEX and TYSABRI.

AVONEX and TYSABRI also face competition from off-label uses of
    drugs approved for other indications.

RITUXAN— B-CELL
    NHLs

A number of other companies, including us, are working to
    develop products to treat B-cell NHLs and other forms of
    non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma that may ultimately compete with
    RITUXAN. Other potential competitors include
    Campath

®

(Berlex, Inc.), which is indicated for B-cell chronic
    lymphocytic leukemia (an unapproved use of RITUXAN),
    Velcade

®

(Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) which is indicated for
    multiple myeloma (an unapproved use of RITUXAN),
    Trianda

®

(Cephalon), and HuMax-CD20 (GenMab), which is in late-stage
    development for refractory CLL and NHL. In addition to the
    foregoing products, we are aware of other anti-CD20 molecules in
    development that, if successfully developed and registered, may
    compete with RITUXAN.

RITUXAN
    IN RA

RITUXAN, in combination with methotrexate, is approved for
    reducing signs and symptoms and to slow the progression of
    structural damage in adult patients with moderately-to-severely
    active RA who have had an inadequate response to one or more TNF
    antagonist therapies. RITUXAN will compete with several
    different types of therapies in the RA market, including:

•

traditional therapies for RA, including disease-modifying
    anti-rheumatic drugs, such as steroids, methotrexate and
    cyclosporine, and pain relievers such as acetaminophen;

•

anti-TNF therapies, such as
    REMICADE

®

(infliximab), a drug sold worldwide by Centocor, Inc., a
    subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson,
    HUMIRA

®

(adalimumab), a drug sold by Abbott Laboratories, and
    ENBREL

®

(etanercept), a drug sold by Amgen, Inc. and Wyeth
    Pharmaceuticals, Inc.;

•

ORENCIA

®

(abatacept), a drug developed by Bristol-Myers Squibb Company,
    which was approved by the FDA to treat moderate-to-severe RA in
    December 2005;

•

drugs in late-stage development for RA; and

•

drugs approved for other indications that are used to treat RA.

In addition, a number of other companies, including us, are
    working to develop products to treat RA that may ultimately
    compete with RITUXAN in the RA marketplace.

Regulatory

Our current and contemplated activities and the products and
    processes that will result from such activities are subject to
    substantial government regulation.

Regulation
    of Pharmaceuticals

Before new pharmaceutical products may be sold in the
    U.S. and other countries, clinical trials of the products
    must be conducted and the results submitted to appropriate
    regulatory agencies for approval. Clinical trial programs must
    establish efficacy, determine an appropriate dose and regimen,
    and define the conditions for safe use, a high-risk process that
    requires stepwise clinical studies in which the candidate
    product must successfully meet predetermined endpoints. The
    results of the preclinical and clinical testing of a product are
    then submitted to the FDA in the form of a Biologics License
    Application, or BLA, or a New Drug Application, or NDA. In
    response to a BLA or NDA, the FDA may grant marketing approval,
    request additional information or deny the application if it
    determines the application does not provide an adequate basis
    for approval. Similar submissions are required by



authorities in other jurisdictions who independently assess the
    product and may reach the same or different conclusions. The
    receipt of regulatory approval often takes a number of years,
    involving the expenditure of substantial resources and depends
    on a number of factors, including the severity of the disease in
    question, the availability of alternative treatments and the
    risks and benefits demonstrated in clinical trials. On occasion,
    regulatory authorities may require larger or additional studies,
    leading to unanticipated delay or expense. Even after initial
    FDA approval or approvals from other regulatory agencies have
    been obtained, further clinical trials may be required to
    provide additional data on safety and effectiveness and are
    required to gain clearance for the use of a product as a
    treatment for indications other than those initially approved.
    The FDA may grant “accelerated approval” status to
    products that treat serious or life-threatening illnesses and
    that provide meaningful therapeutic benefits to patients over
    existing treatments, but accelerated approval status does not
    ensure that FDA will ultimately approve the product. Under this
    pathway, the FDA may approve a product based on surrogate
    endpoints, or clinical endpoints other than survival or
    irreversible morbidity, or when the product is shown to be
    effective but can be safely used only if access to or
    distribution of the product is restricted. When approval is
    based on surrogate endpoints or clinical endpoints other than
    survival or morbidity, the sponsor will be required to conduct
    additional clinical studies to verify and describe clinical
    benefit. When accelerated approval requires restricted use or
    distribution, the sponsor may be required to establish rigorous
    systems to assure use of the product under safe conditions.
    These systems are usually referred to as Risk Minimization
    Action Plans, or RiskMAPs, or Risk Evaluation and Mitigation
    Strategies, or REMS. In addition, for all products approved
    under accelerated approval, sponsors must submit all copies of
    its promotional materials, including advertisements, to the FDA
    at least thirty days prior to their initial dissemination. The
    FDA may also withdraw approval under accelerated approval after
    a hearing if, for instance, post-marketing studies fail to
    verify any clinical benefit or it becomes clear that
    restrictions on the distribution of the product are inadequate
    to ensure its safe use. The BLA for TYSABRI in MS was initially
    approved under the accelerated approval pathway based on
    surrogate endpoints. A stringent restricted distribution program
    was also imposed.

The supplemental BLA for TYSABRI for second-line treatment of
    Crohn’s disease was approved by FDA on January 14,
    2008. This product will be subject to the same stringent
    distribution restrictions as TYSABRI for MS.

We cannot be certain that the FDA will approve any products for
    the proposed indications whether under accelerated approval or
    another pathway. If the FDA approves products or new
    indications, the agency may require us to conduct additional
    post-marketing studies. If we fail to conduct the required
    studies or otherwise fail to comply with the conditions of
    accelerated approval, the FDA may take action to seek to
    withdraw that approval. Legislation has recently been passed in
    the U.S. to also provide the FDA with additional powers of
    sanction regarding non-completion of or non-compliance with
    certain post-marketing commitments, including RiskMAPs/REMS. In
    Europe, the EMEA has new powers of sanction for non-completion
    of post-marketing commitments. These range from a fine of 10% of
    global revenue to removal of the product from the market.

Regulatory authorities track information on side effects and
    adverse events reported during clinical studies and after
    marketing approval. Non-compliance with FDA safety reporting
    requirements may result in FDA regulatory action that may
    include civil action or criminal penalties. Side effects or
    adverse events that are reported during clinical trials can
    delay, impede, or prevent marketing approval. Similarly, adverse
    events that are reported after marketing approval can result in
    additional limitations being placed on the product’s use
    and, potentially, withdrawal or suspension of the product from
    the market. For example, in February 2005, in consultation with
    the FDA, we and Elan voluntarily suspended the marketing and
    commercial distribution of TYSABRI, and informed physicians that
    they should suspend dosing of TYSABRI until further
    notification. In addition, we suspended dosing in clinical
    studies of TYSABRI in MS, Crohn’s disease and RA. These
    decisions were based on reports of two cases of PML, a rare and
    frequently fatal, demyelinating disease of the central nervous
    system, that occurred in patients treated with TYSABRI in
    clinical studies. See “Our Products and Late Stage Product
    Candidates — Approved Indications and Ongoing
    Development — TYSABRI.” Any adverse event, either
    before or after marketing approval, could result in product
    liability claims against us. See the sections of
    “Item 1A — Risk Factors” entitled
    “Our near terms success depends on the market acceptance
    and successful sales growth of TYSABRI” and “Pending
    and future product liability claims may adversely affect our
    business and our reputation.”

Furthermore, recently enacted legislation provides the FDA with
    expanded authority over drug products after approval. This
    legislation enhances the FDA’s authority with respect to
    post-marketing safety surveillance,



including, among other things, the authority to require
    additional post-approval studies or clinical trials and mandate
    label changes as a result of safety findings. These requirements
    may affect our ability to maintain marketing approval of our
    products or require us to make significant expenditures to
    obtain or maintain such approvals.

If we seek to make certain changes to an approved product, such
    as adding a new indication, making certain manufacturing
    changes, or changing manufacturers or suppliers of certain
    ingredients or components, we will need review and approval of
    regulatory authorities, including FDA and EMEA, before the
    changes can be implemented.

Orphan Drug Act.

Under the U.S. Orphan
    Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs
    intended to treat a “rare disease or condition,” which
    generally is a disease or condition that affects fewer than
    200,000 individuals in the U.S. Orphan drug designation
    must be requested before submitting a BLA or NDA. After the FDA
    grants orphan drug designation, the generic identity of the
    therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are publicly
    disclosed by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey
    any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory
    review and approval process. If a product which has an orphan
    drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval
    for the indication for which it has such designation, the
    product is entitled to orphan exclusivity, i.e., the FDA may not
    approve any other applications to market the same drug for the
    same indication for a period of seven years following marketing
    approval, except in certain very limited circumstances, such as
    if the later product is shown to be clinically superior to the
    orphan product.

Biosimilars.

Most of our marketed products,
    including AVONEX, RITUXAN and TYSABRI, are licensed under the
    Public Health Service Act as biological products. Unlike small
    molecule drugs, which are subject to the generic drug provisions
    (Hatch-Waxman Act) of the U.S. Food, Drug, and Cosmetic
    Act, as described below, there currently is no process in the
    U.S. for the submission or approval of biological products
    based upon abbreviated data packages or a showing of sameness to
    another approved product. There is public dialogue at FDA and in
    the Congress, however, regarding the scientific and statutory
    basis upon which such products, known as biosimilars or
    follow-on biologics, could be approved and marketed in the
    U.S. We cannot be certain when, or if, Congress will create
    a statutory pathway for the approval of biosimilars. We cannot
    predict what impact, if any, the approval of biosimilars would
    have on the sales of our products.

In Europe, however, the EMEA has issued guidelines for approval
    of biological products through an abbreviated pathway, and the
    first biosimilars have been approved. If a biosimilar version of
    one of our products were approved in Europe, it could have a
    negative effect on sales of that product.

Small molecule generics.

We are developing
    small molecule products. If development is successful, these
    products may be approved as drugs under the U.S. Food,
    Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Under the Drug Price Competition and
    Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, also known as the
    Hatch-Waxman Act, Congress created two pathways for FDA review
    and approval of “generic” versions of pioneer small
    molecule drug products. The first is the abbreviated new drug
    application, or ANDA, a type of application in which approval is
    based on a showing of “sameness” to an already
    approved drug product. An ANDA need not contain full reports of
    safety and effectiveness, but rather must demonstrate that a
    proposed product is “the same as” a reference
    brand-name product. An ANDA applicant is also required to
    demonstrate the “bioequivalence” of its product to the
    reference product. The second pathway is a 505(b)(2)
    application, or an NDA in which one or more of the
    investigations relied upon by the applicant for approval was not
    conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant
    has not obtained a right of reference or use from the person by
    or for whom the investigation was conducted. A 505(b)(2)
    applicant must provide the FDA with any additional clinical data
    necessary to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the
    product with the proposed change(s).

The Hatch-Waxman Act also provides for the restoration of a
    portion of the patent term lost during small molecule product
    development. In addition, the statute establishes a complex set
    of processes for notifying sponsors of pioneer products of ANDA
    and 505(b)(2) applications that may infringe patents and to
    permit sponsors of pioneer drugs an opportunity to pursue patent
    litigation prior to FDA approval of the generic product. The
    Hatch-Waxman Act also awards non-patent marketing exclusivities
    to qualifying pioneer drug products. For example, the first
    applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a product that contains
    an active ingredient not found in any other approved product is
    awarded five years of “new chemical entity” marketing
    exclusivity. Where this exclusivity is awarded, the FDA is
    prohibited , with some exception, from accepting any ANDAs or
    505(b)(2) applications during



the five-year period. The Hatch-Waxman Act also provides three
    years of marketing exclusivity for the approval of NDAs,
    505(b)(2) applications, and supplements, where those
    applications contain the results of new clinical investigations
    (other than bioavailability studies) essential to the FDA’s
    approval of the applications. Three-year exclusivity prohibits
    the final FDA approval of ANDAs or 505(b)(2) applications for
    products with the specific changes associated with those
    clinical investigations. It does not necessarily prohibit the
    FDA from approving an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application for a
    product containing the same active ingredient. For example, if
    clinical investigations supported a new indication, three-year
    exclusivity would not block FDA approval of an ANDA or 505(b)(2)
    application for a product where the new indication has been
    carved out or omitted from the label.

Good manufacturing practices.

The FDA, the
    EMEA and other regulatory agencies regulate and inspect
    equipment, facilities, and processes used in the manufacturing
    of pharmaceutical and biologic products prior to approving a
    product. If, after receiving clearance from regulatory agencies,
    a company makes a material change in manufacturing equipment,
    location, or process, additional regulatory review and approval
    may be required. We also must adhere to current Good
    Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, and product-specific
    regulations enforced by the FDA following product approval. The
    FDA, the EMEA and other regulatory agencies also conduct
    regular, periodic visits to re-inspect equipment, facilities,
    and processes following the initial approval of a product. If,
    as a result of these inspections, it is determined that our
    equipment, facilities, or processes do not comply with
    applicable regulations and conditions of product approval,
    regulatory agencies may seek civil, criminal, or administrative
    sanctions

and/or

remedies against us, including the suspension of our
    manufacturing operations.

In addition, the FDA regulates all advertising and promotion
    activities for products under its jurisdiction both prior to and
    after approval. A company can make only those claims relating to
    safety and efficacy that are approved by the FDA. Physicians may
    prescribe legally available drugs for uses that are not
    described in the drug’s labeling and that differ from those
    tested by us and approved by the FDA. Such off-label uses are
    common across medical specialties, and often reflect a
    physician’s belief that the off-label use is the best
    treatment for the patients. The FDA does not regulate the
    behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments, but the
    FDA regulations do impose stringent restrictions on
    manufacturers’ communications regarding off-label uses.
    Failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements may subject a
    company to adverse publicity, enforcement action by the FDA,
    corrective advertising, and the full range of civil and criminal
    penalties available to the FDA.

Regulation Outside
    the U.S.

In the EU, Canada, and Australia, regulatory requirements and
    approval processes are similar in principle to those in the
    U.S. depending on the type of drug for which approval is
    sought. There are currently three potential tracks for marketing
    approval in EU countries: mutual recognition, decentralized
    procedures, and centralized procedures. These review mechanisms
    may ultimately lead to approval in all EU countries, but each
    method grants all participating countries some decision-making
    authority in product approval.

Sales,
    Marketing and Product Pricing

In the U.S., the federal government regularly considers
    reforming health care coverage and costs. For example, reforms
    to Medicare have reduced the reimbursement rates for many of our
    products. Effective January 1, 2005, Medicare pays
    physicians and suppliers that furnish our products under a
    payment methodology using average sales price, or ASP,
    information. Manufacturers, including us, are required to
    provide ASP information to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid
    Services on a quarterly basis. The manufacturer submitted
    information is used to compute Medicare payment rates, which are
    set at ASP plus 6 percent, updated quarterly. There is a
    mechanism for comparison of such payment rates to widely
    available market prices, which could cause further decreases in
    Medicare payment rates, although this mechanism has yet to be
    utilized. Effective January 1, 2006, Medicare began to use
    the same ASP plus 6 percent payment methodology to
    determine Medicare rates paid for products furnished by hospital
    outpatient departments. As of January 1, 2008, the
    reimbursement rate in the hospital outpatient setting will be
    ASP plus 5 percent. If a manufacturer is found to have made
    a misrepresentation in the reporting of ASP, the statute
    provides for civil monetary penalties of up to $10,000 for each
    misrepresentation and for each day in which the
    misrepresentation was applied.



Another payment reform is the addition of an expanded
    prescription drug benefit for all Medicare beneficiaries known
    as Medicare Part D. This is a voluntary benefit that is
    being implemented through private plans under contractual
    arrangements with the federal government. Like pharmaceutical
    coverage through private health insurance, Part D plans
    establish formularies that govern the drugs and biologicals that
    will be offered and the out- of-pocket obligations for such
    products. In addition, plans are expected to negotiate discounts
    from drug manufacturers and pass on some of those savings to
    Medicare beneficiaries.

Future legislation or regulatory actions implementing recent or
    future legislation may have a significant effect on our
    business. Our ability to successfully commercialize products may
    depend in part on the extent to which reimbursement for the
    costs of our products and related treatments will be available
    in the U.S. and worldwide from government health
    administration authorities, private health insurers and other
    organizations. Substantial uncertainty exists as to the
    reimbursement status of newly approved health care products by
    third party payors.

We also participate in the Medicaid rebate program established
    by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990, and under
    multiple subsequent amendments of that law. Sections 6001,
    6002, and 6003 of the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, or DRA,
    made significant changes to the Medicaid prescription drug
    provisions of the Social Security Act. These changes include,
    but are not limited to, revising the definition of average
    manufacturer price, or AMP, establishing an obligation to report
    AMP on a monthly basis, in addition to a quarterly basis,
    establishing a new formula for calculating Federal upper limits,
    or FULs, requiring rebates for certain physician-administered
    drugs, and clarifying rebate liability for authorized generic
    drugs. Under the Medicaid rebate program, we pay a rebate for
    each unit of product reimbursed by Medicaid. The amount of the
    rebate for each product is set by law as the larger of, 15.1% of
    AMP or the difference between AMP and the best price available
    from us to any commercial or non-governmental customer. The
    rebate amount must be adjusted upward where the AMP for a
    product’s first full quarter of sales, when adjusted for
    increases in the CPI-U, or Consumer Price Index —
    Urban, exceeds the AMP for the current quarter with the upward
    adjustment equal to the excess amount. The rebate amount is
    required to be recomputed each quarter based on our report of
    current AMP and best price for each of our products to the
    Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. The terms of our
    participation in the program imposes a requirement for us to
    report revisions to AMP or best price within a period not to
    exceed 12 quarters from the quarter in which the data was
    originally due. Any such revisions could have the impact of
    increasing or decreasing our rebate liability for prior
    quarters, depending on the direction of the revision. In
    addition, if we were found to have knowingly submitted false
    information to the government, the statute provides for civil
    monetary penalties in the amount not to exceed $100,000 per item
    of false information in addition to other penalties available to
    the government.

The availability of federal funds to pay for our products under
    the Medicaid and Medicare Part B programs requires that we
    extend discounts under the 340B/PHS drug pricing program. The
    340B/PHS drug pricing program extends discounts to a variety of
    community health clinics and other entities that receive health
    services grants from the PHS, as well as hospitals that serve a
    disproportionate share of poor Medicare beneficiaries.

We also make our products available for purchase by authorized
    users of the Federal Supply Schedule, or FSS, of the General
    Services Administration pursuant to our FSS contract with the
    Department of Veterans Affairs. Under the Veterans Health Care
    Act of 1992, or the VHC Act, we are required to offer deeply
    discounted FSS contract pricing to four Federal
    agencies — the Department of Veterans Affairs, the
    Department of Defense, the Coast Guard and the Public Health
    Service (including the Indian Health Service) — for
    federal funding to be made available for reimbursement of any of
    our products under the Medicaid program and for our products to
    be eligible to be purchased by those four Federal agencies and
    certain Federal grantees. FSS pricing to those four Federal
    agencies must be equal to or less than the “Federal Ceiling
    Price,” which is, at a minimum, 24% off the Non-Federal
    Average Manufacturer Price, or “Non-FAMP”, for the
    prior fiscal year. In addition, if we are found to have
    knowingly submitted false information to the government, the VHC
    provides for civil monetary penalties of not to exceed $100,000
    per false item of information in addition to other penalties
    available to the government.

We are also subject to various federal and state laws pertaining
    to health care “fraud and abuse,” including
    anti-kickback laws and false claims laws. Anti-kickback laws
    make it illegal for a prescription drug manufacturer to solicit,
    offer, receive, or pay any remuneration in exchange for, or to
    induce, the referral of business, including the purchase or
    prescription of a particular drug. Due to the breadth of the
    statutory provisions and the absence of



guidance in the form of regulations and very few court decisions
    addressing industry practices, it is possible that our practices
    might be challenged under anti-kickback or similar laws. False
    claims laws prohibit anyone from knowingly and willingly
    presenting, or causing to be presented for payment to third
    party payors (including Medicare and Medicaid) claims for
    reimbursed drugs or services that are false or fraudulent,
    claims for items or services not provided as claimed, or claims
    for medically unnecessary items or services. Our activities
    relating to the sale and marketing of our products may be
    subject to scrutiny under these laws. Violations of fraud and
    abuse laws may be punishable by criminal

and/or

civil
    sanctions, including fines and civil monetary penalties, as well
    as the possibility of exclusion from federal health care
    programs (including Medicare and Medicaid). If the government
    were to allege or convict us of violating these laws, our
    business could be harmed. In addition, there is an ability for
    private individuals to bring similar actions. See the section of
    “Item 1A — Risk Factors” entitled
    “If we fail to comply with the extensive legal and
    regulatory requirements affecting the healthcare industry, we
    could face increased costs, penalties and a loss of
    business.” For a description of litigation in this area in
    which we are currently involved, see
    “Item 3 — Legal Proceedings.”

Our activities could be subject to challenge for the reasons
    discussed above and due to the broad scope of these laws and the
    increasing attention being given to them by law enforcement
    authorities. Further, there are an increasing number of state
    laws that require manufacturers to make reports to states on
    pricing and marketing information. Many of these laws contain
    ambiguities as to what is required to comply with the laws.
    Given the lack of clarity in laws and their implementation, our
    reporting actions could be subject to the penalty provisions of
    the pertinent state authorities.

Other
    Regulations

Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.

We are also
    subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act which
    prohibits corporations and individuals from paying, offering to
    pay, or authorizing the payment of anything of value to any
    foreign government official, government staff member, political
    party, or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain
    business or to otherwise influence a person working in an
    official capacity.

NIH Guidelines.

We conduct relevant research
    at all of our research facilities in the U.S. in compliance
    with the current U.S. National Institutes of Health
    Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant DNA Molecules, or
    the NIH Guidelines, and all other applicable federal and state
    regulations. By local ordinance, we are required to, among other
    things, comply with the NIH Guidelines in relation to our
    facilities in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and San Diego,
    California, and are required to operate pursuant to certain
    permits.

Other Laws.

Our present and future business
    has been and will continue to be subject to various other laws
    and regulations. Various laws, regulations and recommendations
    relating to safe working conditions, laboratory practices, the
    experimental use of animals, and the purchase, storage,
    movement, import and export and use and disposal of hazardous or
    potentially hazardous substances, including radioactive
    compounds and infectious disease agents, used in connection with
    our research work are or may be applicable to our activities.
    Certain agreements entered into by us involving exclusive
    license rights may be subject to national or supranational
    antitrust regulatory control, the effect of which also cannot be
    predicted. The extent of government regulation, which might
    result from future legislation or administrative action, cannot
    accurately be predicted.

Manufacturing
    and Raw Materials

We currently produce all of our bulk AVONEX, as well as AMEVIVE
    on a contract basis for Astellas, at our manufacturing
    facilities located in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina and
    Cambridge, Massachusetts. We currently produce TYSABRI at our
    Research Triangle Park facility. We supply the commercial
    requirements of the antibody for ZEVALIN on a contract basis for
    Cell Therapeutics, Inc. We have moved the manufacturing of
    ZEVALIN to our manufacturing facilities in Cambridge,
    Massachusetts and are awaiting FDA approval of the production of
    the antibody at that facility. Genentech is responsible for all
    worldwide manufacturing activities for bulk RITUXAN and has
    sourced the manufacturing of certain bulk RITUXAN requirements
    to an independent third party. We manufacture clinical products
    in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina and Cambridge,
    Massachusetts. We use a third party to manufacture the active
    pharmaceutical ingredient of FUMADERM and another third party to
    further process that to produce the FUMADERM pill.



We are constructing a large-scale biologic manufacturing
    facility in Hillerod, Denmark to be used to manufacture TYSABRI
    and other products in our pipeline. The first phase is complete
    and included the construction of an administrative building, a
    laboratory, a labeling and packaging facility and a facility to
    provide utilities to the Hillerod campus. The administrative
    building was in use in 2006, and the label and packaging
    facility and lab facility were placed into service in the first
    quarter of 2007. In addition, a large-scale manufacturing
    facility was partially constructed during this phase and major
    equipment was installed. The utilities facility has been in
    partial use since the first quarter of 2007. The second phase of
    the project, which we commenced in January 2007, involves the
    completion and fit out of the large-scale manufacturing facility
    and construction of a warehouse. The utilities facility is
    expected to be in full use upon completion of the second phase.
    The large scale manufacturing facility is expected to be ready
    for commercial production in 2009. See
    “Item 1A — Risk Factors” entitled
    “We have made a significant investment in constructing a
    manufacturing facility the success of which depends upon the
    completion and licensing of the facility and continued demand
    for our products.”

We source all of our fill-finish and the majority of final
    product storage operations for our products, along with a
    substantial part of our packaging operations, to a concentrated
    group of third party contractors. Many of the raw materials and
    supplies required for the production of AVONEX, TYSABRI, ZEVALIN
    and AMEVIVE are available from various suppliers in quantities
    adequate to meet our needs. However, due to the unique nature of
    the production of our products, we do have several single source
    providers of raw materials. We make efforts to qualify new
    vendors and to develop contingency plans so that production is
    not impacted by short-term issues associated with single source
    providers. Each of our third party service providers, suppliers
    and manufacturers are subject to continuing inspection by the
    FDA or comparable agencies in other jurisdictions. Any delay,
    interruption or other issues that arise in the manufacture,
    fill-finish, packaging, or storage of our products, including as
    a result of a failure of our facilities or the facilities or
    operations of third parties to pass any regulatory agency
    inspection, could significantly impair our ability to sell our
    products. See the sections of “Item 1A —
    Risk Factors” entitled “Problems with manufacturing or
    with inventory planning could result in our inability to deliver
    products, inventory shortages or surpluses, product recalls and
    increased costs”, “We rely on third parties to provide
    services in connection with the manufacture of our products and,
    in some instances, the manufacture of the product itself,”
    and “If we fail to meet the stringent requirements of
    governmental regulation in the manufacture of our products, we
    could incur substantial remedial costs and a reduction in
    sales.”

We believe that our existing manufacturing facilities and
    outside sources will allow us to meet our near-term and
    long-term manufacturing needs for our current commercial
    products and our other products currently in clinical trials.
    Our existing licensed manufacturing facilities operate under
    multiple licenses from the FDA, regulatory authorities in the EU
    and other regulatory authorities. For a discussion of risks
    related to our ability to meet our manufacturing needs for our
    commercial products and our other products currently in clinical
    trials, see the sections of “Item 1A — Risk
    Factors” entitled “Problems with manufacturing or with
    inventory planning could result in our inability to deliver
    products, inventory shortages or surpluses, product recalls and
    increased costs”, “We rely on third parties to provide
    services in connection with the manufacture of our products and,
    in some instances, the manufacture of the product itself,”
    and “If we fail to meet the stringent requirements of
    governmental regulation in the manufacture of our products, we
    could incur substantial remedial costs and a reduction in
    sales.”

Additional manufacturing facilities and outside sources may be
    required to meet our long-term research, development and
    commercial production needs.

Item 1A.

Risk
    Factors

We are
    substantially dependent on revenues from our two principal
    products

Our current and future revenues depend substantially upon
    continued sales of our two principal products, AVONEX and
    RITUXAN, which represented approximately 88% of our total
    revenues in 2007. Any significant negative developments relating
    to these two products, such as safety or efficacy issues, the
    introduction or greater acceptance of competing products
    (including greater than anticipated substitution of TYSABRI for
    AVONEX) or adverse regulatory or legislative developments, would
    have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
    Although we have developed and continue to develop additional
    products for commercial introduction, we expect to be
    substantially dependent on sales from these two products for
    many years. A decline in sales from either of these two products
    would adversely affect our business.

Our
    near-term success depends on the market acceptance and
    successful sales growth of TYSABRI

A substantial portion of our growth in the near-term is
    dependent on anticipated sales of TYSABRI. TYSABRI is expected
    to diversify our product offerings and revenues, and to drive
    additional revenue growth over the next several years. If we are
    not successful in growing sales of TYSABRI, that would result in
    a significant reduction in diversification and expected
    revenues, and adversely affect our business.

Achievement of anticipated sales growth of TYSABRI will depend
    upon its acceptance by the medical community and patients, which
    cannot be certain given the significant restrictions on use and
    the significant safety warnings in the label. Additional cases
    of the known side effect PML at a higher rate than indicated in
    the prescribing information, or the occurrence of other
    unexpected side effects could harm acceptance and limit TYSABRI
    sales. Any significant lack of acceptance of TYSABRI by the
    medical community or patients would materially and adversely
    affect our growth and our plans for the future.

As a relatively new entrant to a maturing MS market, TYSABRI
    sales may be more sensitive to additional new competing
    products. A number of such products are expected to be approved
    for use in MS in the coming years. If these products have a
    similar or more attractive overall profile in terms of efficacy,
    convenience and safety, future sales of TYSABRI could be limited.

Our
    business could be negatively affected as a result of a
    threatened proxy fight and other actions of activist
    shareholders

We recently received a notice from Icahn Partners and certain of
    its affiliates nominating three individuals for election to our
    Board of Directors at the 2008 annual meeting and proposing to
    amend our bylaws to set the number of directors at twelve. If a
    proxy contest results from this notice, our business could be
    adversely affected because:

•

Responding to proxy contests and other actions by activist
    shareholders can be costly and time-consuming, disrupting our
    operations and diverting the attention of management and our
    employees;

•

Perceived uncertainties as to our future direction may result in
    the loss of potential acquisitions, collaborations or
    in-licensing opportunities, and may make it more difficult to
    retain business partners; and

•

If individuals are elected to our board of directors with a
    specific agenda, it may adversely affect our ability to
    effectively and timely implement our strategic plan.

These actions could cause our stock price to experience periods
    of volatility.

Our
    long-term success depends upon the successful development and
    commercialization of other products from our research and
    development activities

Our long-term viability and growth will depend upon the
    successful development and commercialization of other products
    from our research and development activities. Product
    development and commercialization are very expensive and involve
    a high degree of risk. Only a small number of research and
    development programs result in the commercialization of a
    product. Success in early stage clinical trials or preclinical
    work does not ensure that later stage or larger scale clinical
    trials will be successful. Even if later stage clinical trials
    are successful, the risk



remains that unexpected concerns may arise from additional data
    or analysis or that obstacles may arise or issues may be
    identified in connection with review of clinical data with
    regulatory authorities or that regulatory authorities may
    disagree with our view of the data or require additional data or
    information or additional studies.

Conducting clinical trials is a complex, time-consuming and
    expensive process. Our ability to complete our clinical trials
    in a timely fashion depends in large part on a number of key
    factors including protocol design, regulatory and institutional
    review board approval, the rate of patient enrollment in
    clinical trials, and compliance with extensive current good
    clinical practice requirements. We have recently opened clinical
    sites and are enrolling patients in a number of new countries
    where our experience is more limited, and we are in many cases
    using the services of third-party contract clinical trial
    providers. If we fail to adequately manage the design, execution
    and regulatory aspects of our large, complex and diverse
    clinical trials, our studies and ultimately our regulatory
    approvals may be delayed or we may fail to gain approval for our
    product candidates altogether.

Adverse
    safety events can negatively affect our assets, product sales,
    operations and products in development

Even after we receive marketing approval for a product, adverse
    event reports may have a negative impact on our
    commercialization efforts. Our voluntary withdrawal of TYSABRI
    from the market in February 2005 following reports of cases of
    PML resulted in a significant reduction in expected revenues as
    well as significant expense and management time required to
    address the legal and regulatory issues arising from the
    withdrawal, including revised labeling and enhanced risk
    management programs. Later discovery of safety issues with our
    products that were not known at the time of their approval by
    the FDA could cause product liability events, additional
    regulatory scrutiny and requirements for additional labeling,
    withdrawal of products from the market and the imposition of
    fines or criminal penalties. Any of these actions could result
    in, among other things, material write-offs of inventory and
    impairments of intangible assets, goodwill and fixed assets.

If we
    fail to compete effectively, our business and market position
    would suffer

The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industry is intensely
    competitive. We compete in the marketing and sale of our
    products, the development of new products and processes, the
    acquisition of rights to new products with commercial potential
    and the hiring and retention of personnel. We compete with
    biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies that have a greater
    number of products on the market, greater financial and other
    resources and other technological or competitive advantages. We
    cannot be certain that one or more of our competitors will not
    receive patent protection that dominates, blocks or adversely
    affects our product development or business, will not benefit
    from significantly greater sales and marketing capabilities, or
    will not develop products that are accepted more widely than
    ours. The introduction of alternatives to our products that
    offer advantages in efficacy, safety or ease of use could
    negatively affect our revenues and reduce the value of our
    product development efforts. In addition, potential governmental
    action in the future could provide a means for competition from
    developers of follow-on biologics, which could compete on price
    and differentiation with products that we now or could in the
    future market.

In addition to competing directly with products that are
    marketed by substantial pharmaceutical competitors, AVONEX,
    RITUXAN and TYSABRI also face competition from off-label uses of
    drugs approved for other indications. Some of our current
    competitors are also working to develop alternative formulations
    for delivery of their products, which may in the future compete
    with ours.



We
    depend on collaborators for both product and royalty revenue and
    the clinical development of future collaboration products, which
    are outside of our full control

Collaborations between companies on products or programs are a
    common business practice in the biotechnology industry.
    Out-licensing typically allows a partner to collect up front
    payments and future milestone payments, share the costs of
    clinical development and risk of failure at various points, and
    access sales and marketing infrastructure and expertise in
    exchange for certain financial rights to the product or program
    going to the in-licensing partner. In addition, the obligation
    of in-licensees to pay royalties or share profits generally
    terminates upon expiration of the related patents. We have a
    number of collaborators and partners, and have both in-licensed
    and out-licensed several products and programs. These
    collaborations include several risks:

•

we are not fully in control of the royalty or profit sharing
    revenues we receive from collaborators, and we cannot be certain
    of the timing or potential impact of factors including patent
    expirations, pricing or health care reforms, other legal and
    regulatory developments, failure of our partners to comply with
    applicable laws and regulatory requirements, the introduction of
    competitive products, and new indication approvals which may
    affect the sales of collaboration products;

•

where we copromote and co-market products with our collaboration
    partners, any failure on their part to comply with applicable
    laws in the sale and marketing of our products could have an
    adverse effect on our revenues as well as involve us in possible
    legal proceedings; and

•

collaborations often require the parties to cooperate, and
    failure to do so effectively could have an impact on product
    sales by our collaborators and partners, as well as an impact on
    the clinical development of shared products or programs under
    joint control.

In addition, the successful development and commercialization of
    new anti-CD20 product candidates in our collaboration with
    Genentech (which also includes RITUXAN) will decrease our
    participation in the operating profits from the collaboration
    (including as to RITUXAN).

We
    depend, to a significant extent, on reimbursement from third
    party payors and a reduction in the extent of reimbursement
    could negatively affect our product sales and
    revenue

Sales of our products are dependent, in large part, on the
    availability and extent of reimbursement from government health
    administration authorities, private health insurers and other
    organizations. U.S. and foreign government regulations
    mandating price controls and limitations on patient access to
    our products impact our business and our future results could be
    adversely affected by changes in such regulations.

In the U.S., at both the federal and state levels, the
    government regularly proposes legislation to reform healthcare
    and its cost, any of which may impact our ability to
    successfully commercialize our products. In the last few years,
    there have been a number of legislative changes that have
    affected the reimbursement for our products, including, but not
    limited to, the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and
    Modernization Act of 2003 and most recently, the Deficit
    Reduction Act of 2005. The Deficit Reduction Act made
    significant changes to the Medicaid prescription drug provisions
    of the Social Security Act, including changes that impose the
    monthly reporting of price information and that may have an
    impact on the Medicaid rebates we pay. In addition, states may
    more aggressively seek Medicaid rebates as a result of
    legislation enacted in 2006, which rebate activity could
    adversely affect our results of operations.

Pricing pressures in the U.S. may increase as a result of
    the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act
    of 2003. Managed care organizations as well as Medicaid and
    other government health administration authorities continue to
    seek price discounts. Government efforts to reduce Medicaid
    expenses may continue to increase the use of managed care
    organizations. This may result in managed care organizations
    influencing prescription decisions for a larger segment of the
    population and a corresponding constraint on prices and
    reimbursement for our products. In addition, some states have
    implemented and other states are considering price controls or
    patient-access constraints under the Medicaid program and some
    states are considering price-control regimes that would apply to
    broader segments of their populations that are not Medicaid
    eligible. Other matters also could be the subject of
    U.S. federal or state legislative or regulatory action that
    could adversely affect our business, including the importation
    of prescription drugs that are marketed outside the
    U.S. and sold at lower prices as a result of drug price
    limitations imposed by the governments of various foreign
    countries.



We encounter similar regulatory and legislative issues in most
    other countries. In the EU and some other international markets,
    the government provides health care at low cost to consumers and
    regulates pharmaceutical prices, patient eligibility or
    reimbursement levels to control costs for the
    government-sponsored health care system. This international
    patchwork of price regulations may lead to inconsistent prices.
    Within the EU and other countries, some third party trade in our
    products occurs from markets with lower prices thereby
    undermining our sales in some markets with higher prices.
    Additionally, certain countries reference the prices in other
    countries where our products are marketed. Thus, inability to
    secure adequate prices in a particular country may also impair
    our ability to obtain acceptable prices in existing and
    potential new markets. This may create the opportunity for the
    third party cross border trade previously mentioned or our
    decision not to sell the product thus affecting our geographic
    expansion plans.

When a new medical product is approved, the availability of
    government and private reimbursement for that product is
    uncertain, as is the amount for which that product will be
    reimbursed. We cannot predict the availability or amount of
    reimbursement for our product candidates.

If we
    do not successfully execute our strategy of growth through the
    acquisition, partnering and in-licensing of products,
    technologies or companies, our future performance could be
    adversely affected

In addition to the expansion of our pipeline through spending on
    internal development projects, we plan to grow through external
    growth opportunities, which include the acquisition, partnering
    and in-licensing of products, technologies and companies or the
    entry into strategic alliances and collaborations. If we are
    unable to complete or manage these external growth opportunities
    successfully, we will not be able to grow our business in the
    way that we currently expect. The availability of high quality
    opportunities is limited and we are not certain that we will be
    able to identify suitable candidates or complete transactions on
    terms that are acceptable to us. In addition, even if we are
    able to successfully identify and complete acquisitions, we may
    not be able to integrate them or take full advantage of them and
    therefore may not realize the benefits that we expect. If we are
    unsuccessful in our external growth program, we may not be able
    to grow our business significantly and we may incur asset
    impairment charges as a result of acquisitions that are not
    successful.

Our
    business is subject to extensive governmental regulation and
    oversight and changes in laws could adversely affect our
    revenues and profitability

Our business is in a highly regulated industry. As a result,
    governmental actions may adversely affect our business,
    operations or financial condition, including:

•

new laws, regulations or judicial decisions, or new
    interpretations of existing laws, regulations or decisions,
    related to health care availability, method of delivery and
    payment for health care products and services;

•

changes in the FDA and foreign regulatory approval processes
    that may delay or prevent the approval of new products and
    result in lost market opportunity;

•

changes in FDA and foreign regulations that may require
    additional safety monitoring after the introduction of our
    products to market, which could increase our costs of doing
    business and adversely affect the future permitted uses of
    approved products;

•

new laws, regulations and judicial decisions affecting pricing
    or marketing; and

•

changes in the tax laws relating to our operations.

The enactment in the U.S. of the Medicare Prescription Drug
    Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, possible legislation
    which could ease the entry of competing follow-on biologics in
    the marketplace, and importation of lower-cost competing drugs
    from other jurisdictions are examples of changes and possible
    changes in laws that could adversely affect our business. In
    addition, the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of
    2007 included new authorization for the FDA to require
    post-market safety monitoring, along with a clinical trials
    registry, and expanded authority for FDA to impose civil
    monetary penalties on companies that fail to meet certain
    commitments.



If we
    fail to comply with the extensive legal and regulatory
    requirements affecting the healthcare industry, we could face
    increased costs, penalties and a loss of business

Our activities, including the sale and marketing of our
    products, are subject to extensive government regulation and
    oversight both in the U.S. and in foreign jurisdictions.
    Pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies have been the target
    of lawsuits and investigations alleging violations of government
    regulation, including claims asserting submission of incorrect
    pricing information, impermissible off-label promotion of
    pharmaceutical products, causing false claims to be submitted
    for government reimbursement as well as antitrust violations, or
    other violations related to environmental matters. Violations of
    governmental regulation may be punishable by criminal and civil
    sanctions, including fines and civil monetary penalties and
    exclusion from participation in government programs. In addition
    to penalties for violation of laws and regulations, we could be
    required to repay amounts we received from government payors, or
    pay additional rebates and interest if we are found to have
    miscalculated the pricing information we have submitted to the
    government Whether or not we have complied with the law, an
    investigation into alleged unlawful conduct could increase our
    expenses, damage our reputation, divert management time and
    attention and adversely affect our business.

The federal Medicare/Medicaid anti-kickback law prohibits
    payments intended to induce any entity either to purchase,
    order, or arrange for or recommend the purchase of healthcare
    products or services paid for under federal health care
    programs. There are similar laws in a number of states. These
    laws constrain the sales, marketing and other promotional
    activities of manufacturers of drugs and biologics, such as us,
    by limiting the kinds of financial arrangements, including sales
    programs, with hospitals, physicians, and other potential
    purchasers of drugs and biologics. Other federal and state laws
    generally prohibit individuals or entities from knowingly
    presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from
    federal health care programs, including Medicare, Medicaid, or
    other third party payors that are false or fraudulent, or are
    for items or services that were not provided as claimed.
    Anti-kickback and false claims laws prescribe civil and criminal
    penalties for noncompliance that can be substantial, including
    the possibility of exclusion from federal healthcare programs
    (including Medicare and Medicaid).

Problems
    with manufacturing or with inventory planning could result in
    our inability to deliver products, inventory shortages or
    surpluses, product recalls and increased costs

We manufacture and expect to continue to manufacture our own
    commercial requirements of bulk AVONEX and TYSABRI. Our products
    are difficult to manufacture and problems in our manufacturing
    processes can occur. Our inability to successfully manufacture
    bulk product and to obtain and maintain regulatory approvals of
    our manufacturing facilities would harm our ability to produce
    timely sufficient quantities of commercial supplies of AVONEX
    and TYSABRI to meet demand. Problems with manufacturing
    processes could result in product defects or manufacturing
    failures that could require us to delay shipment of products or
    recall or withdraw products previously shipped, which could
    result in inventory write-offs and impair our ability to expand
    into new markets or supply products in existing markets. In the
    past, we have had to write down and incur other charges and
    expenses for products that failed to meet specifications.
    Similar charges may occur in the future. In addition, lower than
    expected demand for our products, including suspension of sales,
    or a change in product mix may result in less than optimal
    utilization of our manufacturing facilities and lower inventory
    turnover, which could result in abnormal manufacturing variance
    charges, facility impairment charges and charges for excess and
    obsolete inventory.

We rely solely on our manufacturing facility in Research
    Triangle Park, North Carolina, or RTP, for the production of
    TYSABRI. We plan on applying to the FDA and EMEA for approval of
    a production process, known as a second generation high-titer
    process, which yields much higher concentrations of TYSABRI than
    the process we currently use. If we do not obtain approval for
    that process, to meet anticipated demand for TYSABRI, we would
    need to increase our capital spending to add capacity at our RTP
    manufacturing facility and at the Hillerod, Denmark facility we
    are completing. Such an increase in capital spending would
    affect our business, cash position and results of operations.

If we cannot produce sufficient commercial requirements of bulk
    product to meet demand, we would need to rely on third party
    contract manufacturers, of which there are only a limited number
    capable of manufacturing bulk products of the type we require.
    We cannot be certain that we could reach agreement on reasonable
    terms, if at all,



with those manufacturers. Even if we were to reach agreement,
    the transition of the manufacturing process to a third party to
    enable commercial supplies could take a significant amount of
    time. Our ability to supply products in sufficient capacity to
    meet demand is also dependent upon third party contractors to
    fill-finish, package and store such products. Any prolonged
    interruption in the operations of our existing manufacturing
    facilities could result in cancellations of shipments or loss of
    product in the process of being manufactured. Because our
    manufacturing processes are highly complex and are subject to a
    lengthy FDA approval process, alternative qualified production
    capacity may not be available on a timely basis or at all.

We
    rely on third parties to provide services in connection with the
    manufacture of our products and, in some instances, the
    manufacture of the product itself

We rely on Genentech for all RITUXAN manufacturing. Genentech
    relies on a third party to manufacture certain bulk RITUXAN
    requirements. If Genentech or any third party upon which it
    relies does not manufacture or fill-finish RITUXAN in sufficient
    quantities and on a timely and cost-effective basis, or if
    Genentech or any third party does not obtain and maintain all
    required manufacturing approvals, our business could be harmed.

We also source all of our fill-finish and the majority of our
    final product storage operations, along with a substantial
    portion of our packaging operations of the components used with
    our products, to a concentrated group of third party
    contractors. The manufacture of products and product components,
    fill-finish, packaging and storage of our products require
    successful coordination among us and multiple third party
    providers. Our inability to coordinate these efforts, the lack
    of capacity available at a third party contractor or any other
    problems with the operations of these third party contractors
    could require us to delay shipment of saleable products, recall
    products previously shipped or impair our ability to supply
    products at all. This could increase our costs, cause us to lose
    revenue or market share, diminish our profitability and damage
    our reputation. Any third party we use to fill-finish, package
    or store our products to be sold in the U.S. must be
    licensed by the FDA. As a result, alternative third party
    providers may not be readily available on a timely basis.

Due to the unique nature of the production of our products,
    there are several single source providers of raw materials. We
    make every effort to qualify new vendors and to develop
    contingency plans so that production is not impacted by
    short-term issues associated with single source providers.
    Nonetheless, our business could be materially impacted by long
    term or chronic issues associated with single source providers.

If we
    fail to meet the stringent requirements of governmental
    regulation in the manufacture of our products, we could incur
    substantial remedial costs and a reduction in
    sales

We and our third party providers are generally required to
    maintain compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practice, or
    cGMP, and are subject to inspections by the FDA or comparable
    agencies in other jurisdictions to confirm such compliance. Any
    changes of suppliers or modifications of methods of
    manufacturing require amending our application to the FDA and
    acceptance of the change by the FDA prior to release of product
    to the marketplace. Our inability, or the inability of our third
    party service providers, to demonstrate ongoing cGMP compliance
    could require us to withdraw or recall product and interrupt
    commercial supply of our products. Any delay, interruption or
    other issues that arise in the manufacture, fill-finish,
    packaging, or storage of our products as a result of a failure
    of our facilities or the facilities or operations of third
    parties to pass any regulatory agency inspection could
    significantly impair our ability to develop and commercialize
    our products. This non-compliance could increase our costs,
    cause us to lose revenue or market share and damage our
    reputation.

We
    have made a significant investment in constructing a
    manufacturing facility the success of which depends upon the
    completion and licensing of the facility and continued demand
    for our products

We are building a large-scale biologic manufacturing facility in
    Hillerod, Denmark, in which we have invested approximately
    $300 million. We anticipate that the facility will be ready
    for commercial production in 2009. If we fail to manage the
    project, or other unforeseen events occur, we may incur
    additional costs to complete the project. Depending on the
    timing of the completion and licensing of the facility, and our
    other estimates and assumptions regarding future product sales,
    the carrying value of all or part of the manufacturing facility
    or other assets may not be fully recoverable and could result in
    the recognition of an impairment in the carrying value at the
    time that such



effects are identified. The recognition of impairment in the
    carrying value, if any, could have a material and adverse affect
    on our results of operations. For example, if the anticipated
    demand for TYSABRI does not materialize, the carrying values of
    our Hillerod, Denmark facility could be impaired, which would
    negatively impact our results of operations.

If we
    are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel and key
    relationships, the growth of our business could be
    harmed

Our success will depend, to a great extent, upon our ability to
    attract and retain qualified scientific, manufacturing, sales
    and marketing and executive personnel and our ability to develop
    and maintain relationships with qualified clinical researchers
    and key distributors. Competition for these people and
    relationships is intense and we compete with numerous
    pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies as well as with
    universities and

non-profit

research organizations. Any inability we experience to continue
    to attract and retain qualified personnel or develop and
    maintain key relationships could have an adverse effect on our
    ability to accomplish our research, development and external
    growth objectives.

Our
    sales and operations are subject to the risks of doing business
    internationally

We are increasing our presence in international markets, which
    subjects us to many risks, such as:

•

economic problems that disrupt foreign healthcare payment
    systems;

•

fluctuations in currency exchange rates;

•

the imposition of governmental controls;

•

less favorable intellectual property or other applicable laws;

•

the inability to obtain any necessary foreign regulatory or
    pricing approvals of products in a timely manner;

•

restrictions on direct investments by foreign entities and trade
    restrictions;

•

changes in tax laws and tariffs;

•

difficulties in staffing and managing international
    operations; and

•

longer payment cycles.

Our operations and marketing practices are also subject to
    regulation and scrutiny by the governments of the other
    countries in which we operate. In addition, the Foreign Corrupt
    Practices Act, or FCPA, prohibits U.S. companies and their
    representatives from offering, promising, authorizing or making
    payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or
    retaining business abroad. In many countries, the healthcare
    professionals we regularly interact with meet the definition of
    a foreign official for purposes of the FCPA. Additionally, we
    are subject to other U.S. laws in our international
    operations. Failure to comply with domestic or foreign laws
    could result in various adverse consequences, including possible
    delay in approval or refusal to approve a product, recalls,
    seizures, withdrawal of an approved product from the market,

and/or

the
    imposition of civil or criminal sanctions.

A portion of our business is conducted in currencies other than
    our reporting currency, the U.S. dollar. We recognize
    foreign currency gains or losses arising from our operations in
    the period in which we incur those gains or losses. As a result,
    currency fluctuations among the U.S. dollar and the
    currencies in which we do business will affect our operating
    results, often in unpredictable ways.

Our
    operating results are subject to significant
    fluctuations

Our quarterly revenues, expenses and net income (loss) have
    fluctuated in the past and are likely to fluctuate significantly
    in the future due to the timing of charges and expenses that we
    may take. In recent periods, for instance, we have recorded
    charges that include:

•

acquired in-process research and development at the time we make
    an acquisition;

•

impairments that we are required to take with respect to
    investments;



•

impairments that we are required to take with respect to fixed
    assets, including those that are recorded in connection with the
    sale of fixed assets;

•

Inventory write-downs for failed quality specifications, charges
    for excess

and/or

obsolete inventory and charges for inventory write downs
    relating to product suspensions; and

•

the cost of restructurings.

Additionally, net income may fluctuate due to the impact of
    charges we may be required to take with respect to foreign
    currency hedge transactions. In particular, we may incur higher
    charges from hedge ineffectiveness than we expect or from the
    termination of a hedge relationship.

These examples are only illustrative and other risks, including
    those discussed in these “Risk Factors,” could also
    cause fluctuations in our reported earnings. In addition, our
    operating results during any one quarter do not necessarily
    suggest the anticipated results of future quarters.

If we
    are unable to adequately protect and enforce our intellectual
    property rights, our competitors may take advantage of our
    development efforts or our acquired technology

We have filed numerous patent applications in the U.S. and
    various other countries seeking protection of inventions
    originating from our research and development, including a
    number of our processes and products. Patents have been issued
    on many of these applications. We have also obtained rights to
    various patents and patent applications under licenses with
    third parties, which provide for the payment of royalties by us.
    The ultimate degree of patent protection that will be afforded
    to biotechnology products and processes, including ours, in the
    U.S. and in other important markets remains uncertain and
    is dependent upon the scope of protection decided upon by the
    patent offices, courts and lawmakers in these countries. Our
    patents may not afford us substantial protection or commercial
    benefit. Similarly, our pending patent applications or patent
    applications licensed from third parties may not ultimately be
    granted as patents and we may not prevail if patents that have
    been issued to us are challenged in court. In addition, pending
    legislation to reform the patent system could also reduce our
    ability to enforce our patents. We do not know when, or if,
    changes to the U.S. patent system will become law. If we
    are unable to protect our intellectual property rights and
    prevent others from exploiting our inventions, we will not
    derive the benefit from them that we currently expect.

If our
    products infringe the intellectual property rights of others, we
    may incur damages and be required to incur the expense of
    obtaining a license

A substantial number of patents have already been issued to
    other biotechnology and biopharmaceutical companies. Competitors
    may have filed applications for, or have been issued patents and
    may obtain additional patents and proprietary rights that may
    relate to products or processes competitive with or similar to
    our products and processes. Moreover, the patent laws of the
    U.S. and foreign countries are distinct and decisions as to
    patenting, validity of patents and infringement of patents may
    be resolved differently in different countries. In general, we
    obtain licenses to third party patents that we deem necessary or
    desirable for the manufacture, use and sale of our products. We
    are currently unable to assess the extent to which we may wish
    or be required to acquire rights under such patents and the
    availability and cost of acquiring such rights, or whether a
    license to such patents will be available on acceptable terms or
    at all. There may be patents in the U.S. or in foreign
    countries or patents issued in the future that are unavailable
    to license on acceptable terms. Our inability to obtain such
    licenses may hinder our ability to manufacture and market our
    products.

Uncertainty
    over intellectual property in the biotechnology industry has
    been the source of litigation, which is inherently costly and
    unpredictable

We are aware that others, including various universities and
    companies working in the biotechnology field, have filed patent
    applications and have been granted patents in the U.S. and
    in other countries claiming subject matter potentially useful to
    our business. Some of those patents and patent applications
    claim only specific products or methods of making such products,
    while others claim more general processes or techniques useful
    or now used in the biotechnology industry. There is considerable
    uncertainty within the biotechnology industry about the
    validity,



scope and enforceability of many issued patents in the
    U.S. and elsewhere in the world, and, to date, there is no
    consistent policy regarding the breadth of claims allowed in
    biotechnology patents. We cannot currently determine the
    ultimate scope and validity of patents which may be granted to
    third parties in the future or which patents might be asserted
    to be infringed by the manufacture, use and sale of our products.

There has been, and we expect that there may continue to be,
    significant litigation in the industry regarding patents and
    other intellectual property rights. Litigation and
    administrative proceedings concerning patents and other
    intellectual property rights may be protracted, expensive and
    distracting to management. Competitors may sue us as a way of
    delaying the introduction of our products. Any litigation,
    including any interference proceedings to determine priority of
    inventions, oppositions to patents in foreign countries or
    litigation against our partners, may be costly and time
    consuming and could harm our business. We expect that litigation
    may be necessary in some instances to determine the validity and
    scope of certain of our proprietary rights. Litigation may be
    necessary in other instances to determine the validity, scope

and/or

noninfringement of certain patent rights claimed by third
    parties to be pertinent to the manufacture, use or sale of our
    products. Ultimately, the outcome of such litigation could
    adversely affect the validity and scope of our patent or other
    proprietary rights, or, conversely, hinder our ability to
    manufacture and market our products.

Pending
    and future product liability claims may adversely affect our
    business and our reputation

The administration of drugs in humans, whether in clinical
    studies or commercially, carries the inherent risk of product
    liability claims whether or not the drugs are actually the cause
    of an injury. Our products or product candidates may cause, or
    may appear to have caused, injury or dangerous drug
    interactions, and we may not learn about or understand those
    effects until the product or product candidate has been
    administered to patients for a prolonged period of time. For
    example, lawsuits have been filed by patients who have had
    serious adverse events while using TYSABRI, and we may face
    lawsuits with other product liability and related claims by
    patients treated with TYSABRI or other products.

We cannot predict with certainty the eventual outcome of any
    pending or future litigation. We may not be successful in
    defending ourselves in the litigation and, as a result, our
    business could be materially harmed. These lawsuits may result
    in large judgments or settlements against us, any of which could
    have a negative effect on our financial condition and business.
    Additionally, lawsuits can be expensive to defend, whether or
    not they have merit, and the defense of these actions may divert
    the attention of our management and other resources that would
    otherwise be engaged in managing our business.

We
    have recently incurred substantial indebtedness that could
    adversely affect our business and limit our ability to plan for
    or respond to changes in our business

We have recently incurred a substantial amount of indebtedness
    and we may also incur additional debt in the future. This
    indebtedness could have significant consequences to our
    business, for example, it could:

•

increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and
    industry conditions;

•

require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow
    from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby
    reducing the availability of our cash flow for other purposes,
    including business development efforts and mergers and
    acquisitions; and

•

limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes
    in our business and the industry in which we operate, thereby
    placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our
    competitors that may have less debt.

Our
    business involves environmental risks, which include the cost of
    compliance and the risk of contamination or injury

Our business and the business of several of our strategic
    partners, including Genentech and Elan, involve the controlled
    use of hazardous materials, chemicals, biologics and radioactive
    compounds. Biologics manufacturing is extremely susceptible to
    product loss due to contamination, material equipment failure,
    or vendor or operator error. Although we believe that our safety
    procedures for handling and disposing of such materials comply
    with state and



federal standards, there will always be the risk of accidental
    contamination or injury. In addition, microbial or viral
    contamination may cause the closure of a manufacturing facility
    for an extended period of time. By law, radioactive materials
    may only be disposed of at state-approved facilities. We
    currently store radioactive materials from our California
    laboratory

on-site

because the approval of a disposal site in California for all
    California-based companies has been delayed indefinitely. If and
    when a disposal site is approved, we may incur substantial costs
    related to the disposal of these materials. If we were to become
    liable for an accident, or if we were to suffer an extended
    facility shutdown, we could incur significant costs, damages and
    penalties that could harm our business. Biologics manufacturing
    also requires permits from government agencies for water supply
    and wastewater discharge. If we do not obtain appropriate
    permits, or permits for sufficient quantities of water and
    wastewater, we could incur significant costs and limits on our
    manufacturing volumes that could harm our business.

Our
    investments in marketable securities are significant and are
    subject to market, interest and credit risk that may reduce
    their value

We maintain a significant portfolio of investments in marketable
    securities. Our earnings may be adversely affected by changes in
    the value of this portfolio. In particular, the value of our
    investments may be adversely affected by increases in interest
    rates, downgrades in the corporate bonds included in the
    portfolio and by other factors which may result in other than
    temporary declines in value of the investments. Each of these
    events may cause us to record charges to reduce the carrying
    value of our investment portfolio.

We may
    incur liabilities to tax authorities in excess of amounts that
    have been accrued

The preparation of our financial statements requires estimates
    of the amount of tax that will become payable in each of the
    jurisdictions in which we operate. Accordingly, we determine our
    estimated liability for federal, state and local taxes (in the
    U.S.) and in many overseas jurisdictions. Our previous tax
    filings may be challenged by any of these taxing authorities
    and, in the event that we are not able to defend our position,
    we may incur unanticipated liabilities and such amounts could be
    significant. The jurisdictions in which we are subject to
    taxation may enact or change laws that would adversely impact
    the rate at which we are taxed in future periods. Such actions
    could result in an additional income tax provision.

Several
    aspects of our corporate governance and our collaboration
    agreements may discourage a third party from attempting to
    acquire us

Several factors might discourage a takeover attempt that could
    be viewed as beneficial to stockholders who wish to receive a
    premium for their shares from a potential bidder. For example:

•

we are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General
    Corporation Law, which provides that we may not enter into a
    business combination with an interested stockholder for a period
    of three years after the date of the transaction in which the
    person became an interested stockholder, unless the business
    combination is approved in the manner prescribed in
    Section 203;

•

our stockholder rights plan is designed to cause substantial
    dilution to a person who attempts to acquire us on terms not
    approved by our board of directors;

•

our board of directors has the authority to issue, without a
    vote or action of stockholders, up to 8,000,000 shares of
    preferred stock and to fix the price, rights, preferences and
    privileges of those shares, each of which could be superior to
    the rights of holders of common stock;

•

our collaboration agreement with Elan provides Elan with the
    option to buy the rights to TYSABRI in the event that we undergo
    a change of control, which may limit our attractiveness to
    potential acquirers;

•

our amended and restated collaboration agreement with Genentech
    provides that, in the event we undergo a change of control,
    within 90 days Genentech may present an offer to us to
    purchase our rights to RITUXAN. Recently, in an arbitration
    proceeding brought by Biogen Idec relating to the collaboration
    agreement, Genentech alleged for the first time that the
    November 2003 transaction in which Idec acquired Biogen and
    became Biogen Idec constituted such a change of control, an
    assertion with which we strongly disagree. It is our position
    that the Biogen Idec merger did not constitute a change of
    control under our agreement with



Genentech and that, even if it did, Genentech’s rights
    under the change of control provision have long since expired.
    We intend to vigorously assert our position if Genentech
    persists in making this claim. If the arbitrators decide this
    issue in favor of Genentech, or if a change of control were to
    occur in the future and Genentech were to present an offer for
    the RITUXAN rights, we must either accept Genentech’s offer
    or purchase Genentech’s rights to RITUXAN on the same terms
    as its offer. If Genentech presents such an offer, then they
    will be deemed concurrently to have exercised a right, in
    exchange for a share in the operating profits or net sales in
    the U.S. of any other anti-CD 20 products developed under
    the agreement, to purchase our interest in each such product.

•

our directors are elected to staggered terms, which prevents the
    entire board from being replaced in any single year; and

•

advance notice is required for nomination of candidates for
    election as a director and for proposals to be brought before an
    annual meeting of stockholders.

Item 3.

Legal
    Proceedings

On March 2, 2005, we, along with William H. Rastetter, our
    former Executive Chairman, and James C. Mullen, our Chief
    Executive Officer, were named as defendants in a purported class
    action lawsuit, captioned Brown v. Biogen Idec Inc., et al.
    (“Brown”), filed in the U.S. District Court for
    the District of Massachusetts (the “Court”). The
    complaint alleges violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of
    the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and

Rule 10b-5

promulgated thereunder. The action is purportedly brought on
    behalf of all purchasers of our publicly-traded securities
    between February 18, 2004 and February 25, 2005. The
    plaintiff alleges that the defendants made materially false and
    misleading statements regarding potentially serious side effects
    of TYSABRI in order to gain accelerated approval from the FDA
    for the product’s distribution and sale. The plaintiff
    alleges that these materially false and misleading statements
    harmed the purported class by artificially inflating our stock
    price during the purported class period and that our insiders
    benefited personally from the inflated price by selling our
    stock. The plaintiff seeks unspecified damages, as well as
    interest, costs and attorneys’ fees. Substantially similar
    actions, captioned Grill v. Biogen Idec Inc., et al. and
    Lobel v. Biogen Idec Inc., et al., were filed on
    March 10, 2005 and



April 21, 2005, respectively, in the same court by other
    purported class representatives. Those actions have been
    consolidated with the Brown case. On October 13, 2006, the
    plaintiffs filed an amended consolidated complaint which, among
    other amendments to the allegations, adds as defendants Peter N.
    Kellogg, our former Chief Financial Officer, William R. Rohn,
    our former Chief Operating Officer, Burt A. Adelman, our former
    Executive Vice President, Portfolio Strategy, and Thomas J.
    Bucknum, our former General Counsel. On September 14, 2007,
    the District Court Judge entered an Order allowing the Motions
    to Dismiss of all defendants. On October 15, 2007, the
    plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal to the United States Court
    of Appeals for the First Circuit. Plaintiff filed its principal
    brief on appeal on February 6, 2008. We have not formed an
    opinion that an unfavorable outcome is either
    “probable” or “remote” and do not express an
    opinion at this time as to the likely outcome of the matter or
    as to the magnitude or range of any potential loss. We believe
    that we have good and valid defenses to the complaint and intend
    to vigorously defend the case.

On October 4, 2004, Genentech, Inc. received a subpoena
    from the U.S. Department of Justice requesting documents
    related to the promotion of RITUXAN. We market RITUXAN in the
    U.S. in collaboration with Genentech. Genentech has
    disclosed that it is cooperating with the associated
    investigation which they disclosed that they have been advised
    is both civil and criminal in nature. Genentech has reported
    further that the government has called and is expected to call
    former and current Genentech employees to appear before a grand
    jury in connection with this investigation. We are cooperating
    with the U.S. Department of Justice in its investigation of
    Genentech. The potential outcome of this matter and its impact
    on us cannot be determined at this time.

Along with several other major pharmaceutical and biotechnology
    companies, Biogen, Inc. (now Biogen Idec MA, Inc., one of our
    wholly-owned subsidiaries) or, in certain cases, Biogen Idec
    Inc., was named as a defendant in lawsuits filed by the City of
    New York and numerous Counties of the State of New York. All of
    the cases — except for cases filed by the County of
    Erie, County of Oswego and County of Schenectady — are
    the subject of a Consolidated Complaint (“Consolidated
    Complaint”), which was filed on June 15, 2005, and
    amended on June 8, 2007, in the U.S. District Court
    for the District of Massachusetts in Multi-District Litigation
    No. 1456 (“the MDL proceedings”). The County of
    Nassau joined in the amended Consolidated Complaint on
    June 8, 2007. On September 17, 2007, the County of
    Erie, County of Oswego and County of Schenectady cases were
    remanded to state court in New York.

All of the complaints in these cases allege that the defendants
    (i) fraudulently reported the Average Wholesale Price for
    certain drugs for which Medicaid provides reimbursement
    (“Covered Drugs”); (ii) marketed and promoted the
    sale of Covered Drugs to providers based on the providers’
    ability to collect inflated payments from the government and
    Medicaid beneficiaries that exceeded payments possible for
    competing drugs; (iii) provided financing incentives to
    providers to over-prescribe Covered Drugs or to prescribe
    Covered Drugs in place of competing drugs; and
    (iv) overcharged Medicaid for illegally inflated Covered
    Drugs reimbursements. Among other things, the complaints allege
    violations of New York state law and advance common law claims
    for unfair trade practices, fraud, and unjust enrichment. In
    addition, the amended Consolidated Complaint alleges that the
    defendants failed to accurately report the “best
    price” on the Covered Drugs to the Secretary of Health and
    Human Services pursuant to rebate agreements, and excluded from
    their reporting certain discounts and other rebates that would
    have reduced the “best price.”

On September 7, 2006, a New York State court granted in
    part and denied in part Biogen Idec’s motion to
    dismiss the County of Erie complaint. On April 2, 2007, the
    defendants’ joint motion to dismiss the original
    Consolidated Complaint and the County of Nassau’s second
    amended complaint were granted in part, but certain claims
    against Biogen Idec remained. Biogen Idec’s individual
    motion to dismiss these complaints remains pending. We have not
    formed an opinion that an unfavorable outcome is either
    “probable” or “remote” and do not express an
    opinion at this time as to the likely outcome of the matter or
    as to the magnitude or range of any potential loss. We believe
    that we have good and valid defenses to these complaints and
    intend to vigorously defend the case.

Along with several other major pharmaceutical and biotechnology
    companies, we were also named as a defendant in a lawsuit filed
    by the Attorney General of Arizona. The lawsuit was filed in the
    Superior Court of the State of Arizona and transferred to the
    MDL proceedings. The complaint, as amended on March 13,
    2007, is brought on behalf of Arizona consumers and other payors
    for drugs, and alleges that the defendants violated the state
    consumer fraud statute by fraudulently reporting the Average
    Wholesale Price for certain drugs covered by



various private and public insurance mechanisms and by marketing
    these drugs to providers based on the providers’ ability to
    collect inflated payments from third-party payors. Motions to
    dismiss the complaint have not yet been filed and briefed. We
    have not formed an opinion that an unfavorable outcome is either
    “probable” or “remote” and do not express an
    opinion at this time as to the likely outcome of the matter or
    as to the magnitude or range of any potential loss. We believe
    that we have good and valid defenses to the complaint and intend
    to vigorously defend the case.

On January 6, 2006, we were served with a lawsuit,
    captioned United States of America ex rel. Paul P.
    McDermott v. Genentech, Inc. and Biogen Idec, Inc., filed
    in the United States District Court of the District of Maine
    (“Court”). The lawsuit was filed under seal on
    July 29, 2005 by a former employee of our co-defendant
    Genentech pursuant to the False Claims Act, 31 U.S.C.
    section 3729 et. seq. On December 20, 2005, the
    U.S. government elected not to intervene, and the complaint
    was subsequently unsealed and served. On April 4, 2006, the
    plaintiff filed his first amended complaint alleging, among
    other things, that we directly solicited physicians and their
    staff members to illegally market off-label uses of RITUXAN for
    treating rheumatoid arthritis, provided illegal kickbacks to
    physicians to promote off-label uses, trained our employees in
    methods of avoiding the detection of these off-label sales and
    marketing activities, formed a network of employees whose
    assigned duties involved off-label promotion of RITUXAN,
    intended and caused the off-label promotion of RITUXAN to result
    in the submission of false claims to the government, and
    conspired with Genentech to defraud the government. The
    plaintiff seeks entry of judgment on behalf of the United States
    of America against the defendants, an award to the plaintiff as
    relator, and all costs, expenses, attorneys’ fees, interest
    and other appropriate relief. On July 24, 2007, the
    District Court granted Biogen Idec’s motion to dismiss on
    the grounds that the Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction,
    the complaint fails to state a claim and the claims were not
    pleaded with particularity. Certain of plaintiff’s claims
    against Genentech are still pending. On August 14, 2007,
    the plaintiff filed a motion requesting that the Court allow the
    plaintiff to file an interlocutory appeal of the granting of
    Biogen Idec’s motion to dismiss. The court denied the
    motion on October 22, 2007. We have not formed an opinion
    that an unfavorable outcome is either “probable” or
    “remote” and do not express an opinion at this time as
    to the likely outcome of the matter or as to the magnitude or
    range of any potential loss. We believe that we have good and
    valid defenses to the complaint and intend to vigorously defend
    the case.

On June 17, 2006, Biogen Idec filed a Demand for
    Arbitration against Genentech, Inc. with the American
    Arbitration Association (“AAA”), which was amended on
    December 5, 2006 and January 29, 2008. Biogen Idec
    alleges that Genentech breached the parties’ Amended and
    Restated Collaboration Agreement dated June 19, 2003 (the
    “Collaboration Agreement”), by failing to honor Biogen
    Idec’s contractual right to participate in strategic
    decisions affecting the parties’ joint development and
    commercialization of certain pharmaceutical products, including
    humanized anti-CD20 antibodies. Genentech filed an Answering
    Statement in response to Biogen Idec’s Demand in which
    Genentech denied that it had breached the Collaboration
    Agreement and alleged that Biogen Idec had breached the
    Collaboration Agreement. Genentech also asserted for the first
    time that the November 2003 transaction in which Idec acquired
    Biogen and became Biogen Idec was a change of control under the
    Collaboration Agreement, a position with which we disagree
    strongly. It is our position that the Biogen Idec merger did not
    constitute a change of control under the Collaboration Agreement
    and that, even if it did, Genentech’s rights under the
    change of control provision, which must be asserted within
    90 days of the change of control event, have long since
    expired. We have not formed an opinion that an unfavorable
    outcome is either “probable” or “remote” and
    do not express an opinion at this time as to the likely outcome
    of the matter or as to the magnitude or range of any potential
    loss. We believe that we have good and valid defenses to
    Genentech’s allegations in the arbitration and intend to
    vigorously defend against these allegations.

On September 12, 2006, the Massachusetts Department of
    Revenue (“DOR”) issued a notice of assessment against
    Biogen Idec MA, Inc. for $38.9 million of corporate excise
    tax for the 2001, 2002 and 2003 tax years, which includes
    associated interest and penalties. On December 6, 2006, we
    filed an abatement application with the DOR, seeking abatements
    for

2001-2003.

The abatement application was denied on July 24, 2007. On
    July 25, 2007, we filed a petition with the Massachusetts
    Appellate Tax Board, seeking abatements of corporate excise tax
    for the

2001-2003

tax years and adjustments in certain credits and credit
    carryforwards for the

2001-2003 years.

Issues before the Board include the computation of Biogen
    MA’s sales factor for

2001-2003,

computation of Biogen MA’s research credits for those same
    years, and the availability of deductions for certain expenses
    and partnership flow-



through items. We intend to contest this matter vigorously. We
    believe that the assessment does not impact the level of
    liabilities for income tax contingencies.

On August 10, 2004, Classen Immunotherapies, Inc. filed
    suit against us, GlaxoSmithKline, Chiron Corporation,
    Merck & Co., Inc., and Kaiser-Permanente, Inc. in the
    U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland contending
    that we induced infringement of U.S. Patent Nos, 6,420,139,
    6,638,739, 5,728,383, and 5,723,283, all of which are directed
    to various methods of immunization or determination of
    immunization schedules. All Counts asserted against us by
    Classen were dismissed by the Court upon various motions filed
    by the Parties. In early December 2006, Classen filed its
    initial appeal brief with the United States Court of Appeals for
    the Federal Circuit. On March 7, 2007, we filed our brief
    in response. The Court of Appeals held oral argument on
    August 8, 2007. We have not formed an opinion that an
    unfavorable outcome is either “probable” or
    “remote” and do not express an opinion at this time as
    to the likely outcome of the matter or as to the magnitude or
    range of any potential loss. We believe that we have good and
    valid defenses to the complaint and intend to vigorously defend
    the case.

On January 30, 2007, the Estate of Thaddeus Leoniak commenced a
    civil lawsuit in the Court of Common Pleas, Philadelphia County,
    Pennsylvania, against Biogen Idec, the Fox Chase Cancer Center
    and three physicians. The complaint alleges that Thaddeus
    Leoniak died as a result of taking the drug ZEVALIN, and seeks
    to hold Biogen Idec strictly liable for placing an allegedly
    “unreasonably dangerous” product in the stream of
    commerce without proper warnings. The complaint also seeks to
    hold us liable for alleged negligence in the design,
    manufacture, advertising, marketing, promoting, distributing,
    supplying and selling of ZEVALIN. The lawsuit seeks damages for
    pecuniary losses suffered by the decedent’s survivors and
    for compensatory damages for decedent’s pain and suffering,
    loss of earnings and deprivation of normal activities, all in an
    amount “in excess of $50,000.” On January 31,
    2007, the Plaintiff’s counsel demanded $7.0 million to
    settle the lawsuit. We have not formed an opinion that an
    unfavorable outcome is either “probable” or
    “remote” and do not express an opinion at this time as
    to the likely outcome of the matter or as to the magnitude or
    range of any potential loss. We believe that we have good and
    valid defenses to the complaint and intend to vigorously defend
    the case.

In addition, we are involved in product liability claims and
    other legal proceedings generally incidental to our normal
    business activities. While the outcome of any of these
    additional claims and proceedings cannot be accurately
    predicted, we do not believe the ultimate resolution of any of
    these existing matters would have a material adverse effect on
    our business or financial condition.

Included in costs and expenses in 2007 is a charge of
    $18.4 million for in-process research and development
    related to the acquisition of Syntonix, Inc., and
    $64.3 million related to our collaborations with Cardiokine
    Biopharma LLC and Neurimmune SubOne AG, which we consolidated
    under FASB Interpretation No. 46,

Consolidation of
    Variable Interest Entities

, or FIN 46(R). The
    $64.3 million was offset by an equal amount of minority
    interest, resulting in no net impact to the results of the
    operations.

(7)

In July 2007, we purchased 56,424,155 shares of our common
    stock pursuant to a tender offer. We funded the transaction
    through existing cash and cash equivalents of
    $1,490.5 million and a short term loan of
    $1,500.0 million.

Executive
    Summary

Biogen Idec Inc. was formed in 2003 upon the acquisition of
    Biogen, Inc. by IDEC Pharmaceuticals Corporation in a merger
    transaction, or the Merger. We are a global biotechnology
    company that creates new standards of care in therapeutic areas
    of high unmet medical needs. We have two licensed biological
    bulk-manufacturing facilities, including our large-scale
    manufacturing plant in Research Triangle Park, NC, which is one
    of the world’s largest cell culture facilities. An
    additional large-scale manufacturing plant is under construction
    in Hillerød, Denmark. We maintain research centers of
    excellence in San Diego, CA and Cambridge, MA. We have
    additional offices in Canada, Brazil, Australia, Japan and
    throughout Europe, including our international headquarters in
    Zug, Switzerland and operate a global distribution network,
    which covers over 70 countries. We currently employ
    approximately 4,300 people worldwide.

Results for the year ended December 31, 2007 included total
    revenue of $3,171.6 million, net income of
    $638.2 million and diluted net income per share of $1.99.
    These results reflect an increase in revenue primarily
    attributable to the continued growth in TYSABRI revenue, an
    increase in RITUXAN revenues from our unconsolidated joint
    business arrangement as well as the impact of price increases on
    our AVONEX product. The effect of the increase in revenue was
    partially offset by an increase in research and development
    expense due to new and existing clinical trials and other
    projects and an increase in selling, general and administrative
    expense related to increased personnel to support ongoing
    TYSABRI and AVONEX sales.

In January 2008, we received notice from Icahn Partners LP and
    certain of its affiliates for the nomination of three
    individuals to our Board of Directors at the Company’s 2008
    Annual Meeting. The notice also includes a proposal to amend the
    our bylaws to set the size of the Board at 12. Our Board of
    Directors will review the notice and consider it in light of the
    best interests of all shareholders of the Company.



In October 2007, we announced that our Board of Directors had
    authorized management to evaluate whether third parties would
    have an interest in acquiring us at a price and on terms that
    would represent a better value for our stockholders than having
    us continue to execute our strategy on a stand-alone basis. In
    December 2007, we announced that the board of directors had
    completed this evaluation, it resulted in no definitive offers
    to acquire the company and we will continue as an independent
    company.

In November 2007, we entered into an agreement with Neurimmune
    SubOne AG, or Neurimmune, for the worldwide development and
    commercialization of human antibodies for the treatment of
    Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Neurimmune will conduct research
    to identify potential therapeutic antibodies and we will be
    responsible for the development and commercialization of all
    products. Under the terms of the agreement, we paid a
    $2.0 million upfront payment and could pay up to an
    additional $378.0 million if certain milestones are met, as
    well as a royalty on net sales of any products.

In August 2007, an agreement with Cardiokine Biopharma LLC
    became effective for the joint development of lixivaptan, an
    oral compound for the potential treatment of hyponatremia in
    patients with congestive heart failure. We will be responsible
    for the global commercialization of lixivaptan and Cardiokine
    Biopharma LLC has an option for limited co-promotion in the
    United States. Under the terms of the agreement, we paid a
    $50.0 million upfront fee and could pay up to an additional
    $170.0 million if certain milestones are met.

In July 2007, we completed a tender offer in which we purchased
    56,424,155 shares of our common stock for a purchase price
    of $2,990.5 million. We funded the transaction in July 2007
    through existing cash and cash equivalents of
    $1,490.5 million and by obtaining a short-term loan for
    $1,500.0 million. We retired all of these shares in July
    2007.

In January 2007, we completed the acquisition of 100% of the
    stock of Syntonix Pharmaceuticals, Inc. for total initial
    consideration of $44.4 million and contingent payments of
    up to $124.4 million, if certain milestones are achieved.

Marketed
    Products

We currently have four products:

•

AVONEX

®

(interferon beta-1a);

•

RITUXAN

®

(rituximab);

•

TYSABRI

®

(natalizumab);

•

FUMADERM

®

(dimethylfumarate and monoethylfumarate salts)

In December 2007, we sold the U.S. marketing, sales, and
    manufacturing and development right of
    ZEVALIN

®

to Cell Therapeutics, Inc., or CTI, for an upfront purchase
    price of $10.0 million and up to an additional
    $20.0 million in milestone payments. In addition, we will
    receive royalty payments on future sales of ZEVALIN. As part of
    the overall agreement, we entered into a supply agreement with
    CTI to sell ZEVALIN product through 2014 and a related services
    and security agreement under which CTI has agreed to reimburse
    us for costs incurred in an ongoing randomized clinical trial
    for ZEVALIN with respect to aggressive non-Hodgkin’s
    lymphoma, or NHL. The $10.0 million upfront payment will be
    recognized in our results of operations over the term of the
    supply agreement.

Through April 2006, we recorded product revenues from sales of
    AMEVIVE

®

(alefacept). In April 2006, we sold the worldwide rights to this
    product to Astellas Pharma US, Inc., or Astellas. We will
    continue to manufacture and supply this product to Astellas for
    a period of up to 11 years. Under the terms of the supply
    agreement, we charge Astellas fixed amounts based on volume.
    Such amounts will be recognized as corporate partner revenue and
    are not expected to be significant.

Most of our revenues are currently dependent on AVONEX, TYSABRI,
    and RITUXAN. In the near term, we are dependent on the continued
    sales growth of TYSABRI to grow our overall revenues. In the
    longer term, our revenue growth is dependent on the successful
    clinical development, regulatory approval and launch of current
    pipeline products and other in-licensed or acquired products and
    programs.



Continued growth of global AVONEX sales is primarily dependent
    on maintaining AVONEX’s position as the most prescribed
    multiple sclerosis, or MS, therapy in the U.S. and growing
    AVONEX market share outside the U.S. In both the
    U.S. and globally, we face increasing competition in the MS
    market from currently marketed products and future products in
    late stage development. We continue to generate data showing
    AVONEX to be an effective and safe choice for MS patients and
    physicians.

The majority of RITUXAN sales are currently from use in the
    oncology setting. We believe there is additional room for
    RITUXAN sales growth in the immunology setting, where RITUXAN is
    currently indicated for patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis, or
    RA, with inadequate response to anti-tumor necrosis factor
    therapies, or TNF-IR RA patients. Additional immunology
    indications for RITUXAN that we are investigating include
    earlier stage RA patients with inadequate response to
    disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs, or DMARD-IR patients, MS
    and lupus.

In July 2006, we began to ship TYSABRI in the U.S. in
    connection with the re-introduction and internationally for the
    first time. TYSABRI sales are currently for use in the relapsing
    remitting MS setting. Growth in TYSABRI revenue will be
    dependent on the generation of a larger and longer term safety
    database as well as continued acceptance by physicians and MS
    patients. In January 2008, the FDA approved TYSABRI as a
    treatment of certain patients with Crohn’s disease.

Clinical
    Studies

Over the past few years, we have incurred significant
    expenditures related to conducting clinical studies to develop
    new pharmaceutical products and exploring the utility of our
    existing products in treating disorders beyond those currently
    approved in their respective labels. For 2008, we expect to
    continue to incur significant levels of research and development
    expenditures. We have a number of pipeline products in late
    stage clinical trials, including over 15 pipeline products in
    Phase 2 or Phase 3 trials. Pipeline products for which we have
    entered or initiated Phase 3 trials include:

•

BG-12 for relapsing forms of MS;

•

Galiximab for NHL; and

•

RITUXAN for a number of indications, including chronic
    lymphocytic leukemia, RA, primary progressive MS and lupus
    nephritis.

In addition to the expense associated with these late stage
    trials, other pipeline products are in ongoing or are expected
    to enter proof of concept trials in 2008.

Business
    Development

As part of our business strategy, we plan to consider and, as
    appropriate, make acquisitions of other businesses, products,
    product rights or technologies. Our cash reserves and other
    liquid assets may be inadequate to consummate such acquisitions
    and develop such products

and/or

technologies, and it may be necessary for us to raise
    substantial additional funds in the future to complete future
    transactions. In addition, as a result of our acquisition
    efforts, we may experience significant charges to earnings for
    merger and related expenses that may include transaction costs,
    closure costs or acquired in-process research and development
    charges.

Other

We may experience significant fluctuations in quarterly results,
    primarily based on the level and timing of:

•

product revenues;

•

cost of product sales;

•

collaboration revenues;

•

cost of clinical trials, regulatory approvals and product
    approvals;

•

marketing and other expenses;



•

manufacturing or supply disruptions; and

•

costs associated with the operations of recently-acquired
    businesses and technologies.

We expect to use our cash, cash equivalents and marketable
    securities for working capital and general corporate purposes,
    including the acquisition of businesses, products, product
    rights or technologies, as well as potential repayment of
    short-term debt. At this time, we cannot accurately predict the
    effect of certain developments on the rate of future revenue
    growth, such as the degree of market acceptance, the impact of
    competition, the effectiveness of our sales and marketing
    efforts and the outcome of our current efforts to develop,
    receive approval for and successfully launch our near-term
    product candidates.

For 2007 compared to 2006, U.S. sales of AVONEX increased
    $62.8 million, or 6.1%, primarily due to the impact of
    price increases offset by decreased product demand resulting in
    lower volume. For 2007 compared to 2006 and international sales
    of AVONEX increased $98.3 million, or 14.4%, primarily due
    to the impact of exchange rates and higher sales volume.

For 2006 compared to 2005, U.S. sales of AVONEX increased
    $83.5 million, or 8.9%, primarily due to the impact of
    price increases and a reduction in discounts associated with the
    introduction of the Medicare Part D prescription drug
    benefit. These increases were offset by lower volume. For 2006
    compared to 2005, international sales of AVONEX increased
    $80.1 million, or 13.3%, primarily due to increases in
    volume and price, including the impact of patient mix. Foreign
    exchange accounted for a 0.6% increase in reported revenues; on
    a local currency basis, international sales increased 12.7%.

We expect to face increasing competition in the MS marketplace
    in and outside the U.S. from existing and new MS
    treatments, including TYSABRI, which may impact sales of AVONEX.
    We expect future sales of AVONEX to be dependent to a large
    extent on our ability to compete successfully with the products
    of our competitors.

Under the terms of a collaboration agreement with Elan
    Corporation plc, or Elan, we manufacture TYSABRI and collaborate
    with Elan on the product’s marketing, commercial
    distribution and on-going development activities. We recognize
    revenue for sales of TYSABRI in the U.S. upon Elan’s
    shipment of the product to third party distributors. We
    recognize revenue for sales of TYSABRI outside the U.S. at
    the time of product delivery to our customers.

In November 2004, TYSABRI was approved by the U.S. Food and
    Drug Administration, or FDA, as a treatment for relapsing forms
    of MS to reduce the frequency of clinical relapses. In February
    2005, in consultation with the FDA, we and Elan voluntarily
    suspended the marketing and commercial distribution of TYSABRI,
    and we informed physicians that they should suspend dosing of
    TYSABRI until further notification. In 2005, our net revenue
    associated with sales of TYSABRI was $4.7 million, which
    consisted of revenue of $15.1 million from sales that
    occurred prior to our voluntary suspension, offset by an
    allowance for sales returns of $10.4 million related to
    returns of product sold prior to the suspension.

On June 5, 2006, the FDA approved a supplemental Biologics
    License Application, or sBLA, for the reintroduction of TYSABRI
    as a monotherapy treatment for relapsing forms of MS to slow the
    progression of disability and reduce the frequency of clinical
    relapses. On June 29, 2006, we and Elan announced that the
    European Medicines Agency, or EMEA, had approved TYSABRI as a
    similar treatment. In July 2006, we began to ship TYSABRI in
    both the United States and Europe. In 2006, we recorded revenue
    on sales of TYSABRI in the U.S. and Europe relating to 2006
    activity of $11.9 million and $10.0 million,
    respectively. Prior to the suspension of TYSABRI in 2005, we
    shipped product to Elan in the U.S. and recognized revenue
    in accordance with the policy described above. As a result of
    the suspension of TYSABRI, we had deferred $14.0 million in
    revenue related to TYSABRI product that remained in Elan’s
    ending inventory. This amount was paid by Elan during 2005 and
    was subsequently recognized as revenue during 2006, when the
    uncertainty about the ultimate disposition of the product was
    eliminated. In 2007, we have recorded revenue on sales of
    TYSABRI in the U.S. and Europe of $104.4 million and
    $125.5 million, respectively. The increase in 2007 sales
    over 2006 sales is primarily due to an increase in the number of
    patients using TYSABRI and increased volumes, as the product was
    being shipped for the entire 12 months during 2007.

During 2007 and 2006, we had product on hand that had been fully
    written-off in 2005 due to the uncertainties surrounding the
    TYSABRI suspension but which is available to fill future orders.
    As we sold TYSABRI in 2007 and 2006, we realized lower than
    normal cost of sales and, therefore, higher margins, as we
    shipped the inventory that had been previously written-off. For
    2007 and 2006, cost of sales was approximately
    $12.6 million and $2.6 million, respectively, lower
    due to the sale of TYSABRI that had been previously written-off.
    All TYSABRI inventory that had been previously written-off had
    been shipped as of December 31, 2007.

FUMADERM

FUMADERM was produced by Fumapharm, which we acquired in June
    2006. In December 2006, we acquired the right to distribute
    FUMADERM in Germany from Fumedica, beginning on May 1,
    2007. In connection with the acquisition of the FUMADERM
    distribution rights in Germany, we committed to the repurchase
    of any inventory Fumedica had not sold by May 1, 2007. As a
    result of this provision, we deferred the recognition of revenue
    on shipments made to Fumedica through April 30, 2007. We
    resumed recognizing revenue on sales of FUMADERM into the German
    market in May 2007. Sales of FUMADERM for 2007 and 2006 were
    $21.5 million and $9.5 million, respectively. The
    increase in 2007 sales over 2006 sales is primarily due to
    increased volumes.

ZEVALIN

In 2007, 2006 and 2005 sales of ZEVALIN were $16.9 million,
    $17.8 million and $20.7 million, respectively, of
    which $13.9 million, $16.4 million, and
    $19.4 million respectively, were generated in the
    U.S. The decrease in total ZEVALIN sales in 2007 compared
    to 2006 was primarily due to the reduction in sales and
    marketing efforts in 2007 as we prepared for the sale of our
    rights to market, sell, manufacture and develop ZEVALIN in the
    U.S., which was completed in December 2007.



AMEVIVE

In 2007, 2006 and 2005, sales of AMEVIVE were $0.7 million,
    $11.5 million and $48.5 million, respectively, of
    which $0.3 million, $5.0 million and
    $34.9 million, respectively, were generated in the
    U.S. The decrease in total AMEVIVE sales for 2007 compared
    to 2006 and for 2006 compared to 2005 was due to the sale, in
    April 2006, of our worldwide rights and infrastructure related
    to sales, production, and marketing of AMEVIVE.

Although we sold the rights to this product, we continue to
    report a small amount of product revenues related to shipments
    made by certain of our overseas joint ventures, which we
    consolidate.

Provisions
    for Discounts and Allowances

Revenues from product sales are recognized when product is
    shipped and title and risk of loss has passed to the customer,
    typically upon delivery. Revenues are recorded net of applicable
    allowances for trade term discounts, wholesaler incentives,
    Medicaid rebates, Veteran’s Administration, or VA, rebates,
    managed care rebates, product returns, other applicable
    allowances and, in 2006 and 2005, patient assistance and patient
    replacement goods. The estimates we make with respect to these
    allowances represent significant judgments.

Effective January 1, 2007, we changed the manner in which
    we administer our patient assistance and patient replacement
    goods programs. Prior to January 1, 2007, AVONEX product
    shipped for these programs was invoiced and recorded as gross
    product revenue and an offsetting provision for discount and
    returns was recorded for expected credit requests from the
    distributor that administers these programs on our behalf.
    Effective January 1, 2007, we entered into a new
    arrangement with a distributor, which established a consignment
    sales model. Under the new sales model, gross revenue is not
    recorded for product shipped to satisfy these programs, and cost
    of sales is recorded when the product is shipped.

Provisions for discounts and allowances reduced gross product
    revenues as follows (in millions):

Our product revenue reserves are based on estimates of the
    amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales. These
    estimates take into consideration our historical experience,
    current contractual and statutory requirements, specific known
    market events and trends and forecasted customer buying
    patterns. If actual results vary, we may need to adjust these
    estimates, which could have an effect on earnings in the period
    of the adjustment.

Product revenue reserves are categorized as follows: discounts,
    contractual adjustments and returns.

Discount reserves include trade term discounts, wholesaler
    incentives and, in 2006 and 2005, patient assistance. For 2007
    compared to 2006, discounts decreased $57.2 million, or
    55.6%, resulting from a $67.5 million reduction related to
    the change of patient assistance to a consignment model, offset
    by increases in trade term discounts and wholesaler incentives.
    For 2006 compared to 2005, discounts decreased
    $3.6 million, or 3.4%, reflecting lower amounts of AVONEX
    distributed through our patient assistance program.

Contractual adjustment reserves relate to Medicaid, VA and
    managed care rebates and other applicable allowances. For 2007
    compared to 2006, contractual adjustments increased
    $11.9 million, or 12.8%, primarily due to the impact of
    higher reserves for managed care (associated with higher level
    of activity with respect to rebates) and Medicaid and VA
    programs (associated with price increases). For 2006 compared to
    2005, contractual adjustments were consistent reflecting more
    activity in the managed care markets, offset by a reduction in
    Medicaid activity due to the introduction of Medicare
    Part D, the expanded prescription drug benefit program.

Product return reserves are established for returns made by
    wholesalers and our patient replacement goods program in 2006
    and 2005. In accordance with contractual terms, wholesalers are
    permitted to return product for reasons such as damaged or
    expired product. We also accept returns from our patients for
    various reasons. For 2007



compared to 2006, returns decreased $16.6 million, or
    42.9%, primarily due to a $15.0 million decrease related to
    the change to a consignment sales model for patient replacement
    goods. For 2006 compared to 2005, returns increased
    $12.7 million, or 48.8%, as a result of an adjustment of
    $6.9 million to increase reserve levels to correct prior
    period errors, and higher return experience in 2006. These
    increases were offset by the impact of returns made in
    connection with the suspension of TYSABRI in 2005.

Reserves for product returns are recorded in the period the
    related revenue is recognized, resulting in a reduction to
    product sales. The majority of wholesaler returns are due to
    product expiration. Expired product return reserves are
    estimated through a comparison of historical return data to
    their related sales on a production lot basis. Historical rates
    of return are determined for each product and are adjusted for
    known or expected changes in the marketplace specific to each
    product.

Unconsolidated
    Joint Business Revenues

We copromote RITUXAN in the U.S. in collaboration with
    Genentech, Inc., or Genentech, under a collaboration agreement
    between the parties. Under the collaboration agreement, we
    granted Genentech a worldwide license to develop, commercialize
    and market RITUXAN in multiple indications. In exchange for
    these worldwide rights, we have copromotion rights in the
    U.S. and a contractual arrangement under which Genentech
    shares a portion of the pretax U.S. copromotion profits of
    RITUXAN with us. This collaboration was created through a
    contractual arrangement, not through a joint venture or other
    legal entity. In June 2003, we amended and restated our
    collaboration agreement with Genentech to include the
    development and commercialization of one or more anti-CD20
    antibodies targeting B-cell disorders, in addition to RITUXAN,
    for a broad range of indications.

In the U.S., we contribute resources to selling and the
    continued development of RITUXAN. Genentech is responsible for
    worldwide manufacturing of RITUXAN. Genentech also is
    responsible for the primary support functions for the
    commercialization of RITUXAN in the U.S. including selling
    and marketing, customer service, order entry, distribution,
    shipping and billing. Genentech also incurs the majority of
    continuing development costs for RITUXAN. Under the arrangement,
    we have a limited sales force as well as limited development
    activity.

Under the terms of separate sublicense agreements between
    Genentech and F. Hoffman-La Roche Ltd., or Roche,
    commercialization of RITUXAN outside the U.S. is the
    responsibility of Roche, except in Japan where Roche copromotes
    RITUXAN in collaboration with Zenyaku Kogyo Co Ltd., or Zenyaku.
    There is no direct contractual arrangement between us and Roche
    or Zenyaku.

Revenues from unconsolidated joint business consists of our
    share of pretax copromotion profits, which is calculated by
    Genentech, and includes consideration of our RITUXAN-related
    sales force and development expenses, and royalty revenue from
    sales of RITUXAN outside the U.S. by Roche and Zenyaku.
    Pre-tax copromotion profit consists of U.S. sales of
    RITUXAN to third-party customers net of discounts and allowances
    less the cost to manufacture RITUXAN, third-party royalty
    expenses, distribution, selling and marketing expenses, and
    joint development expenses incurred by Genentech and us.

Net sales of RITUXAN to third-party customers in the
    U.S. recorded by Genentech for 2007 were
    $2,284.8 million compared to $2,071.2 million in 2006
    and $1,831.5 million in 2005. The increase in 2007 from
    2006 was primarily due to increased unit sales in treatments of
    B-cell NHLs and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (an unapproved use
    of RITUXAN), increased utilization for RA and increases in the
    wholesale price of RITUXAN. The increase in 2006 from 2005 was
    primarily due to the approval by the FDA of RITUXAN for two new
    indications, RA and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and an
    increase in wholesale prices.

For 2007 compared to 2006, reimbursements of selling and
    development expenses decreased $2.6 million, or 4.2%. For
    2006 compared to 2005, such reimbursements increased
    $13.5 million, or 28.3%. This increase was primarily due to
    the expansion of the oncology sales force and development costs
    we incurred related to the development of RITUXAN for RA.

Our royalty revenue on sales of RITUXAN outside the U.S. is
    based on Roche and Zenyaku’s net sales to third-party
    customers and is recorded on a cash basis. Royalty revenues in
    2007 compared to 2006 increased $56.8 million, or 29.3% due
    to increased sales of RITUXAN outside the U.S. Royalty
    revenues in 2006 compared to 2005 increased $46.5 million,
    or 31.5%, primarily due to increased market penetration and an
    increase in prices. The royalty period with respect to all
    products is 11 years from the first commercial sale of such
    product on a country by country basis. RITUXAN was launched in
    1998 in most European countries and in 2001 in Japan.

Under the amended and restated collaboration agreement, our
    current pretax copromotion profit-sharing formula, which resets
    annually, is as follows:

Biogen Idec’s Share

Copromotion Operating Profits

of Copromotion Profits

First $50 million


%

Greater than $50 million


%

In 2007, 2006, and 2005, the 40% threshold was met during the
    first quarter.

For each calendar year or portion thereof following the approval
    date of the first new anti-CD20 product, the pretax copromotion
    profit-sharing formula for RITUXAN and other anti-CD20 products
    sold by us and Genentech will change. Additionally, under the
    amended and restated collaboration agreement, we will receive
    lower royalty revenue from Genentech on sales by Roche and
    Zenyaku of new anti-CD20 products, if and when commercially
    available, as compared to royalty revenue received on sales of
    RITUXAN. (See Note 16, Unconsolidated Joint Business
    Arrangement, for further detail).

Royalty
    Revenues

We receive revenues from royalties on sales by our licensees of
    a number of products covered under patents that we control. Our
    royalty revenues on sales of RITUXAN outside the U.S. are
    included in revenues from unconsolidated joint business in the
    accompanying consolidated statements of income.

For 2007 compared to 2006, royalty revenues increased
    $15.9 million, or 18.4%, primarily due to an increase in
    sales levels of products under license partially offset by the
    expiration of royalties under certain contracts. For 2006
    compared to 2005, royalty revenue decreased $7.0 million,
    or 7.5%, primarily due to a decrease in sales levels of products
    under license and to the expiration of certain contracts.

We anticipate that total royalty revenues in future years will
    continue to represent a lower proportion of our total revenues.
    Royalty revenues may fluctuate as a result of fluctuations in
    sales levels of products sold by our licensees from quarter to
    quarter due to the timing and extent of major events such as new
    indication approvals or government-sponsored programs.

Inventory
    Write-Offs

We periodically review our inventories for excess or obsolete
    inventory and write-down obsolete or otherwise unmarketable
    inventory to its estimated net realizable value. If the actual
    net realizable value is less than that estimated by us, or if it
    is determined that inventory utilization will further diminish
    based on estimates of demand, additional inventory write-downs
    may be required. Additionally, our products are subject to
    strict quality control and monitoring which we perform
    throughout the manufacturing process. Periodically, certain
    batches or units of product may no longer meet quality
    specifications or may expire. As a result, included in product
    cost of revenues were write-downs of commercial inventory that
    did not meet quality specifications or that became obsolete due
    to expiration. In all cases product inventory was written-down
    to its estimated net realizable value.

We closely monitor levels of inventory in our distribution
    channel. At both December 31, 2007 and 2006, we had
    approximately 2 weeks of inventory with wholesalers in our
    distribution channel. The shelf life associated with our
    products is generally between 15 and 48 months, depending
    on the product. Obsolescence due to dating



expiration has not been a historical concern, given the rapidity
    in which our products move through the channel. Changes due to
    our competitors’ price movements have not adversely
    affected us. We do not provide incentives to our distributors to
    assume additional inventory levels beyond what is customary in
    their ordinary course of business.

We have written-down the following inventory, which was charged
    to cost of sales (in millions):

Research
    and Development Expenses

Research and development expenses totaled $925.2 million in
    2007 compared to $718.4 million in 2006 and
    $747.7 million in 2005.

For 2007 compared to 2006, research and development expenses
    increased $206.8 million, or 28.8%, primarily due to
    approximately $65.5 million of expense for the development
    of lixivaptan, (including a $50 million upfront payment to
    Cardiokine Biopharma LLC), a $12.4 million increase for
    ADENTRI projects, a $32.6 million increase for lumiliximab
    projects, a $15.2 million increase for BG-12 projects, a
    $13.5 million increase for HSP90i projects, a
    $12.4 million increase for IGF-1R projects, a
    $27.6 million increase for baminercept-alfa (LTBR-Fc)
    projects and $18.4 million of research and development
    costs related to Syntonix projects.

For 2006 compared to 2005, research and development expenses
    decreased $29.3 million, or 3.9%, primarily due to a
    $61.5 million reduction in salary and benefits arising from
    headcount reductions in 2005, a $20.0 million decrease
    related to the NIMO facility that was sold in the second quarter
    of 2005, and a $23.0 million decrease for clinical trials,
    primarily related to TYSABRI and AMEVIVE. These decreases were
    offset by a $11.2 million increase for new collaborations
    during the year, a $10.8 million increase for higher
    clinical manufacturing, and the $51.5 million impact of
    share-based compensation recognized under Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards (revised 2004) No. 123R,

Share-based Payments

, or SFAS 123(R), in 2006.

We expect that research and development expenses will increase
    in 2008 for a number of reasons, including our expected clinical
    trial costs, costs incurred with our collaborative development
    efforts, and pursuit of additional research opportunities.

Selling,
    General and Administrative Expenses

Selling, general and administrative expenses totaled
    $776.1 million in 2007 compared to $685.0 million in
    2006 and $644.8 million in 2005.



For 2007 compared to 2006, selling, general and administrative
    expenses increased $91.1 million, or 13.3%, primarily due
    to a $65.0 million increase in sales and marketing
    activities for TYSABRI, primarily in international sales and
    marketing, a $25.5 million net increase in salaries and
    benefits related to increased headcount in general and
    administrative personnel, a $19.0 million increase in fees
    and services related to general and administrative matters
    offset by a $12.1 million decrease in sales and marketing
    activities for ZEVALIN due to decreased commercial efforts due
    to the planned divestiture of this product line.

For 2006 compared to 2005, selling, general and administrative
    expenses increased $40.2 million, or 6.2%, primarily due to
    $21.5 million of higher expenses related to sales of
    RITUXAN in RA, $20.3 million of increased sales expenses
    for the re-launch of TYSABRI, $4.3 million of lower
    reimbursements related to collaboration agreements and
    $45.2 million of higher expenses related to share-based
    compensation recognized under SFAS 123(R) in 2006. These
    increases were offset by $31.0 million of lower expenses
    related to sales of AMEVIVE due to its divestiture and a
    $20.0 million decrease in expenses related to sales of
    ZEVALIN, due in part to the planned divestiture, and also due to
    the impact of a charge taken in 2005 related to a write-down of
    remaining prepaid expense associated with our arrangement with
    MDS Nordion.

We anticipate that total selling, general, and administrative
    expenses in 2008 will be higher than 2007 due to sales,
    marketing and other general and administrative expenses to
    primarily support AVONEX and TYSABRI, especially in the
    international market.

Severance
    and Other Restructuring Costs

Severance and other restructuring costs totaled
    $1.8 million in 2007 as compared to $3.6 million in
    2006 and $31.4 million in 2005. These costs are included in
    selling, general and administrative expense in our consolidated
    statements of income. At December 31, 2007, there are no
    remaining material severance or restructuring accruals on our
    consolidated balance sheets.

For 2006, $3.6 million of restructuring charges were
    included in selling, general and administrative expenses,
    including $1.2 million in severance costs associated with
    the acquisition of Conforma during 2006 and $1.7 million
    related in headcount reductions related to the planned
    disposition of our ZEVALIN product line. Costs not yet paid as
    of December 31, 2006, were $2.1 million, and are
    included in accrued expenses and other on our consolidated
    balance sheet. See Note 22, Severance and Other
    Restructuring Costs, of the consolidated financial statements,
    for details on the change in reserve levels related to severance.

In September 2005, we consolidated or eliminated certain
    internal management layers and staff functions, resulting in a
    17% reduction of our workforce at that time. These adjustments
    took place across company functions, departments and sites, and
    were substantially implemented by the end of 2005. We recorded
    restructuring charges of $31.4 million in connection with
    these activities, of which $28.3 million related to
    severance and other employee termination costs, including health
    benefits, outplacement and bonuses. Other costs were
    $3.1 million and included write-downs of certain research
    assets that will no longer be utilized, consulting costs in
    connection with the restructuring effort, and costs related to
    the acceleration of restricted stock, offset by the reversal of
    previously recognized compensation due to unvested restricted
    stock cancellations.

Effective December 31, 2005, our former Executive Chairman
    and Chairman of the Board retired and resigned. The charges
    related to this retirement amounted to $7.1 million and
    were all paid in 2005.

We may have additional charges in future periods. The amount of
    those future charges cannot be determined at this time.

Amortization
    of Intangible Assets

For 2007, 2006, and 2005, amortization expense was
    $257.5 million, $267.0 million and
    $302.3 million, respectively.

Our most significant intangible asset is the core technology
    related to our AVONEX product. Our amortization policy for our
    core technology intangible asset is based on the principles of
    Statement of Financial Standards No. 142,

Goodwill and
    Other Intangible Assets,

or SFAS 142, which requires
    the amortization of intangible assets to



reflect the pattern in which the economic benefits of the
    intangible asset are consumed. Every year during the third
    quarter we complete our long range planning cycle, which
    includes an analysis of the anticipated product sales of AVONEX.
    The results of this forecast serve as the basis for our
    assumptions used in the economic consumption amortization model
    for our core technology intangible asset. We also establish
    minimum annual amortization amounts to ensure amortization
    charges are not unreasonably deferred to future periods. See
    Note 1, Business Overview and Significant Accounting
    Policies, for a detailed description of our accounting policy
    for amortization of intangible assets.

For 2007 compared to 2006, amortization expense decreased
    $9.5 million, or 3.6%, primarily due to the changes in
    estimate of the future revenue of AVONEX, which serves as the
    basis in our calculation of economic consumption for core
    technology.

For 2006 compared to 2005, amortization expense decreased
    $35.3 million, or 11.7%, primarily due to the changes in
    estimate of the future revenue of AVONEX, which serves as the
    basis for our calculation of economic consumption for core
    technology. Additionally, in 2005, a $7.9 million
    impairment charge was recorded to write-down certain core
    technology intangible assets related to AVONEX to their fair
    value.

We review our intangible assets for impairment when events or
    changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an
    asset may not be recoverable. If future events or circumstances
    indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be
    recoverable, we may be required to record additional charges to
    our results of operations.

In-Process
    Research and Development (IPR&D)

IPR&D charges totaled $84.2 million in 2007, compared
    with $330.5 million in 2006. No IPR&D charges were
    taken in 2005.

During the year ended December 31, 2007, we recorded
    IPR&D charges of $84.2 million. The principal
    components of this amount are as follows: $18.4 million
    related to the acquisition of Syntonix, approximately
    $30 million related to the collaboration with Cardiokine
    Biopharma LLC, and $34.3 million related to the
    collaboration with Neurimmune. In 2006, we recorded
    $207.4 million and $123.1 million in IPR&D
    related to the acquisitions of Fumapharm AG, or Fumapharm, and
    Conforma, respectively. See Note 2, Acquisitions and
    Dispositions, and Note 15, Research Collaborations of the
    Consolidated Financial Statements.

Cardiokine Biopharma LLC and Neurimmune are variable interest
    entities, as defined in FIN 46(R). The consolidation of
    these entities resulted in IPR&D charges. The IPR&D
    charges have been recorded as a component of operating income.
    However, because the IPR&D charges relate to the fair value
    of the underlying technology retained by the parent companies of
    Cardiokine Biopharma LLC and Neurimmune, these amounts were
    allocated to the respective minority interests. Consequently,
    minority interest of $64.3 million was recorded as a
    component of non-operating income.

Facility
    Impairments and (Gain) Loss on Disposition, net

In 2007, we sold approximately 28 acres of land in
    Oceanside, California for $16.5 million. We recorded a
    pre-tax gain of approximately $7.2 million on the sale,
    which is included in other income (expense) on the accompanying
    consolidated statement of income, as this land was not utilized
    in our operations.

In December 2006, we completed the sale of one of the buildings
    in our Cambridge, Massachusetts facility, known as Bio 1.
    Proceeds from the sale were approximately $39.5 million. We
    recorded a pre-tax gain of approximately $15.6 million on
    the sale. We continued to occupy a minor portion of the building
    under a leasing arrangement. In February 2006, we sold our
    clinical manufacturing facility in Oceanside, California, known
    as NICO. The assets associated with the facility were included
    in assets held for sale on our consolidated balance sheet as of
    December 31, 2005. Total consideration was
    $29.0 million. In 2005, we recorded impairment charges
    totaling $28.0 million to reduce the carrying value of NICO
    to its net realizable value. No additional loss resulted from
    completion of the sale.

In June 2005, we sold our large-scale biologics manufacturing
    facility in Oceanside, California, known as NIMO, along with
    approximately 60 acres of real property located in
    Oceanside, California upon which NIMO is



located, together with improvements, related property rights,
    and certain personal property intangibles and contracts at or
    related to the real property. Total consideration for the sale
    was $408.1 million. The loss from this transaction was
    $83.5 million which consisted primarily of the write-down
    of NIMO to net selling price, sales and transfer taxes, and
    other associated transaction costs. After our voluntary
    suspension of TYSABRI, we reconsidered our construction plans
    and determined that we would proceed with the bulk manufacturing
    component of our large-scale biologic manufacturing facility in
    Hillerød, Denmark, but determined that we would no longer
    proceed with the fill-finish component of the facility. As a
    result, we recorded an impairment charge of approximately
    $6.2 million in 2005 related to the fill-finish component
    that had previously been capitalized.

Gain
    on Settlement of License Agreements, net

In 2006, we recorded a net gain on settlement of license
    agreements, net of $6.1 million.

Fumapharm

During 2006, we recorded a gain of $34.2 million coincident
    with the acquisition of Fumapharm in accordance with

EITF 04-1,

Accounting for Preexisting Relationships between the Parties
    to a Business Combination,

or

EITF 04-1.

The gain related to the settlement of a preexisting
    collaboration agreement between Fumapharm and us. The
    collaboration agreement was entered into in October 2003 and
    required payments to Fumapharm of certain royalty amounts. The
    market rate for such payments was higher at the acquisition
    date, primarily due to the increased technical feasibility of
    BG-12. The gain relates to the difference between the royalty
    rates at the time the agreement was entered into as compared to
    the rates at the time the agreement was effectively settled by
    virtue of our acquisition of Fumapharm.

Fumedica

During 2006, we recorded a charge of $28.1 million in
    connection with a settlement agreement with Fumedica
    Arzneimittel AG and Fumedica Arzneimittel GmbH, collectively
    Fumedica. The charge related to the settlement of the agreement
    with Fumedica under which we were contingently obligated to make
    royalty payments with respect to a successful launch of BG-12
    for psoriasis in Germany. Under the terms of the settlement
    agreement, we will not be required to make any royalty payments
    to Fumedica if BG-12 is successfully launched for psoriasis in
    Germany. The $28.1 million was expensed in 2006, as it
    related to a product that has not reached technological
    feasibility.

Share-based
    Compensation Expense

In the year ended December 31, 2007, we recorded
    share-based compensation expense of $123.1 million
    associated with SFAS 123(R). In the year ended
    December 31, 2006, we recorded share-based compensation
    expense of $126.8 million associated with SFAS 123(R),
    which is net of a cumulative effect pre-tax adjustment of
    $5.6 million, or $3.8 million after-tax. The
    cumulative effect results from the application of an estimated
    forfeiture rate for current and prior period unvested restricted
    stock awards.

Our share-based compensation programs consist of share-based
    awards granted to employees including stock options, restricted
    stock, performance share units and restricted stock units, or
    RSUs, as well as our employee stock purchase plan, or ESPP.

Effective January 1, 2006, we adopted SFAS 123(R).
    This Statement requires compensation cost relating to
    share-based awards to be recognized in the financial statements
    using a fair-value measurement method. Under the fair value
    method, the estimated fair value of awards is charged against
    income over the requisite service period, which is generally the
    vesting period. We selected the modified prospective method as
    prescribed in SFAS 123(R) and, therefore, prior periods
    were not restated. Under the modified prospective method, this
    Statement was applied to awards granted subsequent to
    January 1, 2006, as well as to the unvested portion of
    previously granted equity-based awards for which the requisite
    service had not been rendered as of December 31, 2005. The
    fair value of performance based stock units is based on the
    market price of our stock on the date of grant and assumes that
    the performance criteria will be met and the target payout level
    will be achieved. Compensation expense is adjusted for
    subsequent changes in the outcome of performance-related
    conditions until the vesting date.

Interest
    Income

For 2007 compared to 2006, interest income increased
    $2.4 million, or 2.4%, primarily due to higher yields
    offset by a reduction in cash and cash equivalents due to the
    funding of our tender offer in July 2007. For 2006 compared to
    2005, interest income increased $38.5 million, or 61.4%,
    primarily due to higher levels of cash and marketable securities.

Minority
    Interest

For 2007 compared to 2006, minority interest increased
    $65.2 million, primarily due to the consolidation of
    Cardiokine Biopharma LLC in August 2007, and Neurimmune in
    November 2007. The minority interest related to Cardiokine
    Biopharma LLC and Neurimmune offset an equal charge to
    IPR&D, which resulted in no net impact to our results of
    operations for these IPR&D and minority interest charges.

Interest
    Expense

Interest expense was $40.5 million, $0.9 million and
    $9.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2007,
    2006 and 2005, respectively.

For 2007 compared to 2006, interest expense increased
    $39.6 million, primarily due to the increased debt levels
    relating to our tender offer funded in July 2007 (see
    Note 20, Tender Offer). For 2006 compared to 2005, interest
    expense decreased $8.7 million, or 90.6%, primarily due to
    the repurchase of our senior notes due in 2032 in the second
    quarter of 2005.

    investments in the future.



Income
    Tax Provision

Our effective tax rate was 29.9%, 56.6% and 37.3% on pre-tax
    income for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and
    2005, respectively. Our effective tax rate for 2007 was lower
    than the U.S. statutory rate primarily due to the effect of
    lower income tax rates (less than the U.S. statutory tax
    rate) in certain

non-U.S. jurisdictions

in which we operate. Our effective rate for 2006 was higher than
    the U.S. statutory rate primarily due to the write-off of
    non-deductible IPR&D in connection with the acquisitions of
    Conforma and Fumapharm, (offset by the gain on settlement of the
    Fumapharm license agreement), and the impact of
    acquisition-related intangible amortization related to foreign
    jurisdictions and state taxes, offset by the effect of lower
    income tax in certain

non-U.S. jurisdictions.

Our effective tax rate for 2005 varied from the
    U.S. federal statutory rate and prior years primarily due
    to the acquisition-related intangible amortization arising from
    purchase accounting related to foreign jurisdictions and a
    one-time tax charge related to the repatriation of a portion of
    the accumulated earnings of our foreign subsidiary offset, in
    part, by the effect of lower income tax rates (less than 35%
    U.S. statutory tax rate) in certain

non-U.S. jurisdictions

in which we operate, tax credits allowed for research and
    experimentation expenses in the U.S., and the new domestic
    manufacturing deduction.

The reduction in working capital at December 31, 2007 as
    compared to December 31, 2006, primarily reflects payments
    made to fund our tender offer as discussed in Note 20,
    Tender Offer, offset by cash generated from operations in 2007.

Until required for use in the business, we invest our cash
    reserves in bank deposits, certificates of deposit, commercial
    paper, corporate notes, foreign and U.S. government
    instruments, asset backed securities and other readily
    marketable debt instruments in accordance with our investment
    policy as described in Note 1, Business Overview and
    Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. Our investments are
    highly rated and, to date, have not been materially impacted by
    the disruption of capital markets in 2007. Additionally, we lend
    our marketable securities to third parties to enhance investment
    returns through our securities lending program as described in
    Note 1, Business Overview and Significant Accounting
    Policies.

We have financed our operating and capital expenditures
    principally through cash flows from our operations. We financed
    the tender offer through issuance of short-term debt and use of
    existing cash. We expect to refinance our short-term debt
    through the offering of long-term debt securities in 2008. We
    expect to finance our current and planned operating requirements
    principally through cash from operations, as well as existing
    cash resources including liquidation of marketable securities.
    We believe that these funds will be sufficient to meet our
    operating requirements for the foreseeable future. However, we
    may, from time to time, seek additional funding through a
    combination of new collaborative agreements, strategic alliances
    and additional equity and debt financings or from other sources.

See Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” of this form 10-K
    for risk factors that could negatively impact our cash position
    and ability to fund future operations.



Operating
    activities

Cash provided by operations is primarily driven by our net
    income and adjusted for non-cash charges. In 2007, 2006 and
    2005 net cash provided by operations was
    $1,020.6 million, $841.3 million and
    $889.5 million, respectively.

Cash provided by operations increased $179.4 million, or
    21.3%, in 2007 compared to 2006, is primarily due to higher
    earnings. Movements in working capital accounts, which were a
    use of funds of $77.9 million in 2007 as compared to a use
    of funds of $103.3 million in 2006, also contributed to
    this increase.

For 2006 compared to 2005, net cash provided by operations
    decreased $48.2 million or 5.4%. The decrease in cash
    provided by operations is primarily attributable to movements in
    working capital accounts which were a use of funds of
    $103.3 million in 2006 as compared to a source of funds of
    $139.8 million in 2005.

Investing
    activities

In 2007, 2006 and 2005, net cash provided by (used in) investing
    activities was $(286.6) million, $(599.8) million and
    $417.7 million, respectively.

In 2007, net proceeds from sales of marketable securities were
    $209.0 million, which was used to partially fund the tender
    offer described in Note 20, Tender Offer. Purchases of
    property, plant and equipment totaled $284.1 million in
    2007. Payments made for acquisitions were $95.8 million in
    2007, which primarily related to our acquisition of Syntonix for
    $42.3 million, and our collaboration payments to Cardiokine
    Biopharma LLC for $50.0 million and Neurimmune of
    $2.0 million. The change in balance of collateral received
    under securities lending is reflected as a use of cash in
    investing activities offset by a source of cash from financing
    activities. Additionally, in 2007 we sold our position in a
    strategic investment for $99.5 million.

In 2006, net cash used to purchase marketable securities was
    $162.8 million. Purchases of property, plant and equipment
    totaled $198.3 million for 2006. Payments made for
    acquisitions were $363.3 million in 2006, which related to
    our acquisitions of Fumapharm and Conforma. Proceeds from the
    sale of product lines were $59.8 million in 2006, which
    related to the sale of AMEVIVE.

In 2005 our major sources of cash consisted of
    $408.1 million of proceeds from the sale of our Oceanside,
    California manufacturing facility. Additionally, approximately
    $447.9 million of proceeds was provided from net sales of
    marketable securities, which was used to fund the repurchase of
    our senior notes, as discussed below. Purchases of property
    plant and equipment totaled $318.4 million, including our
    research and development and administration campus in
    San Diego, and our manufacturing facility in Oceanside.
    Additionally, in 2005, we purchased positions in strategic
    investments of $119.9 million relating to PDL BioPharma
    Inc., Sunesis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and other strategic
    investments.

Financing
    activities

In 2007, 2006 and 2005, net cash used in financing activities
    was $735.2 million, $148.4 million and
    $948.5 million, respectively.

In 2007, the primary use of cash related to the repurchase of
    treasury stock via the tender offer of $2,990.5 million.
    This repurchase was partially funded with cash proceeds from a
    short-term note of $1,500.0 million. This transaction is
    described in Note 20, Tender Offer. Additionally, cash
    proceeds from issuance of stock for our share based compensation
    arrangements were $489.2 million, which was primarily
    attributable to the exercise of stock options and participation
    in our ESPP plan. The charge in balance of collateral received
    under securities lending is reflected as a use of cash in
    investing activities offset by a source of cash from financing
    activities.

In 2006, the primary use of cash was $320.3 million for the
    purchase of treasury stock, offset by $147.0 million in
    proceeds from issuance of stock for our share based compensation
    arrangements.

The primary uses of cash in 2005 were for the repurchase of
    long-term debt of $746.4 million and repurchases of
    treasury stock of $322.6 million, offset by
    $119.6 million cash proceeds from the issuance of stock for
    our share based compensation arrangements.



Borrowings

At December 31, 2007, we have a note payable of
    approximately $44.6 million relating to the acquisition of
    distribution rights of FUMADERM. Additionally, one of our
    international joint ventures maintained a loan that had a
    carrying value of $17.5 million as of December 31,
    2007.

In January and July 2007, we issued a total of 3.0 million
    shares of common stock for $75.0 million in face value and
    $39.0 million in carrying value of our 2019 subordinated
    notes to the holders that elected to convert into common stock.

In June 2007, in connection with the tender offer described in
    Note 20, Tender Offer, we entered into a
    $1,500.0 million term loan facility, which is due in June
    2008. On July 2, 2007, in connection with the funding of
    the tender offer, we borrowed the full $1,500.0 million
    available under this facility. We expect to repay this term loan
    facility in 2008 with proceeds from an offering of long term
    debt securities.

In June 2007, we also entered into a five year
    $400.0 million Senior Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility,
    which we may use for working capital and general corporate
    purposes. As of December 31, 2007, there were no borrowings
    outstanding under this credit facility.

In May 2007, holders of the senior notes due 2032 with an
    aggregate principal amount at maturity of $10.1 million,
    exercised their right to require us to repurchase the notes. We
    paid $6.6 million in cash to repurchase substantially all
    of the senior notes.

Tender
    Offer

On June 27, 2007, pursuant to the terms of a modified
    “Dutch Auction” tender offer, we accepted for payment
    56,424,155 shares of our common stock at a price of $53.00
    per share for a purchase price of $2,990.5 million. We
    funded the tender offer through existing cash and cash
    equivalents of $1,490.5 million and $1,500.0 million
    by our term loan facility as described in Note 7,
    Indebtedness. All of the shares repurchased were retired in July
    2007.

Commitments

In August 2004, we restarted construction of our large-scale
    biologic manufacturing facility in Hillerød, Denmark. In
    March 2005, after our voluntary suspension of TYSABRI, we
    reconsidered our construction plans and determined that we would
    proceed with the bulk-manufacturing component, add a labeling
    and packaging component but would no longer proceed with the
    fill-finish component of that facility. As of December 31,
    2007, we have substantially completed this phase of the project,
    including the partial construction of the bulk manufacturing
    facility and installation of major equipment. We are proceeding
    with the second phase of the project, the completion of a large
    scale bulk manufacturing component and construction of a
    warehouse. In October 2006, our Board of Directors approved this
    phase of the project, which is expected to cost an additional
    $225.0 million. As of December 31, 2007, we had
    contractual commitments of approximately $207 million for
    the second phase, of which approximately $117 million had
    been paid. This second phase of the project is expected to be
    licensed for commercial production in 2010.

Share
    Repurchase Programs

In October 2004, our Board of Directors authorized the
    repurchase of up to 20.0 million shares of our common
    stock. This repurchase program expired October 4, 2006.
    During 2006, we repurchased 7.5 million shares at a cost of
    $320.3 million. During 2005, we repurchased
    7.5 million shares at a cost of $324.3 million under
    this program. In October 2006, our Board of Directors authorized
    the repurchase of up to an additional 20.0 million shares
    of our common stock. This repurchase program does not have an
    expiration date. No shares have been repurchased under the
    program as of December 31, 2007.

Contractual
    Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

At December 31, 2007, we have funding commitments of up to
    approximately $28.3 million as part of our investment in
    biotechnology oriented venture capital funds. In addition, we
    have committed to make potential



future milestone payments to third-parties of up to
    approximately $1.55 billion as part of our various
    collaborations including licensing and development programs.
    Payments under these agreements generally become due and payable
    only upon achievement of certain developmental, regulatory

and/or

commercial milestones. Because the achievement of these
    milestones had not occurred as of December 31, 2007, such
    contingencies have not been recorded in our financial
    statements. We expect to make approximately $52 million of
    milestone payments in 2008.

At December 31, 2007, we have several clinical studies in
    various clinical trial stages. Our most significant clinical
    trial expenditures are to clinical research organizations, or
    CROs. The contracts with CROs are generally cancellable at our
    option. We have recorded accrued expenses of $15.5 million
    recorded in accrued expenses on our consolidated balance sheet
    for work done by CROs at December 31, 2007. We have
    approximately $254 million in cancellable future
    commitments based on existing CRO contracts at December 31,
    2007.

We do not have any significant relationships with entities often
    referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities,
    which would have been established for the purpose of
    facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements. As such, we are not
    exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that
    could arise if we had engaged in such relationships. We
    consolidate entities within the scope of FIN 46(R) if we
    are the primary beneficiary.

The following summarizes our contractual obligations (excluding
    funding and contingent milestone payments as described above and
    construction commitments disclosed above under
    “Commitments”) at December 31, 2007, and the
    effects such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity
    and cash flows in future periods (in millions):

Critical
    Accounting Estimates

The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and
    results of operations is based on our financial statements,
    which have been prepared in accordance with accounting
    principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
    The preparation of these financial statements requires us to
    make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
    of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent
    assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements
    and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
    reporting period. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its
    critical estimates and judgments, including, among others, those
    related to revenue recognition, investments, inventory, research
    and development expenses, purchase accounting, goodwill
    impairment, stock-based compensation, and income taxes. Those
    critical estimates and assumptions are based on



our historical experience, our observance of trends in the
    industry, and various other factors that are believed to be
    reasonable under the circumstances and form the basis for making
    judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities
    that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results
    may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or
    conditions.

We believe the following critical accounting estimates affect
    our more significant judgments and estimates used in the
    preparation of our consolidated financial statements:

Revenue
    Recognition and Accounts Receivable

Product
    Revenues

We recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met:
    persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; delivery has
    occurred or services have been rendered; the seller’s price
    to the buyer is fixed or determinable; and collectibility is
    reasonably assured.

Revenues are recorded net of applicable reserves for trade term
    discounts, wholesaler incentives, Medicaid rebates, VA rebates,
    managed care rebates, product returns and other applicable
    allowances. Our product revenue reserves are based on estimates
    of the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales.
    These estimates take into consideration our historical
    experience, current contractual and statutory requirements,
    specific known market events and trends and forecasted customer
    buying patterns. If actual results vary, we may need to adjust
    these estimates, which could have an effect on earnings in the
    period of the adjustment. These estimates we make with respect
    to these allowances represent the most significant judgments
    that we make with regard to revenue recognition.

Royalties

We receive royalty revenues under license agreements with a
    number of third parties that sell products based on technology
    developed by us or to which we have rights. The license
    agreements provide for the payment of royalties to us based on
    sales of the licensed product. We record these revenues based on
    estimates of the sales that occurred during the relevant period.
    The relevant period estimates of sales are based on interim data
    provided by licensees and analysis of historical royalties paid
    to us, adjusted for any changes in facts and circumstances, as
    appropriate. We maintain regular communication with our
    licensees in order to gauge the reasonableness of our estimates.
    Differences between actual royalty revenues and estimated
    royalty revenues are reconciled and adjusted for in the period
    which they become known, typically the following quarter.
    Historically, adjustments have not been material based on actual
    amounts paid by licensees.

Investments

We invest in various types of securities, including:

•

short-term and long-term marketable securities, principally
    corporate notes and government securities, in which our excess
    cash balances are invested;

•

equity securities in certain publicly-traded biotechnology
    companies with which we have collaborative agreements; and

•

equity securities of certain companies whose securities are not
    publicly traded and where fair value is not readily available.

These investments are accounted for in accordance with Statement
    of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115,

Accounting
    for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities

, or
    SFAS 115, or APB No. 18,

The Equity Method of
    Accounting for Investments in Common

, or APB 18, as
    appropriate.

In accounting for investments, we evaluate if a decline in the
    fair value of a marketable security below our cost basis is

other-than-temporary,

and if so, we record an impairment charge in our consolidated
    statement of income. The factors that we consider in our
    assessments include the fair market value of the security, the
    duration of the security’s decline, prospects for the
    investee, including favorable clinical trial results, new
    product initiatives, new



collaborative agreements and our intent and ability to hold to
    recovery. The determination of whether a loss is other than
    temporary is highly judgmental and can have a material impact on
    our results.

Inventory

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost
    determined under the

first-in,

first-out, or FIFO, method. Included in inventory are raw
    materials used in the production of pre-clinical and clinical
    products, which are expensed as research and development costs
    when consumed.

Our policy is to capitalize inventory costs associated with our
    products prior to regulatory approval, when, based on
    management’s judgment, future commercialization is
    considered probable and the future economic benefit is expected
    to be realized. Our accounting policy addresses the attributes
    that should be considered in evaluating whether the costs to
    manufacture a product have met the definition of an asset as
    stipulated in FASB Concepts Statement No. 6,

Elements of
    Financial Statements — A Replacement of FASB Concepts
    No. 3

, or FASB Concepts Statement No. 6. We assess
    the regulatory approval process and where the particular product
    stands in relation to that approval process including any known
    constraints and impediments to approval, including safety,
    efficacy and potential labeling restrictions. We evaluate our
    anticipated research and development initiatives and constraints
    relating to the product and the indication in which it will be
    used. We consider our manufacturing environment including our
    supply chain in determining logistical constraints that could
    possibly hamper approval or commercialization. We consider the
    shelf life of the product in relation to the expected timeline
    for approval and we consider patent related or contract issues
    that may prevent or cause delay in commercialization. We are
    sensitive to the significant commitment of capital to scale up
    production and to launch commercialization strategies. We also
    base our judgment on the viability of commercialization, trends
    in the marketplace and market acceptance criteria. Finally, we
    consider the reimbursement strategies that may prevail with
    respect to the product and assess the economic benefit that we
    are likely to realize.

There is a risk inherent in these judgments and any changes we
    make in these judgments may have a material impact on our
    results in future periods.

We periodically review our inventories for excess or obsolete
    inventory and write-down obsolete or otherwise unmarketable
    inventory to its estimated net realizable value. If the actual
    net realizable value is less than that estimated by us, or if
    there are any further determinations that inventory will not be
    marketable based on estimates of demand, additional inventory
    write-downs will be required. Additionally, our products are
    subject to strict quality control and monitoring throughout the
    manufacturing process. Periodically, certain batches or units of
    product may no longer meet quality specifications or may expire.
    As a result, included in costs of goods sold are write-downs of
    commercial inventory that do not meet quality specifications or
    became obsolete due to expiration.

Research
    and Development Expenses

Research and development expenses consist of upfront fees and
    milestones paid to collaborators and expenses incurred in
    performing research and development activities including
    salaries and benefits, facilities expenses, overhead expenses,
    clinical trial and related clinical manufacturing expenses,
    contract services and other outside expenses. Research and
    development expenses are expensed as incurred. The timing of
    upfront fees and milestone payments in the future may cause
    variability in future research and development expense. Clinical
    trial expenses include expenses associated with contract
    research organizations, or CROs. The invoicing from CROs for
    services rendered can lag several months. We accrue the cost of
    services rendered in connection with CRO activities based on our
    estimate of site management, monitoring costs, and project
    management costs. We maintain regular communication with our CRO
    vendors to gauge the reasonableness of our estimates.
    Differences between actual clinical trial expenses and estimated
    clinical trial expenses recorded have not been material and are
    adjusted for in the period in which they become known.



Valuation
    of Acquired Intangible Assets and In-process Research and
    Development Expenses

We have acquired, and expect to continue to acquire, intangible
    assets primarily through the acquisition of biotechnology
    companies. These intangible assets primarily consist of
    technology associated with human therapeutic products and
    in-process product candidates. When significant identifiable
    intangible assets are acquired, an independent third-party
    valuation firm is generally engaged to assist in determining the
    fair values of these assets as of the acquisition date.
    Management will determine the fair value of less significant
    identifiable intangible assets as acquired. Discounted cash flow
    models are typically used in these valuations, and these models
    require the use of significant estimates and assumptions
    including but not limited to:

•

estimating the timing of and expected costs to complete the
    in-process projects;

•

projecting regulatory approvals;

•

estimating future cash flows from product sales resulting from
    completed products and in-process projects; and

•

developing appropriate discount rates and probability rates by
    project.

We believe the fair values assigned to the intangible assets
    acquired are based upon reasonable estimates and assumptions
    given available facts and circumstances as of the acquisition
    dates.

FIN 46(R)

Under FIN 46(R)

,

we consolidate variable interest
    entities for which we are the primary beneficiary. In
    determining whether we are the primary beneficiary, we consider
    a number of factors, including determining the expected losses
    and residual returns of the technologies being developed
    pursuant to collaborations and other economic risk and reward of
    such collaborations. Discounted cash flow models are typically
    used in these analyses and these models require the use of
    significant estimates and assumptions including but not limited
    to:

•

assuming that the research and development efforts will result
    in an approved commercial product;

•

estimating the timing of and expected costs to complete the
    in-process projects;

•

projecting timing of regulatory approvals;

•

estimating future cash inflows from product sales or funding
    from partners resulting from completed products and in-process
    projects; and

•

developing appropriate discount rates and probability rates by
    project.

For such consolidated entities that we own less than a 100%
    interest, we record minority interest in our statement of income
    for the current results allocated to the outside equity
    interests. FIN 46(R) impacts the way we account for certain
    collaborations and future events may result in our consolidation
    of companies or related entities with which we have a
    collaborative arrangement. The consolidation of variable
    interest entities may have a material effect on our financial
    condition

and/or

results of operation in future periods.

Goodwill

We annually assess our goodwill balance to determine whether any
    impairment in this asset may exist and, if so, the extent of
    such impairment. To do this, in the case of goodwill we estimate
    the fair value of each of our reporting units and compare it to
    the book value of their net assets. Calculating fair value
    involves identifying future cash flows, which requires that we
    make a number of critical legal, economic, market and business
    assumptions that reflect our best estimates as of the testing
    date. We believe the methods we use to determine these
    underlying assumptions and estimates are reasonable.
    Notwithstanding this, our assumptions and estimates may differ
    significantly from actual results, or circumstances could change
    that would cause us to conclude that an impairment now exists or
    that we previously understated the extent of impairment.



Share-based
    Compensation

We make certain assumptions in order to value and expense our
    share-based compensation. In connection with valuing stock
    options and our employee stock purchase plan, we use the
    Black-Scholes model, which requires us to estimate certain
    subjective assumptions. The key assumptions we make are: the
    expected volatility of our stock; the expected term of the
    award; and the expected forfeiture rate. In connection with our
    restricted stock programs, we make assumptions principally
    related to the forfeiture rate.

We review our valuation assumptions periodically and, as a
    result, we may change our valuation assumptions used to value
    share-based awards granted in future periods. Such changes may
    lead to a significant change in the expense we recognize in
    connection with share-based payments.

Income
    Taxes

In preparing our consolidated financial statements, we estimate
    our income tax liability in each of the jurisdictions in which
    we operate by estimating our actual current tax expense together
    with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing
    treatment of items for tax and financial reporting purposes.
    These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities,
    which are included in our consolidated balance sheets.
    Significant management judgment is required in assessing the
    realizability of our deferred tax assets. In performing this
    assessment, we consider whether it is more likely than not that
    some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be
    realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is
    dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during
    the periods in which those temporary differences become
    deductible. In making this determination, under the applicable
    financial accounting standards, we are allowed to consider the
    scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future
    taxable income, and the effects of viable tax planning
    strategies. Our estimates of future taxable income include,
    among other items, our estimates of future income tax deductions
    related to the exercise of stock options. In the event that
    actual results differ from our estimates, we adjust our
    estimates in future periods we may need to establish a valuation
    allowance, which could materially impact our financial position
    and results of operations.

Adoption
    of FASB Interpretation No. 48

Effective January 1, 2007, we adopted FIN 48.
    FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income
    taxes recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements in
    accordance with FASB Statement No. 109,

Accounting for
    Income Taxes,

or SFAS 109. FIN 48 also prescribes
    a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the
    financial statement recognition and measurement of each tax
    position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. As a
    result of the adoption of FIN 48, we recognized a reduction
    in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits of
    $14.2 million, which was recorded as a $1.8 million
    reduction to the January 1, 2007 balance of our accumulated
    deficit, a $9.1 million reduction in goodwill and a
    $3.3 million increase in our deferred tax liability.

A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of
    unrecognized tax benefits is as follows (in millions):

Balance at January 1, 2007

    $110.5 million and $98.2 million (net of the federal
    benefit on state issues), respectively, of unrecognized tax
    benefits that, if recognized, would affect the effective income
    tax rate in any future periods.

Disclosure
    Controls and Procedures and Internal Control over Financial
    Reporting

Controls
    and Procedures

We have carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and the
    participation of our management, including our principal
    executive officer and principal financial officer, of the
    effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure
    controls and procedures (as defined in

Rules 13a-15(e)

and

15d-15(e)

under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the
    Securities Exchange Act), as of December 31, 2007. Based
    upon that evaluation, our principal executive officer and
    principal financial officer concluded that, as of the end of
    that period, our disclosure controls and procedures are
    effective in providing reasonable assurance that (a) the
    information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that
    we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act is recorded,
    processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
    specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and (b) such
    information is accumulated and communicated to our management,
    including our principal executive officer and principal
    financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions
    regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating our
    disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognized
    that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed
    and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving
    the desired control objectives, and our management necessarily
    was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the
    cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.

Changes
    in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires us
    to evaluate annually the effectiveness of our internal controls
    over financial reporting as of the end of each fiscal year, and
    to include a management report assessing the effectiveness of
    our internal control over financial reporting in all annual
    reports. There were no changes in our internal control over
    financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31,
    2007 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to
    materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Management’s
    Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial
    Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
    adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal
    control over financial reporting is defined in

Rules 13a-15(f)

and

15d-15(f)

under the Securities Exchange Act as a process designed by, or
    under the supervision of, a company’s principal executive
    and principal financial officers and effected by a
    company’s board of directors, management and other
    personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. Our internal control
    over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures
    that:

•

pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable
    detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
    dispositions of our assets;

•

provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
    necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
    accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and
    that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in
    accordance with authorizations of our management and
    directors; and

•

provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
    detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our
    assets that could have a material effect on the financial
    statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods
    are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate
    because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
    compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal
    control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007.
    In making this assessment, management used the criteria set
    forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
    Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control —
    Integrated Framework.

Based on our assessment, our management has concluded that, as
    of December 31, 2007, our internal control over financial
    reporting is effective based on those criteria.



The effectiveness of our internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2007 has been audited by
    PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public
    accounting firm, as stated in their report, which is included
    herein.

Item 7A.

Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

We have operations in Europe, Japan, Australia and Canada in
    connection with the sale of AVONEX and TYSABRI. We also receive
    royalty revenues based on worldwide product sales by our
    licensees and through Genentech on sales of RITUXAN outside of
    the U.S. As a result, our financial position, results of
    operations and cash flows can be affected by market fluctuations
    in foreign currency exchange rates (primarily Euro, Danish
    krone, Swedish krona, British pound, Japanese yen, Canadian
    dollar and Swiss franc).

We use foreign currency forward contracts to manage foreign
    currency risk but do not engage in currency speculation. We use
    these forward contracts to hedge certain forecasted transactions
    denominated in foreign currencies. A hypothetical adverse 10%
    movement in foreign exchange rates compared to the
    U.S. dollar across all maturities (for example, a
    strengthening of the Euro) would result in a hypothetical loss
    in fair value of approximately $48.7 million. Our use of
    this methodology to quantify the market risk of such instruments
    should not be construed as an endorsement of its accuracy or the
    accuracy of the related assumptions. The quantitative
    information about market risk is necessarily limited because it
    does not take into account operating transactions.

Certain of our debt instruments are variable rate instruments
    and our interest expense associated with these instruments is,
    therefore, subject to changes in market interest rates. A 100
    basis-point adverse movement (increase in LIBOR) would increase
    annual interest expense by approximately $12.2 million.

In addition, the fair value of our marketable securities is
    subject to change as a result of potential changes in market
    interest rates. The potential change in fair value for interest
    rate sensitive instruments has been assessed on a hypothetical
    100 basis point adverse movement across all maturities. We
    estimate that such hypothetical adverse 100 basis point
    movement would result in a hypothetical loss in fair value of
    approximately $18.3 million to our interest rate sensitive
    instruments.

The returns from cash and marketable securities will vary as
    short-term interest rates change. A 100 basis-point adverse
    movement (decrease) in short-term interest rates would decrease
    interest income by approximately $11.5 million.

We are exposed to equity price risks on the marketable portion
    of equity securities included in our portfolio of investments
    entered into for the promotion of business and strategic
    objectives. These investments are generally in small
    capitalization stocks in the biotechnology industry sector. We
    regularly review the market prices of these investments for
    impairment purposes. A hypothetical adverse 10% movement in
    market values would result in a hypothetical loss in fair value
    of approximately $1.7 million.

BIOGEN
    IDEC INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS

1.

Business
    Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting
    Policies

Overview

Biogen Idec Inc. is an international biotechnology company that
    creates new standards of care in therapeutic areas with high
    unmet medical needs. We currently market four products:
    AVONEX

®

,
    RITUXAN

®

,
    TYSABRI

®

and
    FUMADERM

®

.

Principles
    of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements reflect our financial
    statements, those of our wholly-owned subsidiaries and of our
    joint ventures in Italy and Switzerland. In accordance with FASB
    Interpretation No. 46,

Consolidation of Variable
    Interest Entities

, or FIN 46(R), we consolidate
    variable interest entities in which we are the primary
    beneficiary. For such consolidated entities in which we own less
    than a 100% interest, we record minority interest in our
    statement of income for the ownership interest of the minority
    owner. All material intercompany balances and transactions have
    been eliminated in consolidation.

Use of
    Estimates

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in
    accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
    requires our management to make estimates and judgments that may
    affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and
    expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and
    liabilities. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates,
    including those related to revenue recognition and related
    allowances, marketable securities, derivatives and hedging
    activities, inventory, impairments of long-lived assets,
    including intangible assets, impairments of goodwill, income
    taxes including the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets,
    valuation of long-lived assets and investments, research and
    development, contingencies and litigation, and share-based
    payments. We base our estimates on historical experience and on
    various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable,
    the results of which form the basis for making judgments about
    the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results
    may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or
    conditions.

Translation
    of Foreign Currencies

The functional currency for most of our foreign subsidiaries is
    their local currency. Assets and liabilities are translated at
    current rates of exchange at the balance sheet date. Income and
    expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for
    the period. Adjustments resulting from the translation of the
    financial statements of our foreign operations into
    U.S. dollars are excluded from the determination of net
    income and are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive
    income, a separate component of shareholders’ equity.

Foreign exchange transaction gains and losses are included in
    the results of operations in other income (expense), net. We had
    net foreign exchange gains of $3.0 million and
    $4.9 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively, and foreign
    exchange losses of $8.7 million in 2005.

Cash
    and Cash Equivalents

We consider only those investments which are highly liquid,
    readily convertible to cash and that mature within three months
    from date of purchase to be cash equivalents.

Fair
    Value of Financial Instruments

The carrying amounts reflected in the consolidated balance
    sheets for cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, due
    from unconsolidated joint business, other current assets,
    accounts payable, and accrued expenses and other, approximate
    fair value due to their short-term maturities. Our marketable
    securities and strategic investments, substantially all of which
    are available-for-sale, are carried at fair value based on
    quoted market prices.

F-7


BIOGEN
    IDEC INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The fair values of our foreign currency forward contracts are
    based on quoted market prices or pricing models using current
    market rates.

Inventory

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost
    determined under the

first-in,

first-out, or FIFO, method. Included in inventory are raw
    materials used in the production of pre-clinical and clinical
    products,which are charged to research and development expense
    when consumed.

The components of inventories are as follows (in millions):

Capitalization
    of Inventory Costs

We capitalize inventory costs associated with our products prior
    to regulatory approval when, based on management’s
    judgment, future commercialization is considered probable and
    the future economic benefit is expected to be realized. We
    consider numerous attributes in evaluating whether the costs to
    manufacture a particular product should be capitalized as an
    asset. We assess the regulatory approval process and where the
    product stands in relation to that approval process including
    any known constraints and impediments to approval, including
    safety, efficacy and potential labeling restrictions. We
    evaluate our anticipated research and development initiatives
    and constraints relating to the particular product and the
    indication in which it will be used. We consider our
    manufacturing environment including our supply chain in
    determining logistical constraints that could possibly hamper
    approval or commercialization. We consider the shelf life of the
    product in relation to the expected timeline for approval and we
    consider patent related or contract issues that may prevent or
    cause delay in commercialization. We are sensitive to the
    significant commitment of capital to scale up production and to
    launch commercialization strategies. We also base our judgment
    on the viability of commercialization, trends in the marketplace
    and market acceptance criteria. Finally, we consider the
    reimbursement strategies that may prevail with respect to the
    product and assess the economic benefit that we are likely to
    realize. We expense previously capitalized costs related to
    pre-approval inventory upon a change in such judgment, due to,
    among other potential factors, a denial or delay of approval by
    necessary regulatory bodies. As of December 31, 2007 and
    2006, the carrying value of our inventory did not include any
    costs associated with products that had not yet received
    regulatory approval.

In 2007 and 2006, we conducted process validation runs in our
    facility in Cambridge, MA to establish manufacturing
    capabilities for the ZEVALIN product. In connection with those
    process validation runs, we have capitalized approximately
    $12.9 million of ZEVALIN product costs in our Consolidated
    Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2007, based on our
    expectation that the FDA will approve the manufacturing process
    and related inventory.

TYSABRI

We manufactured TYSABRI during the first and second quarters of
    2005 and completed our scheduled production of TYSABRI during
    July 2005. Because of the uncertain future commercial
    availability of TYSABRI at the time, and our inability to
    predict to the required degree of certainty that TYSABRI
    inventory would be realized in commercial sales prior to the
    expiration of its shelf life, we expensed $23.2 million of
    costs related to the manufacture of TYSABRI to cost of sales. At
    the time of production, the inventory was believed to be
    commercially

F-8


BIOGEN
    IDEC INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

saleable. As we worked with clinical investigators to understand
    the possible risks of progressive multifocal
    leukoencephalopathy, or PML, we charged the costs related to the
    manufacture of TYSABRI to research and development expense. As a
    result, we expensed $21.5 million related to the
    manufacture of TYSABRI to research and development expense
    during 2005. At December 31, 2005, there was no carrying
    value of TYSABRI inventory on our consolidated balance sheet.

In the first quarter of 2006, in light of expectations of the
    re-introduction of TYSABRI, we began a new manufacturing
    campaign. The costs associated with this campaign were
    capitalized in accordance with our policy. On June 5, 2006,
    the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, approved the
    reintroduction of TYSABRI as a monotherapy treatment for
    relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis, or MS, to slow the
    progression of disability and reduce the frequency of clinical
    relapses. On June 29, 2006, we and Elan Corporation plc, or
    Elan, announced the European Medicines Agency’s, or
    EMEA’s, approval of TYSABRI as a similar treatment. In July
    2006, we began to ship TYSABRI in both the United States and
    Europe.

We had product on hand that was written-down in 2005 due to the
    uncertainties surrounding the TYSABRI suspension, but which was
    subsequently used to fill orders in 2007 and 2006. As a result,
    in 2007 and 2006, we recognized lower than normal cost of sales
    and, therefore, higher margins. For 2007 and 2006, cost of sales
    was approximately $12.6 million and $2.6 million lower
    due to the sale of TYSABRI inventory that had been written-off.
    All TYSABRI inventory that had been previously written-off had
    been shipped at December 31, 2007.

Inventory
    Write-Offs

We periodically review our inventories for excess or obsolete
    inventory and write-down obsolete or otherwise unmarketable
    inventory to its estimated net realizable value. If the actual
    realizable value is less than that estimated by us, or if it is
    determined that inventory utilization will further diminish
    based on estimates of demand, additional inventory write-downs
    may be required.

Our products are subject to strict quality control and
    monitoring which we perform throughout the manufacturing
    process. Periodically, certain batches or units of product may
    no longer meet quality specifications or may expire. As a
    result, included in cost of sales were write-downs of commercial
    inventory that did not meet quality specifications or that
    became obsolete due to dating expiration. In all cases product
    inventory is written-down to its estimated net realizable value.

We have written-down the following unmarketable inventory, which
    was charged to cost of sales (in millions):

Marketable
    Securities and Investments

Marketable
    Securities, including Strategic Investments

Until required for use in the business, we invest our cash
    reserves in bank deposits, certificates of deposit, commercial
    paper, corporate notes, foreign and U.S. government
    instruments, asset backed securities and other readily
    marketable debt instruments. We limit the amount of investment
    exposure as to institution, maturity and investment type. At
    December 31, 2007, substantially all of these securities
    were classified as “available-for-sale” in accordance
    with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115,

Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity
    Securities

, or SFAS 115. All available-for-sale
    securities are recorded at fair market value and unrealized
    gains and losses, to the extent deemed temporary, are included
    in accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders’
    equity, net of related tax effects. Realized gains and losses
    are reported in other income (expense) net. Declines in value
    judged to be other than temporary on available for sale
    securities are reported in other income (expense) net. This
    includes losses due to changes in credit quality or interest
    rates judged to be other-than-temporary, including changes
    resulting from the disruption in the capital markets during 2007
    (which were not significant). Valuation of available-for-sale
    securities for purposes of determining the amount of gains and
    losses is based on the specific identification method.

As part of our strategic product development efforts, we invest
    in equity securities of certain biotechnology companies with
    which we have collaborative agreements. Such investments are
    known as strategic investments and are classified as available
    for sale and accounted for as marketable securities. When
    assessing whether a decline in the fair value of a strategic
    investment below our cost basis is other-than-temporary, we
    consider the fair market value of the security, the duration of
    the security’s decline, and prospects for the underlying
    business, including favorable clinical trial results, new
    product initiatives and new collaborative agreements.

Non-Marketable
    Securities

We also invest in equity securities of companies whose
    securities are not publicly traded and where fair value is not
    readily available. These investments are recorded using either
    the cost method or the equity method of accounting, depending on
    our percentage ownership interest and other factors which may
    indicate the existence of significant influence, as required by
    Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 18,

The Equity
    Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock,

or APB
    18. We monitor these investments to evaluate whether any decline
    in their value has occurred that would be other than temporary,
    based on the implied value from any recent rounds of financing
    completed by the investee, market prices of comparable public
    companies, and general market conditions.

Securities
    lending

We loan certain securities from our portfolio to other
    institutions. Such securities are classified as loaned
    securities on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.
    Collateral for the loaned securities, consisting of cash or
    other securities is maintained at a rate of approximately 102%
    of the market value of each loaned security. We held cash as
    collateral in the amount of $208.2 million as of
    December 31, 2007. The cash collateral is recorded as

F-10


BIOGEN
    IDEC INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

cash collateral received for loaned securities on the
    consolidated balance sheet. We have a current obligation to
    return the collateral which is reflected as collateral received
    on loaned securities on the accompanying consolidated balance
    sheet. Income received from lending securities is recorded in
    other income (expense), net.

Property,
    Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment are carried at cost, subject to
    review for impairment whenever events or changes in
    circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may
    not be recoverable. Depreciation is generally calculated on the
    straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the
    assets. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of
    the useful life or the term of the respective lease. Maintenance
    costs are expensed as incurred. Buildings and building
    components are depreciated over estimated useful lives ranging
    from 15 to 40 years, machinery and equipment from 6 to
    15 years, furniture and fixtures for 7 years and
    computer software and hardware from 3 to 5 years. Interest
    costs incurred during the construction of major capital projects
    are capitalized in accordance with Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards No. 34,

Capitalization of Interest
    Costs,

or SFAS 34. The interest is capitalized until
    the underlying asset is ready for its intended use, at which
    point the interest cost is amortized as interest expense over
    the life of the underlying asset. We capitalize certain direct
    and incremental costs associated with the validation effort
    required for licensing by the FDA of manufacturing equipment for
    the production of a commercially approved drug. These costs
    include primarily direct labor and material and are incurred in
    preparing the equipment for its intended use. The validation
    costs are amortized over the life of the related equipment.

Intangible
    Assets, excluding Goodwill

Our intangible assets consist of patents, trademarks and
    tradenames, core technology, licenses, assembled workforce and
    distribution rights, the majority of which arose in connection
    with the Merger. These intangible assets were recorded at fair
    value and are stated net of accumulated amortization and
    impairments.

Intangible assets related to patents, core technology, licenses,
    assembled workforce and distribution rights are amortized over
    their remaining estimated useful lives, ranging from 2 to
    20 years. Our amortization policy for intangible assets is
    based on the principles in Statement of Financial Standards
    No. 142,

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

, or
    SFAS 142, which requires the amortization of intangible
    assets reflect the pattern that the economic benefits of the
    intangible asset are consumed. We believe the economic benefit
    of our core technology is consumed as revenue is generated from
    our AVONEX product. Every year during the third quarter we
    complete our long range planning cycle, which includes an
    analysis of the anticipated product sales of AVONEX. The results
    of this forecast serve as the basis for our assumptions used in
    the economic consumption amortization model for our core
    technology intangible assets. Although we believe our process
    has allowed us to reliably determine our best estimate of the
    pattern in which we will consume the economic benefits of the
    core technology intangible assets, we also believe that this
    model could result in deferring amortization charges to future
    periods in certain instances, including the impact of continued
    sales of the product at a nominal level after patent expiration.
    Consequently, in establishing our methodology, we considered
    models that would prevent deferring amortization charges to
    future periods such as the model described in paragraph 8
    of Statement of Financial Standards No. 86,

Accounting
    for the Costs of Computer Software to be Sold, Leased, or
    Otherwise Marketed,

or SFAS 86. In order to ensure
    amortization charges are not unreasonably deferred to future
    periods, we use the straight-line method to determine the
    minimum annual amount of amortization expense, or the minimum.
    The long range planning process determines whether amortization
    will be based on an economic consumption or the minimum and,
    thus, the amount of amortization for the next four quarters.

Intangible assets related to trademarks and tradenames have
    indefinite lives, and as a result are not amortized, but are
    subject to review for impairment. We review our intangible
    assets with indefinite lives for impairment annually, as of
    October 31, and whenever events or changes in circumstances
    indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be
    recoverable.

Impairment
    of Long-Lived Assets

Long-lived assets to be held and used, including property plant
    and equipment, intangible assets, are reviewed for impairment
    whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
    carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. Conditions
    that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a
    significant decline in the observable market value of an asset,
    a significant change in the extent or manner in which an asset
    is used, or a significant adverse change that would indicate
    that the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets is not
    recoverable. Determination of recoverability is based on an
    estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the
    use of the asset and its eventual disposition. In the event that
    such cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the
    carrying amount of the assets, the assets are written-down to
    their estimated fair values. Long-lived assets to be disposed of
    are carried at fair value less costs to sell.

Goodwill

Goodwill relates largely to amounts that arose in connection
    with the Merger and represents the difference between the
    purchase price and the fair value of the identifiable tangible
    and intangible net assets when accounted for using the purchase
    method of accounting. Goodwill is not amortized, but is subject
    to periodic review for impairment. Goodwill is reviewed
    annually, as of October 31, and whenever events or changes
    in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the
    goodwill might not be recoverable.

Income
    Taxes

The provision for income taxes includes federal, state, local
    and foreign taxes. Income taxes are accounted for under the
    liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
    recognized for the estimated future tax consequences of
    temporary differences between the financial statement carrying
    amounts and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and
    liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to
    apply to taxable income in the year in which the temporary
    differences are expected to be recovered or settled. We evaluate
    the realizability of our deferred tax assets and establish a
    valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that all or
    a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized.

We account for uncertain tax positions in accordance with FASB
    Interpretation No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in
    Income Taxes — an Interpretation of FASB Statement
    No. 109

, or FIN 48. FIN 48 prescribes a
    recognition threshold and measurement attribute for financial
    statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or
    expected to be taken in a tax return and also provides guidance
    on various related matters such as derecognition, interest and
    penalties, and disclosure. We also recognize interest and
    penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in
    income tax expense.

Derivatives
    and Hedging Activities

Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133,

Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,

or SFAS 133, requires that all derivatives be
    recognized on the balance sheet at their fair value. Changes in
    the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in
    current earnings or accumulated other comprehensive income
    (loss), depending on whether a derivative is designated as part
    of a hedge transaction and, if it is, the type of hedge
    transaction. We assess, both at inception and on an on-going
    basis, whether the derivatives that are used in hedging
    transactions are highly effective in offsetting the changes in
    cash flows of hedged items. We also assess hedge ineffectiveness
    on a quarterly basis and record the gain or loss related to the
    ineffective portion to current earnings to the extent
    significant. If we determine that a forecasted transaction is no
    longer probable of occurring, we discontinue hedge accounting
    for the affected portion of the hedge instrument, and any
    related unrealized gain or loss on the contract is recognized in
    current earnings.

Comprehensive
    Income (Loss)

Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 130,

Reporting Comprehensive Income,

or SFAS 130,
    requires us to display comprehensive income (loss) and its
    components as part of our financial statements. Comprehensive
    income (loss) is comprised of net income and other comprehensive
    income (loss). Other comprehensive income (loss) includes
    changes in equity that are excluded from net income, such as
    foreign currency translation adjustments and unrealized holding
    gains and losses on available-for-sale marketable securities and
    certain derivative instruments, and, effective December 31,
    2006, the unfunded amount of our postretirement and pension
    plans. All of these changes in equity are reflected net of tax.

Segment
    Information

Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 131,

Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related
    Information,

or SFAS 131, establishes standards for
    reporting information on operating segments in interim and
    annual financial statements. We operate in one segment, which is
    the business of development, manufacturing and commercialization
    of novel therapeutics for human health care. Our chief operating
    decision-maker reviews our operating results on an aggregate
    basis and manages our operations as a single operating segment.

Revenue
    Recognition

Product
    Revenues

We recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met:
    persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; delivery has
    occurred or services have been rendered; the seller’s price
    to the buyer is fixed or determinable; and collectibility is
    reasonably assured.

Revenues from product sales are recognized when title and risk
    of loss have passed to the customer, which is typically upon
    delivery. However, sales of TYSABRI in the U.S. are
    recognized on the “sell-through” model, that is, upon
    shipment of the product by Elan to its third party distributor
    rather than upon shipment to Elan. The timing of distributor
    orders and shipments can cause variability in earnings.

Revenues are recorded net of applicable allowances for trade
    term discounts, wholesaler incentives, Medicaid rebates,
    Veteran’s Administration, or VA, rebates, managed care
    rebates, product returns and other applicable allowances.

TYSABRI

Subsequent to the re-introduction of TYSABRI for sale in the
    U.S. and approval for sale in Europe, we began to ship
    TYSABRI into both regions in the third quarter of 2006. We
    manufacture TYSABRI and collaborate with Elan on the
    product’s marketing, distribution and on-going development
    activities. The collaboration agreement with Elan is designed to
    effect an equal sharing of profits and losses generated by the
    activities of the collaboration between us and Elan. Under our
    agreement with Elan, however, in the event that sales of TYSABRI
    exceed specified thresholds, Elan is required to make milestone
    payments to us in order to continue sharing equally in the
    collaboration’s results.

In the U.S., we sell TYSABRI to Elan who sells the product to
    third party distributors. We and Elan co-market the product. The
    sales price to Elan in the U.S. is set at the beginning of
    each quarterly period to effect an equal sharing of the gross
    margin between Elan and us. In addition, both parties share
    equally in the operating costs, which include research and
    development, selling, general and administrative expenses and
    other similar costs. Elan’s reimbursement of TYSABRI
    operating costs is reflected as a reduction of the respective
    costs within our consolidated statement of income. Sales of
    TYSABRI to Elan are reported as revenues and are recognized upon
    Elan’s shipment of the product to third party distributors,
    at which time all revenue recognition criteria have been

F-13


BIOGEN
    IDEC INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

met. As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, we had deferred
    revenue of $9.0 million and $5.0 million,
    respectively, for shipments to Elan that remained in Elan’s
    ending inventory.

For sales outside the U.S., we are responsible for distributing
    TYSABRI to customers and are primarily responsible for all
    operating activities. Both parties share equally in the
    operating results of TYSABRI operations outside the
    U.S. Sales of TYSABRI are reported as revenue and are
    recognized at the time of shipment of product to our customer,
    as all revenue recognition criteria have been met. Payments to
    or from Elan for their share of collaboration net operating
    profits or losses relating to sales outside the U.S. are
    reflected in the collaboration profit (loss) sharing line in our
    consolidated statement of income. For 2007 and 2006, we provided
    and received net payments of $14.1 million and
    ($9.7) million, respectively, related to reimbursements
    made in connection with this arrangement.

Prior to the suspension of TYSABRI in 2005, we shipped product
    to Elan in the U.S. and recognized revenue in accordance
    with the policy described above. As a result of the suspension
    of TYSABRI, we deferred $14.0 million in revenue from Elan
    related to TYSABRI product that Elan had not yet shipped to
    third party distributors. This amount was paid by Elan during
    2005 and was recognized as revenue during 2006, when the
    uncertainty about the ultimate disposition of the product was
    eliminated.

Reserves
    for Discounts and Allowances

We establish reserves for trade term discounts, wholesaler
    incentives, Medicaid rebates, VA rebates, managed care rebates,
    product returns and other applicable allowances and in 2006 and
    2005, patient assistance and patient replacement goods. Such
    reserves are classified as reductions of accounts receivable (if
    the amount is payable to our customer) or a liability (if the
    amount is payable to a party other than our customer).

Effective January 1, 2007, we changed the manner in which
    we administer our patient assistance and patient replacement
    goods programs. Prior to January 1, 2007, AVONEX product
    shipped for these programs was invoiced and recorded as gross
    product revenue and an offsetting provision for discount and
    returns was recorded for expected credit requests from the
    distributor that administers these programs on our behalf.
    Effective January 1, 2007, we entered into a new
    arrangement with a distributor, which established a consignment
    sales model. Under the new arrangement, gross revenue is not
    recorded for product shipped to satisfy these programs, and cost
    of sales is recorded when we ship the product.

The reserves are based on estimates of the amounts earned or to
    be claimed on the related sales. These estimates take into
    consideration our historical experience, current contractual and
    statutory requirements, specific known market events and trends
    and forecasted customer buying patterns. If actual future
    results vary, we may need to adjust these estimates, which could
    have an effect on earnings in the period of the adjustment.

Product revenue reserves are categorized as follows: discounts,
    contractual adjustments and returns.

Discounts

Discount reserves include trade term discounts, wholesaler
    incentives and, in 2006 and 2005, patient assistance.

Trade term discounts and wholesaler incentive reserves primarily
    relate to estimated obligations for credits to be granted to
    wholesalers for remitting payment on their purchases within
    established incentive periods and credits to be granted to
    wholesalers for compliance with various contractually-defined
    inventory management practices, respectively. We determine these
    reserves based on our experience, including the timing of
    customer payments.

In 2006 and 2005, patient assistance reserves were established
    to cover no-charge product that we distribute to qualifying
    patients under our indigent program, Patient Access. The program
    is administered through one of our distribution partners, who
    ship product for qualifying patients from their own inventory
    that was purchased from us. In 2006 and 2005, the distributor
    received a credit at the end of each period for product that was
    administered during the period. An accrual was established
    through a reduction of product revenues for sales made to the
    distributor which we estimated may be used to administer our
    patient assistance program. We determined this reserve based on
    our experience with the activity under the program. Effective
    January 1, 2007, gross revenue and the related reserves are
    not recorded on product shipped under this program.

F-15


BIOGEN
    IDEC INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Contractual
    Adjustments

Contractual adjustment reserves relate to Medicaid, VA and
    managed care rebates and other applicable allowances.

Medicaid rebates reserves relate to our estimated obligations to
    states under established reimbursement arrangements. Rebate
    accruals are recorded in the same period the related revenue is
    recognized resulting in a reduction of product sales revenue and
    the establishment of a liability. Rebate amounts are generally
    determined at the time of claim to the state, and we generally
    make cash payments for such amounts within a few weeks of
    receiving billings from the state.

VA rebates or chargeback reserves represent our estimated
    obligations resulting from contractual commitments to sell
    products to qualified healthcare providers at prices lower than
    the list prices we charge the wholesalers which provide those
    products. The wholesaler charges us for the difference between
    what the wholesaler pays for the products and the ultimate
    selling price to the qualified healthcare providers. Rebate
    accruals are established in the same period as the related
    revenue is recognized resulting in a reduction in product sales
    revenue. Chargeback amounts are generally determined at the time
    of resale to the qualified healthcare provider, and we generally
    issue credits for such amounts within a few weeks of receiving
    notification from the wholesaler.

Managed care rebates reserves represent our estimated
    obligations to third parties, primarily pharmacy benefit
    managers. Rebate accruals are recorded in the same period the
    related revenue is recognized resulting in a reduction to
    product sales revenue and the establishment of a liability which
    is included in other accrued liabilities. These rebates result
    from performance-based offers that are primarily based on
    attaining contractually specified sales volumes and growth. The
    calculation of the accrual for these rebates is based on an
    estimate of the customer’s buying patterns and the
    resulting applicable contractual rebate rate(s) to be earned
    over a contractual period.

Returns

Allowances for product returns are established for returns made
    by wholesalers and patients. In accordance with contractual
    terms, wholesalers are permitted to return product for reasons
    such as damaged or expired product. We also accept returns from
    our patients for various reasons.

Reserves for product returns are recorded in the period the
    related revenue is recognized, resulting in a reduction to
    product sales revenue. The patient return program is
    administered by the same distribution partner as the patient
    assistance program. As noted above, in 2006 and 2005, revenue
    related to product sold to this distribution partner that is
    used to satisfy patient returns was fully reserved. The majority
    of wholesaler returns are due to product expiration. Expired
    product return reserves are estimated through a comparison of
    historical return data to their related sales on a production
    lot basis. Historical rates of return are determined for each
    product and are adjusted for known or expected changes in the
    marketplace specific to each product. As noted above, in 2007,
    pursuant to the change in the way we administered our patient
    assistance program, revenue is no longer recorded under this
    program.

During the second quarter of 2006, we recorded an increase in
    our allowance for expired products of $12.3 million to
    correct for prior period errors. This increase in the allowance
    was recorded through an out of period reduction in net product
    revenue of $6.9 million and an increase in goodwill of
    $5.4 million. We identified and quantified the errors
    through an analysis of the historical rate for returns based on
    volumes of returns and the amount of credit granted to the
    returning distributors in past periods. At the time of the
    Merger with Biogen, Inc. in 2003, Biogen, Inc. had understated
    its allowance for expired product by an estimated
    $5.4 million due to an incorrect methodology applied in
    calculating its reserve balance. Had we identified this error at
    the time of the Merger, the recorded goodwill would have been
    approximately $5.4 million higher than has been previously
    reflected. Biogen, Inc.’s methodology was in error because
    it did not utilize known information in determining critical
    assumptions used in the basis of calculation. Our application of
    this incorrect methodology in the post-Merger period resulted in
    understating this reserve by an additional $6.9 million. In
    all cases, the correctly

F-16


BIOGEN
    IDEC INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

calculated rate of return is less than one percent of related
    gross product revenues. We have determined that the out of
    period correction of this error in 2006 is not material to our
    reported results. Additionally, we have determined that the
    error at the merger date is not material to any prior period
    balance sheet amounts and the error in the post-merger period is
    not material to any prior period reported results.

Other

Bad debt reserves are based on our estimated uncollectible
    accounts receivable. Given our historical experiences with bad
    debts, combined with our credit management policies and
    practices, we do not presently maintain significant bad debt
    reserves. The amount of such reserves as of December 31,
    2007, and 2006, was $0.8 million, and $1.7 million,
    respectively.

We have various contracts with distributors that provide for
    discounts and rebates. These discounts and rebates are
    classified as a reduction of revenue. We also maintain select
    customer service contracts with distributors and other customers
    in the distribution channel. We have established the fair value
    of these services and classified these customer service
    contracts as sales and marketing expense. If we had concluded
    that sufficient evidence of the fair value did not exist for
    these services, we would have been required to classify these
    costs as a reduction of revenue.

Revenues
    from Unconsolidated Joint Business

Revenues from unconsolidated joint business consist of our share
    of the pretax copromotion profits generated from our copromotion
    arrangement with Genentech, Inc., or Genentech, reimbursement
    from Genentech of our RITUXAN-related sales force and
    development expenses and royalties from Genentech for sales of
    RITUXAN outside the U.S. by F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd.,
    or Roche, and Zenyaku Kogyo Co. Ltd., or Zenyaku. Under the
    copromotion arrangement, all U.S. sales of RITUXAN and
    associated costs and expenses are recognized by Genentech and we
    record our share of the pretax copromotion profits as defined in
    our amended and restated collaboration agreement with Genentech.
    Pretax copromotion profits under the copromotion arrangement are
    derived by taking U.S. net sales of RITUXAN to third-party
    customers less cost of sales, third-party royalty expenses,
    distribution, selling and marketing expenses and joint
    development expenses incurred by Genentech and us. We record
    royalty revenue on sales of RITUXAN outside the U.S. on a
    cash basis.

Royalty
    Revenues

We receive royalty revenues under license agreements with a
    number of third parties that sell products based on technology
    we have developed or to which we have rights. The license
    agreements provide for the payment of royalties to us based on
    sales of the licensed product. We record these revenues based on
    estimates of the sales that occurred during the relevant period.
    The relevant period estimates of sales are based on interim data
    provided by licensees and analysis of historical royalties we
    have been paid (adjusted for any changes in facts and
    circumstances, as appropriate). We maintain regular
    communication with our licensees in order to gauge the
    reasonableness of our estimates. Differences between actual
    royalty revenues and estimated royalty revenues are reconciled
    and adjusted for in the period in which they become known,
    typically the following quarter. Historically, adjustments have
    not been material based on actual amounts paid by licensees.
    There are no future performance obligations on our part under
    these license agreements. To the extent we do not have
    sufficient ability to accurately estimate revenue, we record it
    on a cash basis.

Research
    and Development Expenses

Research and development expenses consist of upfront fees and
    milestones paid to collaborators and expenses incurred in
    performing research and development activities including
    salaries and benefits, facilities expenses, overhead expenses,
    clinical trial and related clinical manufacturing expenses,
    contract services and other outside expenses. Research and
    development expenses are expensed as incurred. We have entered
    into certain research agreements in which we share expenses with
    our collaborator. We have entered into other collaborations
    where we

F-17


BIOGEN
    IDEC INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

are reimbursed for work performed on behalf of our collaborative
    partners. We record the expenses for such work as research and
    development expenses. If the arrangement is a cost-sharing
    arrangement and there is a period during which we receive
    payments from the collaborator, we record payments by the
    collaborator for their share of the development effort as a
    reduction of research and development expense. If the
    arrangement is a reimbursement of research and development
    expenses, we record the reimbursement as corporate partner
    revenue.

FIN 46(R)

Under FIN 46(R)

,

we consolidate variable interest
    entities for which we are the primary beneficiary. For such
    consolidated entities in which we own less than a 100% interest,
    we record minority interest in our statement of income for the
    current results allocable to the outside equity interests.
    FIN 46(R) impacts the way we account for certain
    collaborations and future events may result in our consolidation
    of companies or related entities with which we have a
    collaborative arrangement. The consolidation of variable
    interest entities may have a material effect on our financial
    condition

and/or

results of operation in future periods.

Acquired
    In-Process Research and Development

IPR&D represents the fair value assigned to research and
    development projects that we acquire that have not been
    completed at the date of acquisition and which have no future
    alternative use. Accordingly, the fair value of such projects is
    recorded as in process research and development expense as of
    the acquisition date.

The value assigned to acquired IPR&D is determined by
    estimating the costs to develop the acquired technology into
    commercially viable products, estimating the resulting net cash
    flows from the projects, and discounting the net cash flows to
    present value. The revenue and costs projections used to value
    IPR&D were, as applicable, reduced based on the probability
    of developing a new drug. Additionally, the projections
    considered the relevant market sizes and growth factors,
    expected trends in technology, and the nature and expected
    timing of new product introductions by us and our competitors.
    The resulting net cash flows from such projects are based on
    management’s estimates of cost of sales, operating
    expenses, and income taxes from such projects. The rates
    utilized to discount the net cash flows to their present value
    were commensurate with the stage of development of the projects
    and uncertainties in the economic estimates used in the
    projections described above.

If these projects are not successfully developed, the sales and
    profitability of the company may be adversely affected in future
    periods. Additionally, the value of other acquired intangible
    assets may become impaired. We believe that the foregoing
    assumptions used in the IPR&D analysis were reasonable at
    the time of the respective acquisition. No assurance can be
    given, however, that the underlying assumptions used to estimate
    expected project sales, development costs or profitability, or
    the events associated with such projects, will transpire as
    estimated.

Earnings
    per Share

We calculate earnings per share in accordance with Statement of
    Financial Accounting Standards No. 128,

Earnings per
    Share

, or SFAS 128, and

EITF 03-06,

Participating Securities and the Two —
    Class Method Under SFAS 128,

or

EITF 03-06.

SFAS 128 and

EITF 03-06

together require the presentation of “basic” earnings
    per share and “diluted” earnings per share.

Basic earnings per share is computed using the two-class method.
    Under the two-class method, undistributed net income is
    allocated to common stock and participating securities based on
    their respective rights to share in dividends. We have
    determined that our preferred shares meet the definition of
    participating securities, and have allocated a portion of net
    income to our preferred shares on a pro rata basis. Net income
    allocated to preferred shares is excluded from the calculation
    of basic earnings per share. For basic earnings per share, net
    income available to holders of common stock is divided by the
    weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding.
    For purposes of calculating diluted earnings per share, net
    income is adjusted for the after-tax amount of interest
    associated with convertible debt and net income allocable to
    preferred shares, and the denominator includes both

the weighted average number of shares of common stock
    outstanding and potential dilutive shares of common stock from
    stock options, unvested restricted stock awards, restricted
    stock units and other convertible securities, to the extent they
    are dilutive.

Accounting
    for Share-based Compensation

Our share-based compensation programs consist of share-based
    awards granted to employees including stock options, restricted
    stock, performance and time-vested restricted stock units, as
    well as our employee stock purchase plan, or ESPP.

Until December 31, 2005, we applied APB Opinion
    No. 25,

Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,

or
    APB 25, in accounting for our plans and applied Statement of
    Financial Accounting Standards No. 123,

Accounting for
    Stock Issued to Employees,

or SFAS 123, as amended by
    Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 148,

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation —
    Transition and Disclosure,

or SFAS 148, for disclosure
    purposes only. The SFAS 123 disclosures included pro forma
    net income and earnings per share as if the fair value-based
    method of accounting had been used. Stock-based compensation
    issued to non-employees was accounted for in accordance with
    SFAS 123 and related interpretations.

Effective January 1, 2006, we adopted Statement of
    Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004),

Share-Based Payments,

or SFAS 123(R), which replaced
    SFAS 123 and superseded APB 25. SFAS 123(R) requires
    compensation cost relating to share-based payment transactions
    to be recognized in the financial statements using a fair-value
    measurement method. Under the fair value method, the estimated
    fair value of awards is charged against income over the
    requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period.
    We selected the modified prospective method as prescribed in
    SFAS 123(R) and, therefore, prior periods were not
    restated. Under the modified prospective application,
    SFAS 123(R) was applied to new awards granted in 2006, as
    well as to the unvested portion of previously granted
    share-based awards for which the requisite service had not been
    rendered as of December 31, 2005. Where awards are made
    with non-substantive vesting periods (for instance, where a
    portion of the award vests upon retirement eligibility), we
    estimate and recognize expense based on the period from the
    grant date to the date on which the employee is retirement
    eligible. For our ESPP, we apply a graded vesting approach
    because the ESPP provides for multiple purchase periods and is,
    in substance, a series of linked awards.

The fair value of the stock option grants is based on estimates
    as of the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option valuation
    model. The fair value of all time vested restricted units and
    restricted stock is based on the market value of our stock on
    the date of grant. Compensation expense for restricted stock and
    restricted stock units, including the effect of forfeitures, is
    recognized over the applicable service period. The fair value of
    performance based stock units is based on the market price of
    our stock on the date of grant and assumes that the performance
    criteria will be met and the target payout level will be
    achieved. Compensation cost is adjusted for subsequent changes
    in the outcome of performance-related conditions until the
    vesting dates. For certain performance based stock units, we
    apply a graded vesting approach and the fair value is based on
    the market price on the date of the vesting.

Change
    in Accounting Principle Related to Accounting for Tax Effects of
    Share-based Payment Awards

In November 2005, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position
    FAS 123(R) – 3,

Transition Election Related to
    Accounting for Tax Effects of Share-based Payment Awards,

or
    FSP FAS 123(R) – 3. In accordance with FSP
    FAS 123(R) – 3, entities can choose to follow
    either the transitional guidance of SFAS 123(R) or the
    alternative transition method described in FSP
    FAS 123(R) – 3. Effective in the fourth quarter
    of 2006, we elected to adopt the alternative transition method
    for calculating the tax effects of stock-based compensation
    pursuant to SFAS 123(R). The alternative transition method
    includes simplified methods to establish the beginning balance
    of the additional paid-in capital pool, or APIC pool or
    windfall, related to the tax effects of employee stock-based
    compensation, and to determine the subsequent impact on the APIC
    pool and consolidated statements of cash flows of the tax
    effects of employee-stock based compensation awards that are
    outstanding upon adoption of SFAS 123(R). Electing the

F-19


BIOGEN
    IDEC INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

alternative transition method constitutes a change in accounting
    principle, which requires retrospective application to the 2006
    quarterly financial statements.

As a result of the adoption of FSP FAS 123(R) –
    3, the presentation of income taxes in the consolidated
    statement of cash flows and stockholders equity has changed.

The retrospective application to prior period financial
    statements had the effect of changing the amounts of cash flows
    from operations and from financing from those previously
    reported in our

Forms 10-Q.

Specifically, for the nine months ended September 30, 2006,
    both cash flows from operating activities, and cash used in
    financing activities would have been lower by $9.2 million.
    For the six months ended by June 30, 2006 both cash flows
    from operating activities, and cash used in financing activities
    would have been lower by $8.0 million. The change to the
    amounts reported in the

Form 10-Q

for the quarter ending March 31, 2006, was not material.

Consistent with the election to use the alternative method, we
    have excluded the impact of pro forma deferred tax assets in
    determining the assumed proceeds under the treasury method for
    purposes of calculating earnings per share.

Assets
    Held for Sale

We consider certain real property and certain other
    miscellaneous assets as held for sale when they meet the
    criteria set out in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    No. 144,

Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of
    Long-Lived Assets

, or SFAS 144.

As of December 31, 2007, there were no assets held for sale
    on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. As of
    December 31, 2006, assets held for sale were
    $9.3 million that comprised certain land and real property
    in San Diego, CA. that was sold in 2007, as described in
    Note 24, Facility Impairments and Loss (Gain) on
    Dispositions. Assets held for sale are included in other current
    assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

Acquisitions
    and Dispositions

Syntonix
    Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

In January 2007, we acquired 100% of the stock of Syntonix
    Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Syntonix, a privately held
    biopharmaceutical company based in Waltham, Massachusetts.
    Syntonix focuses on discovering and developing long-acting
    therapeutic products to improve treatment regimens for chronic
    diseases, and is engaged in multiple pre-clinical programs in
    hemophilia. The purchase price was $44.4 million, including
    transaction costs, and could increase to as much as
    $124.4 million if certain development milestones with
    respect to Syntonix’s lead product, long acting recombinant
    Factor IX, a proprietary long-acting factor IX product for the
    treatment of hemophilia B, are achieved. The purpose of the
    acquisition was to enhance our pipeline and to expand into
    additional specialized markets.

The acquisition was funded from our existing cash on hand and
    was accounted for as an asset acquisition as Syntonix is a
    development-stage company. As a result of the acquisition we
    obtained the rights to the in-process technology of the
    Fc-fusion technology platform. Syntonix has two programs in
    development using the Fc-fusion platform, long acting
    recombinant Factor IX and long acting recombinant Factor VIII.
    Syntonix’s lead product, long acting recombinant Factor IX,
    is a proprietary long-acting factor IX product for the treatment
    of hemophilia B. Syntonix filed an investigational new drug
    application with the Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, for
    long acting recombinant Factor IX in 2007. Long acting
    recombinant Factor VIII is a product for the treatment of
    hemophilia A and is approximately two years from filing of the
    investigational new drug application with the FDA.

The purchase price included $2.0 million in loan
    forgiveness and $0.7 million in transaction fees. In
    addition, $0.3 million of severance charges were accrued as
    a result of the acquisition.

The amount allocated to IPR&D relates to the development of
    long acting recombinant Factor IX and long acting recombinant
    Factor VIII, which are in a development stage. We expect to
    incur an additional $37.5 million to complete long acting
    recombinant Factor IX and an additional $43.8 million to
    complete long acting recombinant Factor VIII. The estimated
    revenues from long acting recombinant Factor IX and long acting
    recombinant Factor VIII are expected to be recognized beginning
    in 2012 and 2014, respectively. A discount rate of 13% was used
    to value these projects, which we believe to be commensurate
    with the stage of development and the uncertainties in the
    economic estimates described above. At the date of acquisition,
    these compounds had not reached technological feasibility and
    had no alternative future use. Accordingly, $18.4 million
    in IPR&D was expensed upon acquisition.

Upon acquisition, we recognized a deferred tax asset of
    $27.8 million.. The deferred tax asset included
    approximately $12.8 million of net operating loss and
    research credit carryovers that will be utilized prior to
    applicable expiration dates, as well as approximately
    $15.3 million of other deferred tax assets primarily
    related to

start-up

and
    research expenditures that have been capitalized for tax
    purposes and will be amortized over the next several years.

Future contingent consideration payments, if any, will be
    recorded as IPR&D. The total revenue, operating income
    (loss) and net income (loss) pro forma impacts of the
    acquisition for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006
    were not material.

Zevalin

In December 2007, we sold the U.S. marketing, sales,
    manufacturing and development rights of ZEVALIN to Cell
    Therapeutics, Inc., or CTI, for an upfront purchase price of
    $10.0 million and up to an additional $20.0 million in
    milestone payments. In addition, we also will receive royalty
    payments on future sales of ZEVALIN. As part of the overall
    arrangement, we have entered into a contract with CTI to supply
    ZEVALIN product through 2014 and a related services and security
    agreement under which CTI has agreed to reimburse us for costs
    incurred in an ongoing randomized clinical trial for ZEVALIN
    with respect to aggressive non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. The
    $10.0 million upfront payment will be recognized in our
    results of operations over the term of the supply agreement.

Fumapharm

In June 2006, we completed the acquisition of 100% of the stock
    of Fumapharm, a privately held pharmaceutical company based in
    Switzerland that develops therapeutics derived from fumaric acid
    esters. As part of the acquisition, we acquired FUMADERM, a
    commercial product available in Germany for the treatment of
    psoriasis, and BG-12, a clinical-stage compound being studied
    for the treatment of MS and psoriasis that was being jointly
    developed by Fumapharm and us. The purpose of this acquisition
    was to support our goal of developing innovative therapeutic
    options for people living with MS.

As part of the acquisition, we agreed to pay
    $220.0 million, of which $218.0 million was paid at
    closing and $2.0 million will be retained until
    July 31, 2008 as partial coverage for any losses incurred
    as a result of any breach of representations and warranties. We
    agreed to additional payments of $15.0 million upon
    achievement of certain regulatory approvals, and additional
    payments in the event that annual and cumulative sales targets,
    as defined, are achieved.

The acquisition was funded from our existing cash on hand and
    has been accounted for as a business combination. Assets and
    liabilities assumed have been recorded at their fair values as
    of the date of acquisition. The results of operations for
    Fumapharm are included from the date of acquisition. Our

The purchase price allocation was completed during the fourth
    quarter of 2006.

The amount allocated to IPR&D projects relates to the
    development of BG-12. BG-12 had recently received positive
    results from a Phase 2 study of its efficacy and safety for
    patients with relapsing-remitting MS and, subsequent to the
    acquisition, we initiated Phase 3 clinical trials. Since the
    acquisition in June of 2006, we have incurred $56.3 million
    in research and development costs. We expect to incur
    approximately an additional $111 million to complete the
    development of BG-12. The estimated revenues from BG-12 are
    expected to be recognized beginning in 2011. A discount rate of
    12% was used to value the project, which we believe to be
    commensurate with the stage of development and the uncertainties
    in the economic estimates described above. At the date of
    acquisition, the development of BG-12 had not yet reached
    technological feasibility, and the research and development in
    progress had no alternative future use. Accordingly,
    $207.4 million in IPR&D was expensed in 2006.

The fair value of intangible assets was based on valuations
    using an income approach, with estimates and assumptions
    determined by management. The core technology asset represents a
    combination of Fumapharm’s processes and procedures related
    to the design and development of its application products. The
    developed technology relates to processes and procedures related
    to products that have reached technological feasibility. Core
    technology is being amortized over approximately 12 years
    and the developed technology over approximately 3 years.
    The excess of purchase price over tangible assets, identifiable
    intangible assets and assumed liabilities represents goodwill.
    None of the goodwill or intangible assets acquired is deductible
    for income tax purposes. As a result, we recorded a deferred tax
    liability of $2.8 million, based on the tax effect of the
    amount of the acquired intangible assets other than goodwill
    with no tax basis.

BIOGEN

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

In addition to the assets acquired, a gain of $34.2 million
    was recognized coincident with the acquisition of Fumapharm in
    accordance with

EITF 04-1,

Accounting for Preexisting Relationships between the Parties
    to a Business Combination.

The gain related to the
    settlement of a preexisting license agreement between Fumapharm
    and us. The license agreement in question had been entered into
    in October 2003 and required us to make payments to Fumapharm of
    certain royalty amounts. The market rate for such payments was
    determined to have increased due, principally, to the increased
    technical feasibility of BG-12. The gain primarily relates to
    the difference between i) the royalty rates at the time the
    agreement was entered into as compared to ii) the expected
    higher royalty rates that would result at the time the agreement
    was effectively settled by virtue of our acquisition of
    Fumapharm.

Future contingent consideration payments, if any, will be
    accounted for as increases to goodwill. The total revenue,
    operating income (loss) and net income (loss) impacts of the
    acquisition for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005
    were not material.

Conforma

In May 2006, we completed the acquisition of 100% of the stock
    of Conforma, a privately-held development stage
    biopharmaceutical company based in California that focused on
    the design and development of drugs for the treatment of cancer.
    The goal of this acquisition was to enable us to broaden our
    therapeutic opportunities in the field of oncology.

We acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of the
    capital stock of Conforma for $150.0 million, paid at
    closing. Of this amount, $15.0 million has been escrowed by
    the sellers pending satisfaction of customary representations
    and warranties made by Conforma. Up to an additional
    $100.0 million could be payable to the sellers upon the
    achievement of certain future development milestones.
    Additionally, $0.5 million in transaction costs were
    incurred and loans of approximately $2.3 million were made
    to certain non-officer employees of Conforma, which are included
    in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.
    Such loans are fully collateralized and were made for the
    purpose of assisting the employees in meeting their tax
    liabilities.

The acquisition was funded from our existing cash on hand and
    was accounted for as an asset acquisition as Conforma is a
    development-stage company. As a result of the acquisition, we
    obtained the rights to two compounds in Phase 1 clinical trials:
    CNF1010, a proprietary form of the geldanamycin derivative

17-AAG;

and
    CNF2024, or HSP90i, a totally synthetic, orally bioavailable
    heat shock protein 90 inhibitor.

The results of operations of Conforma are included in our
    results from the date of acquisition. Our completed purchase

    acquisition in June of 2006, we have incurred $22.9 million
    in research and development costs. We expect to incur
    approximately an additional $98 million to complete the
    development of HSP90i. The estimated revenues from HSP90i, if
    any, are expected to be recognized beginning in 2011. A discount
    rate of 12% was used to value the project, which we believe to
    be commensurate with the stage of development and the
    uncertainties in the economic estimates described above. At the
    date of acquisition, this compound had not reached technological
    feasibility and had no alternative future use. Accordingly,
    $123.1 million in IPR&D was expensed in 2006.

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Upon acquisition, we recognized a deferred tax asset of
    $24.0 million relating to US federal and state net
    operating losses and tax credit carryforwards that we acquired
    from Conforma. The amount allocated to deferred tax assets does
    not include certain tax attributes, such as net operating losses
    and research credits, that may not be realized because they are
    subject to annual limitations under the Internal Revenue Code
    due to a cumulative ownership change of more than 50% which
    occurred in connection with our acquisition of Conforma.

Future contingent consideration payments, if any, will be
    recorded as IPR&D. The total revenue, operating income
    (loss) and net income (loss) impacts of the acquisition for the
    years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 were not material.

Fumedica
    Agreements

In December 2006, we entered into an agreement with Fumedica.
    Fumedica is a privately held pharmaceutical company based in
    Germany and Switzerland that maintains distribution rights to
    FUMADERM and to whom we were contingently obligated to make
    royalty payments with respect to a successful launch of BG-12
    for psoriasis in Germany. Fumedica had the rights to distribute
    FUMADERM in Germany through April 2009. Under the terms of the
    agreement, we have obtained all distribution and marketing
    rights to FUMADERM effective May 2007. No royalty payments were
    due under the agreement and under the terms of the transition
    agreement, we will not be required to make any royalty payments
    to Fumedica if BG-12 is successfully launched for psoriasis in
    Germany.

In connection with this transaction, we committed to total
    payments of 61.4 million Swiss Francs ($50.5 million),
    which will be paid to Fumedica in varying amounts from June 2008
    through June 2018. The present value of these payments was
    $39.2 million. The fair value of the acquired FUMADERM
    distribution rights was approximately $11.1 million. This
    amount has been capitalized and included in intangible assets
    and will be amortized over approximately two years beginning in
    May 2007, based on the remaining term of the distribution
    agreement. The fair value of terminating the pre-existing
    agreement was approximately $28.1 million. This amount has
    been expensed as it relates to a product that has not reached
    technological feasibility.

The present value of the payments due under the agreements will
    be accreted to future value at an interest rate of 5.75%, our
    incremental borrowing rate at the time of the acquisition.

The total revenue, operating income (loss) and net income (loss)
    impacts of the acquisition for the years ended December 31,
    2006 and 2005 were not material.

Financial
    Instruments

Financial instruments that potentially subject us to
    concentrations of credit risk are accounts receivable and
    marketable securities. Wholesale distributors and large
    pharmaceutical companies account for the majority of our
    accounts receivable and collateral is generally not required
    from these customers. To mitigate credit risk, we monitor the
    financial performance and credit worthiness of our customers.

The tables above include our loaned securities. In the years
    ended December 31, 2007 and 2005, we recognized
    $7.5 million and $3.1 million, respectively, in
    charges for the impairment of available-for-sale securities,
    other than strategic investments, that were determined to be
    other-than-temporary following a decline in value. No such
    charges were recognized in 2006.

Unrealized losses relate to various debt securities, including
    U.S. Government issues, corporate bonds and asset-backed
    securities. The unrealized losses on these securities were
    primarily caused by a rise in interest rates subsequent to
    purchase. We believe that these unrealized losses are temporary,
    and we have the intent and ability to hold these securities to
    recovery, which may be at maturity.

Strategic
    Investments

In 2007, we sold our share in one strategic investment for
    $99.5 million, which resulted in an $17.2 million
    gain. In 2006 and 2005, we did not sell any portion of strategic
    investments. Strategic investments are included in investments
    and other assets on the accompanying balance sheet.

In 2007, 2006 and 2005, we recognized $16.0 million,
    $30.5 million and $13.8 million in charges,
    respectively, for the impairment of strategic investments for
    declines in value that were determined to be
    other-than-temporary.

We hold other investments in equity securities of certain
    privately held biotechnology companies or biotechnology oriented
    venture capital funds. The cost basis of these securities at
    December 31, 2007 and 2006 is $52.9 million and
    $32.6 million, respectively. These securities are included
    in investments and other assets on the accompanying consolidated
    balance sheet.

In 2007, 2006 and 2005, we recorded $2.4 million,
    $3.9 million and $1.6 million, respectively, in
    charges for the impairment for certain of those investments that
    were determined to be other than temporary.

Forward
    Contracts

We use foreign currency forward contracts to hedge specific
    forecasted transactions denominated in foreign currencies. All
    foreign currency forward contracts in effect at
    December 31, 2007 had durations of 1 to 12 months.
    These contracts have been designated as cash flow hedges and
    accordingly, to the extent effective, any unrealized gains or
    losses on these foreign currency forward contracts are reported
    in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Realized gains
    and losses for the effective portion are recognized with the
    completion of the underlying hedge transaction. To the extent
    ineffective, hedge transaction gains and losses are reported in
    other income (expense).

The notional settlement amount of the foreign currency forward
    contracts outstanding at December 31, 2007 was
    approximately $409.2 million. The fair value of these
    contracts was a loss of $6.4 million and was included in
    other current liabilities at December 31, 2007. The
    notional settlement amount of the foreign currency forward

contracts outstanding at December 31, 2006 was
    approximately $293.2 million. The fair value of these
    contracts was a loss of $0.2 million and is included in
    other current liabilities at December 31, 2006.

In 2007, there was $2.6 million recognized in earnings as a
    loss due to hedge ineffectiveness. We recognized
    $13.1 million of losses in product revenue and no losses in
    royalty revenue for the settlement of certain effective cash
    flow hedge instruments through December 31, 2007. These
    settlements were recorded in the same period as the related
    forecasted transactions affecting earnings.

In 2006, there was $0.6 million recognized in earnings as a
    loss due to hedge ineffectiveness and $0.9 million
    recognized in earnings as a loss as a result of the
    discontinuance of cash flow hedge accounting because it was no
    longer probable that the hedge forecasted transaction would
    occur. We recognized $11.2 million of losses in product
    revenue for the settlement of certain effective cash flow hedge
    instruments through December 31, 2006. These settlements
    were recorded in the same period as the related forecasted
    transactions affecting earnings.

In 2005, there was $1.0 million recognized in earnings as a
    gain due to hedge ineffectiveness and $0.3 million
    recognized in earnings as a gain as a result of the
    discontinuance of cash flow hedge accounting because it was no
    longer probable that the hedge forecasted transaction would
    occur. We recognized $0.1 million of losses in product
    revenue and $0.2 million of losses in royalty revenue for
    the settlement of certain effective cash flow hedge instruments
    through December 31, 2005. These settlements were recorded
    in the same period as the related forecasted transactions
    affecting earnings.

Share-based

Share-based
    compensation expense

For 2007, we recorded pre-tax share-based compensation expense
    of $123.1 million. For 2006, we recorded pre-tax share
    based compensation expense of $126.8 million. The expense
    for 2006 is net of a cumulative effect pre-tax adjustment of
    $5.6 million, or $3.8 million after-tax, resulting
    from the application of an estimated forfeiture rate for
    pre-2006 unvested restricted stock awards.

For 2007, we capitalized total costs of $4.7 million
    associated with share-based compensation costs to inventory and
    fixed assets. For 2006, we capitalized total costs of
    $3.3 million associated with share-based compensation costs
    to inventory and fixed assets.

In accordance with SFAS 123(R), windfall tax benefits from
    vesting of stock awards, exercises of stock options and ESPP
    participation of $69.7 million and $31.7 million were
    recorded as cash inflows from financing activities in our
    consolidated statement of cash flows for 2007 and 2006,
    respectively. This amount has been calculated in accordance with
    the alternative transition method described in FSP
    FAS 123(R) — 3, which we adopted effective the
    fourth quarter of 2006.

The total amount of tax benefit realized during 2007 was
    $103.6 million. Cash received from the exercise of stock
    options in 2007 was approximately $471 million. The total
    amount of tax benefit realized during 2006 was
    $42.8 million. Cash received from the exercise of stock
    options in 2006 was approximately $131.8 million.

At December 31, 2007, unrecognized compensation costs
    relating to unvested share-based compensation was approximately
    $160 million. We expect to recognize the cost of these
    unvested awards over a weighted-average period of one year. In
    accordance with SFAS 123(R), deferred share-based
    compensation is no longer reflected as a separate component of
    shareholders’ equity in the consolidated balance sheet. As
    a result, we reclassified our deferred share-based compensation
    of $42.9 million at December 31, 2005 to additional
    paid in capital during the first quarter of 2006.

Share-based
    Compensation Plans

We have three share-based compensation plans pursuant to which
    awards are currently being made: (i) the Biogen Idec Inc.
    2006 Non-Employee Directors Equity Plan, or the
    2006 Directors Plan; (ii) the Biogen Idec Inc. 2005
    Omnibus Equity Plan, or the 2005 Omnibus Plan; and
    (iii) the Biogen Idec Inc. 1995 Employee Stock Purchase
    Plan, or ESPP. We have four share-based compensation plans
    pursuant to which outstanding awards have been made, but from
    which no further awards can or will be made: (i) the Idec
    Pharmaceuticals Corporation 1993 Non-Employee Directors Stock
    Option Plan, or the 1993 Directors Plan; (ii) the Idec
    Pharmaceuticals Corporation 1998 Stock Option Plan;
    (iii) the Biogen, Inc. 1985 Non-Qualified Stock Option
    Plan; and (iv) the Biogen, Inc. 1987 Scientific Board Stock
    Option Plan. In addition, we have the Biogen Idec Inc. 2003
    Omnibus Equity Plan, or the 2003 Omnibus Plan, pursuant to which
    outstanding awards have been made. We have not made any awards
    from the 2003 Omnibus Plan since our stockholders approved the
    2005 Omnibus Plan and do not intend to make any awards from the
    2003 Omnibus Plan in the future.

Directors Plan:

In May 2006, our stockholders
    approved the 2006 Directors Plan for share-based awards to
    our directors. Awards granted from the 2006 Directors Plan
    may include options, shares of restricted stock, restricted
    stock units, stock appreciation rights and other awards in such
    amounts and with such terms and conditions as may be determined
    by a committee of our Board of Directors, subject to the
    provisions of the plan. We have reserved a total of
    850,000 shares of common stock for issuance under the
    2006 Directors Plan. The 2006 Directors Plan provides
    that awards other than stock options and stock appreciation
    rights will be counted against the total number of shares
    reserved under the plan in a 1.5-to-1 ratio.

Omnibus Plans:

In June 2005, our stockholders
    approved the 2005 Omnibus Plan for share-based awards to our
    employees. Awards granted from the 2005 Omnibus Plan may include
    options, shares of restricted stock, restricted stock units,
    performance shares, shares of phantom stock, stock bonuses,
    stock appreciation rights and other awards in such amounts and
    with such terms and conditions as may be determined by a
    committee of our Board of Directors, subject to the provisions
    of the plan. Shares of common stock available for issuance under
    the 2005 Omnibus Plan consist of 15.0 million shares
    reserved for this purpose, plus shares of common stock that
    remained available for issuance under the 2003 Omnibus Plan on
    the date that our stockholders approved the 2005 Omnibus Plan,
    plus shares that are subject to awards under the 2003 Omnibus
    Plan which remain unissued upon the cancellation, surrender,
    exchange or termination of such awards. The 2005 Omnibus Plan
    provides that awards other than stock options and stock
    appreciation rights will be counted against the total number of
    shares available under the plan in a 1.5-to-1 ratio.

Stock
    Options

All stock option grants to employees are for a ten-year term and
    generally vest one-fourth per year over four years on the
    anniversary of the date of grant, provided the employee remains
    continuously employed with us. Stock option grants to directors
    are for ten-year terms and generally vest as follows:
    (i) grants made on the date of a director’s initial
    election to our Board of Directors vest one-third per year over
    three years on the anniversary of the date of grant, and
    (ii) grants made for service on our Board of Directors vest
    on the first anniversary of the date of grant, provided in each
    case that the director continues to serve on our Board of
    Directors through the vesting date. Options granted under all
    plans are exercisable at a price per share not less than the
    fair market value of the underlying common stock on the date of
    grant. The estimated fair value of options, including the effect
    of estimated forfeitures, is recognized over the options’
    vesting periods. The fair value of the stock option grants
    awarded in 2007 and 2006 was estimated as of the date of grant
    using a Black-Scholes option valuation model that uses the
    following weighted-average assumptions:

Expected volatility is based upon implied volatility for our
    exchange-traded options and other factors, including historical
    volatility. After assessing all available information on either
    historical volatility, implied volatility, or both, we have
    concluded that a combination of both historical and implied
    volatility provides the best estimate of expected volatility.
    The expected term of options granted is derived using assumed
    exercise rates based on historical exercise patterns and
    represents the period of time that options granted are expected
    to be outstanding. The risk-free interest rate used is
    determined by the market yield curve based upon risk-free
    interest rates established by the Federal Reserve, or non-coupon
    bonds that have maturities equal to the expected term. The
    dividend yield of zero is based upon the fact that we have not
    historically granted cash dividends, and do not expect

to issue dividends in the foreseeable future. Stock options
    granted prior to January 1, 2006 were valued based on the
    grant date fair value of those awards, using the Black-Scholes
    option pricing model, as previously calculated for pro-forma
    disclosures under SFAS 123. For 2007, we recorded
    $30.7 million of stock compensation cost related to stock
    options.

Time-Vested
    Restricted Stock Units

Time-vested restricted stock units, or RSUs, awarded to
    employees vest no sooner than one-third per year over three
    years on the anniversary of the date of grant, or upon the third
    anniversary of the date of the grant, provided the employee
    remains continuously employed with us. Shares of our common
    stock will be delivered to the employee upon vesting, subject to
    payment of applicable withholding taxes. Time-vested RSUs
    awarded to directors for service on our Board of Directors vest
    on the first anniversary of the date of grant, provided in each
    case that the director continues to serve on our Board of
    Directors through the vesting date. Shares of our common stock
    will be delivered to the director upon vesting. The fair value
    of all time-vested RSUs is based on the market value of our
    stock on the date of grant. Compensation expense, including the
    effect of forfeitures, is recognized over the applicable service
    period. For 2007, we recorded $75.2 million of stock
    compensation cost related to time-vested RSUs.

Performance-Based
    Restricted Stock Units

In the first quarter of 2007, our Board of Directors awarded
    30,000 RSUs to our President, Research and Development, under
    the 2005 Omnibus Plan, subject to certain performance criteria.
    The RSUs will convert into shares of our common stock, subject
    to attainment of certain performance goals and the
    employee’s continued employment through December 31,
    2007. Additionally, during the second quarter of 2007, our Board
    of Directors awarded 90,000 RSUs to our President, Research and
    Development, under the 2005 Omnibus Plan, subject to certain
    performance criteria. We apply graded vesting when accounting
    for these RSU’s and the fair value will be based on the
    market price on the date of vesting. These RSUs will vest
    annually in equal increments of 30,000 shares over three
    years and convert into shares of our common stock, subject to
    attainment of certain performance goals and the employee’s
    continued employment through the three performance periods,
    which end December 31, 2008, December 31, 2009 and
    September 30, 2010, respectively.

In the first quarter of 2006, our Board of Directors awarded
    100,000 RSUs to our CEO, under the 2005 Omnibus Plan, subject to
    certain 2006 financial performance criteria. In February 2007,
    our Board of Directors determined that the performance criteria
    had been attained and that 100,000 RSUs would convert into
    shares of our common stock. A total of 58,250 shares were
    issued, reflecting the fact that certain shares were withheld
    for income tax purposes.

During the third quarter of 2005, we granted 1.18 million
    performance-based RSUs, to be settled in shares of our common
    stock, to a group of approximately 200 senior employees
    excluding our CEO. The grants were made under the 2005 Omnibus
    Plan as part of an initiative to retain certain key personnel.
    On September 14, 2006, 70% of the RSUs for all employees
    still in active employment, or 758,262 shares, vested as
    the required performance goals had been determined to have been
    achieved. A total of 510,859 shares were issued, reflecting
    the fact that certain shares were withheld for income tax
    purposes.

On March 14, 2007, the remaining 30% of the RSUs granted
    during the third quarter of 2005 were scheduled to vest and
    convert into shares if the performance goals were attained and
    the employee was still in active employment.. On March 14,
    2007, 258,387 shares vested based on the determination by
    our Board of Directors that approximately 83% of these RSUs had
    been earned. A total of 172,054 shares were issued,
    reflecting the fact that certain shares were withheld for income
    tax purposes.

For 2007, we recorded stock compensation cost of approximately
    $5.0 million related to performance-based restricted stock
    units. For 2006, we recorded compensation charges of
    approximately $33.6 million related to performance-based
    restricted stock units. Compensation cost is adjusted quarterly
    for subsequent changes in the outcome of performance-related
    conditions until the vesting date.

Restricted
    Stock Awards

In 2005, we awarded restricted common stock to our employees
    under the 2005 Omnibus Plan and the 2003 Omnibus Plan at no cost
    to the employees. The restricted stock awards, or RSAs, granted
    under the 2003 Omnibus Plan will vest in full on the third
    anniversary of the date of grant, provided the employee remains
    continuously employed with us. The restricted stock awards, or
    RSAs, granted under the 2005 Omnibus Plan will vest at a rate of
    approximately one-third per year over three years on the
    anniversary of the date of grant, provided the employee remains
    continuously employed with us. During the vesting period, the
    recipient of the restricted stock has full voting rights as a
    stockholder, even though the restricted stock remains subject to
    transfer restrictions and will generally be forfeited upon
    termination of employment by the recipient prior to vesting.

For 2006, we recorded $21.9 million of stock compensation
    cost related to restricted stock awards, prior to a first
    quarter pre-tax cumulative effect

catch-up

credit of $5.6 million, or $3.8 million after-tax,
    resulting from the application of an estimated forfeiture rate
    for prior period unvested restricted stock awards. For 2007, we
    recorded $11.7 million of stock compensation charges
    related to restricted stock awards. The fair value of all
    time-vested RSAs is based on the market value of our stock on
    the date of grant. Compensation expense, including the effect of
    forfeitures, is recognized over the applicable service period.

ESPP

Under the terms of the ESPP, employees can elect to have up to
    ten percent of their annual compensation (subject to certain
    dollar limits) withheld to purchase shares of our common stock.
    The purchase price of the common stock is equal to 85% of the
    lower of the fair market value of the common stock on the
    enrollment or purchase date under a look-back provision. In June
    2005, our stockholders approved the amendment and restatement of
    the ESPP, including an increase in the number of shares
    available for issuance under the ESPP from 4.2 million to
    6.2 million shares. At December 31, 2007, a total of
    4.9 million shares of our common stock were available for
    issuance. During 2007, 2006, and 2005, 0.5 million,
    0.5 million and 0.6 million shares, respectively, were
    issued under the ESPP. We utilize the Black-Scholes model to
    calculate the fair value of these discounted purchases. The fair
    value of the look-back provision plus the 15% discount amount is
    recognized as compensation expense over the purchase period. We
    apply a graded vesting approach because the plan provides for
    multiple purchase periods and is, in substance, a series of
    linked awards. In 2007 and 2006, we recorded stock compensation
    cost of approximately $5.2 million and $5.2 million,
    respectively.

Cash received under the ESPP in 2007 was approximately
    $18.2 million. Cash received under the ESPP in 2006 was
    approximately $15.2 million.

The effects of applying SFAS 123 in this pro forma

    did not apply to awards prior to 1995, and additional awards in

On December 6, 2005, our Board of Directors approved the
    acceleration of vesting of unvested stock options then
    outstanding having an exercise price per share of $55.00 or
    higher, granted under our stock option plans that were held by
    current employees, including executive officers. Shares of
    common stock acquired by our executive officers upon the
    exercise of stock options whose vesting was so accelerated
    generally are subject to transfer restrictions until such time
    as the stock options otherwise would have vested. Options held
    by our non-employee directors were excluded from this vesting
    acceleration. As a result, the vesting of options granted
    predominantly from 2001 to 2005 with respect to approximately
    4,518,809 shares of our common stock was accelerated.

The purpose of this acceleration was to eliminate future
    compensation expense that we would otherwise have recognized in
    our results of operation upon adoption of SFAS 123(R) in
    2006. The approximate future expense eliminated by the
    acceleration, based on a Black-Scholes calculation, was
    estimated to be approximately $93.1 million between 2006
    and 2009 on a pre-tax basis. The acceleration did not result in
    any compensation expense being recorded in 2005.

In June 2007, we also entered into a five year $400 million
    Senior Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility, which we may use for
    working capital and general corporate purposes. No amounts have
    been drawn under this facility.

In May 2007, holders of the senior notes due 2032 with an
    aggregate principal amount at maturity of $10.1 million,
    exercised their right under the indenture governing the senior
    notes to require us to repurchase the notes. We paid
    $6.6 million in cash to repurchase substantially all of the
    senior notes.

In January and July 2007, holders of the subordinated notes due
    2019 with an aggregate principal amount at maturity of
    $70.5 million and $4.5 million, respectively,
    exercised their right under the indenture governing the notes to
    require us to issue shares of common stock. We issued
    2.8 million and 0.2 million, shares of common stock,
    respectively.

During 2006 we completed the following significant financing
    transactions:

•

In October 2006, Biogen-Dompe SRL a consolidated joint venture
    in which we are a 50% partner, obtained a 24 million Euros
    line of credit from us and Dompé Farmaceutici SpA, our
    partner.

•

In December 2006, in connection with the settlement of various
    agreements associated with Fumedica, we entered into two notes
    payable, the aggregate amount of which, at present value, was
    47.7 million Swiss Francs ($39.2 million).

The following is a summary description of our principal
    indebtedness as of December 31, 2007.

Term
    loan facility

In June 2007, in connection with the tender offer described in
    Note 20, Tender Offer, we entered into a
    $1,500.0 million term loan facility. The term loan facility
    has a term of 364 days and bears interest at a rate of
    LIBOR plus 45 basis points or a rate based on the prime
    lending rate of the agent bank at our option. The rate in effect
    on December 31, 2007 was 5.54%. The terms of this term loan
    facility include various covenants, including financial
    covenants that require us to meet a maximum leverage ratio and
    under certain circumstances, an interest coverage ratio. As of
    December 31, 2007 we were in compliance with these
    covenants. We expect to repay this term loan facility in 2008
    with proceeds from an offering of long-term debt securities.

Revolving
    credit facility

In June 2007, we entered into a five year $400 million
    Senior Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility, which we may use for
    working capital and general corporate purposes. This credit
    facility bears interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 45 basis
    points or a rate based on the prime lending rate of the agent
    bank, at our option. The terms of this revolving credit facility
    include various covenants, including financial covenants that
    require us to meet a maximum leverage ratio and under certain
    circumstances, an interest coverage ratio. Since the inception
    of the credit facility, there have been no borrowings
    outstanding under this credit facility and we were in compliance
    with these covenants.

Subordinated
    notes

As of December 31, 2007, we have $0.2 million of the
    subordinated notes due 2019 outstanding, representing an
    aggregate principal amount at maturity of $0.4 million. The
    subordinated notes are zero coupon and were priced with a yield
    to maturity of 5.5%. Each $1,000 aggregate principal face value
    subordinated note is convertible at the holder’s option at
    any time through maturity into 40.404 shares of our common
    stock. The remaining holders of the subordinated notes may
    require us to purchase the subordinated notes on
    February 16, 2009 or 2014 at a price equal to the issue
    price plus accrued original issue discount to the date of
    purchase with us having the option to repay the subordinated
    notes plus accrued original issue discount in cash, common stock
    or a combination of cash and stock. We have the right to redeem,
    at a price equal to the issue price plus the accrued original
    issue discount to the date of redemption, all or a portion of
    the subordinated notes for cash at any time.

Biogen-Dompe

As of December 31, 2007, Biogen-Dompe SRL, a consolidated

    ($17.5 million). This balance represents a line of credit
    from us and Dompé Farmaceutici SpA of 24 million
    Euros, half of which has been eliminated as it is an
    intercompany loan for purposes of presenting our consolidated
    financial position. Borrowings are to be made equally between
    the partners, and any repayments are to be paid in a similar
    manner. The interest rate of the line of credit is at a rate of
    3 month Euro LIBOR plus 25 basis points, and was 5.10%
    at December 31, 2007. The interest rate is reset quarterly
    and payable quarterly in arrears. Any borrowings on the line of

In 2007, assembled workforce increased by $0.7 million as a
    result of the acquisition of Syntonix.

In 2006, core/developed technology increased by
    $26.4 million as a result of the acquisition of Fumapharm.
    The assembled workforce intangible asset increased
    $1.4 million as a result of the acquisition of Conforma and
    we obtained $11.1 million of distribution rights in
    connection with the buy out of an agreement with Fumedica. See
    Note 2, Acquisitions and Dispositions, for further
    discussion of these transactions.

During 2005, we recorded impairment charges of $7.9 million
    related to certain core technology and related to AVONEX in
    Japan and $5.7 million related to ZEVALIN patents. The
    AVONEX charge arose as a result of our decision to terminate
    certain clinical trials. As a result of the annual impairment
    analysis, the ZEVALIN patents were determined to be impaired. In
    both cases the charge reduced our carrying value to estimated
    net realizable value and was recorded as additional amortization
    expense.

Amortization expense was $257.5 million,
    $267.0 million, and $302.3 million for 2007, 2006, and
    2005, respectively.

Amortization on intangible assets is expected to be in the range
    of approximately $234.8 million to $262.4 million for
    each of the next five years.

Goodwill

Goodwill decreased $17.4 million in 2007, primarily as a
    result of certain tax adjustments. Approximately
    $9.1 million of the adjustments relate to the adoption of
    FASB Interpretation No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty
    in Income Taxes

,

an Interpretation of FASB Statement
    No. 109

, or FIN 48. (See Note 14, Income
    Taxes, for discussion on income tax). Goodwill increased
    $18.5 million in 2006, due to the acquisition of Fumapharm.
    We also recorded an increase to goodwill of $5.4 million to
    correct reserves for product returns at the time of the Merger
    in 2003. See discussion of our revenue recognition policy in
    Note 1, Business Overview and Summary of Significant
    Accounting Policies, for additional discussion of this
    adjustment.

During 2007 and 2006, we capitalized to construction in progress
    approximately $10.1 million and $2.1 million,
    respectively, of interest costs primarily related to the
    development of our large-scale biologic manufacturing facility
    in Hillerød, Denmark.

At December 31, 2007, $300.4 million of the
    construction in progress balance was related to construction of
    Hillerød, Denmark. The first phase is complete and involved
    the construction of an administrative building, partial
    construction of a bulk manufacturing facility, a labeling and
    packaging facility and a facility to provide utilities to the
    Hillerød campus. The administrative building was in use in
    2006, and the label and packaging facility and lab facility and
    a portion of the utilities facility were placed into service in
    the first quarter of 2007. The second phase of the project
    involves the completion and fit out of a large-scale
    manufacturing facility and construction of a warehouse, and is
    expected to be ready for commercial production in 2009. The
    utilities facility is expected to be in full use upon completion
    of the second phase.

Employee
    Benefit Plans

401(k)
    Employee Savings Plan

We maintain a 401(k) Savings Plan, or 401(k) Plan, which is
    available to substantially all U.S. regular employees over
    the age of 21. Participants may make voluntary contributions. We
    make matching contributions according to the 401(k) Plan’s
    matching formula. The matching contributions vested over four
    years of service by the employee. Beginning in January 2008, all
    past and current matching contributions will vest immediately.
    Participant contributions vest immediately. The 401(k) Plan also
    holds certain transition contributions on behalf of participants
    who previously participated in the Biogen, Inc. Retirement Plan.
    Employer contributions for 2007, 2006 and 2005 totaled
    $17.8 million, $12.0 million, and $16.8 million,
    respectively.

Deferred
    Compensation Plan

We maintain a non-qualified deferred compensation plan that
    allows a select group of management and highly compensated
    U.S. employees to defer a portion of their compensation and
    that provides for certain company credits, known as the
    Restoration Match, to participants’ accounts. This
    arrangement is known as the Supplemental Savings Plan, or SSP.
    The deferred compensation amounts are accrued when earned. Such
    deferred compensation is distributable in cash in accordance
    with the rules of the SSP. Deferred compensation amounts under
    such plan at December 31, 2007 and 2006, totaled
    approximately $50.3 million and $47.8 million,
    respectively, and are included in other long-term liabilities in
    the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The SSP also holds
    certain transition contributions on behalf of participants who
    previously participated in the Biogen Inc. Retirement Plan. The
    Restoration Match and transition contributions vested over four
    and seven years of service, respectively, by the employee.
    Beginning in 2008, the company credits vest immediately.
    Participant contributions vest immediately. Distributions to
    participants can be either in one lump sum payment or annual
    installments as elected by the participants.

Retiree
    Medical Plan

In 2003, we began to provide medical plan benefits to retirees
    under the age of 65. Net periodic (benefit) cost for 2007, 2006,
    and 2005, was $(6.7) million, $1.4, million and
    $2.0 million, respectively. In 2007, we recognized a
    benefit, which was primarily related to a modification of the
    plan in 2007. In 2006 and 2005, the majority of the expense was
    related to service cost. Our liability at December 31, 2006
    related to this benefit arrangement was approximately
    $6.8 million. The plan terms were modified in 2007 and
    accordingly, no liability remained at December 31, 2007.

Pension
    Plan

We currently maintain two retiree benefit plans: a Supplemental
    Employee Retirement Plan and a defined benefit plan for certain
    employees in Germany.

The obligations under the remaining plans totaled
    $5.0 million and $4.9 million at December 31,
    2007 and 2006, respectively.

Net periodic pension cost for 2007, 2006 and 2005 was
    $1.3 million, $1.2 million, and $1.0 million,
    respectively. The majority of the net period pension costs
    related to service cost.

At December 31, 2007, we had net operating losses and
    general business credit carryforwards for federal income tax
    purposes of approximately $72.1 million and
    $3.2 million, respectively, which begin to expire in 2020.
    Additionally, for state income tax purposes, we had net
    operating loss carryforwards of approximately
    $49.4 million, which have no prescribed expiration date.
    For state income tax purposes, we also had research credit
    carryforwards of approximately $3.5 million, of which
    approximately $1.2 million will begin to expire in 2015 and
    the remainder have no prescribed expiration date.

In assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets, we
    have considered whether it is more likely than not that some
    portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
    The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent
    upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods
    in which those temporary differences become deductible. In
    making this determination, under the applicable financial
    reporting standards, we are allowed to consider the scheduled
    reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable
    income, and tax planning strategies. Our estimates of future
    taxable income take into consideration, among other items, our
    estimates of future income tax deductions related to the
    exercise of stock options. Based upon the level of historical
    taxable income and income tax liability and projections for
    future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax
    assets are utilizable, we believe it is more likely than not
    that we will realize the benefits of our entire deferred tax
    assets. In the event that actual results differ from our
    estimates or we adjust our estimates in future periods, we may
    need to establish a valuation allowance, which could materially
    impact our financial position and results of operations.

As of December 31, 2007, undistributed foreign earnings of

non-U.S. subsidiaries

included in consolidated retained earnings aggregated
    approximately $1,111 million, exclusive of earnings that
    would result in little or no net income tax expense under
    current U.S. tax law. We intend to reinvest these earnings
    indefinitely in operations outside the U.S. It is not
    practicable to estimate the amount of additional tax that might
    be payable if such earnings were remitted to the U.S.

On October 22, 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act of
    2004, or the Act, was signed into law. The Act created a
    temporary incentive, which expired on December 31, 2005,
    for U.S. multinational companies to repatriate accumulated
    income earned outside the U.S. at an effective tax rate
    that could be as low as 5.25%. On December 21, 2004, the
    FASB issued FASB staff position

exception to recognizing deferred tax liabilities. A total
    distribution of $196 million was made by one of our foreign
    subsidiaries to one of our U.S. subsidiaries in December
    2005. We incurred a charge to our consolidated results of
    operations of approximately $11.0 million in the fourth
    quarter of 2005 for the tax cost related to the distribution.

IRS
    Settlement

During the fourth quarter of 2005, the Internal Revenue Service,
    or IRS, completed its examination of legacy Biogen, Inc.’s,
    now Biogen Idec MA, Inc.’s, consolidated federal income tax
    returns for the fiscal years 2001 and 2002 and issued an
    assessment. We subsequently paid the majority of the amounts
    assessed and are appealing one issue. As a result of this and
    other income tax audit activity, Biogen Idec MA, Inc. reassessed
    its liability for income tax contingencies to reflect the IRS
    findings and recorded a $13.8 million reduction in these
    liabilities during the fourth quarter of 2005. The corresponding
    effects of the adjustments to the liability for income tax
    contingencies through 2004 resulted in a reduction in goodwill
    of $20.7 million for amounts related to periods prior to
    the Merger and an increase in income tax expense associated with
    continuing operations of $6.9 million.

During the second quarter of 2007, the IRS completed its
    examination of Biogen Idec Inc.’s consolidated federal
    income tax returns for the fiscal years 2003 and 2004 and issued
    an assessment. We subsequently paid amounts related to issues
    agreed to with the IRS and are appealing several issues. As a
    result of this examination activity, we reassessed our liability
    for income tax contingencies to reflect the IRS findings and
    recorded a $14.7 million reduction in our liabilities for
    income tax contingencies during the second quarter of 2007.

Contingency

On September 12, 2006, we received a Notice of Assessment
    from the Massachusetts Department of Revenue for
    $38.9 million, which includes penalties and interest, with
    respect to the 2001, 2002 and 2003 tax years. We believe that we
    have meritorious defenses to the proposed adjustment and will
    vigorously oppose the assessment. We believe that the assessment
    does not impact the level of liabilities for income tax
    contingencies. However, there is a possibility that we may not
    prevail in all of our assertions. If this is resolved
    unfavorably in the future, this could have a material impact on
    our future effective tax rate and our results of operations in
    the period in which an event would occur.

Adoption
    of FASB Interpretation No. 48

Effective January 1, 2007, we adopted FIN 48.
    FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income
    taxes recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements in
    accordance with SFAS 109. FIN 48 also prescribes a
    recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the
    financial statement recognition and measurement of each tax
    position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. As a
    result of the adoption of FIN 48, we recognized a reduction
    in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits of
    $14.2 million, which was recorded as a $1.8 million
    reduction to the January 1, 2007 balance of our accumulated
    deficit, a $9.1 million reduction in goodwill and a
    $3.3 million increase in our deferred tax liability.

A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of
    unrecognized tax benefits is as follows (in millions):

Included in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits at
    December 31, 2007 and January 1, 2007, are
    $110.5 million and $98.2 million (net of the federal
    benefit on state issues), respectively, of unrecognized tax
    benefits that, if recognized, would affect the effective income
    tax rate in any future periods. We do not anticipate any
    significant changes in our positions in the next twelve months.

We recognize interest and penalties accrued related to
    unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. During 2007 and
    2006, we recognized approximately $14.5 million and
    $11.4 million in interest. Additionally, during 2007, we
    reduced our interest accrual by $3.3 million due to the
    completion of an IRS examination as described below. We had
    accrued approximately $31.6 million and $20.3 million
    for the payment of interest at December 31, 2007 and
    January 1, 2007, respectively.

We file income tax returns in the U.S. federal
    jurisdiction, and various states and foreign jurisdictions. With
    few exceptions, we are no longer subject to U.S. federal,
    state and local, or

non-U.S. income

tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 2001.

In connection with the adoption of FIN 48, we reclassified
    approximately $113 million in reserves for uncertain tax
    positions from current taxes payable to long-term liabilities.

Research
    Collaborations

In connection with our research and development efforts, we have
    entered into various collaboration arrangements which provide us
    with rights to develop, produce and market products using
    certain know-how, technology and patent rights maintained by the
    parties. Terms of the various license agreements may require us
    to make milestone payments upon the achievement of certain
    product development objectives and pay royalties on future
    sales, if any, of commercial products resulting from the
    collaboration.

Neurimmune

In November 2007, we entered into an agreement with Neurimmune
    SubOne AG, or Neurimmune, for the worldwide development and
    commercialization of human antibodies for the treatment of
    Alzheimer’s disease, or AD. Neurimmune will conduct
    research to identify potential therapeutic antibodies and we
    will be responsible for the development and commercialization of
    all products. Under the terms of the agreement, we paid a
    $2.0 million upfront payment and may pay up to
    $378.0 million in milestone payments, as well as a royalty
    on net sales of any resulting commercial products. We also will
    reimburse Neurimmune for certain research and development costs
    incurred. We have determined that we are the primary beneficiary
    under FIN 46(R). As a result, we have consolidated the
    results of Neurimmune and recorded an IPR&D charge of
    $34.3 million. The amount allocated to IPR&D relates
    to the development of the

Beta-Amyloid

antibody. At the effective date of the agreement, this compound
    had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative
    future use. We have allocated the $34.3 million to the
    minority interest, as the charge represents the fair value of
    the

Beta-Amyloid

antibody retained by the minority interest holders. As a result,
    we have recorded a credit in minority interest, which is
    recorded in other income (expense). Through December 31,
    2007, we have spent an additional $0.6 million to develop
    the

Beta-Amyloid

antibody. We expect to incur approximately an additional
    $310 million to develop the

Beta-Amyloid

antibody for all indications under development. The estimated
    revenues from the

Beta-Amyloid

antibody are expected to be recognized beginning in 2017. A
    discount rate of 15% was used to value this project, which we
    believe to be commensurate with the stage of development of the

Beta-Amyloid

antibody and the uncertainties in the economic estimates
    described above.

Cardiokine
    Biopharma LLC

In August 2007, our agreement with Cardiokine Biopharma LLC
    became effective. The agreement is for the joint development of
    lixivaptan, an oral compound for the potential treatment of
    hyponatremia in patients with

F-46

congestive heart failure. We will be responsible for the global
    commercialization of lixivaptan and Cardiokine Biopharma LLC has
    an option for limited co-promotion in the U.S.

Under the terms of the agreement, we paid a $50.0 million
    upfront payment and will pay up to $170.0 million in
    milestone payments for successful development and global
    commercialization of lixivaptan, as well as royalties on
    commercial sales. The $50.0 million is reflected as
    research and development expense in the accompanying
    consolidated statement of income. We have determined that we are
    the primary beneficiary under FIN 46(R). As a result, we
    have consolidated the results of Cardiokine Biopharma LLC and
    recorded an IPR&D charge of approximately $30 million.
    The amount allocated to IPR&D relates to the development of
    lixivaptan. At the effective date of the agreement, this
    compound had not reached technological feasibility and had no
    alternative future use. We have allocated the approximately
    $30 million to the minority interest, as the charge
    represents the fair value of the lixivaptan compound retained by
    the minority interest holders. As a result, we recorded a credit
    in minority interest, which is recorded in other income
    (expense). Through December 31, 2007, we have spent an
    additional $15.5 million to develop lixivaptan since the
    agreement became effective. We expect to incur approximately an
    additional $260 million to develop lixivaptan for all
    indications under development. The estimated revenues from
    lixivaptan are expected to be recognized beginning in 2011. A
    discount rate of 11% was used to value this project, which we
    believe to be commensurate with the stage of development of
    lixivaptan and the uncertainties in the economic estimates
    described above.

mondo

On September 14, 2006, we entered into an exclusive
    collaboration and license agreement with mondoBIOTECH, AG, or
    mondo, a private Swiss biotechnology company, to develop,
    manufacture and commercialize Aviptadil, a clinical compound for
    the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension, or PAH. In
    accordance with the agreement, we will be responsible for the
    global manufacturing, clinical development, regulatory approval
    and commercialization of Aviptadil. We finalized the development
    plan for Aviptadil and had mondo initiate additional clinical
    work in 2007.

Under the terms of the agreement, we paid mondo a
    $7.5 million upfront payment and will pay up to
    $30.0 million in milestones payments for successful
    development and commercialization of Aviptadil in PAH in the
    U.S. and Europe, as well as royalty payments on commercial
    sales. The $7.5 million upfront amount was recorded as
    research and development expense in 2006. Through
    December 31, 2007, we have spent an additional
    $15.4 million on the development of Aviptadil and expect to
    incur an additional $143.5 million to develop Aviptadil. We
    have determined that we are the primary beneficiary under
    FIN 46(R) and as a result, we consolidate the results of
    mondo.

Additionally, we have indicated our intention to make a minority
    equity investment of $5.0 million in mondo in the event
    that it undertakes an initial public offering.

Alnylam

In September 2006, we entered into a collaboration agreement
    with Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Alnylam, related to
    discovery and development of RNAi therapeutics for the potential
    treatment of PML.

Under the terms of the collaboration, we and Alnylam will
    initially conduct investigative research into the potential of
    using RNAi technology to develop up to three therapeutics to
    treat PML. Of the therapeutics presented, we will select one
    development candidate and one back up candidate and will be
    responsible for the development and commercialization of the
    selected candidate. We would also have the option to develop and
    commercialize the backup candidate at our discretion. We will
    fund all research and development activities.

We paid Alnylam an upfront payment of $5.0 million and
    agreed to additional payments of up to $51.3 million in
    milestone payments, plus royalties in the event of successful
    development and utilization of any product resulting

from the collaboration. The $5.0 million upfront payment
    was recorded as research and development expense in 2006.

UCB

In September 2006, we entered into a global collaboration with
    UCB, S.A., or UCB, to jointly develop and commercialize CDP323
    for the treatment of relapsing-remitting MS and other potential
    indications. CDP323 is an orally active small molecule alpha-4
    integrin inhibitor in Phase 2 clinical trials.

Under terms of the agreement, we paid UCB an upfront payment of
    $30.0 million and agreed to make development milestone
    payments to UCB for the first indication of up to
    $93.0 million, with total milestone payments of up to
    $71.3 million payable for any additional indications. We
    will also pay UCB up to $75.0 million in commercialization
    milestones and will contribute significantly to clinical costs
    for Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies. All commercialization costs and
    profits will be shared equally. The $30.0 million upfront
    payment was recorded as research and development expense in 2006.

PDL

In August 2005, we entered in a collaborative agreement with PDL
    BioPharma, Inc., or PDL, for the joint development, manufacture
    and commercialization of three Phase 2 antibody products. Under
    this agreement, we and PDL will share in the development and
    commercialization of Daclizumab in MS and indications other than
    transplant and respiratory diseases, and the development and
    commercialization of M200, or volociximab, and HuZAF, or
    fontolizumab, in all indications. Fontolizumab was discontinued
    during 2006. Both companies will share equally the costs of all
    development activities and all operating profits from each
    collaboration product within the U.S. and Europe. We paid
    PDL a non-refundable upfront licensing fee of $40.0 million
    for these product candidates, which we concluded had no
    alternative future uses and was therefore included in research
    and development expenses in 2005. We also accrued
    $10.0 million in research and development expense in 2005
    for future payments that were determined to be unavoidable. The
    terms of the collaborative agreement require us to make certain
    development and commercialization milestone payments upon the
    achievement of certain program objectives totaling up to
    $660.0 million over the life of the agreement, of which
    $560.0 million relates to development and
    $100.0 million relates to the commercialization of
    collaboration products.

In addition to the collaborative agreement, we purchased
    approximately $100.0 million of common stock, or 3.5% of
    its common stock, from PDL. We recorded an impairment charge of
    $18.3 million during 2006 to reflect an other than
    temporary impairment in the value of the stock we own. In 2007,
    we sold our entire investment in PDL for $99.5 million,
    resulting in a gain of $17.2 million.

Sunesis

In December 2002, we entered into a collaboration agreement with
    Sunesis Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Sunesis, related to the
    discovery and development of oral therapeutics for the treatment
    of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. In August 2004, we
    entered into a collaborative agreement with Sunesis to discover
    and develop small molecule cancer therapeutics targeting
    primarily kinases. Under the agreement, we acquired exclusive
    licenses to develop and commercialize certain compounds
    resulting from the collaboration. Upon signing the agreement, we
    paid Sunesis a non-refundable upfront license fee of
    $7.0 million, which was recorded in research and
    development expenses in 2004. During 2005, we recorded
    $1.0 million to research and development expense for
    milestones achieved through the collaboration with Sunesis, of
    which $0.5 million was paid to Sunesis in 2005. We have
    committed to paying Sunesis additional amounts upon the
    completion of certain future research milestones and first and
    second indication development milestones. If all the milestones
    were to be achieved based on our plan of research, we would be
    required to pay up to an additional $302.0 million to
    Sunesis, excluding royalties.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Under the terms of the agreements, we purchased approximately
    4.2 million shares of preferred stock of Sunesis for
    $20.0 million and, in September 2005, we purchased
    $5.0 million of common stock of Sunesis as part of their
    initial public offering, or IPO. At the time of the IPO, our
    preferred stock was converted into shares of Sunesis common
    stock and, based on the IPO valuation, we wrote-down the value
    of our investment in Sunesis by $4.6 million as we had
    determined that the impairment was other than temporary.
    Following the IPO, we owned approximately 2.9 million
    shares, or 9.9% of the common stock. We recorded impairment
    charges of $7.4 million and $7.2 million during 2007
    and 2006, respectively, to reflect an other than temporary
    impairments in the value of the stock we own. We now hold a
    total of 2.9 million shares of Sunesis, representing 8% of
    total shares outstanding. Our investment in Sunesis is included
    in investments and other assets and has a fair value of
    $5.8 million at December 31, 2007.

Vernalis

In June 2004, we entered into a collaborative research and
    development agreement with Vernalis plc, or Vernalis, aimed at
    advancing research into Vernalis’ adenosine A2A receptor
    antagonist program, which targets Parkinson’s disease and
    other central nervous system disorders. Under the agreement, we
    received exclusive worldwide rights to develop and commercialize
    Vernalis’ lead compound, BIIB014, formerly V2006. We paid
    Vernalis an initial license fee of $10.0 million in July
    2004, which was recorded in research and development expenses in
    2004. Terms of the collaborative agreement may require us to
    make milestone payments upon the achievement of certain program
    objectives and pay royalties on future sales, if any, of
    commercial products resulting from the collaboration. In June
    2004, we made an investment of $5.5 million through
    subscription for approximately 6.2 million new Vernalis
    common shares, representing 4.19% of Vernalis’
    post-financing issued share capital, and committed to purchase
    an additional $4.0 million in the event of future Vernalis
    financing. In March 2005, we purchased approximately
    1.4 million additional shares under a qualified offering
    for $1.8 million, which fully satisfies our investment
    obligation to Vernalis. We paid development milestones of
    $3.0 million in 2006. If all the milestones were to be
    achieved, we would be required to pay up to an additional
    $85.0 million, excluding royalties, over the remaining life
    of the agreement. We account for our investment in Vernalis
    using the cost method of accounting, subject to periodic review
    of impairment. In 2007, we recorded an impairment charge of
    $6.3 million, representing an other than temporary
    investment in the stock we own. We now hold a total of
    approximately 7.6 million shares of Vernalis, representing
    2% of total shares outstanding. Our investment in Vernalis is
    included in investments and other assets and has a fair value of
    $0.9 million at December 31, 2007.

MPM

In May 2006, we became a limited partner in MPM Bioventures IV-
    Strategic Fund, LP, a limited partnership that invests in
    entities that are engaged in the research, development,
    manufacture, marketing

and/or

sale
    of novel biological products or technologies. Due to our
    percentage of ownership, we account for our investment in this
    fund under the equity method of accounting. We have committed to
    contribute up to $10.0 million to the LP and made an
    initial contribution of $1.1 million to the LP. Through
    December 31, 2007, we have contributed $1.9 million
    into the LP, which is included in investments and other assets
    in our consolidated balance sheets.

In February 2006, we became a limited partner in MPM Bioventures
    IV-QP, LP, a limited partnership that invests in entities that
    are engaged in the research, development, manufacture, marketing

and/or

sale
    of novel biological products or technologies. Due to our
    percentage of ownership, we account for our investment in this
    fund under the cost method of accounting. We have committed to
    contribute up to $10.0 million to the LP and made an
    initial contribution of $1.0 million to the LP. Through
    December 31, 2007, we have contributed $2.55 million
    into the LP, which is included in investments and other assets
    in our consolidated balance sheets.

In May 2004, we entered into a limited partnership agreement as
    a limited partner with MPM Bioventures III GP, LP, to
    create MPM Bioventures Strategic Fund, LP, or the Strategic
    Fund. The purpose of the Strategic Fund is to make, manage, and
    supervise investments in biotechnology companies with novel
    products or technologies that

fit strategically with Biogen Idec. Due to our percentage of
    ownership, we account for our investment in this fund under the
    equity method of accounting. The Strategic Fund takes only
    minority positions in the equity of its investments, and does
    not seek to engage in

day-to-day

management of the entities. In February 2006, we adjusted our
    commitment to the Strategic Fund to approximately
    $32 million over a three-year period. Through
    December 31, 2007, we contributed $24.8 million to the
    Strategic Fund.

In April 2004, we became a limited partner in MPM Bioventures
    III-QP, LP, a limited partnership that invests in entities that
    are engaged in the research, development, manufacture, marketing

and/or

sale
    of novel biological products or technologies. Due to our
    percentage of ownership, we account for our investment in this
    fund under the cost method of accounting. We have committed to
    contribute $4.0 million to the LP. Through
    December 31, 2007, we have contributed $3.7 million
    into the LP, which is included in investments and other assets
    in our consolidated balance sheets.

Vetter

In August 2003, Biogen, Inc. entered into a collaboration
    agreement with Vetter Pharma-Fertigung GmbH & Co. KG,
    or Vetter, for the fill-finish of our products, including liquid
    AVONEX and TYSABRI. As of December 31, 2007, we have made
    milestone payments to Vetter of 35.0 million euros in
    return for its reserving certain manufacturing capacity for us
    at its fill-finish facility. Under the terms of the agreement,
    these payments will reduce payments due on our future purchases
    of inventory from Vetter over a seven-year period, which
    commenced in 2007. During 2007, we consumed approximately
    $5.6 million of this asset. Accordingly, as of
    December 31, 2007, we have recorded $7.3 million and
    $29.4 million of these payments in other current assets and
    in investments and other assets, respectively, in our
    consolidated balance sheets. The related portion of the asset
    will be reclassified to inventory when purchases from Vetter are
    made.

Schering

In June 1999, we entered into a collaboration and license
    agreement with Schering AG, aimed at the development and
    commercialization of ZEVALIN. Under the terms of the agreement,
    we may receive milestone and research and development support
    payments totaling up to $47.5 million, subject to the
    attainment of product development objectives. Schering AG
    received exclusive marketing and distribution rights to ZEVALIN
    outside the U.S., and we will continue to receive royalties on
    product sales by Schering AG. Under the terms of a separate
    supply agreement, we are obligated to meet Schering AG’s
    clinical and commercial requirements for ZEVALIN. Schering AG
    may terminate these agreements for any reason. Under the above
    agreement, amounts earned by us and recognized as revenue for
    contract research and development approximate the research and
    development expenses incurred under the related agreement.
    Although in December 2007, we sold our rights to market, sell,
    manufacture and develop ZEVALIN in the U.S., we still
    participate in this agreement and we are reimbursed by CTI for
    our costs incurred in fulfilling our obligation.

Targeted

We had previous agreements that have expired with Targeted
    Genetics Corporation, or Targeted, for gene therapy and
    research. We have no ongoing commitments with respect to
    Targeted. In connection with the expired agreements, however, we
    acquired shares of Targeted. In 2005, we recognized
    $9.2 million for impairments of our Targeted investment
    that was determined to be

other-than-temporary.

In 2006, we received one million shares of Targeted and
    $0.5 million in cash in exchange for forgiveness of
    $5.7 million of debt owed by Targeted to us. We recorded a
    gain of $3.4 million upon receipt of the shares and the
    cash payment. As a result of the transactions, as of
    December 31, 2006, we owned 19.9% of the outstanding shares
    of Targeted. We account for our investment in Targeted using the
    cost method. During 2007, we recorded an impairment charge of
    $1.7 million related to Targeted and at December 31,
    2007, we held 2.2 million shares, representing 11% of the
    outstanding shares, with a fair

Unconsolidated
    Joint Business Arrangement

We copromote RITUXAN in the U.S. in collaboration with
    Genentech, Inc., or Genentech, under a collaboration agreement
    between the parties. Under the collaboration agreement, we
    granted Genentech a worldwide license to develop, commercialize
    and market RITUXAN in multiple indications. In exchange for
    these worldwide rights, we have copromotion rights in the
    U.S. and a contractual arrangement under which Genentech
    shares a portion of the pretax U.S. copromotion profits of
    RITUXAN with us. This collaboration was created through a
    contractual arrangement, not through a joint venture or other
    legal entity. In June 2003, we amended and restated our
    collaboration agreement with Genentech to include the
    development and commercialization of one or more anti-CD20
    antibodies targeting B-cell disorders, in addition to RITUXAN,
    for a broad range of indications.

In the U.S., we contribute resources to selling and the
    continued development of RITUXAN. Genentech is responsible for
    worldwide manufacturing of RITUXAN. Genentech also is
    responsible for the primary support functions for the
    commercialization of RITUXAN in the U.S. including selling
    and marketing, customer service, order entry, distribution,
    shipping and billing. Genentech also incurs the majority of
    continuing development costs for RITUXAN. Under the arrangement,
    we have a limited sales force as well as limited development
    activity.

Under the terms of separate sublicense agreements between
    Genentech and F. Hoffman-La Roche Ltd., or Roche,
    commercialization of RITUXAN outside the U.S. is the
    responsibility of Roche, except in Japan where Roche copromotes
    RITUXAN in collaboration with Zenyaku Kogyo Co Ltd., or Zenyaku.
    There is no direct contractual arrangement between us and Roche
    or Zenyaku.

Revenue from unconsolidated joint business consists of our share
    of pretax copromotion profits, which is calculated by Genentech,
    and includes consideration of our RITUXAN-related sales force
    and development expenses, and royalty revenue from sales of
    RITUXAN outside the U.S. by Roche and Zenyaku. Pre-tax
    copromotion profit consists of U.S. sales of RITUXAN to
    third-party customers net of discounts and allowances and less
    the cost to manufacture RITUXAN, third-party royalty expenses,
    distribution, selling and marketing expenses, and joint
    development expenses incurred by Genentech and us.

Under the amended and restated collaboration agreement, our
    current pretax copromotion profit-sharing formula, which resets
    annually, is as follows:

Copromotion Operating Profits

Biogen Idec’s Share of Copromotion Profits

First $50 million

In 2007, 2006 and 2005, the 40% threshold was met during the
    first quarter. For each calendar year or portion thereof
    following the approval date of the first new anti-CD20 product,
    the pretax copromotion profit-sharing formula for RITUXAN and
    other anti-CD20 products sold by us and Genentech will change to
    the following:

in any calendar year and until such sales exceed $350 million in
    any calendar year(3)

Or

After such sales exceed $350 million


%

in any calendar year(4)

Currently, we record our share of expenses incurred for the
    development of new anti-CD20 products in research and
    development expense until such time as a new product is
    approved, at which time we will record our share of pretax
    copromotion profits related to the new product in revenues from
    unconsolidated joint business. We record our royalty revenue on
    sales of RITUXAN outside the U.S. on a cash basis. Under
    the amended and restated collaboration agreement, we will
    receive lower royalty revenue from Genentech on sales by Roche
    and Zenyaku of new anti-CD20 products, as compared to royalty
    revenue received on sales of RITUXAN. The royalty period with
    respect to all products is 11 years from the first
    commercial sale of such product on a

country-by-country

basis.

The amended and restated collaboration agreement provides that,
    upon the occurrence of a Biogen Idec

change-in-control

as described in the agreement, within 90 days of that

change-in-control,

Genentech may present an offer to us to purchase our rights to
    RITUXAN. We must then accept Genentech’s offer or purchase
    Genentech’s rights to RITUXAN for an amount proportioned
    (using the profit sharing ratio between us) to Genentech’s
    offer. If

F-52


BIOGEN
    IDEC INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Genentech presents such an offer in such a situation, then
    Genentech will be deemed concurrently to have exercised a right,
    in exchange for a share in the operating profits or net sales in
    the U.S. of any new products developed under the agreement,
    to purchase our interest in each such product. As discussed in
    Note 18, Litigation, Genentech asserted for the first time
    that the November 2003 transaction in which Idec acquired Biogen
    and became Biogen Idec was a change of control of our company
    under the Collaboration Agreement. We strongly disagree that the
    Merger was a change of control of our company, but if it was,
    our position is that Genentech’s rights under the

change-in-control

provision in the Collaboration Agreement have long since expired.

Concurrent with the original collaboration agreement, we also
    entered into an expression technology license agreement with
    Genentech (for a proprietary gene expression technology
    developed by us) and a preferred stock purchase agreement
    providing for certain equity investments in us by Genentech (see
    Note 19, Shareholders’ Equity).

Under the terms of separate agreements with Genentech,
    commercialization of RITUXAN outside the U.S. is the
    responsibility of Roche, except in Japan where it copromotes
    RITUXAN in collaboration with Zenyaku. We receive royalties from
    Genentech on sales by Roche and Zenyaku of RITUXAN outside the
    U.S., except in Canada. Royalties on sales of RITUXAN in Canada
    are received directly from Roche (and are included in revenues
    from unconsolidated joint business arrangement in the
    accompanying consolidated statements of income). Under our
    amended and restated collaborative agreement with Genentech, we
    will receive lower royalty revenue from Genentech on sales by
    Roche and Zenyaku of new anti-CD20 products and only for the
    first 11 years from the date of first commercial sale of
    such new anti-CD20 products.

Total revenues from unconsolidated joint business consist of the

Leases

We rent laboratory and office space and certain equipment under
    noncancellable operating leases. The rental expense under these
    leases, which terminate at various dates through 2015, amounted
    to $33.1 million in 2007, $26.2 million in 2006, and
    $32.2 million in 2005. The lease agreements contain various
    clauses for renewal at our option and, in certain cases,

Construction
    Commitments

As discussed in Note 9, Property Plant and Equipment, in
    2004, we restarted construction of our large-scale biologic
    manufacturing facility in Hillerød, Denmark. In 2005, after
    our voluntary suspension of TYSABRI, we reconsidered our
    construction plans and determined that we would proceed with the
    bulk-manufacturing component, add a labeling and packaging
    component but would no longer proceed with the fill-finish
    component of that facility. As of December 31, 2007, we
    have substantially completed this phase of the project including
    the partial construction of the bulk manufacturing facility and
    installation of major equipment. We are in the process of
    completing the second phase of the project, a large scale bulk
    manufacturing component and construction of a warehouse. In
    October 2006, our Board of Directors approved this phase, which
    is expected to cost an additional $225.0 million. As of
    December 31, 2007, we had contractual commitments of
    approximately $207 million for the second phase, of which
    approximately $117 million had been paid. This phase of the
    project is expected to be ready for commercial production in
    2009.

Litigation

On March 2, 2005, we, along with William H. Rastetter, our
    former Executive Chairman, and James C. Mullen, our Chief
    Executive Officer, were named as defendants in a purported class
    action lawsuit, captioned Brown v. Biogen Idec Inc., et al.
    (“Brown”), filed in the U.S. District Court for
    the District of Massachusetts (the “Court”). The
    complaint alleges violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of
    the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and

Rule 10b-5

promulgated thereunder. The action is purportedly brought on
    behalf of all purchasers of our publicly-traded securities
    between February 18, 2004 and February 25, 2005. The
    plaintiff alleges that the defendants made materially false and
    misleading statements regarding potentially serious side effects
    of TYSABRI in order to gain accelerated approval from the FDA
    for the product’s distribution and sale. The plaintiff
    alleges that these materially false and misleading statements
    harmed the purported class by artificially inflating our stock
    price during the purported class period and that our insiders
    benefited personally from the inflated price by selling our
    stock. The plaintiff seeks unspecified damages, as well as
    interest, costs and attorneys’ fees. Substantially similar
    actions, captioned Grill v. Biogen Idec Inc., et al. and
    Lobel v. Biogen Idec Inc., et al., were filed on
    March 10, 2005 and April 21, 2005, respectively, in
    the same court by other purported class representatives. Those
    actions have been consolidated with the Brown case. On
    October 13, 2006, the plaintiffs filed an amended
    consolidated complaint which, among other amendments to the
    allegations, adds as defendants Peter N. Kellogg, our former
    Chief Financial Officer, William R. Rohn, our former Chief
    Operating Officer, Burt A. Adelman, our former Executive Vice
    President, Portfolio Strategy, and Thomas J. Bucknum, our former
    General Counsel. On September 14, 2007, the District Court
    Judge entered an Order allowing the Motions to Dismiss of all
    defendants. On October 15, 2007, the plaintiffs filed a
    notice of appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the
    First Circuit. Plaintiff filed its principal brief on appeal on
    February 6, 2008. We have not formed an opinion that an
    unfavorable outcome is either “probable” or
    “remote” and do not express an opinion at this time as
    to the likely outcome of the matter or as to the magnitude or
    range of any potential loss. We believe that we have good and
    valid defenses to the complaint and intend to vigorously defend
    the case.

On October 4, 2004, Genentech, Inc. received a subpoena
    from the U.S. Department of Justice requesting documents
    related to the promotion of RITUXAN. We market RITUXAN in the
    U.S. in collaboration with Genentech. Genentech has
    disclosed that it is cooperating with the associated
    investigation which they disclosed that they have been advised
    is both civil and criminal in nature. Genentech has reported
    further that the government has called and is expected to call
    former and current Genentech employees to appear before a grand
    jury in connection with this investigation. We are cooperating
    with the U.S. Department of Justice in its investigation of
    Genentech. The potential outcome of this matter and its impact
    on us cannot be determined at this time.

Along with several other major pharmaceutical and biotechnology
    companies, Biogen, Inc. (now Biogen Idec MA, Inc., one of our
    wholly-owned subsidiaries) or, in certain cases, Biogen Idec
    Inc., was named as a defendant in lawsuits filed by the City of
    New York and numerous Counties of the State of New York. All of
    the cases — except

    County of Schenectady — are the subject of a
    Consolidated Complaint (“Consolidated Complaint”),
    which was filed on June 15, 2005, and amended on
    June 8, 2007, in the U.S. District Court for the
    District of Massachusetts in Multi-District Litigation
    No. 1456 (“the MDL proceedings”). The County of
    Nassau joined in the amended Consolidated Complaint on
    June 8, 2007. On September 17, 2007, the County of
    Erie, County of Oswego and County of Schenectady cases were
    remanded to state court in New York.

All of the complaints in these cases allege that the defendants
    (i) fraudulently reported the Average Wholesale Price for
    certain drugs for which Medicaid provides reimbursement
    (“Covered Drugs”); (ii) marketed and promoted the
    sale of Covered Drugs to providers based on the providers’
    ability to collect inflated payments from the government and
    Medicaid beneficiaries that exceeded payments possible for
    competing drugs; (iii) provided financing incentives to
    providers to over-prescribe Covered Drugs or to prescribe
    Covered Drugs in place of competing drugs; and
    (iv) overcharged Medicaid for illegally inflated Covered
    Drugs reimbursements. Among other things, the complaints allege
    violations of New York state law and advance common law claims
    for unfair trade practices, fraud, and unjust enrichment. In
    addition, the amended Consolidated Complaint alleges that the
    defendants failed to accurately report the “best
    price” on the Covered Drugs to the Secretary of Health and
    Human Services pursuant to rebate agreements, and excluded from
    their reporting certain discounts and other rebates that would
    have reduced the “best price.”

On September 7, 2006, a New York State court granted in
    part and denied in part Biogen Idec’s motion to
    dismiss the County of Erie complaint. On April 2, 2007, the
    defendants’ joint motion to dismiss the original
    Consolidated Complaint and the County of Nassau’s second
    amended complaint were granted in part, but certain claims
    against Biogen Idec remained. Biogen Idec’s individual
    motion to dismiss these complaints remains pending. We have not
    formed an opinion that an unfavorable outcome is either
    “probable” or “remote” and do not express an
    opinion at this time as to the likely outcome of the matter or
    as to the magnitude or range of any potential loss. We believe
    that we have good and valid defenses to these complaints and
    intend to vigorously defend the case.

Along with several other major pharmaceutical and biotechnology
    companies, we were also named as a defendant in a lawsuit filed
    by the Attorney General of Arizona. The lawsuit was filed in the
    Superior Court of the State of Arizona and transferred to the
    MDL proceedings. The complaint, as amended on March 13,
    2007, is brought on behalf of Arizona consumers and other payors
    for drugs, and alleges that the defendants violated the state
    consumer fraud statute by fraudulently reporting the Average
    Wholesale Price for certain drugs covered by various private and
    public insurance mechanisms and by marketing these drugs to
    providers based on the providers’ ability to collect
    inflated payments from third-party payors. Motions to dismiss
    the complaint have not yet been filed and briefed. We have not
    formed an opinion that an unfavorable outcome is either
    “probable” or “remote” and do not express an
    opinion at this time as to the likely outcome of the matter or
    as to the magnitude or range of any potential loss. We believe
    that we have good and valid defenses to the complaint and intend
    to vigorously defend the case.

On January 6, 2006, we were served with a lawsuit,
    captioned United States of America ex rel. Paul P.
    McDermott v. Genentech, Inc. and Biogen Idec, Inc., filed
    in the United States District Court of the District of Maine
    (“Court”). The lawsuit was filed under seal on
    July 29, 2005 by a former employee of our co-defendant
    Genentech pursuant to the False Claims Act, 31 U.S.C.
    section 3729 et. seq. On December 20, 2005, the
    U.S. government elected not to intervene, and the complaint
    was subsequently unsealed and served. On April 4, 2006, the
    plaintiff filed his first amended complaint alleging, among
    other things, that we directly solicited physicians and their
    staff members to illegally market off-label uses of RITUXAN for
    treating rheumatoid arthritis, provided illegal kickbacks to
    physicians to promote off-label uses, trained our employees in
    methods of avoiding the detection of these off-label sales and
    marketing activities, formed a network of employees whose
    assigned duties involved off-label promotion of RITUXAN,
    intended and caused the off-label promotion of RITUXAN to result
    in the submission of false claims to the government, and
    conspired with Genentech to defraud the government. The
    plaintiff seeks entry of judgment on behalf of the United States
    of America against the

defendants, an award to the plaintiff as relator, and all costs,
    expenses, attorneys’ fees, interest and other appropriate
    relief. On July 24, 2007, the District Court granted Biogen
    Idec’s motion to dismiss on the grounds that the Court
    lacks subject matter jurisdiction, the complaint fails to state
    a claim and the claims were not pleaded with particularity.
    Certain of plaintiff’s claims against Genentech are still
    pending. On August 14, 2007, the plaintiff filed a motion
    requesting that the Court allow the plaintiff to file an
    interlocutory appeal of the granting of Biogen Idec’s
    motion to dismiss. The court denied the motion on
    October 22, 2007. We have not formed an opinion that an
    unfavorable outcome is either “probable” or
    “remote” and do not express an opinion at this time as
    to the likely outcome of the matter or as to the magnitude or
    range of any potential loss. We believe that we have good and
    valid defenses to the complaint and intend to vigorously defend
    the case.

On June 17, 2006, Biogen Idec filed a Demand for
    Arbitration against Genentech, Inc. with the American
    Arbitration Association (“AAA”), which was amended on
    December 5, 2006 and January 29, 2008. Biogen Idec
    alleges that Genentech breached the parties’ Amended and
    Restated Collaboration Agreement dated June 19, 2003 (the
    “Collaboration Agreement”), by failing to honor Biogen
    Idec’s contractual right to participate in strategic
    decisions affecting the parties’ joint development and
    commercialization of certain pharmaceutical products, including
    humanized anti-CD20 antibodies. Genentech filed an Answering
    Statement in response to Biogen Idec’s Demand in which
    Genentech denied that it had breached the Collaboration
    Agreement and alleged that Biogen Idec had breached the
    Collaboration Agreement. Genentech also asserted for the first
    time that the November 2003 transaction in which Idec acquired
    Biogen and became Biogen Idec was a change of control under the
    Collaboration Agreement, a position with which we disagree
    strongly. It is our position that the Biogen Idec merger did not
    constitute a change of control under the Collaboration Agreement
    and that, even if it did, Genentech’s rights under the
    change of control provision, which must be asserted within
    90 days of the change of control event, have long since
    expired. We have not formed an opinion that an unfavorable
    outcome is either “probable” or “remote” and
    do not express an opinion at this time as to the likely outcome
    of the matter or as to the magnitude or range of any potential
    loss. We believe that we have good and valid defenses to
    Genentech’s allegations in the collaboration and intend to
    vigorously defend against these allegations.

On September 12, 2006, the Massachusetts Department of
    Revenue (“DOR”) issued a notice of assessment against
    Biogen Idec MA, Inc. for $38.9 million of corporate excise
    tax for 2002, which includes associated interest and penalties.
    On December 6, 2006, we filed an abatement application with
    the DOR, seeking abatements for

2001-2003.

The abatement application was denied on July 24, 2007. On
    July 25, 2007, we filed a petition with the Massachusetts
    Appellate Tax Board, seeking abatements of corporate excise tax
    for the

2001-2003

tax years and adjustments in certain credits and credit
    carryforwards for the

2001-2003 years.

Issues before the Board include the computation of Biogen
    MA’s sales factor for

2001-2003,

computation of Biogen MA’s research credits for those same
    years, and the availability of deductions for certain expenses
    and partnership flow-through items. We intend to contest this
    matter vigorously. We believe that the assessment does not
    impact the level of liabilities for income tax contingencies.

On August 10, 2004, Classen Immunotherapies, Inc. filed
    suit against us, GlaxoSmithKline, Chiron Corporation,
    Merck & Co., Inc., and Kaiser-Permanente, Inc. in the
    U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland contending
    that we induced infringement of U.S. Patent Nos, 6,420,139,
    6,638,739, 5,728,383, and 5,723,283, all of which are directed
    to various methods of immunization or determination of
    immunization schedules. All Counts asserted against us by
    Classen were dismissed by the Court upon various motions filed
    by the Parties. In early December 2006, Classen filed its
    initial appeal brief with the United States Court of Appeals for
    the Federal Circuit. On March 7, 2007, we filed our brief
    in response. The Court of Appeals held oral argument on
    August 8, 2007. We have not formed an opinion that an
    unfavorable outcome is either “probable” or
    “remote” and do not express an opinion at this time as
    to the likely outcome of the matter or as to the magnitude or
    range of any potential loss. We believe that we have good and
    valid defenses to the complaint and intend to vigorously defend
    the case.

On January 30, 2007, the Estate of Thaddeus Leoniak
    commenced a civil lawsuit in the Court of Common Pleas,
    Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania, against Biogen Idec, the Fox
    Chase Cancer Center and three physicians.

F-56


BIOGEN
    IDEC INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The complaint alleges that Thaddeus Leoniak died as a result of
    taking the drug ZEVALIN, and seeks to hold Biogen Idec strictly
    liable for placing an allegedly “unreasonably
    dangerous” product in the stream of commerce without proper
    warnings. The complaint also seeks to hold us liable for alleged
    negligence in the design, manufacture, advertising, marketing,
    promoting, distributing, supplying and selling of ZEVALIN. The
    lawsuit seeks damages for pecuniary losses suffered by the
    decedent’s survivors and for compensatory damages for
    decedent’s pain and suffering, loss of earnings and
    deprivation of normal activities, all in an amount “in
    excess of $50,000.” On January 31, 2007, the
    Plaintiff’s counsel demanded $7.0 million to settle
    the lawsuit. We have not formed an opinion that an unfavorable
    outcome is either “probable” or “remote” and
    do not express an opinion at this time as to the likely outcome
    of the matter or as to the magnitude or range of any potential
    loss. We believe that we have good and valid defenses to the
    complaint and intend to vigorously defend the case.

In addition, we are involved in product liability claims and
    other legal proceedings generally incidental to our normal
    business activities. While the outcome of any of these
    proceedings cannot be accurately predicted, we do not believe
    the ultimate resolution of any of these existing matters would
    have a material adverse effect on our business or financial
    condition.

    which 1,750,000 shares have been designated as
    Series A Preferred Stock and 1,000,000 shares have
    been designated as Series X Junior Participating Preferred
    Stock. The balance may be issued without a vote or action of
    stockholders from time to time in classes or series with the
    designations, powers, preferences, and the relative,
    participating, optional or other special rights of the shares of
    each such class or series and any qualifications, limitations or
    restrictions thereon as set forth in the stock certificate. Any
    such Preferred Stock may rank prior to common stock as to
    dividend rights, liquidation preference or both, and may have
    full or limited voting rights and may be convertible into shares
    of common stock. As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, there
    were 8,221 shares of Series A Preferred Stock issued
    and outstanding. These shares carry a liquidation preference of
    $67 and are convertible into 60 shares of common stock per
    share of Preferred Stock. No other shares of Preferred Stock are
    issued and outstanding as of December 31, 2007 and 2006.

Stockholder
    Rights Plan

Effective July 26, 2001, our Board of Directors amended and
    restated the terms of our stockholder rights plan, originally
    adopted by the Board of Directors in 1997. Under the plan, we
    declared a dividend distribution of one “Right” for
    each outstanding share of our common stock to stockholders of
    record at the close of business on August 11, 1997. Since
    that time, we have issued one Right with each newly issued share
    of common stock. As amended, each Right, when exercisable,
    entitles the holder to purchase from us one one-thousandth of a
    share of our Series X Junior Participating Preferred Stock
    at a purchase price of $500.00. In general, under the
    amended and restated plan, if a person or affiliated group
    acquires beneficial ownership of 15% or more of our shares of
    common stock, then each Right (other than those held by such
    acquiring person or affiliated group) will entitle the holder to

F-57


BIOGEN
    IDEC INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

receive, upon exercise, shares of common stock (or, under
    certain circumstances, a combination of securities or other
    assets) having a value of twice the underlying purchase price of
    the Right. In addition, if following the announcement of the
    existence of an acquiring person or affiliated group we are
    involved in a business combination or sale of 50% or more of our
    assets or earning power, each Right (other than those held by
    the acquiring person or affiliated group) will entitle the
    holder to receive, upon exercise, shares of common stock of the
    acquiring entity having a value of twice the underlying purchase
    price of the Right. The Board of Directors also has the right,
    after an acquiring person or affiliated group is identified, to
    cause each Right to be exchanged for common stock or substitute
    consideration. We may redeem the Rights at a price of $0.001 per
    Right prior to the identification of an acquiring person or
    affiliated group. The Rights expire on July 26, 2011.

Stock
    Repurchase Programs

In October 2004, our Board of Directors authorized the
    repurchase of up to 20.0 million shares of our common
    stock. The repurchased stock will provide us with treasury
    shares for general corporate purposes, such as common stock to
    be issued under our employee equity and stock purchase plans.
    This repurchase program expired October 4, 2006. During
    2006, we repurchased 7.5 million shares at a cost of
    $320.3 million. During 2005, we repurchased
    7.5 million shares at a cost of $324.3 million.

In October 2006, our Board of Directors authorized the
    repurchase of up to an additional 20.0 million shares of
    our common stock. The repurchased stock will provide us with
    treasury shares for general corporate purposes, such as common
    stock to be issued under our employee equity and stock purchase
    plans. This repurchase program does not have an expiration date.
    No shares have been repurchased under the program as of
    December 31, 2007.

Reclassification

In the year ended December 31, 2007, we reclassified
    amounts within the statement of shareholder’s equity,
    resulting in an approximately $48 million correction in the
    treasury stock and common stock balances.

20.

Tender
    Offer

On June 27, 2007, pursuant to the terms of a tender offer,
    we accepted for payment 56,424,155 shares of our common
    stock at a price of $53.00 per share for a purchase price of
    $2,990.5 million. As the obligation of
    $2,990.5 million was incurred on June 27, 2007 and
    funded on July 2, 2007, pursuant to Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards No. 150,

Accounting for Certain
    Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities
    and Equity

, or SFAS 150, we recorded the present value
    of the obligation of $2,988.2 million on June 27,
    2007, and the $2.3 million difference between the present
    value of the obligation and funded amount was recognized as
    interest expense. We funded the tender offer through existing
    cash and cash equivalents of $1,490.5 million and
    $1,500.0 million borrowed under our short-term loan
    facility as described in Note 7, Indebtedness. We retired
    all of these shares in July 2007. In connection with this
    retirement, in accordance with our policy, we recorded an
    approximately $2,991 million reduction in treasury stock
    and additional

paid-in-capital.

Segment
    Information

We operate in one business segment, which is the business of
    development, manufacturing and commercialization of novel
    therapeutics for human healthcare and, therefore, our chief
    operating decision-maker manages the operations of our Company
    as a single operating segment. Enterprise-wide disclosures about
    product revenues, other revenues and long-lived assets by
    geographic area and information relating to major customers are

Severance
    and Other Restructuring Costs

    Restructurings

During 2007, we incurred $1.8 million in restructuring
    costs, primarily related to the Syntonix acquisition and the
    ZEVALIN divestiture, which are included in selling, general and
    administrative expense. At December 31, 2007, there are no
    material remaining restructuring accruals on our consolidated
    balance sheets.

BIOGEN
    IDEC INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

    Restructurings

During 2006, we incurred restructuring costs associated with
    acquisitions and planned dispositions. Specifically, we incurred
    $1.2 million in severance costs associated with the
    acquisition of Conforma, and $1.7 million related in
    headcount reductions related to the planned disposition of our
    ZEVALIN product line.

    Strategic Plan

In September 2005, we began implementing a comprehensive
    strategic plan, or the 2005 Strategic Plan, in conjunction with
    which we consolidated or eliminated certain internal management
    layers and staff functions, resulting in the reduction of our
    workforce that represented approximately 17%, or approximately
    650 positions worldwide at that time. These adjustments took
    place across company functions, departments and sites, and were
    substantially implemented by the end of 2005. We recorded
    restructuring charges of $31.4 million in connection with
    these activities, of which $28.3 million related to
    severance and other employee termination costs, including health
    benefits, outplacement and bonuses. Other costs were
    $3.1 million and included write-downs of certain research
    assets that will no longer be utilized, consulting costs in
    connection with the restructuring effort, and costs related to
    the acceleration of restricted stock, offset by the reversal of
    previously recognized compensation due to unvested restricted
    stock cancellations.

Remaining
    Reserve Balance

The remaining liability at December 31, 2006 associated
    with the 2005 Strategic Plan and the 2006 Restructurings, which
    is included in accrued expenses and other in our consolidated
    balance sheet, is as follows (in millions). There were no

Effective on December 31, 2005, our former Executive
    Chairman and Chairman of the Board retired and resigned from the
    Board. The charges related to this retirement amounted to
    $7.1 million and were all paid in 2005.

Guarantees

In November 2002, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation
    No. 45,

Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure
    Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of
    Indebtedness of Others, an interpretation of FASB Statements
    No. 5, 57, and 107 and Rescission of FASB Interpretation
    No. 34,

or FIN 45. FIN 45 elaborates on the
    disclosures to be made by a guarantor inside its interim and
    annual financial statements about its obligations under certain
    guarantees that it has issued. It also requires that a guarantor
    recognize, at the inception of a guarantee, a liability for the
    fair value of certain guarantees. The initial recognition and
    initial measurement provisions of FIN No. 45 are
    applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or
    modified after December 31, 2002. At December 31,
    2007, we have no liabilities recorded for guarantees, as defined
    by FIN 45, as the value of our guarantees are not material.

We enter into indemnification provisions under our agreements
    with other companies in the ordinary course of business,
    typically with business partners, contractors, clinical sites
    and customers. Under these provisions, we generally indemnify
    and hold harmless the indemnified party for losses suffered or
    incurred by the indemnified party as a result of our activities.
    These indemnification provisions generally survive termination
    of the underlying

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

agreement. The maximum potential amount of future payments we
    could be required to make under these indemnification provisions
    is unlimited. However, to date we have not incurred material
    costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims related to these
    indemnification provisions. As a result, the estimated fair
    value of these agreements is minimal. Accordingly, we have no
    liabilities recorded for these agreements as of
    December 31, 2007.

In connection with the relocation from leased facilities to our
    new research and corporate campus in San Diego, California,
    we entered into a lease assignment, in January 2005, with Tanox
    West, Inc., or Tanox, for a manufacturing facility in
    San Diego for which we have outstanding lease obligations
    through September 2008. Under the lease assignment, Tanox was
    assigned all of our rights, title, and interest in the amended
    lease and assumed all of the terms, covenants, conditions and
    obligations required to be kept, performed and fulfilled under
    the amended lease, including the making of all payments under
    the amended lease. However, if Tanox were to fail to perform
    under the lease assignment we would be responsible for all
    obligations under the amended lease through September 2008. At
    December 31, 2007, our estimate of the maximum potential of
    future payments under the amended lease through September 2008
    is $3.6 million. Under the lease assignment, Tanox has
    agreed to indemnify and hold us harmless from and against any
    and all claims, proceedings and demands and all costs, expenses
    and liabilities arising out of their performance or failure to
    perform under the lease assignment.

Facility
    Impairments and Loss (Gain) on Dispositions

In 2007, we sold approximately 28 acres of land in
    Oceanside, California for $16.5 million. We recorded a
    pre-tax gain of approximately $7.2 million on the sale,
    which is included in other income (expense) on the accompanying
    consolidated statement of operations, as this land was not
    utilized in our operations.

In December 2006, we completed the sale of a research building
    at our Cambridge, Massachusetts facility. Proceeds from the sale
    were approximately $39.5 million. We recorded a pre-tax
    gain of $15.6 million on the sale. We continue to occupy a
    minor portion of the building under a leasing arrangement.

In April 2006, we sold the worldwide rights and other assets of
    AMEVIVE for $59.8 million, including $43.7 million of
    inventory on hand, to Astellas Pharma US, Inc. As of
    December 31, 2005, our AMEVIVE assets held for sale
    included $8.0 million, net, related to intangible assets,
    and $5.4 million of property, plant and equipment, net, and
    were reported separately in current assets on the consolidated
    balance sheet. The pre-tax gain on this sale of approximately
    $2.8 million was deferred and is being recognized over the
    period of a related long-term supply contract.

In February 2006, we sold our clinical manufacturing facility in
    Oceanside, California, known as NICO. The assets associated with
    the facility were included in assets held for sale on our
    consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2005. Total
    consideration was $29.0 million. In 2005, we recorded
    impairment charges totaling $28.0 million to reduce the
    carrying value of NICO to its net realizable value. No
    additional loss resulted from completion of the sale.

In June 2005, we sold our large-scale biologics manufacturing
    facility in Oceanside, California, known as NIMO, along with
    approximately 60 acres of real property located in
    Oceanside, California upon which NIMO is located, together with
    improvements, related property rights, and certain personal
    property intangibles and contracts at or related to the real
    property. Total consideration for the purchase was
    $408.1 million. The loss from this transaction was
    $83.5 million which consisted primarily of the write-down
    of NIMO to net selling price, sales and transfer taxes, and
    other associated transaction costs.

As of March 31, 2005, after our voluntary suspension of
    TYSABRI, we reconsidered our construction plans and determined
    that we would proceed with the bulk manufacturing component of
    our large-scale biologic manufacturing facility in
    Hillerød, Denmark. Additionally, we added a labeling and
    packaging component to the project, but determined that we would
    no longer proceed with the fill-finish component of the
    large-scale biological manufacturing facility. As a result, we
    recorded an impairment charge of approximately $6.2 million
    in 2005 related to the fill-finish component that had previously
    been capitalized. See Footnote 9, Property, Plant and Equipment,
    and Footnote 17, Commitments and Contingencies.

New
    Accounting Pronouncements

On December 12, 2007,

EITF 07-01,

Accounting for Collaborative Arrangements Related to the
    Development and Commercialization of Intellectual Property

,
    or

EITF 07-01,

was issued. EITF-

07-01

prescribes the accounting for collaborations. It requires
    certain transactions between collaborators to be recorded in the
    income statement on either a gross or net basis within expenses
    when certain characteristics exist in the collaboration
    relationship.

EITF 07-01

is effective for all of our collaborations existing after
    January 1, 2009. We are evaluating the impact this standard
    will have on our financial statements.

On December 4, 2007, Statement of Financial Standard
    No. 141(R),

Business Combinations

, or
    SFAS 141(R), was issued. This Standard will require an
    acquiring company to measure all assets acquired and liabilities
    assumed, including contingent considerations and all contractual
    contingencies, at fair value as of the acquisition date. In
    addition, an acquiring company is required to capitalize
    IPR&D and either amortize it over the life of the product,
    or write it off if the project is abandoned or impaired. The
    Standard is effective for transactions occurring on or after
    January 1, 2009. We are evaluating the impact this standard
    will have on our financial statements.

On December 4, 2007, Statement of Financial Standard
    No. 160,

Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated
    Financial Statements, an amendment of ARB No. 51

, or
    SFAS 160, was issued. This Standard changes the accounting
    for and reporting of noncontrolling or minority interests (now
    called noncontrolling interest) in consolidated financial
    statements. This Standard is effective January 1, 2009.
    When implemented, prior periods will be recast for the changes
    required by SFAS 160. We are evaluating the impact, if any,
    this standard will have on our financial statements.

On June 27, 2007,

EITF 07-3

Accounting for Nonrefundable Advance Payments for Goods or
    Services Received for Use in Future Research and Development
    Activities

, or

EITF 07-3,

EITF

07-3

requires that nonrefundable advance payments made for goods or
    services to be used in future research and development
    activities be deferred and capitalized until such time as the
    related goods are delivered or services are performed, at which
    point the amounts would be recognized as an expense. This
    standard was effective for new contracts entered into after
    January 1, 2008. We are evaluating the impact, if any, this
    EITF will have on our financial statements.

On February 15, 2007, Statement of Financial Standard
    No. 159,

The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and
    Financial Liabilities

Standard permits us to choose to measure many financial
    instruments and certain other items at fair value. It also
    establishes presentation and disclosure requirements. This
    Standard was effective January 1, 2008 for the Company. We
    are evaluating the impact, if any, this standard will have on
    our financial statements.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Biogen Idec
    Inc.:

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and
    the related consolidated statements of income, shareholders
    equity and cash flows present fairly, in all material respects,
    the financial position of Biogen Idec Inc. and its subsidiaries
    at December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the results of their
    operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
    the period ended December 31, 2007 in conformity with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
    America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all
    material respects, effective internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on criteria
    established in

Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The
    Company’s management is responsible for these financial
    statements, for maintaining effective internal control over
    financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness
    of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility
    is to express opinions on these financial statements and on the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting based
    on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance
    with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
    Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and
    perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
    the financial statements are free of material misstatement and
    whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
    maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial
    statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence
    supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
    statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
    significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the
    overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal
    control over financial reporting included obtaining an
    understanding of internal control over financial reporting,
    assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing
    and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of
    internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also
    included performing such other procedures as we considered
    necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits
    provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that
    transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
    financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
    company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

As discussed in Note 5 to the consolidated financial
    statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts
    for share-based compensation in 2006. As discussed in
    Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements, the
    Company changed the manner in which it accounts for income tax
    contingencies in 2007.
