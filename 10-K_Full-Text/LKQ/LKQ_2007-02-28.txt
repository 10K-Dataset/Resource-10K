ITEM 1.

BUSINESS

Overview

We provide replacement systems, components, and parts
needed to repair light vehicles (cars and light trucks). Buyers of light
vehicle replacement products have the option to purchase from primarily three
sources: new products produced by original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”),
which are commonly known as OEM products; new products produced by companies
other than the OEMs, which are sometimes referred to generically as “aftermarket”
products; and recycled products originally produced by OEMs, which we refer to
as recycled OEM products. We participate in the market for recycled OEM
products as well as the market for collision repair aftermarket products. We
obtain aftermarket products and salvage vehicles from a variety of sources, and
we dismantle the salvage vehicles to obtain a comprehensive range of vehicle
products that we distribute into the light vehicle repair market. We recently
entered the business of refurbishing and distributing aluminum alloy wheels,
head lamps and tail lamps. We are not involved in the manufacture of automotive
products and do not maintain any manufacturing or remanufacturing operations.

We believe we are the largest nationwide provider of
recycled OEM products and related services, with sales, processing, and distribution
facilities that reach most major markets in the U.S. We believe that we are the
second largest nationwide provider of aftermarket collision replacement
products and refurbished wheels. We believe there are opportunities for growth
in both product lines through acquisitions and internal development.

We procure salvage vehicles, primarily at auctions,
using our locally based professionals, proprietary processes, and a disciplined
procurement system. In addition, as an alternative source of salvage vehicles,
we obtain some inventory directly from insurance companies, vehicle
manufacturers, and other suppliers. Once we have received proper title, which
assures us that the vehicles have not been stolen, we dismantle such vehicles
for recycled OEM products. We purchase aftermarket products from manufacturers,
primarily in Taiwan, using a proprietary order management system.

Our customers include collision and mechanical repair
shops and, indirectly, insurance companies, including extended warranty
companies. The majority of our products and services are sold to collision
repair shops, also known as body shops, and mechanical repair shops. We
indirectly rely on insurance companies, which ultimately pay the collision
repair shops for the repair of insured vehicles, as a source of business. These
insurance companies exert significant influence in the vehicle repair decision,
and increasingly look to a nationwide source for consistency, quality, and
availability of replacement products. Because of their importance to the
process, we have formed business relationships with certain insurance


companies, and with
certain extended warranty providers, in order to be their preferred light
vehicle parts supplier. For example, with some insurance companies we have
vehicle repair order estimate review programs in place and provide their claims
adjusters a part quote and locator service. In addition, we provide them an
outlet to dispose of certain total loss vehicles directly to us. We provide
extended warranty companies a single national call desk to service their
nationwide needs for mechanical products.

We believe we provide customers a value proposition
that includes high quality products, extensive product availability due to our
regional inventory trading zones, product costs lower than new OEM products,
and quick delivery. We provide benefits to repair shops and insurance companies
because the lower costs for our products enable many vehicles to be repaired
rather than declared a total loss. By expanding our product offerings to
include both recycled OEM products and aftermarket products we now offer
customers a more extensive range of light vehicle replacement products. We
believe this unique combination of recycled, aftermarket and refurbished
product offerings allows us to serve as a “one-stop” solution for our customers
looking for the most cost advantageous way to repair vehicles.

We believe that our
business is environmentally responsible. Our recycled automotive products
provide an alternative to the manufacture of new products, which would require
the expenditure of significantly more resources and energy and would generate a
substantial amount of additional pollution. Also, we recycle materials, such as
fuel, motor oil, and freon, from the salvage vehicles that we procure.

Our History

We believe we were the first recycler of light vehicle
products to achieve a national network and presence. Since our formation in
1998, we have grown through both internal development and acquisitions. Our
acquisition strategy has been to target companies with strategic locations and
significant market presence, strong management teams, a record of environmental
compliance, solid growth prospects, and a reputation for quality and customer
service. We currently have 67
locations in the U.S. that supply wholesale recycled OEM products. In February 2004,
we expanded our product offerings by also becoming a supplier of aftermarket
products and a provider of self-service retail recycled vehicle products. We
currently have approximately 48
locations that supply aftermarket products, 20 of which are co-located at
wholesale recycle facilities. We have 22

locations
providing self-service retail recycled vehicle products. We also operate out of
three locations in Central America. On January 31, 2006, we acquired an
aluminum alloy wheel refurbishing and distribution business. Our wheel
subsidiary currently operates six refurbishing and distribution facilities, one
of which is co-located at an aftermarket facility. On January 1, 2007, we
acquired a head and tail lamp refurbishing company.

For the year ended December 31,
2006, revenue derived from recycled OEM products and related services
represented approximately 59.8%
of our revenue, sales of aftermarket and refurbished products and services
represented approximately 24.4%
of our revenue, and sales of other products, such as scrap and other bulk
products, represented approximately 15.8%

of our revenue.

Our Strengths

We Provide a National Solution to Insurance Companies
and Extended Warranty Providers.

We believe that our
nationwide presence gives us a unique ability to service the major automobile
insurance companies and extended warranty providers. Insurance companies and
extended warranty providers operate generally at a national or regional level
and play a critical role in the repair process. We believe we provide a direct
benefit to these companies by lowering the cost of repairs, decreasing the time
required to return the repaired vehicle to the customer, and providing a replacement
product that is of comparable quality to the part replaced. Specifically, we
assist insurance companies by purchasing insured total loss vehicles and by
providing cost effective products through sales to collision repair shops,
especially


to
repair shops that are part of an insurance company network. We also provide a
review of vehicle repair order estimates to insurance companies so they may
assess the opportunity to increase usage of recycled OEM, aftermarket, and
refurbished products. For extended warranty providers, we provide a single
national call desk to service their nationwide need for mechanical products.

We Believe We Have
the Only National Network for Recycled OEM Products and it Would be Difficult
to Replicate.

We have invested
significant capital developing a national network of recycled OEM product
facilities that serves most major metropolitan areas in the U.S. We have
differentiated ourselves from our local competitors and made replication of our
network difficult by developing our network through purchasing anchor companies
that were among the largest companies in the industry. The difficulty and time
required to obtain proper zoning, as well as dismantling and other
environmental permits necessary to operate newly-sited facilities, would make
establishing new facilities challenging. In addition, there are difficulties associated
with recruiting and hiring an experienced management team that has strong
industry knowledge and local relationships with customers. Finally, our
national network allows us to enter new adjacent markets quickly by
establishing redistribution facilities, which avoids the need for local
dismantling capabilities and inventory.

We Benefit From a Local Presence.

Our network of facilities
allows us to develop and maintain our relationships with local repair shops,
while providing a level of service to insurance companies and national
customers that is made possible by our nationwide presence. Our local presence
allows us to provide daily deliveries that our customers require, using drivers
who routinely deliver to the same customers. Our sales force and local delivery
drivers develop and maintain critical personal relationships with the local
repair shops that benefit from access to our wide selection of products which we
are able to offer as a result of our regional inventory network.

We Have a Proven and Effective Procurement Process.

We have designed
information systems and methodologies to procure salvage vehicles and
aftermarket products cost-effectively. As our largest single expenditure,
efficient procurement of salvage vehicles is critical to the growth, operating
results and cash flow of our business. Our processes and know-how allow us to
identify and value the parts that can be recycled on a damaged vehicle at auction
and to determine rapidly the maximum price we will pay for the vehicle in order
to achieve our target margins on resale of the recycled OEM products. We
carefully analyze the market and obtain aftermarket products and salvage
vehicles of the type whose parts are in demand at prices that we believe will
allow us to sell products profitably. We have also taken advantage of our
relationships with insurance companies and vehicle manufacturers to obtain
salvage vehicles outside the auction process.

We Have a Broad and Deep Inventory of Products.

We believe that our
customers place a high value on availability of a broad range of light vehicle
replacement products. We also believe that our inventory of recycled OEM,
aftermarket and refurbished products allows us to fill a higher percentage of
our customers’ orders than our competitors. In addition, our ability to share
inventory on a regional basis increases the availability of replacement
products and also helps us to fill a higher percentage of our customers’
orders. We have developed regional trading zones within which we make our
inventory available to our local facilities, mostly via overnight product
transfers. We manage our inventory and purchasing on a regional basis to
enhance the availability of the products that we believe will be in the highest
demand within each region. Our broad and deep inventory furthers


our
ability to serve as a “one-stop” solution for our customers’ recycled OEM,
aftermarket and refurbished product needs.

We Have Implemented Management Disciplines.

Our management and
operations team is highly experienced, with many managers having spent their
entire careers in the light vehicle recycling industry. We have developed and
built procurement, operating, and financial systems that have allowed us to
grow and develop our national network and implement professional management
techniques and disciplines. As our business has grown, we have acquired
additional management talent which has furthered the sharing of best practices
throughout the company. In addition, our senior management team has extensive
acquisition experience and will continue to use our disciplined approach in
targeting growth opportunities.

Our Strategies

Strengthen our National Network Through Internal
Growth and Acquisitions.

We intend to continue to
expand our market coverage through a combination of internal development and
acquisitions and to look for opportunities to expand into new regions and into
adjacent markets. We plan to establish a presence in additional major
metropolitan markets and a number of smaller markets in the U.S. We have
applied an analytical and disciplined approach to our acquisition process and
have targeted companies with strong management teams, a record of environmental
compliance, solid growth prospects, and a reputation for quality and customer
service.

Further Develop Business Relationships.

We intend to continue to
develop business relationships with automobile insurance companies, extended
warranty providers, and other industry participants. We believe that insurance
companies and extended warranty providers, as payors for many repairs, will
take a more active role in the selection of replacement products in the repair
process in order to use lower cost alternatives to new OEM products. On behalf
of certain insurance company customers, we provide a review of vehicle repair
order estimates so they may assess the opportunity to increase usage of
recycled OEM, aftermarket and refurbished products in the repair process,
thereby reducing their costs. Our employees also provide quotes for our
products to assist several insurance companies with their estimate and
settlement processes. We also work with insurance companies and light vehicle
manufacturers to procure salvage vehicles directly from them on a selected
basis, which provides us an additional source of supply and provides them
improved economics on salvage vehicle sales. We believe we are positioned to
take advantage of the increasing importance of these industry participants and
will continue to look for ways to enhance our relationships.

Continue to Improve our Operating Results.

We are working to improve
our operating results by applying our business disciplines to our most recently
acquired facilities, continuing to build our network, further centralizing
certain functions, improving our use of technology, and increasing revenue at
our lower volume facilities. Our higher volume facilities generally operate at
a higher profitability level as a percentage of revenue. We believe we can improve
the profitability level at our lower volume facilities by achieving the higher
volumes and improved economies of scale that we realize at our higher volume
facilities. We intend to continue to refine our procurement system, which uses
methodologies that analyze demand levels for our products, existing inventory
levels, and projected margins on an individual vehicle basis.


Further Develop our Technology and Business Processes.

We continue to emphasize
the use of technology in our processes to improve efficiency and to increase
the standardization of our business. Our technology and proprietary processes
enhance procurement, pricing, and inventory management. We continue to develop
our technology to allow us to better manage and analyze our inventory, to
assist our sales people with up-to-date pricing and availability of our
products, and to further enhance our procurement process. For example, many of
our representatives responsible for procuring vehicles, whom we refer to as
“scouts,” are equipped with handheld computing devices to assist them in
appraising the vehicles prior to submitting a bid to purchase the vehicle.

Raise Industry Standards by Being the Industry Leader.

Since our inception, we
have employed a professional approach to the light vehicle recycling business.
We continue to seek new ways to improve our methodologies and to communicate
our standards to our customers. We further believe that, by elevating industry
standards in areas such as customer service, integrity, product quality and
availability, delivery time, warranty support, environmental compliance, and
appearance of facilities, we can help promote the acceptability of the use of
recycled OEM, aftermarket and refurbished products.

Our Process

Our operations generally involve the procurement of
inventory, vehicle processing (in the case of wholesale recycled OEM products),
sales, and distribution. We also perform refurbishing of OEM wheel and lighting
products. Such refurbishing work is primarily cosmetic.

Procurement of Inventory

We start the process of procuring recycled OEM
products for our wholesale operations by acquiring severely damaged or totaled
vehicles. We acquired approximately 111,400 salvage vehicles for our wholesale
operations in 2006. We purchase the majority of our vehicles from salvage
auctions. Wrecked vehicles are sold at salvage auctions held each weekday
throughout the country. Salvage auctions provide an outlet for salvage vehicles
to be processed and sold primarily to automotive recyclers and rebuilders. We
pay third parties fees to tow the vehicles from the auction to our facilities.
Salvage auctions charge fees both to the supplier of vehicles (primarily
insurance companies) and to the purchaser (including us).

For the vast majority of our salvage auction
purchases, we send a scout in advance of each auction to investigate the
vehicles we would be interested in buying. The scout obtains key information
such as the model, mileage, and damage assessment and determines which parts on
the targeted vehicles are recyclable. This information is electronically
forwarded to our bid specialists via handheld computing devices or facsimile
transmissions. The bid specialists analyze the data in light of current demand
for the parts in question, the levels of our inventory with respect to such
parts, and the projected margins expected for each vehicle. The specialists
then set a maximum bid price that our bidders use to purchase the vehicle at
auction. We believe that this system provides a disciplined approach to
procurement.

We also obtain salvage vehicles and parts from
insurance companies, vehicle manufacturers, abandoned vehicle programs, and
other salvage sources. Some of these arrangements allow us to acquire salvage
vehicles directly from the insurance company or vehicle manufacturer at a cost
calculated as a percentage of revenue from such vehicles, which is remitted as
products are sold from these vehicles. These arrangements eliminate the fees we
and the insurance company would otherwise pay to the salvage auction and
provide us inventory with a lower initial expenditure of capital.


We acquire inventory for our self-service retail recycled
OEM products operations from a variety of sources, including but not limited to
auctions, towing companies, municipalities, insurance carriers, charitable
organizations and the general public. In 2006, we purchased approximately

138,700 salvage vehicles for our retail
operations.

We purchase aftermarket products from independent
manufacturers. Approximately 55% of our aftermarket products are purchased and
imported directly from manufacturers in Taiwan. Approximately 45% of our
aftermarket products are purchased from locations in the U.S., however, we
believe that the majority of these products are manufactured in Taiwan and
other Asian countries. No single supplier currently provides more than 21% of our aftermarket products. We
use a proprietary order management system to procure our aftermarket inventory.
The system prompts inventory purchases based on stocking levels and historical
sales data. We believe that the system helps us to procure our aftermarket
inventory efficiently and to maintain one of the highest fulfillment rates in
the aftermarket products industry.

Our refurbished products
are processed from cores obtained from our recycled OEM locations and from
brokers. The higher quality cores are then refurbished. For popular wheels, we
also purchase aftermarket wheels from outside vendors to fill demand.

Vehicle Processing

Vehicle processing for our wholesale operations
involves dismantling a salvage vehicle into recycled OEM products ready for
delivery. When a salvage vehicle arrives at one of our facilities, an inventory
specialist identifies, catalogs, and schedules the vehicle for dismantling. We
do not dismantle any vehicle until we have received proper title documentation,
thereby assuring that the vehicle was not stolen.

The dismantler removes components that will become
products for sale. Products that are placed directly on inventory shelves
generally include such items as the engine, transmission, hood, trunk lid, head
and tail lamp assemblies, rear bumper, and doors. We remove all recyclable
items including fluids, freon, batteries, tires, and catalytic converters.
These items are sold to recyclers and reprocessors. Dismantlers also perform
any required cutting of the vehicle frame or body.

Each inventory item is
entered into our inventory tracking system, inspected for quality, tagged for
identification, and prepared for storage and delivery to our customers.
Mechanical products not in a condition to be sold as recycled products or that
are in surplus supply are separated and sold in bulk to parts remanufacturers.
The remaining vehicle hulks and components, such as fabrics, rubber, plastics,
and glass, are delivered to automobile shredders, crushers, and scrap
processors.

Sales

As of December 31, 2006, we employed 462
full-time sales staff in our wholesale recycled OEM products operations. Of
these, 429 were located at sales desks at our facilities and generally are
responsible for accepting incoming calls from, and selling our inventory to,
our customers. We put all of our sales personnel through a thorough training
program. Most of our sales personnel are paid primarily on a commission basis.
In addition, as of December 31, 2006, we had approximately 33 traveling
sales staff who visit our customers and focus on business development in
various markets. In our aftermarket products operations, sales orders are
accepted by either our local delivery drivers or by our dedicated aftermarket
and refurbished products sales call centers.

We are continually reviewing and revising the pricing
of our recycled OEM products. Our pricing specialists take into consideration
factors such as location, recent demand, inventory quantity, inventory
turnover, new OEM product prices, recycled OEM product prices, aftermarket and
refurbished product prices, and remanufactured part prices, with the goal of
optimizing revenue. We update the pricing of our


aftermarket and
refurbished products at least annually when we update our product catalogs or
when standard pricing guides are provided to estimating systems. We may adjust
prices during the year in response to material price changes of OEM products.

The inventory base of each
of our facilities, supplemented by the inventory sharing system within our
regional trading zones, gives us what we believe to be a competitive advantage
through our ability to meet our customers’ requirements more frequently than
smaller competitors.

Distribution

Each sale results in the generation of a work order. A
dispatcher is then responsible for ensuring product accuracy, printing the
final invoice, and including the products on the appropriate truck route for
delivery to the customer. We operate a delivery fleet of medium-sized trucks
and smaller trucks and vans. These trucks deliver products to our customers
within a specified territory, typically on a daily basis. In markets where we
offer recycled OEM, aftermarket and refurbished products, we deliver all of our
product types on the same delivery routes to help minimize distribution costs.

Additionally, we have
developed an internal distribution network to allow our sales representatives
to sell recycled OEM,  aftermarket and
refurbished products from the inventory of nearby facilities within our
regional trading zones, thus improving our ability to fulfill customer requests
and to improve inventory turnover. We operate approximately 64 recycled OEM product and


aftermarket product and refurbished
wheel product transfers between our facilities within our regional trading
zones each weekday.

Our Products

When we procure salvage vehicles, we focus on vehicles
for which the insured repair market has the most recycled OEM product demand.
These tend to be popular types of vehicles such as sport utility vehicles and
pickup trucks, and automobile models with high sales volume. These vehicles
generally are a few model years old, as insurers tend to use new OEM products
on repairs of vehicles that are one to two years old. Similarly, insurers are
less likely to authorize the repair of vehicles more than ten model years old.
The degree of damage is not a significant factor in our process as we only
assign value to the undamaged products when we prepare our bids.

Our most popular recycled OEM products include
engines, transmissions, vehicle front end assemblies, doors, trunk lids, bumper
assemblies, wheels, head and tail lamp assemblies, mirrors, fenders, and axles.

When we obtain a mechanical product, wheels or certain
lighting products from a dismantled vehicle and determine that we have an
excess supply of such product or it is defective, the mechanical item is then
sold in bulk to mechanical remanufacturers, while the wheel and lighting items
are sent to our refurbishment locations. We refer to these items as core
products. The majority of the mechanical products are transferred to our core
facility in Houston, Texas where we sort them by product and model type.
Examples of such products are engine blocks and heads, transmissions, starters,
alternators, and air conditioner compressors. The wheels and lighting items are
sent to our refurbishing facilities.

When we procure
aftermarket products and refurbish wheels and lights, we focus on products that
are in the most demand by the insured repair market. Our most popular
aftermarket products are head lamps, tail lamps, grilles, hoods, and mirrors.
We also focus on aftermarket and refurbished products that would best
complement our recycled OEM product inventory.


Our Customers

Insurance Companies

We consider automobile
insurance companies our customers, as they are a key demand driver for our
products. Our products are delivered directly to the repair shop or installer,
because insurance companies and extended warranty providers generally do not
take receipt of repair parts. While insurance companies do not pay for our
products directly, the insurance company does ultimately pay for the repair of
the insured vehicle. As a result, the insurance company often exerts
significant influence in the decision-making process as to how a damaged vehicle
is repaired, and the cost level of the product used in the repair process.
Insurance companies are also concerned with customer satisfaction with the
repair process and the total time to return the repaired vehicle to its owner.

Repair Shops and Others

We sell the majority of
our products wholesale to collision repair shops and mechanical repair shops.
The majority of these customers tend to be individually-owned small businesses,
although over the last few years there has been a trend toward consolidation resulting
in the formation of several national and regional repair companies. We also
sell our products to automobile dealerships and fleet management groups. In
addition, we sell our products to individual retail customers at our
self-service retail locations and at certain of our wholesale recycled OEM,
aftermarket and refurbished product locations.

Remanufacturers

A mechanical part that is
not suitable for sale as a replacement part, or that is a product for which we
have an excess supply, is sold to mechanical remanufacturers in bulk shipments.
Examples of mechanical parts we sell in this manner are engine blocks and
heads, transmissions, starters, alternators, and air conditioner compressors.
Remanufacturers usually are significantly larger companies than repair shops.
Our sales to them tend to be large orders and are dependent on their needs for
a certain product line.

Our Employees

As of December 31,
2006, we had approximately 4,100

employees
performing operational functions and approximately 170 corporate and regional
employees. In July 2006, approximately 60 of our employees at our Totowa,
New Jersey facility voted to be represented by a union. Since shortly after the
vote, we have been in negotiations with the union regarding a collective
bargaining agreement. No agreement has been reached. Other than the employees
in Totowa, New Jersey, none of our employees is a member of a union or
participates in other collective bargaining arrangements.

Our Facilities

Our corporate headquarters
are located at 120 North LaSalle Street, Suite 3300, Chicago, Illinois
60602. In February 2004, we entered into a new lease, which became
effective on August 1, 2004, to remain in our current office space. The
term of the new lease is ten years, but either party can terminate the lease in
July 2009. The primary functions performed at our corporate headquarters
are financial, accounting, treasury, marketing, business development, human
resources, information systems support, and legal. In addition to our corporate
headquarters, we have numerous operating facilities that handle recycled OEM
products, aftermarket and refurbished products, and self-service retail
products. A majority of these facilities are leased.


Recycled OEM Parts

Our wholesale recycled OEM
parts facilities are located among eight geographic regions. A typical facility
has processing, sales and distribution operations, including a large warehouse
with multiple bays to dismantle vehicles, indoor and outdoor storage areas, and
administrative and sales offices. Equipment typically used at each facility
includes hydraulic lifts, forklifts and loaders, and hand tools to dismantle
vehicles. We also have facilities that operate primarily as redistribution
centers. As of February 23, 2007, we conducted our wholesale recycled OEM
parts operations from 67 facilities,


of which include a combination of
processing, sales and redistribution operations, and 14 of which are primarily redistribution facilities. We also have
three recycled OEM parts facilities in Central America.

Aftermarket Parts

We conduct our aftermarket
parts business from facilities that serve as sales, warehousing or distribution
centers for these parts. As of February 23, 2007, we conducted our
aftermarket parts operations from approximately


facilities, 20 of which are
co-located at wholesale recycle facilities. The largest of these facilities are
located in Columbus, Ohio; Charlotte, North Carolina; Dallas, Texas; Oakland,
California; Pennsauken, New Jersey; Totowa, New Jersey; Landover, Maryland; Atlanta,
Georgia; Chicago, Illinois; Webster, Massachusetts and Topeka, Kansas.

Refurbished Parts

We refurbish wheels at
four facilities located in Connecticut, Florida, Indiana and Michigan. We also
distribute wheels from two locations, one in Illinois (located within our
Chicago aftermarket warehouse) and one in Michigan. As a result of a 2007
acquisition, we refurbish head lamps and tail lamps at a facility in Grand
Rapids, Michigan.

Self-Service Retail
Parts

Our self-service retail
parts facilities typically consist of several acres of vehicles stored outdoors
and a retail building through which customers access the vehicles. As of February 23,
2007, we conducted our self-service retail parts operations from 22 facilities in the United States.

Competition

We operate in a highly competitive industry. We
consider all suppliers of light vehicle products to be competitors, including
participants in the recycled OEM product market, OEMs, parts remanufacturers,
suppliers of aftermarket and refurbished products, and internet-based
suppliers. We believe the principal areas of competition in our industry
include pricing, product quality, service, and availability of inventory.

We compete with more than 6,000 domestic light vehicle
product recyclers, most of which are single-unit operators. We believe most of
the light vehicle parts recyclers in the U.S. have less than $3.0 million
in annual revenue. In some markets, smaller competitors have organized
affiliations to share marketing and distribution resources. Greenleaf LLC, a
light vehicle recycling business started by Ford Motor Company, is our largest
competitor in the light vehicle OEM product recycling business. Schnitzer Steel
Industries, Inc., a company with operations in the steel manufacturing,
metals recycling, and vehicle product recycling businesses, purchased Greenleaf
on September 30, 2005. Schnitzer Steel is a significant operator in the
self-service retail recycling business.

We also compete with distributors of aftermarket and refurbished collision light vehicle
products. The largest distributor of these products in the U.S. is Keystone
Automotive Industries, Inc.


Manufacturers of new original equipment parts sell the
majority of light vehicle replacement products. We believe, however, that as
the insurance and repair industries come to appreciate the advantages of
recycled OEM, aftermarket and
refurbished products, those products can account for a larger percentage
of total vehicle replacement product sales.

Information
Technology

We use a single third party facility management system
in most of our wholesale recycled OEM operations. We believe that a single
system helps us with the continued implementation of standard operating
procedures, training efficiency, employee transferability, access to a national
inventory database, management reporting, and data storage. It also eliminates
the need to create multiple versions of proprietary applications and systems
support processes.

The major features of our facility management system
include inventory control, customer selling and billing, sales analysis,
vehicle tracking, and profitability reporting. The system also supports an
electronic exchange system for identifying and locating parts at other selected
recyclers and facilitates brokered sales to fill customer orders for items not
in stock.

We have separate third party providers for our
financial systems such as financial and budget reporting, general ledger
accounting, accounts payable, payroll, and fixed assets. We utilize the same
common financial systems throughout the majority of our operations.

We currently protect our local customer, inventory,
and corporate consolidated data, such as financial information, e-mail files,
and other user files, with daily backups. These backups are stored off site
with a third party data protection vendor.

We have consolidated our facility management systems
onto regional system platforms. The hardware for all such platforms is located
at a single data center. The center is in a secure environment with
around-the-clock monitoring; redundant power backup; and multiple, diverse data
and telecommunication routing. Facility management system data is “mirrored”
(replicated) off site in real time to a disaster recovery facility located in a
different part of the country. This disaster recovery facility is also housed
in a secure environment with around-the-clock monitoring; redundant power
backup; and multiple, diverse data and telecommunications routing.

Currently our aftermarket,
refurbishing, and self-service retail operations each use a separate facility
management system.

Regulation

Environmental Compliance

Our operations and properties, including the
maintenance of our delivery vehicles, are subject to extensive federal, state,
and local environmental protection and health and safety laws and regulations.
These environmental laws govern, among other things, the emission and discharge
of hazardous materials into the ground, air, or water; the exposure to
hazardous materials; and the generation, handling, storage, use, treatment,
identification, transportation, and disposal of industrial by-products, waste
water, storm water, and mercury and other hazardous materials.

We have made and will continue to make capital and
other expenditures relating to environmental matters. We have an environmental
management process designed to facilitate and support our compliance with these
requirements. We cannot assure you, however, that we will at all times be in
complete compliance with such requirements.


Although we presently do not expect to incur any
capital or other expenditures relating to environmental controls or other
environmental matters in amounts that would be material to us, we may be
required to make such expenditures in the future. Environmental laws are
complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time.
Accordingly, we cannot assure you that environmental laws will not change or
become more stringent in the future in a manner that could have a material
adverse effect on our business.

Contamination resulting from vehicle recycling
processes can include soil and ground water contamination from the release,
storage, transportation, or disposal of gasoline, motor oil, antifreeze,
transmission fluid, CFCs from air conditioners, other hazardous materials, or
metals such as aluminum, cadmium, chromium, lead, and mercury. Contamination
can migrate on-site or off-site which can increase the risk, and the amount, of
any potential liability.

In addition, many of our facilities are located on or
near properties with a history of industrial use which may have involved
hazardous materials. As a result, some of our properties may be contaminated.
Some environmental laws hold current or previous owners or operators of real
property liable for the costs of cleaning up contamination, even if these
owners or operators did not know of and were not responsible for such
contamination. These environmental laws also impose liability on any person who
disposes of, treats, or arranges for the disposal or treatment of hazardous
substances, regardless of whether the affected site is owned or operated by
such person, and at times can impose liability on companies deemed under law to
be a successor to such person. Third parties may also make claims against
owners or operators of properties, or successors to such owners or operators,
for personal injuries and property damage associated with releases of hazardous
or toxic substances.

When we identify a
potential material environmental issue during our acquisition due diligence
process, we analyze the risks, and, when appropriate, perform further
environmental assessment to verify and quantify the extent of the potential
contamination. Furthermore, where appropriate, we have established financial
reserves for certain environmental matters. In addition, at times we, or one of
the sellers from whom we purchased a business, have undertaken remediation projects.
We do not anticipate, based on currently available information and current
laws, that we will incur liabilities in excess of reserves to address
environmental matters. However, in the event we discover new information or if
laws change, we may incur significant liabilities, which may exceed our
reserves.

Title Laws

In some states, when a
vehicle is deemed a total loss, a salvage title is issued. Whether states issue
salvage titles is important to the light vehicle recycling industry because an
increase in vehicles that qualify as salvage vehicles provides greater
availability and typically lowers the price of such vehicles. Currently, these
titling issues are a matter of state law. In 1992, the U.S. Congress
commissioned an advisory committee to study problems relating to vehicle
titling, registration, and salvage. Since then, legislation has been introduced
seeking to establish national uniform requirements in this area, including a
uniform definition of a salvage vehicle. The light vehicle recycling industry
will generally favor a uniform definition, since it will avoid inconsistencies
across state lines, and will generally favor a definition that expands the
number of damaged vehicles that qualify as salvage. However, certain interest
groups, including repair shops and some insurance associations, may oppose this
type of legislation. National legislation has not yet been enacted in this
area, and there can be no assurance that such legislation will be enacted in
the future.

National Stolen Passenger Motor Vehicle Information
System

In 1992, Congress enacted
the Anti Car Theft Act to deter trafficking in stolen vehicles. This law
included the establishment of the National Stolen Passenger Motor Vehicle
Information System to track


and
monitor stolen automotive parts. In April 2002, the Department of Justice
published for comment proposed regulations to implement the National Stolen
Passenger Motor Vehicle Information System. The proposed regulations require,
among other things, that insurance companies, salvagers, dismantlers,
recyclers, and repairers inspect salvage vehicles for the purpose of collecting
the vehicle identification number and the part number for any “covered major
part” that possesses the vehicle identification number. The requirement to collect
this information would place substantial burdens on light vehicle recyclers,
including us, that otherwise would not normally exist. It would place similar
burdens on repair shops, which may further discourage the use by such shops of
recycled products. The Department of Justice’s comment period for the proposed
regulations ended in June 2002, but final regulations have not been
issued.

Legislation Affecting Automotive Repair Parts

Most states have laws that
restrict the use of aftermarket parts in collision repair work. These
restrictions range from the requirement to disclose to the vehicle owner the
use of aftermarket parts in the repair process to the requirement to have
aftermarket parts certified by an independent testing organization. Some jurisdictions
have laws that prohibit or restrict the sale of certain recycled OEM products
that we provide, such as airbags. Additional laws of this kind may be
introduced in the future. An increase in the number of states passing such
legislation or the passing of legislation with prohibitions or restrictions
that are more severe than current laws could have a material adverse impact on
our business. Additionally, Congress could enact federal legislation
restricting the use of aftermarket and recycled automotive parts in the repair
process.

Seasonality

Our operating results are
subject to quarterly variations based on a variety of factors, influenced
primarily by seasonal changes in weather patterns. During the winter months we
tend to have higher demand for our products because there are more weather
related accidents. In addition, the cost of salvage vehicles tends to be lower
as more weather related accidents occur generating a larger supply of total
loss vehicles.

ITEM 1A.

RISK
FACTORS

Risks Relating to
Our Business

We face intense
competition from local, national, and internet-based light vehicle products
providers, and this competition could negatively affect our business.

The light vehicle
replacement products industry is highly competitive and is served by numerous
suppliers of OEM products, recycled OEM products, aftermarket products, and
refurbished products. Within each of these categories of suppliers, there are
local owner-operated companies, larger regional suppliers, national providers,
and internet-based suppliers. Providers of light vehicle replacement products
that have traditionally sold only certain categories of such products may
decide to expand their product offerings into other categories of light vehicle
replacement products, which may further increase competition. Some of our
current and potential competitors may have more operational expertise; greater
financial, technical, manufacturing, distribution, and other resources; longer
operating histories; lower cost structures; and better relationships in the
insurance and vehicle repair industries. In certain regions of the U.S., local
light vehicle recycling companies have formed cooperative efforts to compete in
the recycled OEM products industry. As a result of these factors, our competitors
may be able to provide products that we are unable to supply, provide their
products at lower costs, or supply products to customers that we are unable to
serve.


An adverse change
in our relationships with auction companies or our suppliers could increase our
expenses and hurt our ability to serve our customers.

Most of our salvage inventory is obtained from
vehicles offered at salvage auctions by several companies that own auction
facilities in numerous locations across the U.S. We do not have contracts with
any auction company. According to industry analysts, three companies control
over 65% of the salvage auction
market in the U.S. In some localities, the automotive auction business may be
even more highly concentrated. If an auction company prohibited us from
participating in its auctions, or significantly raised its fees, our business
could be adversely affected through higher costs or the resulting potential
inability to service our customers. Moreover, we are facing increased
competition in the purchase of salvage vehicles from shredders and scrap
recyclers, internet-based buyers, and others. This increase in the number of
bidders may increase our cost of goods sold for recycled OEM products.

We also acquire some of our inventory directly from
insurance companies, original equipment manufacturers, aftermarket parts
manufacturers, and others. To the extent that these suppliers decide to discontinue
these arrangements, our business could be adversely affected through higher
costs or the resulting potential inability to service our customers.

In addition, we purchase
aftermarket parts primarily from foreign manufacturers in Taiwan. In the event
that our business relationships with these suppliers deteriorated or
terminated, or in the event that the importing of products into the U.S. from
Taiwan or the exporting of products by Taiwan to the U.S. was disrupted, our
business could be adversely affected through higher costs or the resulting
inability to service our customers.

We may not be able
to sell our products due to existing or new laws and regulations prohibiting or
restricting the sale of recycled OEM or aftermarket products.

Some jurisdictions have enacted laws prohibiting or
severely restricting the sale of certain recycled OEM products that we provide,
such as airbags. These and other jurisdictions could enact similar laws or
could prohibit or severely restrict the sale of additional recycled OEM
products. Restrictions on the products we are able to sell could decrease our
revenue and have an adverse effect on our business and operations.

We became involved in the aftermarket products
business upon the closing of an acquisition in February 2004. Since 1998,
most states have passed laws that prohibit or limit the use of aftermarket
products in collision repair work and/or require enhanced disclosure or vehicle
owner consent before using aftermarket products in such repair work. Additional
legislation of this kind may be introduced in the future. If additional laws
prohibiting or restricting the use of aftermarket products are passed, it could
have an adverse impact on our aftermarket products business.

Certain organizations test
the quality and safety of light vehicle replacement products. In the event that
such organizations decide that a particular vehicle product does not meet
applicable quality or safety standards, we may decide to discontinue sales of
such product or insurance companies may decide to discontinue authorization of
repairs using such product. Such events could adversely affect our business.

If our business relationships with insurance companies
end, we may lose important sales opportunities.

We rely on business
relationships with several insurance companies. These insurance companies
encourage vehicle repair facilities to use products we provide. Our
arrangements with these companies may be terminated at any time. We rely on
these relationships for sales to some collision repair shops, and a termination
of these relationships may result in a loss of sales, which could adversely
affect our results of operations.


We are subject to environmental regulations and incur
costs relating to environmental matters.

We are subject to
various federal, state, and local environmental protection and health and
safety laws and regulations governing, among other things:

·

the emission and discharge
of hazardous materials into the ground, air, or water;

·

the exposure to hazardous
materials; and

·

the generation, handling,
storage, use, treatment, identification, transportation, and disposal of
industrial by-products, waste water, storm water, and mercury and other
hazardous materials.

We are also required to obtain environmental permits
from governmental authorities for certain of our operations. If we violate or
fail to obtain or comply with these laws, regulations, or permits, we could be
fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators. We could also become liable if
employees or other third parties are improperly exposed to hazardous materials.

Under certain environmental laws, we could be held
responsible for all of the costs relating to any contamination at, or migration
to or from, our or our predecessors’ past or present facilities and at third
party waste disposal sites. These laws often impose liability even if the owner
or operator did not know of, or was not responsible for, the release of such
hazardous substances.

Environmental laws are
complex, change frequently, and have tended to become more stringent over time.
Our costs of complying with current and future environmental and health and
safety laws, and our liabilities arising from past or future releases of, or
exposure to, hazardous substances, may adversely affect our business, results
of operations, or financial condition.

Governmental agencies may refuse to grant or renew our
operating licenses and permits.

Our operating subsidiaries
must obtain licenses and permits from state and local governments to conduct
their operations. When we develop or acquire a new facility, we must seek the
approval of state and local units of government. Governmental agencies often
resist the establishment of a vehicle recycling facility in their communities.
There can be no assurance that future approvals or transfers will be granted.
In addition, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain and
renew the licenses and permits our operating subsidiaries currently hold.

Proposed
regulations under the National Stolen Passenger Motor Vehicle Information
System could harm our business.

In 1992, Congress enacted
the Anti Car Theft Act to deter trafficking in stolen vehicles. This law included
the establishment of the National Stolen Passenger Motor Vehicle Information
System to track and monitor stolen automotive parts. In April 2002, the
Department of Justice published for comment proposed regulations to implement
this system. The proposed regulations require, among other things, that
insurance companies, salvagers, dismantlers, recyclers, and repairers inspect
salvage vehicles for the purpose of collecting the vehicle identification
number and the part number for any covered major part that possesses the
vehicle identification number. The requirement to collect this information
would place burdens and costs on us that otherwise would not normally exist,
and could discourage our customers from purchasing our products if the proposed
regulations are adopted.

We could be subject to product liability claims.

If customers of repair
shops that purchase our products are injured or suffer property damage, we
could be subject to product liability claims. The successful assertion of this
type of claim could have an adverse effect on our business or financial
condition.


We may lose
business if recent litigation involving the use of aftermarket parts results in
insurance companies modifying arrangements affecting the use of recycled OEM or
aftermarket products in the repair process.

In an Illinois lawsuit
involving State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company (

“Avery v. State Farm”

), a jury decided in October 1999
that State Farm breached certain insurance contracts with its policyholders by
using non-OEM parts to repair damaged vehicles when use of such parts did not
restore the vehicle to its “pre-loss condition.” The jury found that State Farm
misled its customers by not disclosing the use of non-OEM parts and the alleged
inferiority of those parts. The jury assessed damages against State Farm of
$456 million, and the judge assessed an additional $730 million of
disgorgement and punitive damages for violations of the Illinois Consumer Fraud
Act. In April 2001, the Illinois Appellate Court upheld the verdict but
reduced the damage award by $130 million because of duplicative damage
awards. On August 18, 2005, the Illinois Supreme Court reversed the awards
made by the circuit court and found, among other things, that the plaintiffs
had failed to establish any breach of contract on the part of State Farm. The
U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal of this case. As a result of this
case, some insurance companies had reduced or eliminated their use of aftermarket
products. Although our products are primarily recycled OEM parts, we entered
the aftermarket products business through an acquisition in February 2004.
Our financial results could be affected, perhaps adversely, if insurance
companies modified or terminated the arrangements pursuant to which repair
shops buy aftermarket or recycled OEM products from us due to a fear of similar
claims with respect to such products.

If the number of
vehicles involved in accidents declines, our business could suffer.

Because our business
depends on vehicle accidents for both the supply of recycled OEM products and
the demand for repairs using our products, factors which influence the number
and/or severity of accidents, including, but not limited to, the number of
vehicles on the road, the number of miles driven, the ages of drivers, the use
of cellular telephones and other electronic equipment by drivers, the
congestion of traffic, the occurrence and severity of certain weather
conditions, the use of alcohol and drugs by drivers, and the condition of
roadways, impact our business. In this regard, a number of states and
municipalities have adopted, or are considering adopting, legislation banning
the use of handheld cellular telephones while driving and such restrictions
could lead to a decline in accidents. Moreover, an increase in fuel prices may
cause the number of vehicles on the road to decline as motorists seek
alternative transportation options and this also could lead to a decline in
accidents.

We may not be able
to successfully acquire new operations or integrate future acquisitions, which
could cause our business to suffer.

We may not be able
to successfully complete potential strategic acquisitions if we cannot reach
agreement on acceptable terms or for other reasons. If we buy a company or a
division of a company, we may experience difficulty integrating that company’s
or division’s personnel and operations, which could negatively affect our
operating results. In addition:

·

the key personnel of the
acquired company may decide not to work for us;

·

we may experience business
disruptions as a result of information technology systems conversions;

·

we may experience
additional financial and accounting challenges and complexities in areas such
as tax planning, treasury management, and financial reporting;

·

we may be held liable for
environmental risks and liabilities as a result of our acquisitions, some of
which we may not have discovered during our due diligence;

·

our ongoing business may be
disrupted or receive insufficient management attention; and


·

we may not be able to
realize the cost savings or other financial benefits we anticipated.

In connection with future
acquisitions, we may assume the liabilities of the companies we acquire. These
liabilities, including liabilities for environmental-related costs, could
materially and adversely affect our business. We may have to incur debt or
issue equity securities to pay for any future acquisition, the issuance of
which could involve the imposition of restrictive covenants or be dilutive to
our existing stockholders.

Our credit facility
imposes certain operating and financial restrictions on us and our subsidiaries
and requires us to meet certain financial tests.

Our credit facility
contains certain operating and financial restrictions that limit or prohibit us
from engaging in certain transactions, including the following:

·

incurring or guarantying
additional debt;

·

paying dividends or other
distributions to our stockholders or redeeming, repurchasing, or retiring our
capital stock or subordinated obligations;

·

making investments and
capital expenditures;

·

creating liens on our
assets;

·

selling, transferring,
leasing, licensing, or otherwise disposing of assets other than in the ordinary
course of business;

·

engaging in transactions
with stockholders and affiliates;

·

engaging in mergers,
consolidations, or acquisitions;

·

engaging in any material
line of business substantially different from, and unrelated to, those lines of
business currently carried on by us; and

·

making changes to our
equity capital structure or amending our certificate of incorporation, bylaws,
or any stockholder rights agreement.

The credit facility also
requires that we satisfy certain financial tests. The failure to comply with
any of these covenants would cause a default under the credit facility. A
default, if not waived, could result in acceleration of our debt, in which case
the debt would become immediately due and payable. If this occurs, we may not
be able to repay our debt or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it. Even if
new financing were available, it may be on terms that are less attractive to us
than our existing credit facility or it may not be on terms that are acceptable
to us.

Our future capital
needs may require that we seek debt financing or additional equity funding
that, if not available, could cause our business to suffer.

We may need to raise additional funds in the future
to, among other things, fund our existing operations, improve or expand our
operations, respond to competitive pressures, or make acquisitions. From time
to time, we may raise additional funds through public or private financing,
strategic alliances, or other arrangements. If adequate funds are not available
on acceptable terms, we may be unable to meet our business or strategic
objectives or compete effectively. If we raise additional funds by issuing
equity securities, stockholders may experience dilution of their ownership
interests, and the newly issued securities may have rights superior to those of
the common stock. If we raise additional funds by issuing debt, we may be
subject to further limitations on our operations. If we fail to raise capital
when needed, our business will be negatively affected.


Our annual and
quarterly performance may fluctuate.

Our revenue, cost
of goods sold, and operating results have fluctuated on a quarterly and annual
basis in the past and can be expected to continue to fluctuate in the future as
a result of a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control. Future
factors that may affect our operating results include, but are not limited to,
the following:

·

fluctuations in the pricing
of new OEM replacement products;

·

the availability and cost
of inventory;

·

variations in vehicle
accident rates;

·

competition in the vehicle
replacement parts industry;

·

changes in state or federal
laws or regulations affecting our business;

·

changes in the types of
replacement parts that insurance carriers will accept in the repair process;

·

our ability to integrate
and manage our acquisitions successfully;

·

fluctuations in fuel
prices;

·

changes in the demand for
our products and the supply of our inventory due to severity of weather and
seasonality of weather patterns;

·

the amount and timing of
operating costs and capital expenditures relating to the maintenance and
expansion of our business, operations, and infrastructure; and

·

declines in the values of
our assets.

Due to the foregoing
factors, our operating results in future periods can be expected to fluctuate.
Accordingly, our results of operations may not be indicative of future
performance. These fluctuations in our operating results may cause our results
to fall below the expectations of public market analysts and investors, which
could cause our stock price to decline.

If we lose our key
management personnel, we may not be able to successfully manage our business or
achieve our objectives.

Our future success depends
in large part upon the leadership and performance of our executive management
team and key employees at the operating level. If we lose the services of one
or more of our executive officers or key employees, or if one or more of them
decides to join a competitor or otherwise compete directly or indirectly with
us, we may not be able to successfully manage our business or achieve our
business objectives. If we lose the services of any of our key employees at the
operating or regional level, we may not be able to replace them with similarly
qualified personnel, which could harm our business.

We rely on
information technology in critical areas of our operations and a disruption
relating to such technology could harm our business.

We use information technology systems owned by other
companies for management of our facilities and our financial functions. In the
event that the providers of these systems terminate their relationships with
us, we could suffer disruptions to our operations.

In addition, we
continually monitor these systems to find areas for improvement. In the event
that we decided to switch providers or to implement our own systems, we may
also suffer disruptions to our business. We may be unsuccessful in the
development of our own systems, and we may underestimate the


costs
and expenses of developing and implementing our own systems. Also, our revenue
may be hampered during the period of implementing an alternative system, which
period could extend longer than we anticipated.

If we experience
problems with our fleet of trucks, our business could be harmed.

We use a fleet of trucks
to deliver the majority of the products we sell. We are subject to the risks
associated with providing trucking services, including inclement weather,
disruptions in the transportation infrastructure, availability and price of fuel,
liabilities arising from accidents to the extent we are not covered by
insurance, and insurance premium increases. In addition, our failure to deliver
products in a timely and accurate manner could harm our reputation and brand,
which could have a material adverse effect on our business.

If we determine
that our goodwill has become impaired, we may incur significant charges to our
pre-tax income.

Goodwill represents the
excess of cost over the fair market value of net assets acquired in business
combinations. In the future, goodwill and intangible assets may increase as a
result of future acquisitions. Goodwill and intangible assets are reviewed at
least annually for impairment. Impairment may result from, among other things,
deterioration in the performance of acquired businesses, adverse market
conditions, and adverse changes in applicable laws or regulations, including
changes that restrict the activities of the acquired business. As of December 31,
2006, our total goodwill, subject to future impairment testing, was
approximately $246.2 million.

Challenges to the
validity of aftermarket products could adversely effect our business.

Original equipment manufacturers have attempted to use
claims of intellectual property infringement against manufacturers and
distributors of aftermarket products to restrict or eliminate the sale of
aftermarket products that are the subject of the claims. The original equipment
manufacturers have brought such claims in federal court and with the United
States International Trade Commission.

In December 2005, Ford Global Technologies, LLC
initiated a complaint with the International Trade Commission against six
companies, including a competitor of ours, Keystone Automotive Industries, Inc.,
alleging that certain aftermarket parts imported into the United States
infringed on 14 design patents held by Ford Global. We were not named in the
complaint, although the outcome would affect all persons and entities who
import or distribute the parts, including us. In December 2006, an administrative
law judge of the International Trade Commission preliminarily ruled that seven
of the Ford Global design patents were valid and that the importation of
automotive parts covered by these seven patents violated Section 337 of
the Tariff Act of 1930. The ruling of the administrative law judge is not final.
It will be reviewed by the International Trade Commission. If the International
Trade Commission agrees with the ruling, it will issue an order prohibiting
further importation of automotive parts covered by the patents. The parties to
the action can appeal the Commission’s final decision to the United States
Circuit Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.

To the extent that the
original equipment manufacturers are successful with intellectual property
infringement claims, we could be restricted or prohibited from selling certain
aftermarket products which could have an adverse effect on our business. If we
are subsequently named as a defendant in any such claims, we would likely incur
significant expenses defending the claims. Even if we are not named in any such
claims, written allegations that we are infringing another party’s intellectual
property rights could involve significant expense to investigate.


Risks Relating to
Our Common Stock

Our executive
officers, directors, and their affiliates hold a large percentage of our stock
and their interests may differ from other stockholders.

As of December 31,
2006, our executive officers, directors, and their affiliates, in the
aggregate, beneficially owned approximately 21% of our common stock. If they were to act together, these
stockholders would have significant influence over most matters requiring
approval by stockholders, including the election of directors, any amendments
to our certificate of incorporation, and certain significant corporate
transactions. These stockholders may take these actions even if they are
opposed by our other stockholders. In addition, without the consent of these
stockholders, we could be delayed or prevented from entering into transactions
that may be viewed as beneficial to us or our other stockholders.

Future sales of our
common stock may depress our stock price.

We and our stockholders
may sell shares of common stock in the future. We may also issue shares of common
stock in connection with the exercise of outstanding options or in connection
with future acquisitions. Certain of our existing stockholders are parties to a
registration rights agreement that provides such holders with the right to
require us to effect the registration of their shares of common stock in
specific circumstances. In addition, if we propose to register any of our
common stock under the Securities Act of 1933, whether for our own account or
otherwise, some existing stockholders may be entitled to include their shares
of common stock in that registration. We cannot predict the size of future
issuances of our common stock or the effect, if any, that future issuances and
sales of shares of our common stock will have on the price of our common stock.
Sales of substantial amounts of common stock (including shares issued in
connection with an acquisition), or the perception that such sales could occur,
may cause the price of our common stock to fall.

Delaware law and
our charter documents may impede or discourage a takeover, which could affect
the price of our stock.

The anti-takeover
provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware law
could, together or separately, impose various impediments to the ability of a
third party to acquire control of us, even if a change in control would be
beneficial to our existing stockholders. Our certificate of incorporation and
bylaws have provisions that could discourage potential takeover attempts and
make attempts by stockholders to change management more difficult. Our
incorporation under Delaware law and these provisions could also impede a
merger, takeover, or other business combination involving us or discourage a
potential acquiror from making a tender offer for our common stock, which,
under certain circumstances, could reduce the price of our common stock.

MANAGEMENT’S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Overview

We provide replacement systems, components, and parts
needed to repair light vehicles (cars and light trucks). Buyers of light
vehicle replacement products have the option to purchase from primarily three
sources: new products produced by original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”),
which are commonly known as OEM products; new products produced by companies
other than the OEMs, which are sometimes referred to as “aftermarket” products;
and recycled products originally produced by OEMs, which we refer to as
recycled OEM products. We participate in the market for recycled OEM products
as well as the market for collision repair aftermarket products. We obtain aftermarket
products and salvage vehicles from a variety of sources, and we dismantle the
salvage vehicles to obtain a comprehensive range of vehicle products that we
distribute into the light vehicle repair market. We recently entered the
business of refurbishing and distributing aluminum alloy wheels, head lamps and
tail lamps. These acquisitions allowed us to expand our product offerings to
our customers. We are not involved in the manufacture of automotive products
and do not maintain any manufacturing or remanufacturing operations.

Our revenue, cost
of goods sold, and operating results have fluctuated on a quarterly and annual
basis in the past and can be expected to continue to fluctuate in the future as
a result of a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control. Factors
that may affect our operating results include, but are not limited to:

·

fluctuations
in the pricing of new OEM replacement products;

·

the
availability and cost of inventory;

·

variations
in vehicle accident rates;

·

competition
in the vehicle replacement parts industry;

·

changes
in state or federal laws or regulations affecting our business;

·

changes
in the types of replacement parts that insurance carriers will accept in the
repair process;

·

our
ability to integrate and manage our acquisitions successfully;

·

fluctuations
in fuel prices;

·

changes
in the demand for our products and the supply of our inventory due to severity
of weather and seasonality of weather patterns;

·

the
amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures relating to the
maintenance and expansion of our business, operations, and infrastructure; and

·

declines
in the value of our assets.

Due to the foregoing
factors, our operating results in future periods can be expected to fluctuate.
Accordingly, our historical results of operations may not be indicative of
future performance.

Acquisitions

Since our inception in 1998 we have pursued a growth
strategy of both organic growth and acquisitions. We have pursued acquisitions
that we believe will help drive profitability, cash flow and stockholder value.
Our principal focus for acquisitions is companies that will expand our
geographic presence and our ability to provide a wider choice of alternative
light vehicle replacement products and services to our customers.


During 2004, we acquired six businesses (five in the
recycled OEM automotive parts business and one in the aftermarket automotive
parts business) for an aggregate of approximately $61.7 million in cash, $2.4 million
in notes issued and 373,396 shares of our common stock. These business
acquisitions enabled us to serve new markets, expand our presence in certain
markets, become a significant provider of aftermarket automotive replacement
parts and become a provider of self-service retail automotive parts. One of the
acquisitions had operations in Guatemala and Costa Rica. The revenue of the
Central American businesses is not material, but we are using these facilities
as a platform to sell certain types of products into Central America from our
U.S. based recycled OEM automotive replacement parts facilities.

During 2005, we acquired eight businesses (four in the
recycled OEM automotive parts business and four in the aftermarket automotive
parts business) for an aggregate of approximately $108.0 million in cash, $6.4
million in notes issued and $9 million contingently payable based on the
achievement of certain future financial results. Certain terms of one of the
contingent payment agreements were modified in 2006 such that $1.0 million was
immediately paid and the maximum remaining amount contingently payable was
reduced to $4.0 million. These business acquisitions enabled us to serve new
markets and expand our presence in existing markets.

During 2006, we acquired ten businesses (one in the
wheel refurbishing and distribution business, two in the aftermarket automotive
parts business and seven in the recycled OEM automotive parts business) for an
aggregate of approximately $71.1 million in cash and $7.2 million in notes
issued. These business acquisitions enabled us to expand our product offerings
to our customers, serve new markets and expand our presence in existing
markets.

In the first quarter of
2007, we acquired two businesses (one in the recycled OEM automotive parts
business and one that refurbishes head lamps and tail lamps). These business
acquisitions enabled us to expand our presence in existing markets, serve new
market areas and expand our product line offering.

Sources of Revenue

Since 2004, our revenue from the sale of light vehicle
replacement products and related services has ranged between 84% and 92% of our
total revenue. We sell the majority of our light vehicle replacement products
to collision repair shops and mechanical repair shops. Our light vehicle
replacement products include, for example, engines, transmissions, front-ends,
doors, trunk lids, bumpers, hoods, fenders, grilles, valances, wheels, head
lamps, and tail lamps. We sell extended warranty contracts for certain
mechanical products. These contracts cover the cost of parts and labor and are
sold for periods of six months, one year, or two years. We defer the revenue
from such contracts and recognize it ratably over the term of the contracts.
The demand for our products and services is influenced by several factors,
including the number of vehicles in operation, the number of miles being
driven, the frequency and severity of vehicle accidents, availability and
pricing of new parts, seasonal weather patterns, and local weather conditions.
Additionally, automobile insurers exert significant influence over collision
repair shops as to how an insured vehicle is repaired and the cost level of the
products used in the repair process. Accordingly, we consider automobile
insurers to be key demand drivers of our products. We provide insurance
companies services that include the review of vehicle repair order estimates,
as well as direct quotation services to their adjusters. There is no standard
price for recycled OEM products, but rather a pricing structure that varies
from day to day based upon such factors as product availability, quality,
demand, new OEM replacement product prices, the age of the vehicle being
repaired, and competitor pricing. The pricing for aftermarket and refurbished
products is determined based on a number of factors, including availability,
quality, demand, new OEM replacement product prices, and competitor pricing.

Since 2004, approximately 8% to 16% of our revenue has
been obtained from other sources. These include bulk sales to mechanical remanufacturers,
scrap sales, and sales of damaged vehicles that we sell to


vehicle repairers. Our
revenue from other sources has increased since 2004 primarily due to higher
scrap sales from our self-service retail and wheel operations and to higher
bulk sales of certain products.

When we obtain mechanical
products from dismantled vehicles and determine they are damaged, or when we
have a surplus of a certain mechanical product type, we sell them in bulk to
mechanical remanufacturers. The majority of these products are sorted by
product type and model type. Examples of such products are engine blocks and
heads, transmissions, starters, alternators, and air conditioner compressors.
After we have recovered all the products we intend to resell, the remaining materials
are crushed and sold to scrap processors.

Cost of Goods Sold

Our cost of goods sold for recycled OEM products
includes the price we pay for the salvage vehicle and, where applicable,
auction, storage, and towing fees. We are facing increased competition in the purchase
of salvage vehicles from shredders and scrap recyclers, internet-based buyers,
and others. Our cost of goods sold also includes labor and other costs we incur
to acquire and dismantle such vehicles. Since 2004, our labor and labor-related
costs related to acquisition and dismantling have accounted for approximately
10% of our cost of goods sold for vehicles we dismantle. The acquisition and
dismantling of salvage vehicles is a manual process and, as a result, energy
costs are not material.

Our cost of goods sold for aftermarket products
includes the price we pay for the parts, freight, and other inventoried costs
such as import fees and duties, where applicable. Our aftermarket products are
acquired from a number of vendors located primarily overseas, with the majority
of our overseas vendors located in Taiwan. Our cost of goods sold for
refurbished wheels includes the price we pay for wheel cores, freight, and
costs to refurbish the wheels, including overhead and depreciation costs.

In the event we do not have a recycled OEM product or
suitable aftermarket product in our inventory, we attempt to purchase the part
from a competitor. We refer to these parts as brokered products. Since 2004,
the revenue from brokered products that we sell to our customers has ranged
from 5% to 8% of our total revenue. The gross margin on brokered product sales
as a percentage of revenue is generally less than half of what we achieve from
sales of our own inventory because we must pay higher prices for these
products.

Some
of our mechanical products are sold with a standard six-month warranty against
defects. We record the estimated warranty costs at the time of sale using
historical warranty claim information to project future warranty claims
activity and related expenses. Our warranty activity during 2005 and 2006 was
as follows (in thousands):

We also sell separately
priced extended warranty contracts for certain mechanical products. The expense
related to extended warranty claims is recognized when the claim is made.


Expenses

Our facility and warehouse expenses primarily include
our costs to operate our processing, redistribution, self-service, and
warehouse facilities. These costs include labor for both plant management and
facility and warehouse personnel, stock-based compensation, facility rent,
property and liability insurance, utilities, and other occupancy costs.

Our distribution expenses primarily include our costs
to deliver our products to our customers. Included in our distribution expense
category are labor costs for drivers, local delivery and transfer truck rentals
and subcontractor costs, vehicle repairs and maintenance, insurance, and fuel.

Our selling and marketing expenses primarily include
our advertising, promotion, and marketing costs; salary and commission expenses
for sales personnel; sales training; telephone and other communication
expenses; and bad debt expense. Since 2004, personnel costs have accounted for
approximately 77% to 81% of our selling and marketing expenses. Most of our
recycled OEM product sales personnel are paid on a commission basis. The number
and quality of our sales force is critical to our ability to respond to our
customers’ needs and increase our sales volume. Our objective is to continually
evaluate our sales force, develop and implement training programs, and utilize
appropriate measurements to assess our selling effectiveness.

Our general and
administrative expenses include primarily the costs of our corporate and
regional offices that provide corporate and field management, treasury,
accounting, legal, payroll, business development, human resources, and
information systems functions. These costs include wages and benefits for
corporate, regional and administrative personnel, stock-based compensation,
long term incentive compensation, accounting, legal and other professional
fees, office supplies, telephone and other communication costs, insurance and
rent.

Seasonality

Our operating results are
subject to quarterly variations based on a variety of factors, influenced
primarily by seasonal changes in weather patterns. During the winter months we
tend to have higher demand for our products because there are more weather
related accidents. In addition, the cost of salvage vehicles tends to be lower
as more weather related accidents occur generating a larger supply of total
loss vehicles.

Critical Accounting
Policies and Estimates

The discussion and
analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon
our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance
with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. The preparation of
these financial statements requires us to make estimates, assumptions, and
judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and
expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an
ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, assumptions, and judgments, including
those related to revenue recognition, warranty costs, inventory valuation,
allowance for doubtful accounts, goodwill impairments, self-insurance programs,
contingencies, asset impairments, stock-based compensation, and taxes. We base
our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we
believe are reasonable under the circumstances. The results of these estimates
form the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of assets and
liabilities and our recognition of revenue. Actual results may differ from
these estimates.


Revenue Recognition

We recognize and report revenue from the sale of light
vehicle replacement products when they are shipped and title has transferred,
subject to a reserve for returns, discounts, and allowances that management
estimates based upon historical information. A replacement product would
ordinarily be returned within a few days of shipment. Our customers may earn
discounts based upon sales volumes or sales volumes coupled with prompt
payment. Allowances are normally given within a few days following product
shipment. We analyze historical returns and allowances activity by comparing
the items to the original invoice amounts and dates. We use this information to
project future returns and allowances on products sold.

We also sell separately priced extended warranty
contracts for certain mechanical products. Revenue from these contracts is
deferred and recognized ratably over the term of the contracts.

Warranty Reserves

We issue a standard
six-month warranty against defects on some of our mechanical products. We
record an accrual for standard warranty claims at the time of sale using
historical warranty claim information to project future warranty claims
activity and related expenses. We analyze historical warranty claim activity by
referencing the claims made and aging them from the original product sale date.
We use this information to project future warranty claims on actual products
sold that are still under warranty at the end of an accounting period. A 10%
increase in our historical 2006 annual warranty claims would result in an
additional annual expense of approximately $0.3 million.

Inventory Accounting

Salvage
Inventory.

Salvage
inventory is recorded at the lower of cost or market. Our salvage inventory
cost is established based upon the price we pay for a vehicle, and includes
buying; dismantling; and, where applicable, auction, storage, and towing fees.
Inventory carrying value is determined using the average cost to sales
percentage at each of our facilities and applying that percentage to the
facility’s inventory at expected selling prices. The average cost to sales
percentage is derived from each facility’s historical vehicle profitability for
salvage vehicles purchased at auction or from contracted rates for salvage
vehicles acquired under direct procurement arrangements.

Aftermarket
and Refurbished Wheel Inventory.

Aftermarket and
refurbished wheel inventory is recorded at the lower of cost or market. Our
aftermarket inventory cost is based on the average price we pay for parts, and
includes expenses incurred for freight and buying, where applicable. For items
purchased from foreign sources, import fees and duties and transportation
insurance are also included. Our refurbished wheel inventory cost is based on
the average price we pay for wheel cores, and includes expenses incurred for
freight, buying and refurbishing overhead.

For all inventory, our
carrying value is reduced regularly to reflect the age and current anticipated
demand for our products. If actual demand differs from our estimates,
additional reductions to our inventory carrying value would be necessary in the
period such determination is made.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

We maintain an allowance
for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers
to make required payments. The allowance for doubtful accounts is based on our
assessment of the collectibility of specific customer accounts, the aging of
the accounts receivable, and our historical experience. Our allowance for
doubtful accounts at December 31, 2006 was approximately
$2.6 million, which represents 5.0% of gross receivables. If actual
defaults are higher than our historical experience, our allowance for doubtful
accounts may be insufficient to cover the uncollectible receivables, which
would


have an
adverse impact on our operating results in the period of occurrence. A 10%
change in the 2006 annual write-off rate would result in a change in the
estimated allowance for doubtful accounts of approximately $0.2 million.

For our light vehicle replacement parts operations, our
exposure to uncollectible accounts receivable is limited because the majority
of our sales are to a large number of small customers that are generally
geographically dispersed. We also have certain customers in our light vehicle
replacement parts operations that pay for products at the time of delivery. The
aluminum smelter and our mechanical core operation sell in larger quantities to
a small number of distributors, foundry customers and remanufacturers. As a
result, our exposure to uncollectible accounts receivable is greater in these
operations. We control credit risk through credit approvals, credit limits, and
monitoring policies.

Goodwill Impairment

We record goodwill as a result of our acquisitions.
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, “Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets,” which we refer to as SFAS 142, requires us to analyze
our goodwill for impairment at least annually. The determination of the value
of goodwill requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect our
consolidated financial statements. In assessing the recoverability of our
goodwill, we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and
other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets. If these
estimates or their related assumptions change in the future, we may be required
to record impairment charges for these assets. We perform goodwill impairment
tests on an annual basis and between annual tests whenever events may indicate that
an impairment exists. In response to changes in industry and market conditions,
we may be required to strategically realign our resources and consider
restructuring, disposing of, or otherwise exiting businesses, which could
result in an impairment of goodwill.

We utilize outside
professionals in the valuation industry to validate our assumptions and overall
methodology used to determine the fair value estimates used in our goodwill
impairment testing. As of December 31, 2006, we had $246.2 million in
goodwill subject to future impairment tests. If we were required to recognize
goodwill impairments in future periods, we would report those impairment losses
as part of our operating results. We determined that no adjustments were
necessary when we performed our annual impairment testing in the fourth
quarters of 2006, 2005 and 2004. A 10% decrease in the fair value estimates
used in the fourth quarter of 2006 impairment test would not have changed this
determination.

Self-Insurance Programs

We self-insure a portion of employee medical benefits
under the terms of our employee health insurance program. We also self-insure a
portion of automobile, general liability, and workers’ compensation claims. We
have purchased stop-loss insurance coverage that limits our exposure to both
individual claims as well as our overall claims. The cost of the stop-loss
insurance is expensed over the contract periods.

We record an accrual for
the claims expense related to our employee medical benefits, automobile,
general liability, and workers’ compensation claims based upon the expected
amount of all such claims. If actual claims are higher than what we
anticipated, our accrual might be insufficient to cover our claims costs, which
would have an adverse impact on our operating results in that period. If we
were to incur claims up to our aggregate stop-loss insurance coverage during
the open policy years, we would have an additional expense of approximately
$13.3 million.

Contingencies

We are subject to the
possibility of various loss contingencies arising in the ordinary course of
business resulting from litigation, claims and other commitments, and from a
variety of environmental and pollution


control
laws and regulations. We consider the likelihood of loss or the incurrence of a
liability, as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss, in
determining loss contingencies. We accrue an estimated loss contingency when it
is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be
reasonably estimated. We determine the amount of reserves, if any, with the
assistance of our outside legal counsel. We regularly evaluate current
information available to us to determine whether the accruals should be
adjusted. If the amount of an actual loss were greater than the amount we have
accrued, the excess loss would have an adverse impact on our operating results
in the period that the loss occurred. If the loss contingency is subsequently
determined to no longer be probable, the amount of loss contingency previously
accrued would be included in our operating results in the period such
determination was made.

Accounting for Income Taxes

All income tax amounts reflect the use of the
liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are
determined based upon the expected future tax consequences of temporary
differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for
financial and income tax reporting purposes. We operate in multiple tax
jurisdictions with different tax rates, and we determine the allocation of
income to each of these jurisdictions based upon various estimates and
assumptions. In the normal course of business we will undergo tax audits by
various tax jurisdictions. Such audits often require an extended period of time
to complete and may result in income tax adjustments if changes to the
allocation are required between jurisdictions with different tax rates.
Although we have recorded all probable income tax contingencies in accordance
with SFAS No. 5, “Accounting for Contingencies” and SFAS No. 109, “Accounting
for Income Taxes,” these accruals represent estimates that are subject to the
inherent uncertainties associated with the tax audit process, and therefore
include contingencies.

We record a provision for
taxes based upon our effective income tax rate. We record a valuation allowance
to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that we expect is more likely
than not to be realized. We consider historical taxable income, expectations,
and risks associated with our estimates of future taxable income and ongoing
tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance. We had
a valuation allowance of $0.9 million, $0.7 million, and
$0.5 million at December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively,
against our deferred tax assets. Should we determine that it is more likely
than not that we would be able to realize all of our deferred tax assets in the
future, an adjustment to the net deferred tax asset would increase income in
the period such determination was made. Conversely, should we determine that it
is more likely than not that we would not be able to realize all of our
deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the net deferred tax assets
would decrease income in the period such determination was made.

Stock-Based Compensation

In December 2004,
the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued SFAS No. 123R, “Share-Based
Payment” (“SFAS 123R”), a revision of SFAS 123. SFAS 123R supersedes Accounting
Principles Board (“APB”) Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees,” and amends SFAS 95, “Statement of Cash Flows.” SFAS 123R requires
us to measure compensation cost for all share-based payments (including
employee stock options) at fair value and to recognize the cost over the vesting
period, and was effective for us on January 1, 2006. In March 2005,
the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) issued Staff Accounting
Bulletin No. 107 (“SAB 107”) regarding the SEC staff position concerning
the application of SFAS 123R, including interpretive guidance. We implemented
the provisions of SFAS 123R and SAB 107 in the first quarter of 2006 using the
modified prospective method,

pursuant to
which prior periods are not restated. Compensation expense for all share-based
payments granted or modified after the effective date is recognized
prospectively based upon the requirements of SFAS 123R and compensation expense
for all unvested share-based payments as of January 1, 2006 that were
issued


subsequent to the filing of our registration statement
for our initial public offering in October 2003 is recognized
prospectively based on the grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with
the original provisions of SFAS 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,”
net of estimated forfeitures. We have elected to recognize compensation expense
for all awards on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of
the award. The impact of adopting SFAS 123R on 2006 results was as follows:

·

A
reduction of income before income taxes by $2.4 million;

·

A reduction of

net income by $1.4 million; and

·

A reduction of diluted
earnings per share by $0.03.

Prior to January 1, 2006, we accounted for our
stock option plans under the intrinsic value method as defined in APB 25 and
related interpretations. Compensation cost was recognized in net income for
options granted under our plans only when the exercise price was less than the
market price of the underlying common stock on the date of grant. For
nonqualified stock options granted under our plans with an exercise price equal
to the market value of the stock on the date of grant, no compensation cost was
recognized in our financial statements. Rather, stock-based compensation
expense was included as a pro forma disclosure in the notes to our financial
statements. Pro forma disclosures of net earnings and earnings per share
continue to be provided for periods prior to January 1, 2006.

For valuing our stock
option awards under SFAS 123R, several key factors and assumptions are required
for use in the valuation models currently utilized. We have been in existence
since early 1998 and have been a public company since October 2003. As a
result, we do not have the historical data necessary to consider using a
lattice valuation model at this time. We have therefore elected to use the
Black-Scholes valuation model, using the guidance in SAB 107 for determining
our expected term and volatility assumptions. For expected term, we have what
SAB 107 defines as “plain-vanilla” stock options, and therefore used a simple
average of the vesting period and the contractual term for options granted in
2006 as permitted by SAB 107. Volatility is a measure of the amount by which
our stock price is expected to fluctuate during the expected term of the
option. For volatility, we considered our own volatility for the limited time
we have been a public company as well as the disclosed volatilities of
companies that are considered comparable to us. Our forfeiture assumption is
based on historical forfeiture rates both pre-IPO and since we have been a
public company. SFAS 123R requires that forfeitures be estimated at the time of
grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures
differ from those estimates. The dividend yield represents the dividend rate
expected to be paid over the option’s expected term, and we currently have no
plans to pay dividends. The risk-free interest rate is based on zero-coupon
U.S. government issues available at the time each option is granted that have a
remaining life approximately equal to the option’s expected life. Key
assumptions used in determining the fair value of stock options granted in 2006
were: expected term of 6.2 years, risk-free interest rate of 4.38%, dividend
yield of 0%, forfeiture rate of 7%, and volatility of 40%.

Recently Issued
Accounting Pronouncements

In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151,
“Inventory Costs, an Amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4” (“SFAS 151”).
SFAS 151 amended ARB 43, Chapter 4, to clarify that abnormal amounts of idle facility
expense, freight, handling costs, and wasted materials (spoilage) must be
recognized as current period charges. It also requires that allocation of fixed
production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity
of the production facilities. SFAS 151 was effective for inventory costs
incurred during fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005. We adopted
SFAS 151 and its adoption did not have an impact on our consolidated financial
position, results of operations, or cash flows.


In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154, “Accounting
Changes and Error Corrections” (“SFAS 154”). SFAS 154 replaced Accounting
Principles Board Opinion No. 20 “Accounting Changes” and SFAS No. 3, “Reporting
Accounting Changes in Interim Financial Statements-An Amendment of APB Opinion No. 28.”
SFAS 154 provides guidance on the accounting for and reporting of accounting
changes and error corrections. SFAS 154 requires “retrospective application” of
the direct effect of a voluntary change in accounting principle to prior
periods’ financial statements where it is practicable to do so. SFAS 154 also
redefines the term “restatement” to mean the correction of an error by revising
previously issued financial statements. SFAS 154 was effective for accounting
changes and error corrections made in fiscal years beginning after December 15,
2005. We adopted SFAS 154 and its adoption did not have an impact on our
consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows, except
to the extent that the statement subsequently requires retrospective
application of a future item.

In July 2006, the FASB issued Financial
Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes” (“FIN
48”). FIN 48 provides guidance on the measurement, recognition, and disclosure
of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FIN 48 provides
that a tax position should only be recognized if it is more likely than not
that the position will be sustained upon examination by the appropriate taxing
authority. This interpretation also provides guidance on derecognition,
classification, interest and penalties, transition and disclosure. The
cumulative effect of applying the provisions of FIN 48 will be reported as an
adjustment of beginning retained earnings in the period of adoption, and will
be effective for our fiscal year beginning January 1, 2007. We are
currently assessing the impact of FIN 48 on our consolidated financial
position, results of operations, and cash flows.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157,
“Fair Value Measurements” (“SFAS 157”). SFAS 157 defines fair value,
establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about
fair value measurements. SFAS 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after
November 15, 2007. We are currently assessing the impact of SFAS 157 on
our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.

In September 2006, the SEC released Staff
Accounting Bulletin No. 108, “Considering the Effects of Prior Year
Misstatements When Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial
Statements” (“SAB 108”). SAB 108 provides interpretive guidance on how
public companies quantify financial statement misstatements, including
misstatements that were not material to prior years’ financial statements. SAB
108 was effective for our fiscal year ending December 31, 2006, and the
adoption of SAB 108 did not have an impact on our consolidated financial
position, results of operations, or cash flows.

In February 2007, the FASB
issued SFAS No. 159, “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
Liabilities” (“SFAS 159”). SFAS 159 permits entities to choose to measure many
financial instruments and certain other items at fair value, and amends SFAS
No. 115, “Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities.”
SFAS 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007.
We are currently assessing the impact of SFAS 159 on our consolidated financial
position, results of operations, and cash flows.

Segment Reporting

Over 99% of our operations
are conducted in the U.S. During 2004, we acquired a recycled OEM products
business with locations in Guatemala and Costa Rica. Revenue generated and
properties located outside of the U.S. are not material. We manage our operations
geographically. Our light vehicle replacement products operations are organized
into ten operating segments, eight for recycled OEM products, one for
aftermarket products and one for refurbished wheels. These segments are
aggregated into one reportable segment because they possess similar economic
characteristics and have common


products
and services, customers, and methods of distribution. Our light vehicle
replacement products operations account for over 90% of our revenue, earnings,
and assets.

Year Ended December 31,
2006 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2005

Revenue.

Our revenue increased 44.2%,
from $547.4 million in 2005 to $789.4 million in 2006. The increase
in revenue was primarily due to the higher volume of products we sold and
business acquisitions. Organic revenue growth was approximately 11.6% in 2006.
We continued to expand our services to the insured repair industry and added
local delivery routes and transfer routes that helped us to increase our market
penetration. We have also continued to integrate the sale and distribution of
our aftermarket and wheel product offerings with recycled parts in more
locations in order to provide a wider selection of products to our customers.
Business acquisitions completed in 2006 and the full year impact of our 2005
acquisitions accounted for approximately $178.4 million of incremental
revenue for the year.

Cost of Goods Sold.

Our cost of goods sold
increased 49.0%, from $289.8 million in 2005 to $431.8 million in
2006. As a percentage of revenue, cost of goods sold increased from 52.9% to
54.7%. The increase in cost of goods sold was primarily due to increased volume
of products sold.

Our cost of goods sold percentage
increase was due primarily to our acquisition of Transwheel Corporation. We
were required to write-up the value of Transwheel’s finished goods and work in
process inventories for refurbished wheels in accordance with SFAS 141. In
addition, Transwheel’s aluminum smelter that is used to economically dispose of
wheels that cannot be refurbished operates at a low gross margin. This smelter
had revenue of $28.2 million at a gross margin of 7.1% in 2006. Without these
two items related to Transwheel, our cost of goods sold percentage would have
increased from 52.9% in 2005 to 53.3% in 2006.

Gross Margin.

Our gross margin increased
38.8%, from $257.6 million in 2005 to $357.5 million in 2006. Our
gross margin increased primarily due to increased volume. As a percentage of
revenue, gross margin decreased from 47.1% to 45.3%. Our gross margin as a
percentage of revenue decreased due primarily to the factors noted above in

Cost of Goods Sold

.

Facility and Warehouse
Expenses.

Facility
and warehouse expenses increased 43.6%, from $60.1 million in 2005 to
$86.3 million in 2006. Our acquisitions accounted for $20.6 million
of the increase. Our remaining facility and warehouse expenses increased
primarily due to $3.3 million in higher wages and fringe benefits resulting
from increased headcount and stock option expenses (which we were first
required


to expense in 2006)
for field personnel. The balance of the increase primarily related to higher
insurance reserves and legal claims experience, repairs and maintenance and
utilities expenses. As a percentage of revenue, facility and warehouse expenses
decreased from 11.0% to 10.9%.

Distribution Expenses.

Distribution expenses
increased 30.3%, from $61.5 million in 2005 to $80.1 million in 2006.
Our acquisitions accounted for $12.7 million of the increase. Our
remaining distribution expenses increased as we operated approximately 6% more
daily transfer routes between our salvage facilities due to the increase in
parts volume. In addition, higher wages primarily from an increase in the
number of employees, increased fuel costs, truck rentals and repairs, delivery
supplies, and contracted salvage transfer services accounted for the remaining
growth in distribution expenses. Fuel prices increased approximately 12.8% in
2006 compared to 2005. While fuel costs accounted for approximately $1.4
million of the increase in distribution expenses, they represented only 1.7% of
our consolidated revenue. As a percentage of revenue, our distribution expenses
decreased from 11.2% to 10.1%.

Selling, General, and
Administrative Expenses.

Selling, general, and administrative expenses increased
37.2%, from $74.5 million in 2005 to $102.2 million in 2006. Our
acquisitions accounted for $18.3 million of the increase. The majority of
the remaining expense increase was a result of an increase in labor and labor-related
expenses of $3.8 million due primarily to higher sales commission expenses and
increased headcount, $1.8 million for the expensing of stock options that began
for the first time in 2006, and $1.8 million related to our new 2006 long
term incentive plan, $0.5 million for higher insurance and legal claims
experience, and higher sales promotion, professional fees, credit card
processing fees, and data, telephone and e-commerce expenses. Our selling
expenses tend to rise as revenue increases due to our commissioned sales
forces. As a percentage of revenue our selling, general, and administrative
expenses decreased from 13.6% to 12.9%.

Depreciation and
Amortization.

Depreciation
and amortization increased 37.9%, from $8.6 million in 2005 to
$11.8 million in 2006. Our acquisitions accounted for $2.2 million of
the increase in depreciation and amortization. As a percentage of revenue,
depreciation and amortization decreased from 1.6% in 2005 to 1.5% in 2006.

Operating Income.

Operating income increased 45.8%
from $52.9 million in 2005 to $77.2 million in 2006. As a percentage of
revenue, operating income increased from 9.7% to 9.8%. We incurred stock option
expense that totaled $2.4 million in 2006. In addition, our cost of goods sold
in 2006 was higher due to our Transwheel acquisition as we noted above in

Cost of Goods Sold

. Without the effect of
these items, our operating income as a percentage of revenue would have improved
to 10.3% in 2006 compared to 9.7% in 2005.

Other (Income) Expense.

Net other expense increased 245.3%
from $1.3 million in 2005 to $4.3 million in 2006. Net interest expense
increased 208.8% to $5.8 million in 2006 from $1.9 million in 2005. Our average
bank borrowings increased approximately $39.2 million during 2006 as compared
to 2005, due primarily to acquisitions. In addition, our average effective
interest rate on our bank debt also increased in 2006. Other income increased
to $1.5 million in 2006 from $0.6 million in 2005. Included in other income in
2006 is a gain of $0.7 million on the sale of equity securities compared to
$0.3 million in 2005. As a percentage of revenue, net other expense increased
from 0.2% in 2005 to 0.6% in 2006.

Provision for Income Taxes.

The provision for income taxes
increased 36.7%, from 20.8 million in 2005 to $28.4 million in 2006, due
primarily to improved operating results. Our effective tax rate was 39.0% in
2006 and 40.2% in 2005. The decrease in the effective tax rate was due
primarily to the reversal in the third quarter of 2006 of $0.7 million of
accrued income tax liabilities no longer deemed necessary with the statutory
closing of certain tax years. Without the third quarter reversals, the
effective tax rate would have been 40.0%. In addition, state tax adjustments
were recorded in the second quarter of 2005 that increased the effective tax
rate in 2005.


Year Ended December 31, 2005 Compared to Year
Ended December 31, 2004

Revenue.

Our revenue increased 28.9%,
from $424.8 million in 2004 to $547.4 million in 2005. The increase
in revenue was primarily due to the higher volume of products we sold and
business acquisitions. Organic revenue growth was approximately 12.2% in 2005.
We continued to expand our services to the insured repair industry and added
local delivery routes and transfer routes that helped us to increase our market
penetration. We have also continued to integrate our aftermarket and recycled
parts inventories in more locations in order to provide a wider selection of
products to our customers. Business acquisitions completed in 2005 and the full
year impact of our 2004 acquisitions accounted for approximately
$70.6 million of incremental revenue for the year.

Cost
of Goods Sold.

Our
cost of goods sold increased 27.6%, from $227.1 million in 2004 to
$289.8 million in 2005. As a percentage of revenue, cost of goods sold
decreased from 53.5% to 52.9%. The increase in cost of goods sold was primarily
due to increased volume of products sold. The decrease in cost of goods sold
percentage was due primarily to improved pricing and availability of wholesale
salvage vehicles, coupled with improved procurement and inventory management.

Gross
Margin.

Our
gross margin increased 30.4%, from $197.6 million in 2004 to
$257.6 million in 2005. Our gross margin increased primarily due to
increased volume. As a percentage of revenue, gross margin increased from 46.5%
to 47.1%. Our gross margin as a percentage of revenue increased due primarily
to the factors noted above in

Cost of Goods
Sold

.

Facility
and Warehouse Expenses.

Facility and warehouse expenses increased 25.7%, from
$47.8 million in 2004 to $60.1 million in 2005. Our acquisitions
accounted for $9.1 million of the increase. Our remaining facility and
warehouse expenses increased primarily due to higher wages resulting from
increased headcount and incentive compensation expense for field personnel, and
higher repairs and maintenance and supplies expenses. As a percentage of
revenue, facility and warehouse expenses decreased from 11.3% to 11.0%.

Distribution
Expenses.

Distribution
expenses increased 28.3%, from $47.9 million in 2004 to $61.5 million
in 2005. Our acquisitions accounted for $7.2 million of the increase. Our
remaining distribution expenses increased as we operated approximately 8% more
daily transfer routes between our salvage facilities due to the increase in
parts volume. For the year ended December 31, 2005, we increased the
amount of product we moved between our facilities by approximately 24%, the
majority of which was on our own transfer trucks. In addition, higher wages,
primarily from an increase in the number of employees, increased fuel costs,
auto insurance, truck rentals and repairs, delivery supplies, and contracted
salvage transfer services, partially offset by lower freight costs, accounted for
the remaining growth in distribution expenses. Fuel prices increased
approximately 33% in 2005 compared to 2004. While fuel costs accounted for
approximately $2.3 million of the increase in distribution expenses, they
represented only 1.7% of our consolidated revenue. We renegotiated our freight
rates with substantially all of our common carriers in the fourth quarter of
2004, and we directed our sales force to recoup more of our shipping and
handling costs. As a percentage of revenue, our distribution expenses decreased
from 11.3% to 11.2%.

Selling,
General, and Administrative Expenses.

Selling, general, and
administrative expenses increased 24.0%, from $60.1 million in 2004 to
$74.5 million in 2005. Our acquisitions accounted for $8.0 million of
the increase. The majority of the remaining expense increase was a result of an
increase in labor and labor-related expenses of $3.3 million due
primarily to increased headcount, increased incentive compensation expense of
$1.1 million, higher insurance and legal claims experience of $0.9 million, and
higher sales promotion, bad debts, telephone and e-commerce expenses, partially
offset by lower costs associated with being a public company. Our selling
expenses tend to rise as revenue increases due to our commissioned sales
forces. We incurred approximately $2.5 million in costs related to being a
public company in 2005 compared to $2.8 million in 2004. The cost
reductions were primarily from lower


premiums for directors’
and officers’ liability insurance, and lower accounting and legal fees. As a
percentage of revenue our selling, general, and administrative expenses
decreased from 14.1% to 13.6%.

Depreciation
and Amortization.

Depreciation
and amortization increased 24.8%, from $6.9 million in 2004 to
$8.6 million in 2005. Our acquisitions accounted for $1.0 million of
the increase in depreciation and amortization. As a percentage of revenue,
depreciation and amortization was 1.6% in 2005 and 2004.

Operating
Income.

Operating
income increased 51.7%, from $34.9 million in 2004 to $52.9 million
in 2005. As a percentage of revenue, operating income increased from 8.2% to
9.7%.

Other
(Income) Expense.

Net
other expense increased 19.9%, from $1.1 million in 2004 to
$1.3 million in 2005. Net interest expense increased 25.3% to
$1.9 million in 2005 from $1.5 million in 2004. Interest expense was
related primarily to debt incurred to fund acquisitions. The increase in net
interest expense was due to both higher average debt levels and higher interest
rates in 2005. In addition, included in interest expense in 2004 was
$0.3 million in debt issuance costs that were written off. These costs
were attributable to our previous secured bank credit facility that was
terminated in February 2004. See “Liquidity and Capital Resources” below
for further discussion of changes in our bank credit facilities. Included in
other income in 2005 was approximately $0.3 million in gain on the sale of
investment securities. Included in other income in 2004 are approximately
$0.4 million of proceeds from a corporate owned life insurance policy. We
use corporate owned life insurance policies to fund our obligations under our
nonqualified deferred compensation plan. As a percentage of revenue, net other
expense was 0.2% in 2005 and 2004.

Provision for Income
Taxes.

The
provision for income taxes increased 56.6%, from $13.3 million in 2004 to
$20.8 million in 2005 due primarily to improved operating results. Our
effective tax rate was 40.2% in 2005 and 39.2% in 2004. The increase in our
effective income tax rate in 2005 was due primarily to the receipt of
nontaxable life insurance proceeds of approximately $0.4 million in the
fourth quarter of 2004.

Liquidity and Capital
Resources

Our primary sources of ongoing liquidity are cash flow
from our operations and our credit facility. At December 31, 2006, we had
cash and equivalents amounting to $4.0 million, and we had
$86.0 million outstanding under our $135 million unsecured bank
credit facility. We generated $52.4 million in cash flow from operating
activities in 2006 and, based on our current plans, we expect to generate
positive cash flow from operating activities for 2007. We believe that cash
flow from operating activities and availability under our credit facility will
be adequate to fund our short term liquidity needs. Under an accordion option
feature in our bank agreement, we can increase the total credit facility to
$150 million, subject to the approval of our bank group. In addition, with a
senior debt to EBITDA ratio of approximately 1.1 at the end of 2006, we believe
we would be able to further increase our debt capacity significantly if needed.

Our liquidity needs are primarily to fund working
capital requirements and expand our facilities and network. The procurement of
inventory is the largest operating use of our funds. We normally pay for
salvage vehicles acquired at salvage auctions and under some direct procurement
arrangements at the time that we take possession of the vehicles. We normally
pay for aftermarket parts purchases at the time of shipment or on standard
payment terms, depending on the manufacturer and payment options offered. Wheel
cores acquired from third parties are normally paid on standard payment terms.
We acquired approximately 84,600, 97,600, and 111,400 wholesale salvage
vehicles in 2004, 2005, and 2006, respectively. In addition, we acquired
approximately 27,700, 55,800 and 138,700 salvage vehicles for our self-service
retail operations in 2004, 2005 and 2006, respectively. Our purchases of
aftermarket parts and wheels totaled approximately $23.4 million, $46.0
million and $94.5 million in 2004, 2005 and 2006, respectively.


We completed the sale of 6.4 million shares of our
common stock at a price of $14.50 per share in a public offering in October 2005.
This resulted in approximately $87.9 million of cash proceeds to us, net of
underwriting discounts and commissions and expenses of the offering. In
connection with the offering, certain members of management exercised stock
options to purchase 600,000 shares of our common stock, resulting in
approximately $2.1 million of proceeds to us. We used all of the proceeds from
the offering and the option exercises to pay down our then outstanding bank
debt and invested the remaining proceeds in short term cash equivalents until
we used them for general corporate purposes, which included three acquisitions
completed by the end of 2005. We have since used the remaining proceeds for
business acquisitions during 2006.

We intend to continue to evaluate markets for
potential growth through the internal development of redistribution centers,
processing facilities, and warehouses, through further integration of
aftermarket, refurbished and recycled OEM product facilities, and through
selected business acquisitions. Our future liquidity and capital requirements
will depend upon numerous factors, including the costs and timing of our
internal development efforts and the success of those efforts, the costs and
timing of expansion of our sales and marketing activities, and the costs and
timing of future business acquisitions.

Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $52.4
million in 2006, compared to $37.5 million in 2005. Cash was provided by net
income adjusted for non-cash items. Working capital uses of cash included
increases in receivables, inventory, prepaid expenses and other assets, and a
decrease in accounts payable, partially offset by increases in accrued
liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities. Receivables increased due to our
increased sales volume, partially offset by repayments of employee relocation
loans and other receivables. Inventory increased to support our increased
volume and to expand the geographic availability of aftermarket and wheel
products to a number of locations. Accounts payable decreased due primarily to the
timing of payments. Accruals increased primarily due to increases in
self-insurance and legal claims reserves, and interest and property tax
accruals. Other noncurrent liabilities increased primarily due to liabilities
of $1.8 million associated with the new long term incentive plan and increases
of $1.0 million in employee deferred compensation liabilities.

Net cash used in investing activities totaled $110.7
million in 2006, compared to $126.0 million in 2005. We invested $73.5 million
of cash for acquisitions in 2006 compared to $103.8 million in 2005. We repaid
$2.6 million from escrow liabilities in 2006 compared to receiving $2.6 million
deposited in 2005, all related to a 2004 acquisition. Net property and
equipment purchases increased $10.5 million in 2006, due primarily to land
acquisitions and facility expansions.

Net cash provided by financing activities totaled
$59.1 million in 2006, compared to $90.0 million in 2005. Exercises of stock
options and warrants totaled $6.3 million in 2006 and $11.8 million in 2005.
Included in 2005 net cash from financing activities is $87.9 million from
the sale of 6.4 million shares of common stock in a public offering. In
addition, we had net borrowings of $48.0 million under our credit facility in
2006, compared to net repayments of $9.0 million in 2005. Repayments of
long-term debt obligations increased $1.9 million in 2006. The excess tax
benefit from share-based payment arrangements provided $7.1 million of cash in
2006 and is shown in cash flow from financing activities in accordance with
SFAS 123R. These tax benefits for periods prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R
were included in cash flow from operating activities and totaled $6.2 million
in 2005.

Net cash provided by operating activities totaled
$37.5 million in 2005, compared to $25.9 million in 2004. Cash was
provided by net income adjusted for non-cash items. Working capital uses of
cash included increases in receivables and inventory, and decreases in accounts
payable, partially offset by increases in escrow liabilities, accruals and
income taxes payable. Receivables increased due to our increased sales volume,
partially offset by repayments of employee relocation loans and other
receivables. Inventory increased to support our increased volume and to add
aftermarket products to some of our wholesale


recycled salvage
locations. Accounts payable decreased as we accelerated payments to certain
foreign vendors in order to realize improved pricing on certain aftermarket
product purchases. Escrow liabilities increased as a result of the deposit in
escrow with us of $2.6 million in cash as collateral in connection with an
acquisition by us. Accrued liabilities increased primarily due to the timing of
wage payments, higher incentive compensation accruals, and higher
self-insurance reserves for workers’ compensation and auto liability claims.
Income taxes payable increased primarily due to higher levels of taxable
income.

Net cash used in investing activities totaled
$126.0 million in 2005, compared to $87.8 million in 2004. We
invested $103.8 million of cash in eight acquisitions in 2005 compared to
$61.6 million in six acquisitions in 2004. We received $2.6 million in
proceeds from the escrow deposit. We also realized $0.7 million in
increased proceeds from the sale of property and equipment and $0.4 million
from the sale of investment securities in 2005.

Net cash provided by financing activities totaled
$90.0 million in 2005, compared to $47.5 million in 2004. Included in
2005 net cash from financing activities is $87.9 million from the sale of
6.4 million shares of common stock in a public offering. Exercises of stock
options and warrants totaled $11.8 million in 2005 and $4.9 million in
2004. In addition, we had net repayments of $9.0 million under our credit
facility in 2005, compared to net borrowings of $47.0 million in 2004.
Repayments of long-term debt obligations decreased $3.9 million in 2005.

On February 17, 2004, we entered into a new
unsecured revolving credit facility that was originally scheduled to mature in February 2007,
replacing a secured credit facility that would have expired on June 30,
2005. The new credit facility initially had a maximum availability of
$75.0 million, which was amended to $100 million on January 31,
2005. On June 1, 2005, the agreement was further amended to increase the
maximum availability to $135 million, extend the maturity date to June 1,
2010, and modify certain other terms. In order to make any borrowing under the
credit facility, after giving effect to any such borrowing, we must be in
compliance with all of the covenants under the credit facility, including,
without limitation, a senior debt to EBITDA ratio, which cannot exceed 3.00 to
1.00. The credit facility contains customary covenants, including, among other
things, limitations on payment of cash dividends, restrictions on our payment
of other dividends and on purchases, redemptions, and acquisitions of our
stock, limitations on additional indebtedness, certain limitations on
acquisitions, mergers, and consolidations, and the maintenance of certain
financial ratios. We were in compliance with all covenants throughout all of
2006 and 2005. The interest rate on advances under the credit facility may be,
at our option, either the bank prime lending rate, on the one hand, or the
Interbank Offering Rate (IBOR) plus an additional percentage ranging from .875%
to 1.625%, on the other hand. The percentage added to IBOR is dependent upon
our total funded debt to EBITDA ratio for the trailing four quarters.

We may in the future borrow additional amounts under
our credit facility or enter into new or additional borrowing arrangements. We
anticipate that any proceeds from such new or additional borrowing arrangements
will be used for general corporate purposes, including to develop and acquire
businesses and redistribution facilities; to further the integration of our
aftermarket, wheel refurbishing and recycled OEM product facilities; to expand
and improve existing facilities; to purchase property, equipment, and
inventory; and for working capital.

As part of the consideration for business acquisitions
completed during 2006, we issued promissory notes totaling approximately $7.2
million. The notes bear interest at annual rates of 3.5% to 5.0%, and interest
is payable at maturity.

As part of the consideration for business acquisitions
completed during 2005, we issued promissory notes totaling approximately $6.4
million. The notes bear interest at annual rates of 3.0% to 3.5%, and interest
is payable at maturity. We also assumed certain liabilities in connection with
a business acquisition,


which included a
promissory note with a remaining principal balance of $0.2 million. The annual
interest rate on that note is 5.1%.

We estimate that our capital expenditures for 2007,
excluding business acquisitions, will be between $45.0 and $50.0 million.
We expect to use these funds for several major facility expansions, improvement
of current facilities, real estate acquisitions and systems development
projects. We anticipate that net cash provided by operating activities for 2007
will be in excess of $55.0 million.

We believe that our current
cash and equivalents, cash provided by operating activities and funds available
under our credit facility will be sufficient to meet our current operating and
capital requirements. However, we may, from time to time, raise additional
funds through public or private financing, strategic relationships, or other
arrangements. There can be no assurance that additional funding, or refinancing
of our credit facility, if needed, will be available on terms attractive to us,
or at all. Furthermore, any additional equity financing may be dilutive to
stockholders, and debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive
covenants. Our failure to raise capital if and when needed could have a
material adverse impact on our business, operating results, and financial condition.

Off-Balance Sheet
Arrangements and Future Commitments

We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements,
investments in special purpose entities or undisclosed borrowings or debt that
would be required to be disclosed pursuant to Item 303 of Regulation S-K
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Additionally, we have not entered
into any derivative contracts nor do we have any synthetic leases.

Our long-term debt under contractual obligations above
includes interest on the balance outstanding under our variable rate credit
facility as of December 31, 2006. The $86.0 million outstanding at December 31,
2006 was assumed to remain unpaid until the facility matures on June 1,
2010, and interest was computed at the average effective rate of 6.52% at December 31,
2006.

The interest rate on
advances under the credit facility (our primary debt outstanding) may be, at
our option, either the bank prime lending rate, on the one hand, or the
Interbank Offering Rate (IBOR) plus an additional percentage ranging from .875%
to 1.625%, on the other hand. The percentage added to IBOR is dependent upon
our total funded debt to EBITDA ratio (as defined) for the trailing four
quarters.


ITEM 7A.

QUANTITATIVE
AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Our results of operations are exposed to changes in
interest rates primarily with respect to borrowings under our credit facility,
where interest rates are tied to either the prime rate or IBOR. As of December 31,
2006, we had $86.0 million outstanding under our credit facility. We do
not, as a matter of policy, enter into derivative contracts for trading or
speculative purposes. Based upon our variable rate debt at December 31,
2006, a hypothetical 1% increase in interest rates would result in an annual
increase in interest expense of approximately $0.9 million.

The Company is also exposed to currency fluctuations
with respect to the purchase of aftermarket parts in Taiwan. While all
transactions with manufacturers based in Taiwan are conducted in U.S. dollars,
changes in the relationship between the U.S. dollar and the New Taiwan dollar
might impact the purchase price of aftermarket parts. We might not be able to
pass on any price increases to customers. Under our present policies, we do not
attempt to hedge this currency exchange rate exposure.

Our investment in our Central American operations is
not material, and we do not attempt to hedge our foreign currency risk related
to such operations.

REPORT OF
INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of LKQ
Corporation:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance
sheets of LKQ Corporation and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of
December 31, 2006 and 2005, and the related consolidated statements of
income, of stockholders’ equity and other comprehensive income, and of cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2006.
Our audits also included the financial statement schedule included in Item 15
in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2006. These financial statements and financial statement
schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on the financial statements and financial statement
schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of LKQ
Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December 31, 2006, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our
opinion, such financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the
basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in
all material respects, the information set forth therein.

As discussed in Note 1, effective January 1,
2006, the Company changed its method of accounting for stock-based compensation
upon adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123(R),

Share-Based Payment

.

We have also audited, in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States), the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on the criteria
established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
and our report dated February 28, 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion on
management’s assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control
over financial reporting and an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

LKQ CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Note 1. Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies

Company Overview

LKQ Corporation, a
Delaware corporation, believes it is the largest nationwide provider of
recycled light vehicle original equipment manufacturer (“OEM”) products and
related services and the second largest nationwide provider of aftermarket
collision replacement products and refurbished wheels. LKQ Corporation operates
over 100 facilities offering its customers a broad range of replacement
systems, components, and parts to repair light vehicles.

Principles of
Consolidation

The accompanying
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of LKQ Corporation and
its subsidiaries (the, “Company”). All intercompany transactions and accounts
have been eliminated.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of
financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Per Share Amounts

All per share amounts and
the number of shares for all periods have been retroactively adjusted to
reflect the two-for-one stock split declared on December 15, 2005. See
Note 2 for further discussion.

Revenue Recognition

The majority of the
Company’s revenue is derived from the sale of recycled OEM products and
aftermarket products. Revenue is recognized when the products are shipped and
title has transferred, subject to a reserve for estimated returns, discounts
and allowances that management estimates based upon historical information. The
Company has recorded a reserve for estimated returns, discounts and allowances
of approximately $4.0 million and $3.1 million at December 31, 2006 and
2005, respectively. Revenue from the sale of separately-priced extended
warranty contracts is reported as Deferred revenue and recognized ratably over
the term of the contracts.

Shipping &
Handling

Revenue also includes
amounts billed to customers related to shipping and handling of approximately
$8.8 million, $7.6 million and $5.9 million during the years ended December 31,
2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Distribution expenses in the accompanying
consolidated statements of income are the costs incurred to prepare and deliver
products to customers.

Cash and
Equivalents

The Company considers all
highly liquid investments with original maturities of 90 days or less to be
cash equivalents. Cash equivalents are carried at cost, which approximates
market value.


LKQ CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 1.
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

(Continued)

Restricted Cash

In connection with a
business acquisition on January 31, 2005, the Company held approximately
$0.6 million in restricted cash. During the year ended December 31,
2005, the amount of cash restricted was reduced by $0.1 million. During June 2006,
the remaining restrictions were removed.

Receivables

The Company has recorded a
reserve for uncollectible accounts of approximately $2.6 million and $2.1
million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The reserve is based
upon management’s assessment of the collectibility of specific customer accounts,
the aging of the accounts receivable and historical experience. Receivables
include travel advances and relocation loans to employees of approximately $0.1
million and $0.2 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Concentrations of
Credit Risk

Financial instruments that
potentially subject the Company to significant concentration of credit risk
consist primarily of cash and equivalents and accounts receivable. The majority
of cash and equivalents are maintained with several major financial
institutions. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable
are limited because a large number of geographically diverse customers make up
the Company’s customer base. The Company controls credit risk through credit
approvals, credit limits, and monitoring procedures.

Inventory

A salvage product is a recycled vehicle part suitable
for sale as a replacement part. A core is a recycled mechanical part that is
not suitable for sale as a replacement part without further remanufacturing
work. Salvage inventory and cores are recorded at the lower of cost or market.
Cost is established based upon the price the Company pays for a vehicle, and
includes average costs for buying, dismantling, and where applicable, auction
fees and storage, and towing. Inventory carrying value is determined using the
average cost to sales percentage at each of the Company’s facilities and
applying that percentage to the facility’s inventory at expected selling
prices. The average cost to sales percentage is derived from each facility’s
historical vehicle profitability for salvage vehicles purchased at auction or
from contracted rates for salvage vehicles acquired under certain direct
procurement arrangements.

An aftermarket product is a new vehicle product
manufactured by a company other than the OEM. Cost is established based upon
the average price for purchased parts, and includes expenses incurred for
freight and buying, where applicable. For items purchased from foreign
companies, import fees and duties and transportation insurance are also
included. Refurbished wheel inventory cost is based upon the average price paid
for wheel cores, and also includes expenses incurred for freight, buying and
refurbishing overhead. Aftermarket products and refurbished wheels inventory is
recorded at the lower of cost or market.

For all inventory, carrying value is reduced regularly
to reflect the age of the inventory and current anticipated demand. If actual
demand differs from management estimates, additional reductions to inventory
carrying value would be necessary in the period such determination is made.

depreciation are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss
thereon is recognized. Construction in progress consists primarily of building and
land improvements at existing Company facilities. Depreciation is calculated
using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives or, in the case
of leasehold improvements, the term of the related lease, including renewal
periods, if shorter. Other estimated useful lives are as follows:

net assets acquired), covenants not to compete and trademarks.


LKQ CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 1.
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful
lives should not be amortized but instead should be tested for impairment at
least annually. The Company has performed annual impairment tests during the
fourth quarter of 2006, 2005 and 2004. The results of these tests indicated
that goodwill was not impaired.

The
changes in the carrying amount of goodwill are as follows (in thousands):

totaled approximately $0.2 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005,
respectively. Accumulated amortization of other intangible assets at December 31,
2006 and 2005 was approximately $0.1 million. Amortization expense was
approximately $20,000, $19,000 and $8,000 during the years ended December 31,
2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Covenants not to compete are amortized over
the lives of the respective agreements on a straight-line basis. Estimated annual
amortization expense for the years ended December 31, 2007 through 2009 is
approximately $20,000,  for the year
ended December 31, 2010 is approximately $3,000, and for the year ended December 31,
2011 is approximately $2,000.

Impairment of
Long-Lived Assets

Long-lived assets are
reviewed for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that
the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. If such review
indicates that the carrying amount of long-lived assets is not recoverable, the
carrying amount of such assets is reduced to fair value. There were no
adjustments to the carrying value of long-lived assets during the years ended December 31,
2006, 2005 or 2004.

Investments

The Company holds common
shares of Keystone Automotive Industries, Inc., which are classified as an
available-for-sale investment security under Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards (“SFAS”) No. 115, “Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt
and Equity Securities” (“SFAS 115”). Accordingly, the investment is included in
Other Assets at its fair value of approximately $2.2 million and $2.7 million
at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, with the unrealized gain
excluded from earnings and included in Accumulated other comprehensive income,
net of applicable taxes. The fair value of this investment at December 31,
2006 and 2005 was estimated based upon the quoted market price for these
securities. The Company has sold a portion of its investment and included the
realized gains of $0.7 million and $0.3 million in Other (income) expense for
the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.


LKQ CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 1.
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

Fair Value of
Financial Instruments

SFAS No. 107, “Disclosures
About Fair Value of Financial Instruments,” requires disclosure of the fair
value of certain financial instruments. The Company’s financial instruments,
excluding the available-for-sale securities discussed above, include cash and
equivalents, trade receivables, accounts payable, debt and, through August 2004,
an interest rate swap. The carrying amounts of financial instruments
approximate fair value.

Escrow Liability

In February 2004, in
connection with a business acquisition, the Company issued 168,690 shares of
its common stock, which were to be held in escrow for a period of two years as
collateral for the accuracy of certain representations and warranties. The
terms of the agreement granted the shareholders the option to sell any or all
of these shares during the escrow period, provided that all proceeds from such
sale were delivered to the Company. In September 2005, the shareholders
sold all such shares held in escrow and delivered $2.6 million to the Company. In
February 2006, the seller’s representation and warranty provisions were
resolved, and the escrowed funds plus accrued interest at an annual rate of 3%
were returned to the sellers.

Accrued Expenses

The Company has entered into certain arrangements
whereby salvage vehicles are obtained directly from major insurance companies
and automotive manufacturers at a cost calculated as a percentage of the
revenue generated from each vehicle. Accrued expenses include an estimated
liability of approximately $1.4 million and $2.5 million at December 31,
2006 and 2005, respectively, for salvage inventory procured under such
arrangements.

The Company self-insures for a portion of employee
medical benefits under the terms of its employee health insurance program. The
Company has purchased stop-loss insurance coverage in order to limit its
exposure to employee medical benefit claims. Other accrued expenses include an
estimated liability of approximately $1.1 million and $1.5 million at December 31,
2006 and 2005, respectively, for expenses incurred but not yet paid under the
program.

The Company also
self-insures for a portion of general liability and workers compensation claims
under the terms of its current insurance program, which began on April 1,
2002. On April 1, 2003, the Company began self-insuring for a portion of
automobile claims. The Company has purchased stop-loss insurance coverage in
order to limit its exposure to automobile, general liability and workers
compensation claims. Other accrued expenses include an estimated liability of
approximately $7.4 million and $5.4 million, net of claims deposits of
$1.0 million and $0.7 million, at December 31, 2006 and 2005,
respectively, for expenses incurred but not yet paid under the program. If the
Company were to incur claims up to its aggregate stop-loss insurance coverage
during the open policy years, it would have an additional expense of
approximately $13.3 million.

Product Warranties

The Company generally warrants certain mechanical
parts against defects for a period of six months. Based on historical warranty
claims, the Company accrues the estimated costs of the warranty coverage at the
time of sale.

Income Taxes

The Company accounts for
income taxes in accordance with SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income
Taxes.”  Accordingly, deferred income
taxes have been provided to show the effect of temporary differences between
the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the
financial statements. A valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets
if it is more likely than not that these items will either expire before the
Company is able to realize their benefit, or that future deductibility is
uncertain. Income taxes provided during interim periods are based upon the
Company’s anticipated annual effective income tax rate.

Other Noncurrent
Liabilities

Other Noncurrent Liabilities include approximately
$4.1 million and $2.8 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively,
related to employee deferred compensation plans as discussed in Note 5 and
approximately $1.8 million at December 31, 2006 related to a long term
incentive plan for certain key employees as discussed in Note 12.

Other Noncurrent
Liabilities also include approximately $0.8 million and $1.0 million at December 31,
2006 and 2005, respectively, related to unasserted claims that are deemed
probable of assertion. In the event the unasserted claims are asserted and
resolved for amounts different than those accrued, or are determined to no longer
be probable in future periods, the amounts so determined would be adjusted to
income in the periods such determination is made. During the years ended December 31,
2006 and 2005, approximately $0.1 million and $0.5 million, respectively, was
recognized in income due to the favorable resolution of certain unasserted
claims.

Depreciation
Expense

Included in Cost of Goods
Sold is depreciation expense associated with certain wheel refurbishing and
smelting operations.


LKQ CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

Stock-Based
Compensation

On January 1, 2006, the Company adopted the
provisions of SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), “Share-Based Payment” (“SFAS
123R”), requiring it to recognize expense related to the fair value of its
share-based compensation awards (see Note 3). The Company elected to use

the modified prospective transition method,
pursuant to which prior periods are not restated. Compensation expense for all
share-based payments granted or modified after the effective date is recognized
prospectively based upon the requirements of SFAS 123R and compensation expense
for all unvested share-based payments as of January 1, 2006 that were
issued subsequent to the filing of the registration statement for the Company’s
initial public offering in October 2003 is recognized prospectively based
on the grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with the original
provisions of SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation” (“SFAS
123”), net of estimated forfeitures.

When estimating forfeitures, the
Company considers voluntary and involuntary termination behavior as well as
analysis of its historical option forfeitures.

The Company has elected to recognize compensation expense on a
straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award.

Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R, the Company
accounted for its stock compensation arrangements under the provisions of SFAS
123, as amended by SFAS 148, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation—Transition
and Disclosures” (“SFAS 148”), which allowed the application of existing
accounting rules under Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25,
“Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees” (“APB 25”). Under APB 25, the
Company recognized compensation expense based on an award’s intrinsic value,
the difference between the exercise price of the option and the fair market
value of the underlying common stock at the time the options were granted. For
nonqualified stock options granted with an exercise price equal to the market
value of the stock on the date of grant, no compensation cost was recognized.
As required by SFAS 148 prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R, the Company
provided pro forma net income and pro forma earnings per share disclosures for
stock-based awards, as if the fair value-based method defined in SFAS 123 had
been applied.

The
following table sets forth the $2.4 million ($1.4 million, net of tax)
stock-based compensation expense resulting from stock options included in our
Consolidated Statement of Income (in thousands):

As a result of adopting SFAS 123R on January 1,
2006, the Company’s net income for the three month and twelve month periods
ended December 31, 2006 was $0.6 million and $1.4 million lower,
respectively, than if it had continued to account for stock-based compensation
under APB 25. If the Company had not adopted SFAS 123R, basic earnings per
share for the three month and twelve month periods ended December 31, 2006
would have been $0.20 and $0.87 as compared to $0.19 and $0.84, respectively,
and diluted earnings per share for the three month and twelve month periods
ended December 31, 2006 would have been $0.19 and $0.82 as compared to
$0.18 and $0.80, respectively.


LKQ CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 1.
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

The Company has not
capitalized any stock-based compensation cost during the year ended December 31,
2006. As of  December 31, 2006, a
total of $5.6 million in unrecognized compensation expense related to
outstanding stock options is expected to be recognized as follows:


$

2.0 million


1.4 million


1.2 million

The
fair value of stock options has been estimated using the Black-Scholes
option-pricing model. The following table summarizes the assumptions used to
compute the weighted average fair value of stock option grants:

Expected life—The expected life represents the period
that the Company’s stock-based awards are expected to be outstanding.  Due to the limited information available
regarding historical exercise experience, the Company has elected to use the
simplified expected term method as permitted by the Securities and Exchange
Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107 (“SAB 107”).

Risk-free interest rate—The Company bases the risk
free interest rate used in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model on the
implied yield currently available on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with the
same or substantially equivalent remaining term.

Expected volatility—The Company uses the trading
history and historical volatility of its common stock, and because of limited
historical data available on the price of its own publicly traded shares, the
volatility of similar entities whose share prices are publicly available, in
determining an estimated volatility factor for the Black-Scholes option-pricing
model.

Expected dividend yield—The Company has not declared
and has no plans to declare dividends and has therefore used a zero value for
the expected dividend yield in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.

Estimated forfeitures—When estimating forfeitures, the
Company considers voluntary and involuntary termination behavior as well as
analysis of its historical forfeitures. A forfeiture rate of 7.0% has been used
for valuing employee option grants, while a forfeiture rate of 0% has been used
for valuing director option grants.

Prior to the adoption of
SFAS 123R, the Company included all tax benefits associated with share-based
compensation as operating cash flows in the Statement of Cash Flows. SFAS 123R
requires any reduction in taxes payable resulting from tax deductions that
exceed the recognized compensation expense (excess tax benefits) to be
classified as financing cash flows. The Company has included $7.1 million of
excess tax benefits in its cash flows from financing activities for the year
ended December 31, 2006. During the years ended December 31, 2005 and
2004, excess tax benefits of $6.2 million and $1.1 million were included in net
cash provided by operating activities, respectively.

Rental Expense

The Company recognizes
rental expense on a straight-line basis over the respective lease terms for all
of its operating leases.

Earnings per Share

Basic earnings per share
are computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding
during the period. Diluted earnings per share incorporate the incremental
shares issuable upon the assumed exercise of stock options and warrants. Certain
of the Company’s stock options were excluded from the calculation of diluted
earnings per share because they were antidilutive, but these options could be
dilutive in the future.

Segment Information

Over 99% of the Company’s
operations are conducted in the United States. During 2004, the Company
acquired a recycled OEM products business with locations in Guatemala and Costa
Rica. Revenue generated and properties located outside of the United States are
not material. The Company manages its operations geographically. The Company’s
light vehicle replacement products operations are


LKQ CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

organized
into ten operating segments, eight for recycled OEM products, one for
aftermarket products, and one for refurbished wheels. These segments are
aggregated into one reportable segment because they possess similar economic
characteristics and have common products and services, customers and methods of
distribution. The light vehicle replacement products operations account for
over 90% of the Company’s revenue, earnings and assets.

Foreign Currency Translation

For the Company’s foreign
operations, the local currency is the functional currency. Assets and
liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars at the period-ending exchange
rate. Statement of Income amounts are translated to U.S. dollars using average
exchange rates during the period. Translation gains and losses are reported as
a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income in Stockholders’ Equity.
Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are included in current
earnings.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In November 2004, the
Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued SFAS No. 151, “Inventory
Costs, an amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4” (“SFAS 151”). SFAS 151
amends Accounting Research Bulletin No. 43, Chapter 4, to clarify that
abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs and wasted
materials (spoilage) should be recognized as current-period charges. In
addition, SFAS 151 requires that allocation of fixed production overhead to
inventory be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities. SFAS
151 was effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning
after June 15, 2005. The Company has adopted SFAS 151 and its adoption did
not have an impact on the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of
operations, or cash flows.

In May 2005, the FASB
issued SFAS No. 154, “Accounting Changes and Error Corrections” (“SFAS 154”).
SFAS 154 replaces Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 20 “Accounting
Changes” and SFAS No. 3, “Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim
Financial Statements-An Amendment of APB Opinion No. 28.” SFAS 154
provides guidance on the accounting for and reporting of accounting changes and
error corrections. SFAS 154 requires “retrospective application” of the direct
effect of a voluntary change in accounting principle to prior periods’
financial statements where it is practicable to do so. SFAS 154 also redefines
the term “restatement” to mean the correction of an error by revising
previously issued financial statements. SFAS 154 was effective for accounting
changes and error corrections made in fiscal years beginning after December 15,
2005 unless adopted early. The Company has adopted SFAS 154 and its adoption
did not have an impact on the Company’s consolidated financial position,
results of operations, or cash flows, except to the extent that the statement
subsequently requires retrospective application of a future item.

In July 2006, the FASB issued Financial
Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes” (“FIN
48”). FIN 48 provides guidance on the measurement, recognition, and disclosure
of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and requires
that a tax position should only be recognized if it is more-likely-than-not
that the position will be sustained upon examination by the appropriate taxing
authority. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification,
interest and penalties, transition and disclosure. The cumulative effect of
applying the provisions of FIN 48 will be reported as an adjustment to
beginning retained earnings in the period of adoption. FIN 48 will be effective
for the Company’s fiscal year beginning January 1, 2007. The Company is
currently assessing the impact of FIN 48 on the Company’s consolidated
financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.

Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS
No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements” (“SFAS 157”). SFAS 157 defines fair
value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands
disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS 157 is effective for fiscal
years beginning after November 15, 2007. The Company is currently
assessing the impact of SFAS 157 on the Company’s consolidated financial
position, results of operations, and cash flows.

In September 2006, the SEC released Staff
Accounting Bulletin No. 108, “Considering the Effects of Prior Year
Misstatements When Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial
Statements” (“SAB 108”). SAB 108 provides interpretive guidance on how
public companies quantify financial statement misstatements, including
misstatements that were not material to prior years’ financial statements. As
required, the Company adopted SAB 108 on December 31, 2006 and its
adoption did not have an  impact on the
Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash
flows.

In February 2007, the FASB
issued SFAS No. 159, “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
Liabilities” (“SFAS 159”). SFAS 159 permits entities to choose to measure many
financial instruments and certain other items at fair value, and amends SFAS
No. 115, “Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities.”
SFAS 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007.
The Company is currently assessing the impact of SFAS 159 on the Company’s
consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.

Note 2. Capital Structure

On March 31, 1999, in connection with a business
acquisition, the Company issued warrants to purchase 200,000 shares of its
common stock at $7.50 per share, with exercisability contingent upon the
achievement of certain operating results in 2000. These results were achieved
and the warrants became exercisable on March 31, 2001. These warrants were
to expire five years after they became exercisable. In accordance with the
antidilution provisions of the warrant agreement, the total number of warrants
issued and the exercise price at December 31, 2003 were adjusted to
227,502 and $6.59 per share. In June 2005, the warrants were exercised
utilizing a cashless exercise feature as provided in the original agreement. As
a result, the Company issued 116,362 shares of its common stock upon the
exercise of the warrants. The 111,140 shares retained by the Company were
retired.

The Company issued warrants on January 3, 2000 to
purchase 300,000 shares of its common stock at exercise prices ranging from
$7.50 to $17.50 per share, in connection with a business acquisition completed
in 1999. The warrants were valued at $144,500 at the date of grant. In August 2004,
warrants to purchase 100,000 shares of the Company’s common stock at a price of
$7.50 per share were exercised. Warrants to purchase 200,000 shares of the
Company’s common stock at prices ranging from $12.50 to $17.50 expired on August 31,
2004.

On February 14, 2001, the Company issued warrants
to purchase 3,922,224 shares of its common stock at an exercise price of $1.00
per share to certain stockholder guarantors. The Company had breached certain
covenants of its credit facility including covenants relating to operating
income and the minimum required ratio of funded debt to earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. The Company entered into an
amendment to the credit agreement with its banks that waived the breaches and
modified certain of the covenants. As part of the amendment, the banks required
that stockholders guaranty $10 million of the debt, with the guaranties secured
by letters of credit or other highly liquid

collateral acceptable to
the banks. All the Company’s stockholders were given the opportunity to
participate in this transaction and thirty of the Company’s stockholders
provided the guaranties. In exchange for providing the guaranties, each guarantor
received certain rights, including a guaranty fee. The guaranty fee consisted
of each guarantor’s pro rata portion of warrants to purchase a total of
3,922,224 shares of the Company’s common stock (10% of the then outstanding
shares of common stock assuming exercise of these warrants) at an exercise
price of $1.00 per share. The warrants became exercisable upon issuance and
were to expire on February 14, 2006. All such warrants were exercised
prior to the expiration date. The warrants were valued at approximately
$401,000 at the date of grant. Warrants to purchase 785,072, 1,763,986 and
1,005,636 shares of the Company’s common stock at a price of $1.00 per share
were exercised during the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004,
respectively. The stockholder guaranties were cancelled in June 2002 when
the Company entered into a new credit facility.

On January 1, 2003, in connection with a business
acquisition, the Company issued 100,000 shares of its common stock. The Company
granted a put option on those shares with a single exercise date of January 1,
2007 at a price of $7.50 per share and obtained a call option on those shares
with a single exercise date of January 1, 2007 at a price of $11.25 per
share. The Company exercised the call option in 2007 and retired the shares.
These shares are reflected as Redeemable Common Stock in the consolidated
balance sheet as of December 31, 2006 and 2005.

On February 20, 2004, in connection with a
business acquisition, the Company issued 168,690 shares of its common stock. The
purchase agreement contained a provision that if the average market price of
the Company’s common stock on the five business days immediately preceding the
first anniversary of such acquisition was below $8.00 per share, the Company
would make an additional payment per share (in cash or in common stock, at the
Company’s option) equal to $8.00 minus the average closing price over such five
day period. The actual average closing price of the Company’s common stock on
the five business days immediately preceding the first anniversary of the
acquisition exceeded $8.00 per share, and no additional payment was required.

On October 4, 2005, the Company completed the
sale of 6,435,000 shares of its common stock pursuant to a registration
statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Pursuant to the
same registration statement, the selling shareholders named in the registration
statement sold 1,500,000 shares of the Company’s common stock. The Company
received $88.6 million, net of underwriting discount and before offering
related expenses of approximately $744,000, for the common stock it issued and
sold. The Company did not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares by the
selling shareholders. The Company also received approximately $2.1 million in
proceeds from the exercise of 600,000 stock options by certain members of
management in connection with the offering.

On December 15, 2005,
the Company’s Board of Directors approved a two-for-one split of the Company’s
common stock payable as a stock dividend. Each Stockholder of record at the
close of business on January 3, 2006 received an additional share of
common stock for every outstanding share held. The payment date was January 13,
2006, and the common stock began trading on a split-adjusted basis on January 17,
2006.

Note 3. Equity Incentive
Plans

In February 1998, the Company adopted the Equity
Incentive Plan to attract and retain employees and consultants. Under the
Equity Incentive Plan, both qualified and nonqualified stock options, stock

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

(Continued)

appreciation rights,
restricted stock, performance shares and performance units may be granted. On March 6,
2002, the Company’s stockholders approved an increase in the number of shares
available under the Equity Incentive Plan from 6.0 million to 10.0 million,
subject to antidilution and other adjustment provisions. On May 9, 2005,
the Company’s stockholders approved an increase in the number of shares
available under the Equity Incentive Plan from 10.0 million to 14.0 million,
subject to antidilution and other adjustment provisions.

In November 1998, the Company also adopted the
CEO Plan. The terms of the CEO Plan were substantially the same as the terms of
the Equity Incentive Plan except that the exercise price of options granted
under the CEO Plan could be less than the fair market value of the Company’s
common stock on the date the option is granted. During 1998, the Company
granted 350,000 options under the CEO Plan with an exercise price of $5.00 per
share at a time when the fair value of the Company’s stock was $6.25 per share.
The difference between the fair market value and the option exercise price was
recorded as deferred compensation expense and was charged to operations over
the vesting period of the options, which ended in November 2003. There are
no additional shares available for award under the CEO Plan.

In June 2003, the Company’s Board of Directors
adopted the Director Plan and in September 2003, the plan was approved by
the Company’s stockholders. Options granted under the Director Plan are
automatic and nondiscretionary, and the exercise price of the options is 100%
of the fair market value of the Company’s stock on the grant date. Only
non-employee directors are eligible for grants under the Director Plan. Under
the plan, each non-employee director received an initial grant of an option to
purchase 60,000 shares of common stock as of October 2, 2003. The plan
also provides for an initial grant to a new non-employee director of an option
to purchase 60,000 shares of common stock upon election to the board of
directors. Subsequent to the initial grants, each non-employee director will be
automatically granted an option to purchase 20,000 shares of common stock on
each anniversary of the granting of the initial stock option to that
non-employee director. The Director Plan will terminate in June 2013,
unless the board of directors terminates it sooner. The number of shares
available under the Director Plan is 1,000,000, subject to antidilution and
other adjustment provisions.

At December 31, 2006, a total of 6,955,149
options with an average exercise price of $8.11 and a weighted average
remaining contractual life of 6.1 years were expected to vest. The total grant-date
fair value of options that vested during the years ended December 31,
2006, 2005, and 2004 was approximately $2.4 million, $8.2 million,
and $5.1 million, respectively.

The aggregate
intrinsic value (market value of stock less option exercise price) of
outstanding, expected to vest and exercisable stock options at December 31,
2006 is $103.8 million, $103.5 million and $87.4 million, respectively. The
aggregate intrinsic value represents the total pre-tax intrinsic value, based

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 3. Equity Incentive Plans
(Continued)

on the Company’s closing
stock price on December 29, 2006, which would have been received by the
option holders had all option holders exercised their options as of that date.
This amount changes based upon the fair market value of the Company’s common
stock. The total intrinsic value of stock options exercised was $18.5 million,
$16.5 million and $3.0 million during the years ended December 31, 2006,
2005 and 2004, respectively.

At December 31, 2005 and 2004, options to
purchase 5,758,375 and 5,022,940 shares of common stock were exercisable
pursuant to the Company’s stock-based compensation plans with a
weighted-average exercise price of $6.89 and $5.98, respectively.

Stock options expire 10
years from the date they are granted. Most of the options granted under the
Equity Incentive Plan and the CEO Plan vest over a period of five years.
Options granted under the Director Plan vest six months after the date of
grant. The Company expects to issue new shares of common stock to cover future
stock option exercises.

On December 27, 2004,
the Company’s Board of Directors amended the award of 400,000 options granted
to its Chairman on January 29, 2004 under the Equity Incentive Plan,
accelerating the vesting schedule to make all unvested shares subject to the
options immediately exercisable. The Company has recognized compensation
expense of approximately $0.2 million during the year ended December 31,
2004 in connection with this amendment. The Board of Directors decided to
accelerate the vesting schedule of these options in order to conform the
vesting to grants normally made under the Director Plan. In addition, the Board
of Directors decided it was in the best interests of stockholders to accelerate
these options as the Company avoided compensation expense in future periods
that would otherwise result from the effectiveness of SFAS 123R for periods
beginning subsequent to December 31, 2005.

On January 7, 2005,
the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the Compensation Committee to make
the 2005 annual grant of stock options to employees (the “2005 Options”). On January 14,
2005, the Compensation Committee granted options to purchase a total of 844,000
shares of LKQ common stock with an exercise price of $8.84 per share. The
vesting schedule for each of the 2005 Options is as follows: June 14, 2005
with respect to 50% of the number of shares subject to such option and, with
respect to an additional 5.555% of the number of shares subject to such option,
January 14, 2006 and each six month anniversary thereafter until January 14,
2010. This vesting schedule is different than the typical vesting schedule for
options granted under the Equity Incentive Plan.

On January 10, 2005,
the Compensation Committee amended the vesting schedule of a total of 857,000
options granted to employees in 2004 under the Equity Incentive Plan,
accelerating the vesting schedule to make all unvested shares subject to the
options exercisable on January 10, 2005. The Compensation Committee
decided to accelerate the vesting schedule of these options primarily as a supplement
to compensation due to the expected reduction of cash bonuses to employees for
the 2004 calendar year. The bonus formula established by the Company in January 2004
resulted in reduced 2004 bonuses for many LKQ employees as compared to 2003. In
addition, the Compensation Committee decided it was in the best interests of
stockholders to accelerate these options as the Company avoided compensation
expense in future periods that would otherwise result from the effectiveness of
SFAS 123R for periods beginning subsequent to December 31, 2005.

On January 28, 2005, the Company’s Board of
Directors granted options to employees to purchase a total of 600,000 shares of
LKQ common stock at an exercise price of $8.33 per share. The options were


LKQ CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 3. Equity Incentive Plans
(Continued)

immediately
exercisable with respect to all of the shares subject to the options. This
vesting schedule is different than the typical vesting schedule for options
granted under the Equity Incentive Plan.

On March 3, 2005, the
Company’s Board of Directors authorized the submission to the Company’s
stockholders of an amendment to the Equity Incentive Plan to increase the
shares reserved for issuance under the plan from 10,000,000 to 14,000,000. The
amendment was approved by the Company’s stockholders on May 9, 2005.

On January 13, 2006, the Company’s Board of
Directors granted options to employees to purchase a total of  461,600 shares of LKQ common stock at an
exercise price of $19.51 per share. The options vest over a period of five
years.

On January 12, 2007,
the Company’s Board of Directors granted options to employees to purchase a
total of  482,500 shares of LKQ common
stock at an exercise price of $20.12 per share. The options vest over a period
of five years.

Note 4. Related
Party Transactions

The Company subleased its corporate office space from
an entity owned by one of its principal stockholders for a pro rata percentage
of the rent that was charged to that entity. The sublease expired on July 31,
2004. The total amounts paid to this entity were approximately $0.2 million
during the year ended December 31, 2004. Beginning in August 2004,
the Company subleased a portion of its corporate office space to an entity
owned by one of its principal stockholders for a pro rata percentage of the
rent that the Company is charged. The total amounts received from this entity
were approximately $33,900 during the five month period ended December 31,
2004 and $70,000 and $49,000 during the years ended December 31, 2006 and
2005, respectively.

A corporation owned by the Company’s Chairman of the
Board, who is one of the Company’s principal stockholders, owns private
aircraft that the Company uses from time to time for business trips. The
Company reimburses this corporation for out-of-pocket and other related flight
expenses, as well as for other direct expenses incurred. The total amounts paid
to this corporation were approximately $6,400, $122,000 and $54,700 during each
of the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

In connection with the acquisitions of several
businesses, the Company entered into agreements with several sellers of those
businesses, who became stockholders as a result of those acquisitions, for the
lease of certain properties used in its operations. Typical lease terms include
an initial term of five years, with three five-year renewal options and
purchase options at various times throughout the lease periods. The Company
also maintains the right of first refusal concerning the sale of the leased
property. Lease payments to a principal stockholder who became an officer of
the Company after the acquisition of his business were approximately $0.8
million during each of the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004,
respectively.

The Company believes that
the related party transactions described above are comparable to those
available from unaffiliated third parties.

5. Retirement
Plans

The Company sponsors the LKQ Corporation Employees’
Retirement Plan (the “Plan”), a qualified defined contribution plan covering
substantially all full time employees not covered by qualified plans maintained
by subsidiaries. Employees may contribute up to 15% of eligible compensation,
subject to certain Internal Revenue Service limitations. The Company will match
50% of the portion of the employee’s contributions that does not exceed 6% of
the employee’s salary. Matching Company contributions vest over a four year
period and totaled approximately $1.7 million, $1.4 million and $1.2 million
in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The Company may also, at its sole
discretion, make annual profit-sharing contributions to the Plan. There were no
such discretionary profit sharing contributions to the Plan in 2006, 2005 or
2004. All contribution levels may be subject to further limits, under Internal
Revenue Service guidelines.

Two of the companies acquired by the Company during
2004, Foster Auto Parts, Inc. and Global Trade Alliance, Inc. (see
Note 9), also maintained qualified defined contribution plans covering
substantially all of their full time employees. 
The plan maintained by Foster Auto Parts, Inc. was merged into the
LKQ Corporation Employees’ Retirement Plan during 2005. Bodymaster Auto Parts
Inc. and Mid-State Aftermarket Auto Parts, Inc., which were acquired by
the Company in 2005 (see Note 9), also maintained qualified defined
contribution plans covering substantially all of their full time employees. The
plan maintained by Mid-State Aftermarket Auto Parts, Inc. was merged into
the Global Trade Alliance, Inc. Retirement Plan during 2006. Expenses
related to these plans totaled approximately $0.3 million and $0.2 million
during 2006 and 2005, respectively.

The Company also offers a nonqualified deferred
compensation plan to eligible employees who, due to Internal Revenue Service
guidelines, may not take full advantage of the LKQ Corporation Employees’
Retirement Plan. The plan allows participants to defer up to 50% of eligible
compensation, with a maximum deferral of $50,000 per year. The Company will
match 50% of the portion of the employee’s contributions that does not exceed
6% of the employee’s salary. The deferred compensation, together with Company
matching contributions and accumulated earnings, is accrued and is payable
after retirement or termination of employment, subject to vesting provisions.
Participants may also elect to receive amounts deferred in a given year on any
plan anniversary five or more years subsequent to the year of deferral.
Matching Company contributions vest over a four year period and totaled
$50,000, $13,000 and $5,000 in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, net of
allowable transfers into the LKQ Corporation Employee’s Retirement Plan. The
deferred compensation plan is funded under a trust agreement whereby the
Company pays to the trust amounts deferred by employees, together with the
Company match, with such amounts invested in life insurance policies carried to
meet the obligations under the deferred compensation plan. The cash surrender
value of these policies was approximately $3.7 million and $2.8 million at
December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, and is included in Other Assets
in the accompanying balance sheets. Total deferred compensation liabilities
were approximately $3.8 million and $2.7 million at December 31, 2006 and
2005, respectively, and are included in Accrued payroll-related liabilities and
Other Noncurrent Liabilities in the accompanying balance sheets.

A subsidiary of the
Company has a nonqualified retirement plan that the Company agreed to continue
when the subsidiary was acquired in 1998. The plan is funded by the Company
through premium payments on Company-owned life insurance policies that are
carried to meet the obligations under the plan. The cash surrender value of
these policies was approximately $0.2 million at December 31, 2006 and
2005 and is included in Other Assets in the accompanying balance sheets. The
annual expense for this plan is


LKQ CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

approximately
$30,000. Total obligations were approximately $0.4 million at December 31,
2006 and 2005, and are included in Other Noncurrent Liabilities in the
accompanying balance sheets.

On February 17, 2004, the Company entered into a
new unsecured revolving credit facility that originally was scheduled to mature
in February 2007, replacing a secured credit facility that would have
expired on June 30, 2005. As a result, the Company recorded a loss of
approximately $0.3 million in 2004 from the write-off of debt issuance costs
related to the previous secured facility. The new revolving credit facility
initially had a maximum availability of $75 million, which was amended to $100
million on January 31, 2005. On June 1, 2005, the agreement was
further amended to increase the maximum availability to $135 million, extend
the maturity date to June 1, 2010 and modify certain other terms. In order
to make any borrowing under the revolving credit facility, after giving effect
to such borrowing, the Company must be in compliance with all of the covenants
under the credit facility, including without limitation a senior debt to EBITDA
ratio which cannot exceed 3.00 to 1.00. The revolving credit facility contains
customary covenants, including, among other things, limitations on the payment
of cash dividends; restrictions on the payment of other dividends, and on
purchases, redemptions and acquisitions of the Company’s stock; limitations on
additional indebtedness; certain limitations on acquisitions, mergers and
consolidations; and the maintenance of certain financial ratios. The interest
rate on advances under the revolving credit facility may be either the bank
prime lending rate, on the one hand, or the Interbank Offering Rate (“IBOR”)
plus an additional percentage ranging from .875% to 1.625%, on the other hand,
at the Company’s option. The percentage added to IBOR is dependent upon the
Company’s total funded debt to EBITDA ratio for the trailing four quarters. The
Company was in compliance with all covenants throughout 2006, 2005 and 2004.
The weighted-average interest rate on borrowings outstanding against the


LKQ CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Company’s credit facility
at December 31, 2006 and 2005 was 6.52% and 7.25%, respectively.
Borrowings against the credit facility totaled $86.0 million and $38.0 million
at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, and are classified as
long-term obligations.

The $38.0 million
balance outstanding at December 31, 2005 was converted to an IBOR-based
loan at a rate of 5.42% on January 4, 2006.

During August 2002, the Company entered into a
two-year interest rate swap agreement with a total notional amount of $10.0
million and a fixed rate of 2.65%. The agreement matured in August 2004.
The counterparty to the agreement was a member of the Company’s bank group.
Under the terms of the agreement, the Company was required to make quarterly
payments at the specified fixed rate and in return received payments at
variable rates. In accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 133, “Accounting
for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,” as amended, the changes in
the fair value of the interest rate swap were included in current period
earnings, as the agreement had not been designated as a hedging instrument.

As part of the consideration for business acquisitions
completed during 2005, the Company issued promissory notes totaling
approximately $6.4 million. The notes bear interest at annual rates of 3.0% to
3.5%, and interest is payable at maturity. The Company also assumed certain
liabilities in connection with a business acquisition during the second quarter
of 2005, including a promissory note with a remaining principle balance of
approximately $0.2 million. The annual interest rate on the note, which was
retired during 2006, was 5.1%.

As part of the
consideration for business acquisitions completed during 2006, the Company
issued promissory notes totaling approximately $7.2 million. The notes bear
interest at annual rates of 3.5% to 5.0%, and interest is payable at maturity.

Note 7. Commitments and
Contingencies

The Company is obligated under noncancelable operating
leases for corporate office space, warehouse and distribution facilities,
trucks and certain equipment.

The future minimum lease
commitments under these leases at December 31, 2006 are as follows (in thousands):

Rental expense for operating leases was approximately

2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

The Company guaranties the residual values of the
majority of its truck and equipment operating leases. The residual values
decline over the lease terms to a defined percentage of original cost. In the
event the lessor does not realize the residual value when a piece of equipment
is sold, the Company would be responsible for a portion of the shortfall.
Similarly, if the lessor realizes more than the residual value


LKQ CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 7.
Commitments and Contingencies

(Continued)

when a piece of equipment
is sold, the Company would be paid the amount realized over the residual value.
Had the Company terminated all of its operating leases subject to these
guaranties at December 31, 2006, the guarantied residual value would have
totaled approximately $10.1 million.

The Company also has
certain other contingent liabilities resulting from litigation, claims and other
commitments and is subject to a variety of environmental and pollution control
laws and regulations incident to the ordinary course of business. Management
believes that the probable resolution of such contingencies will not materially
affect the financial position, results of operations or cash flows of the
Company.

Note 9. Business
Combinations

During 2006, the Company acquired a 100% equity
interest in each of ten businesses (seven in the recycled OEM automotive parts
business, two in the aftermarket automotive parts business and, on January 31,
2006, Transwheel Corporation, an aluminum alloy wheel refurbishing and
distribution business) for an aggregate of $71.1 million in cash, of which $0.1
million is to be paid subsequent to December 31, 2006, and $7.2 million in
notes issued to the sellers (see Note 6). The acquisitions enabled the Company
to serve new market areas and become a significant provider of refurbished
wheels.


LKQ CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 9.
Business Combinations

(Continued)

During 2005, the Company acquired a 100% equity interest
in each of eight businesses (four in the aftermarket products business,
including on December 29, 2005 Fit-Rite Body Parts, Inc. (“Fit-Rite”))
for an aggregate of $108.0 million in cash, of which $1.7 million is to be paid
subsequent to December 31, 2006, approximately $6.4 million in notes
issued to the sellers (see Note 6). In addition, in connection with the
Fit-Rite acquisition, the Company was obligated to pay up to $9.0 million of
contingent payments based upon the achievement of certain financial results
over the thirty months following the closing of the acquisition. Certain terms
of one of the contingent payment agreements were modified in 2006 such that
$1.0 million was immediately paid and the maximum remaining amount contingently
payable was reduced to $4.0 million. The acquisitions enabled the Company to
serve new market areas and expand its presence in existing areas.

During 2004, the Company acquired a 100% equity
interest in each of six businesses (five in the recycled OEM products business,
including on October 26, 2004 Foster Auto Parts, Inc., and, on February 20,
2004, Global Trade Alliance, Inc., one of the largest suppliers of
aftermarket products in the Midwest) for an aggregate of $61.7 million in cash,
of which $50,000 was to be paid subsequent to December 31, 2004,
approximately $2.4 million in notes issued to the sellers and 373,396 shares of
the Company’s common stock. The acquisitions enabled the Company to serve new
market areas, become a significant provider of aftermarket products and become
a provider of self-service retail recycled vehicle products.

The acquisitions are being accounted for under the
purchase method of accounting and are included in the Company’s financial
statements from the dates of acquisition. The purchase prices were allocated to
the net assets acquired based upon estimated fair market values at the dates of
acquisition. In connection with the 2006 business acquisitions, the purchase
price allocations are preliminary as the Company is in the process of determining
the following:  1) whether any operations
acquired will be closed or combined with existing operations; 2) valuation
amounts for certain of its inventories acquired; and 3) the final estimation of
the tax basis of the entities acquired. During the year ended December 31,
2006, the Company made adjustments to the preliminary purchase price
allocations to finalize the inventory valuations and the estimated tax basis
for certain of the businesses acquired in 2005. The Company also recorded a
liability and made additional payments for additional consideration earned
based upon the achievement of certain financial results in 2006. These
adjustments increased goodwill related to these 2005 acquisitions by $4.5 million.

Note 12. Long Term
Incentive Plan

In 2006, the Compensation
Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors and the Company’s stockholders
approved the LKQ Corporation Long Term Incentive Plan. The purpose of the Long
Term Incentive Plan is to offer certain key employees the opportunity to
receive long-term performance rewards. Performance periods will begin on January 1
and end on December 31 of the third calendar year thereafter. Performance
awards will be equal to the participant’s base salary (at the end of the
applicable performance period) multiplied by an “Award Percentage.” A
participant’s Award Percentage is determined by three components: the growth
over the performance period of each of the Company’s earnings per share, total
revenue, and return on equity. The Compensation Committee of the Company’s
Board of Directors will determine for each participant the range of Award
Percentages based on different growth scenarios of the components. One half of
any performance award achieved is payable promptly after the end of the
performance period. A participant must be an employee of the Company throughout
the performance period to be eligible for the first 50% payment. The other half
of the performance award


LKQ CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 12.
Long Term Incentive Plan

(Continued)

is
deferred and payable in three equal installments on each one year anniversary
of the end of the performance period over a total of three years. A participant
must be an employee on each such anniversary date to be eligible for the
respective deferred payment, unless the participant is not an employee as a
result of death, total disability or normal retirement at age 65, in which case
the participant (or his or her estate) will be entitled to all of the deferred
payments upon such death, disability or retirement. Interest on the deferred
portion of the performance award will accrue at the prime rate and be payable
to the participant at the same time as the deferred installments are paid.
During the year ended December 31, 2006, the Company has recorded expense
related to this plan totaling approximately $1.8 million.

CONTROLS
AND PROCEDURES

As of December 31,
2006, the end of the period covered by this report, an evaluation was carried
out under the supervision and with the participation of LKQ Corporation’s
management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer,
of our “disclosure controls and procedures” (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Based upon that evaluation, the Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the design and
operation of these disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure
that the Company is able to collect, process and disclose, within the required
time periods, the information we are required to disclose in the reports we
file with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Report of Management on Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting

February 28, 200


Management of LKQ Corporation and subsidiaries (the “Company”)
is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Company’s internal control over
financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States. Internal control over
financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain
to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company, (ii) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
of the Company, and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition
of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the Company’s
financial statements.

Internal control over financial reporting includes the
controls themselves, monitoring and internal auditing practices and actions
taken to correct deficiencies as identified. Because of its inherent
limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to
future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate
because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the
policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006.
Management based this assessment on criteria for effective internal control
over financial reporting described in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Management’s assessment included an
evaluation of the design of the Company’s internal control over financial
reporting and testing of the operational effectiveness of its internal control
over financial reporting. Management reviewed the results of its assessment
with the Audit Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors.


Based on this assessment, management determined that,
as of December 31, 2006, the Company maintained effective internal control
over financial reporting. Deloitte & Touche, LLP, independent
registered public accounting firm, who audited and reported on the consolidated
financial statements of the Company included in this report, has issued an
attestation report on management’s assessment of internal control over
financial reporting.

There was no change in the Company’s internal control
over financial reporting that occurred during the Company’s most recently
completed fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely
to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.


REPORT OF
INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of LKQ
Corporation:

We have audited management’s assessment, included in
the accompanying Report of Management on Internal Control over Financial
Reporting, that LKQ Corporation and subsidiaries (the “Company”) maintained
effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006,
based on criteria established in

Internal
Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company’s management is
responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting
and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial
reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s
assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal
control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an
understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating
effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a
reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting
is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company’s principal
executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar
functions, and effected by the company’s board of directors, management, and
other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable
detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the
assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a
material effect on the financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal
control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or
improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error
or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections
of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial
reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may
become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that the
Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2006, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on the
criteria established in

Internal
Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Also in our opinion, the Company
maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.


We have also audited, in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States), the consolidated financial statements and financial statement
schedule as of and for the year ended December 31, 2006 of the Company and our
report dated February 28, 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion on those
financial statements and financial statement schedule and included an
explanatory paragraph regarding the Company’s adoption of Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 123(R),
