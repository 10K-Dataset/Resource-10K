PART I

ITEM 1.    BUSINESS

Overview

We provide automotive replacement parts needed to repair automobiles. Buyers of automotive replacement parts have the option to purchase from primarily three
sources: new parts produced by original equipment manufacturers, which are commonly known as OEM parts; new parts produced by companies other than the OEMs, sometimes referred to generically as
"aftermarket" parts; and recycled parts originally produced by OEMs, which we refer to as recycled OEM parts.

We
believe we are the largest nationwide provider of recycled OEM automotive parts and related services, with 46 sales and processing facilities and 12 redistribution centers that reach
most major markets in the United States. We procure salvage vehicles, primarily at auctions, using our locally based professionals and centralized procurement systems. In addition, as an alternative
source of salvage vehicles, we obtain some vehicles directly from insurance companies, automobile manufacturers and other suppliers. Once we have received proper title, which assures us that the
vehicles have not been stolen, we dismantle them for recycled products.

During
2004 we expanded our product offerings in the automotive parts industry. In February 2004 we became a supplier of aftermarket collision automotive replacement parts. We
currently have approximately 30 locations supplying aftermarket parts, serving 19 states primarily east of the Mississippi River. Also in February 2004, we became a provider of
self-service retail recycled automotive parts. We offer these products at seven locations, also known as u-pull-it facilities, in Florida and Oregon. For the year ended December 31,
2004, revenue derived from recycling activities
represented approximately 90% of our revenue and sales of aftermarket parts and services represented approximately 10% of our revenue.

Our
customers include collision and mechanical repair shops and, indirectly, insurance companies, including extended warranty companies. The majority of our products and services are
sold to collision repair shops, also known as body shops, and mechanical repair shops. These customers benefit from our high quality products, extensive product availability due to our regionally
focused inventories, product costs lower than new OEM parts, and quick delivery. We provide benefits to repair shops and insurance companies because the lower costs for our products enable many
vehicles to be repaired rather than declared a total loss. We indirectly rely on insurance companies, which ultimately pay the collision repair shops for the repair of insured vehicles, as a source of
business. These insurance companies exert significant influence in the vehicle repair decision, and increasingly look to a nationwide source for consistency, quality and availability of replacement
parts. Because of their importance to the process, we have formed business relationships with certain insurance companies and with certain extended warranty providers, in order to be their preferred
automotive parts company. For example, with some insurance companies we have vehicle repair order estimate review programs in place and provide their claims adjusters a part quote and locator service.
In addition we provide them an outlet to dispose of certain total loss vehicles directly with us. We provide extended warranty companies a single national call desk to service their nationwide needs
for mechanical products.

By
expanding our product offerings to include both recycled OEM parts and aftermarket parts, LKQ provides a relatively complete line of automotive replacement parts. Our desire is to
become a one-stop shop for our customers.

Our Strengths

We Provide Services to Insurance Companies and Extended Warranty Providers

We believe that our nationwide presence gives us a unique ability to service the major automobile insurance companies and extended warranty providers. Insurance
companies and extended warranty


providers
are generally national or regional and play a critical role in the repair process. We believe we provide a direct benefit to these companies by lowering the cost of repairs, decreasing the
time required to return the repaired vehicle to the customer, and providing a replacement that is of the same quality as the OEM part replaced. Specifically, we assist insurance companies by
purchasing insured total loss vehicles and by providing cost effective products through sales to collision repair shops, especially to repair shops that are part of an insurance company network. We
also provide a review of vehicle repair order estimates to insurance companies so they may assess the opportunity to increase usage of recycled OEM and aftermarket products. For extended warranty
providers, we provide a single national call desk to service their nationwide need for mechanical products.

Our National Network Would be Difficult to Replicate

We believe that our national network provides a competitive advantage because it would be difficult to replicate. We have invested significant capital in our
current network of service facilities. Since our founding, we have developed a national network that serves 33 out of 35 major metropolitan areas in the United States. We consider our national
presence to be a key distinguishing factor. We have differentiated ourselves from our local competitors and made replication of a similar network difficult by developing our network using anchor
companies that were among the largest companies in the industry with multiple locations. The difficulty and time required to obtain the proper zoning, as well as dismantling and other environmental
permits necessary to operate a newly-sited facility, would make establishing new facilities difficult and expensive. In addition, there are difficulties associated with recruiting and hiring an
experienced management team that has strong local relationships with customers.

We Benefit From a Local Presence as Well as a National Network

We have developed a network of automotive parts facilities that allows us to maintain and develop our relationships with local repair shops, while providing a
level of service to insurance companies and national customers that is made possible by our nationwide presence. Our local presence allows us to provide daily deliveries that our customers require,
using drivers who routinely deliver to the same customers. Our sales force and local delivery drivers maintain and develop critical personal relationships with the local repair shops that benefit from
access to our wide selection of products,
which we are able to offer as a result of our regional inventory network. Finally, our national network allows us to enter adjacent markets by establishing redistribution facilities, which avoids the
need for local dismantling capabilities and inventory. Using this method, we can enter new markets quickly.

We Have an Effective Procurement Process

We have information systems and methodologies that leverage our nationwide presence and use our purchasing personnel to procure vehicles and aftermarket parts
cost-effectively. As our largest single expenditure, efficient procurement of salvage vehicles is critical to the growth, operating results and cash flow of our business. A critical
component of our operations is our ability to identify and value the parts that can be recycled on a damaged vehicle at auction and to rapidly determine the maximum price we can pay for the vehicle in
order to achieve our target margins on resale of the recycled OEM parts. We carefully analyze the market and obtain aftermarket parts and salvage vehicles of the type whose parts are in demand at
prices that we believe will allow us to sell products profitably. We have also taken advantage of our relationships with insurance companies and automobile manufacturers to obtain salvage vehicles
outside the auction process.

We Have a Broad and Deep Inventory of High Quality Products

We believe that our customers place a high value on availability of quality automotive replacement parts. Our broad and deep inventory of recycled OEM and
aftermarket parts allows us to fill a higher percentage of our customers' orders than our competitors can fill. We have invested significant capital


in
our inventory, and we have developed seven regional trading zones within which we make our inventory available to our local facilities. We manage our inventory and purchasing of recycled OEM
products on a regional basis to enhance the availability of the recycled OEM products that we believe will be in the highest demand within each region. We purchase aftermarket parts from manufacturers
primarily in Taiwan using a proprietary order management system. As we grow our business and financial resources, we will continue to increase our inventory and look for ways to improve our ability to
consistently fill our customers' orders.

We Have Implemented Management Disciplines

We have developed and built procurement, operating and financial systems that have allowed us to grow and develop our national network. We believe that our
ability to implement best practices utilizing professional management techniques and disciplines in an industry characterized by small companies with limited resources has made us an industry leader.
As our business has grown, we have implemented programs to further employee development, to support the sharing of best practices among employees, and to attract and retain our valuable employees.

Our Strategies

Expand our National Network

We intend to continue to expand our market coverage through a combination of internal development and acquisitions. We currently service 33 out of the 35 largest
major metropolitan areas in the United States with recycled automotive products and 25 out of the 35 largest major metropolitan areas with aftermarket automotive products. We plan to establish a
presence in additional major metropolitan markets and a number of smaller markets in the United States. We continually analyze our national network and look for opportunities to expand into new
regions or into adjacent markets. We estimate our current share of the automotive recycling market to be less than 10%. We estimate our current share of the insured aftermarket automotive products
market to be less than 5%. We believe there are opportunities for growth in both product lines. We are currently evaluating a number of acquisition candidates. We have applied an analytical and
disciplined approach to our acquisition process and have targeted companies with strong management teams, a record of environmental compliance, solid growth prospects and a reputation for quality and
customer service. We intend to continue to apply the same disciplines to future acquisition opportunities.

Further Develop Business Relationships

We intend to continue to develop business relationships with automobile insurance companies, extended warranty providers and other industry participants. We have
developed programs to enhance our relationships with these key user groups. We believe that insurance companies and extended warranty providers will take a more active role in the selection of
replacement products in the repair process and that they have significant incentives to increase the use of lower cost alternatives to new OEM parts. On behalf of certain insurance company customers,
we provide a review of vehicle repair order estimates so they may assess the opportunity to increase usage of recycled OEM and aftermarket automotive parts in the repair process. Our employees also
provide quotes for our products to assist several insurance companies with their estimate and settlement processes. We work with insurance companies and vehicle manufacturers to procure salvage
vehicles directly from them on a selected basis which provides us an additional source of supply as well as enhancing their recoveries on salvage vehicles. We believe we are positioned to take
advantage of the increasing importance of these groups, and we will continue to look for ways to provide services to them in order to enhance our relationships.


Continue to Improve our Operating Results

We are working to improve our operating results by applying our business approach to our most recently acquired facilities, continuing to build our nationwide
network, further centralizing certain functions, improving our use of technology, and increasing revenue at our lower volume facilities. Our higher volume facilities generally operate at a higher
profitability level as a percentage of revenue. We believe we can improve the operating results at our lower volume facilities by achieving the economies of scale that we realize at our higher volume
facilities. We are continually investing resources in procurement in an attempt to obtain our products at optimum prices. We are working to further improve the procurement function, which uses
methodologies that analyze demand levels for our products, existing inventory levels, and projected margins on an individual vehicle basis.

Further Develop our Technology

We continue to emphasize the use of technology in our processes to improve efficiency and to increase the standardization of our business. Our technology enhances
procurement, pricing and inventory management. We continue to develop our technology to allow us to better manage and analyze our inventory, to assist our sales people with
up-to-date pricing and availability of our products, and to further enhance our procurement process.

Raise Industry Standards by Being an Industry Leader

Since our inception, we have employed a professional approach to the automotive recycling business. We continue to seek new ways to improve our methodologies and
to communicate our standards to our customers. We believe that our competitors will seek to emulate our model. We further believe that, by elevating industry standards in areas such as customer
service, integrity, product quality and availability, delivery time, warranty support, environmental compliance, and appearance of facilities, we can help promote the acceptability of the use of
recycled OEM products and the growth of the automotive recycling industry.

Our Process

Our operations generally involve the procurement of inventory, vehicle processing (in the case of wholesale recycled OEM parts), sales, and distribution.

Procurement of Inventory

We start the process of procuring recycled OEM parts for our wholesale operations by acquiring severely damaged or totaled vehicles. Wrecked vehicles are sold at
salvage auctions held each weekday throughout the country. Salvage auctions provide an outlet for salvage vehicles to be processed and sold primarily to automotive recyclers and rebuilders. We
acquired approximately 84,600 salvage vehicles for our wholesale operations in 2004. We purchase the majority of our vehicles from salvage auctions. We pay third parties fees to tow the vehicles from
the auction to our facilities. Salvage auctions charge fees both to the supplier of vehicles (primarily insurance companies) and to the purchaser (including us).

For
the vast majority of our salvage auction purchases, we send a representative, whom we refer to as a "scout," in advance of each auction to investigate the vehicles we would be
interested in buying. The scout obtains key information such as the model, mileage and damage assessment and determines which parts on the targeted vehicles are recyclable. This information is
immediately forwarded to our bid specialists. The bid specialists analyze the data in light of current demand for the parts in question, the levels of our inventory with respect to such parts, and the
projected margins expected for each vehicle. The specialists then set a maximum bid price that our bidders use to purchase the vehicle at auction. We believe that this system provides a disciplined
approach for procurement.


We
also obtain salvage vehicles and parts from insurance companies, automobile manufacturers, abandoned vehicle programs and other salvage sources. Some of these arrangements allow us to
acquire salvage vehicles directly from the insurance company or automobile manufacturer at a cost calculated as a percentage of revenue from such vehicles, which is remitted as products are sold from
these vehicles. These arrangements eliminate the fees we and the insurance company would otherwise pay to the salvage auction and provide us inventory with a lower initial expenditure of capital.

We
acquire inventory for our self-service retail recycled automotive parts operations from a variety of sources, including but not limited to auctions, towing companies,
municipalities, and insurance carriers. In 2004, we purchased approximately 27,700 salvage vehicles for our retail operations.

We
purchase aftermarket parts from independent manufacturers. Approximately 90% of the aftermarket parts we purchase originate in Taiwan. We obtain the balance of our aftermarket parts
from sources in the United States. No single supplier currently provides more than 25% of our aftermarket parts. We use a proprietary order management system to procure our aftermarket inventory. The
system prompts inventory purchases based on stocking levels and historical sales data. We believe that the system helps us to procure our aftermarket inventory efficiently and to maintain one of the
highest fulfillment rates in the aftermarket parts industry.

Vehicle Processing

Vehicle processing for our wholesale operations involves dismantling a salvage vehicle into recycled OEM products ready for delivery. When a salvage vehicle
arrives at one of our facilities, an inventory specialist identifies, catalogs and schedules the vehicle for dismantling. We do not dismantle any vehicle until we have received proper title
documentation, thereby assuring that the vehicle was not stolen.

The
dismantler removes components that will become products for sale. Products that are placed directly on inventory shelves generally include such items as the engine, transmission,
hood, trunk lid, head and tail lamp assemblies, rear bumper and doors. We remove all recyclable items including fluids, freon, batteries, tires and catalytic converters. These items are sold to
recyclers and reprocessors. Dismantlers also perform any required cutting of the vehicle frame or body.

Each
inventory item is entered into our inventory tracking system, inspected for quality, tagged for identification and prepared for storage and delivery to our customers. Mechanical
products not in a condition to be sold as recycled products or that are in surplus supply are separated and sold in bulk to parts remanufacturers. The remaining vehicle hulks and components such as
fabrics, rubber, plastics and glass are delivered to automobile shredders, crushers and scrap processors.

Sales

As of December 31, 2004, we employed approximately 370 full-time sales staff in our wholesale recycled OEM parts operations. Of these,
approximately 340 were located at sales desks at our facilities and generally are responsible for accepting incoming calls from, and selling our inventory to, our customers. We put all of our sales
personnel through a thorough training program. Most of our sales personnel are paid primarily on a commission basis. In addition, as of December 31, 2004, we had approximately 30 traveling
sales staff who visit our customers and focus on business development in various markets. In our aftermarket parts operations, sales orders are accepted by either our local delivery drivers or by our
sales call center.

We
are continually reviewing and revising the pricing of our recycled OEM parts. Our pricing specialists take into consideration factors such as location, recent demand, inventory
quantity, inventory turnover, new OEM part prices, recycled OEM part prices, aftermarket part prices and remanufactured part prices with the goal of optimizing revenue. We update the pricing of our
aftermarket parts at least annually when we update our parts catalog, and we may adjust aftermarket prices during the year in response to material price changes of OEM parts.


The
inventory base of each of our facilities, supplemented by the inventory sharing system within our regional trading zones, gives us what we believe to be a competitive advantage
through our ability to meet our customers' requirements more frequently than smaller competitors.

Distribution

Each sale results in the generation of a work order. A dispatcher is then responsible for ensuring parts accuracy, printing the final invoice, and including the
parts on the appropriate truck route for delivery to the customer. We operate a delivery fleet of 343 medium-sized trucks, most of which we lease, and 246 smaller trucks and vans, most of which we
own. These trucks generally deliver products to our customers within their territory on a daily basis. In markets where we offer both recycled OEM and aftermarket parts, we deliver both types of parts
on the same delivery routes to help minimize distribution costs.

Additionally,
we have developed an internal distribution network to allow our sales representatives to sell both recycled OEM and aftermarket parts from the inventory of nearby
facilities within our seven regional trading zones, thus improving our ability to fulfill customer requests and to improve inventory turnover. We operate approximately 54 daily recycled product and 25
daily aftermarket product transfers between our facilities within our seven regional trading zones.

Our Products

When we procure salvage vehicles, we focus on vehicles for which the insured repair market has the most recycled product demand. These tend to be popular types of
vehicles such as sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks, and popular models, like the Accord, Taurus, Camry, Lumina and Explorer. These vehicles generally are a few model years old, as insurers tend
to use new OEM parts on repairs of vehicles that are one to two years old. Similarly, insurers are less interested in vehicles more than ten model years old, as they are less likely to be repaired.
Accordingly, we primarily target vehicles from the 1994 to 2002 model years. The degree of damage is not a significant factor in our process as we only assign value to the undamaged product when we
prepare our bids.

Our
most popular items include engines, vehicle front end assemblies, doors, transmissions, trunk lids, bumper assemblies, wheels, head and tail lamp assemblies, mirrors, fenders and
axles.

When
we obtain a mechanical product from a dismantled vehicle and determine that we have an excess supply of such product or it is defective, it is then sold in bulk to mechanical
remanufacturers. The majority of these products are transferred to our core facility in Houston, Texas where we sort them by product and model type. Examples of such products are engine blocks and
heads, transmissions, starters, alternators and air conditioner compressors.

When
we procure aftermarket parts, we focus on aftermarket parts that are in most demand by the insured repair market. We also focus on aftermarket parts that would best complement our
recycled inventory.

Our Customers

Insurance Companies

We consider the insurance companies our customers, as they are a key demand driver for our products. Our products are delivered directly to the repair shop or
installer, since automobile insurance companies and extended warranty providers generally do not actually receive our products. While automobile insurance companies do not pay for our products
directly, the insurance company does ultimately pay for the repair of the insured vehicle. As a result, the insurance company exerts significant influence in the decision-making process as to how a
damaged vehicle is repaired, and the cost level of the product used in the repair process. Insurance companies are also concerned with customer satisfaction with the repair process and the total time
to return the repaired vehicle to its owner.


Repair Shops and Others

We sell the majority of our products wholesale to collision repair shops and mechanical repair shops. The majority of these customers tend to be
individually-owned small businesses, although over the last few years there has been a trend toward consolidation resulting in the formation of several national and regional repair companies. We also
sell our products to individual retail customers at our self-service retail locations and at certain of our wholesale recycled parts locations.

Remanufacturers

A mechanical part that is not suitable for sale as a replacement part, or that is a product for which we have an excess supply, is sold to mechanical
remanufacturers in bulk shipments. Examples of mechanical parts we sell in this manner are engine blocks and heads, transmissions, starters, alternators and air conditioner compressors.
Remanufacturers usually are significantly larger companies than repair shops. Our sales to them tend to be large orders and are dependent on their production run for a certain product line.

Our Employees

As of December 31, 2004, we had approximately 2,700 employees performing operational functions and approximately 100 corporate and regional employees. None
of our employees are members of unions or participate in other collective bargaining arrangements.

Our Facilities

Our corporate headquarters are located at 120 North LaSalle Street, Suite 3300, Chicago, Illinois 60602. In February 2004, we entered into a new lease,
which became effective on August 1, 2004, to
remain in our current office space. The term of the new lease expires in July 2009. The primary functions performed at our corporate headquarters are financial, accounting, treasury, marketing,
business development, human resources, information systems support and legal. In addition to our corporate headquarters, we have numerous operating facilities across the United States that handle
recycled OEM parts, aftermarket parts, and self-service retail parts.

Recycled OEM Parts

Our wholesale recycled OEM parts facilities are located among seven geographic regions. A typical facility has processing, sales and distribution operations,
including a large warehouse with multiple bays to dismantle vehicles, indoor and outdoor storage areas, and administrative and sales offices. Equipment typically used at each facility includes
hydraulic lifts, forklifts and loaders, and hand tools to dismantle vehicles. We also have facilities that operate primarily as redistribution centers. As of February 28, 2005, we conducted our
wholesale recycled OEM parts operations from 58 facilities, 46 of which include a combination of processing, sales and redistribution operations, and 12 of which are currently primarily redistribution
facilities. We also have three recycled OEM parts facilities in San Jose, Costa Rica; Guatemala City, Guatemala; and Xela, Guatemala.

Aftermarket Parts

We conduct our aftermarket parts business from facilities that serve as sales, warehousing or distribution centers for these parts. As of February 28,
2005, we conducted our aftermarket parts operations from approximately 30 facilities. The largest of these facilities are located in Columbus, Ohio; Charlotte, North Carolina; Dallas, Texas; Oakland,
California; Pennsauken, New Jersey and Landover, Maryland.


Self-Service Retail Parts

Our self-service retail parts facilities typically consist of several acres of vehicles stored outdoors and a retail building through which customers
access the vehicles. As of March 1, 2005, we conducted our self-service retail parts operations from seven facilities in the United States.

Competition

We operate in a highly competitive industry. We consider all suppliers of automotive products to be competitors, including participants in the recycled OEM
product market, OEMs, parts remanufacturers, and suppliers of aftermarket parts. We believe the principal areas of competition in our industry include pricing, product quality, service and
availability of inventory.

We
compete with more than 6,000 domestic automotive parts recyclers, most of which are single-unit operators. We believe most of the automotive parts recyclers in the United
States have less than $3.0 million in annual revenue. In some markets, smaller competitors have organized affiliations to share marketing and distribution resources. Greenleaf LLC, an
automotive recycling business with a nationwide presence, started by Ford Motor Company, is our largest competitor in the recycled OEM automotive parts business. According to a published report, Ford
Motor Company sold Greenleaf LLC to former Ford managers in 2003.

We
also compete with distributors of aftermarket collision automotive parts. The largest distributor of these parts in the United States is Keystone Automotive Industries, Inc.

Manufacturers
of new original equipment parts sell the majority of automotive replacement products. We believe, however, that as the insurance and repair industries come to appreciate
the advantages of recycled OEM and aftermarket parts, those products can account for a larger percentage of total automotive replacement product sales.

Information Technology

We use a single third party facility management system in most of our wholesale recycled OEM parts operations. We believe that a single system helps us with the
continued implementation of standard operating procedures, training efficiency, employee transferability, access to a national inventory database, management reporting, and data storage. It also
eliminates the need to create multiple versions of proprietary applications and systems support processes.

The
major features of our facility management system include inventory control, customer selling and billing, sales analysis, vehicle tracking and profitability reporting. The system
also supports an electronic exchange system for identifying and locating parts at other selected recyclers and facilitates brokered sales to fill customer orders for items not in stock.

We
have separate third party providers for our financial systems such as financial and budget reporting, general ledger accounting, accounts payable, payroll and fixed assets. We utilize
the same common financial systems throughout the majority of our operations.

We
currently protect our local customer, inventory and corporate consolidated data, such as financial information, e-mail files and other user files, with daily backups.
These backups are stored off site with a third party data protection vendor.

We
have consolidated our facility management systems onto regional system platforms. The hardware for all such platforms is located at a single data center. The center is in a secure
environment with around-the-clock monitoring, redundant power backup and multiple, diverse data and telecommunication routing. This data center has daily off site back up to
another hardware facility.


Currently
our aftermarket and self-service retail operations each use a separate facility management system.

Regulation

Environmental Compliance

Our operations and properties, including our maintenance of a fleet of vehicles, are subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental protection and
health and safety laws and regulations. These environmental laws govern, among other things:

•

the
emission and discharge of hazardous materials into the ground, air, or water;

•

the
exposure to hazardous materials; and

•

the
generation, handling, storage, use, treatment, identification, transportation and disposal of industrial by-products, waste water, storm water and hazardous
materials.

We
have made and will continue to make capital and other expenditures relating to environmental matters. We have an environmental management process designed to facilitate and support
our compliance with these requirements. We cannot assure you, however, that we will at all times be in complete compliance with such requirements.

Although
we presently do not expect to incur any capital or other expenditures relating to environmental controls or other environmental matters in amounts that would be material to us,
we may be required to make such expenditures in the future. Environmental laws are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that
environmental laws will not change or become more stringent in the future in a manner that could have a material adverse effect on our business.

Contamination
resulting from automotive recycling processes can include soil and ground water contamination from the release, storage, transportation or disposal of gasoline, motor oil,
antifreeze, transmission fluid, CFCs from air conditioners, other hazardous materials, or metals such as aluminum, cadmium, chromium, lead and mercury. Contamination can migrate on-site or
off-site which can increase the risk of, and the amount of, any potential liability.

In
addition, many of our facilities are located on or near properties with a history of industrial use which may have involved hazardous materials. As a result, some of our properties
may be contaminated. Some environmental laws hold current or previous owners or operators of real property liable for the costs of cleaning up contamination, even if these owners or operators did not
know of and were not responsible for such contamination. These environmental laws also impose liability on any person who disposes of, treats, or arranges for the disposal or treatment of hazardous
substances, regardless of whether the affected site is owned or operated by such person, and at times can impose liability on companies deemed under law to be a successor to such person. Third parties
may also make claims against owners or operators of properties, or successors to such owners or operators, for personal injuries and property damage associated with releases of hazardous or toxic
substances.

When
we identify a potential material environmental issue during our acquisition due diligence process, we analyze the risks, and, when appropriate, we perform further environmental
assessment to verify and quantify the extent of the potential contamination. Furthermore, where appropriate, we have established financial reserves for certain environmental matters, which amounts are
not material. In addition, at times we, or one of the sellers from whom we purchased a business, have undertaken remediation projects. We do not anticipate, based on currently available information
and current laws, that we will incur liabilities in excess of those reserves to address environmental matters. However, in the event we discover new information or if laws change, we may incur
significant liabilities, which may exceed our reserves.


Title Laws

The definition of a "salvage" vehicle is the subject of much debate. The definition is important to the automotive recycling industry because an increase in
vehicles that qualify as salvage vehicles provides greater availability and typically lowers the price of such vehicles. Currently, the definition is a matter of state law. In 1992, the United States
Congress commissioned an advisory committee to study problems relating to vehicle titling, registration and salvage. Since then, legislation has been introduced seeking to establish national uniform
requirements in this area, including a uniform definition of a salvage vehicle. The automotive recycling industry will generally favor a uniform definition, since it will avoid inconsistencies across
state lines, and one that expands the number of damaged vehicles that qualify as salvage. However, certain interest groups, including repair shops and some insurance associations, may generally oppose
this type of legislation. National legislation has not yet been enacted in this area, and there can be no assurance that legislation will be enacted in the future.

National Stolen Passenger Motor Vehicle Information System

In 1992, Congress enacted the Anti Car Theft Act to deter trafficking in stolen vehicles. This law included the establishment of the National Stolen Passenger
Motor Vehicle Information System to track and monitor stolen automotive parts. In April 2002, the Department of Justice published for comment proposed regulations to implement the National
Stolen Passenger Motor Vehicle Information System. The proposed regulations require, among other things, that insurance companies, salvagers, dismantlers, recyclers and repairers inspect salvage
vehicles for the purpose of collecting the vehicle identification number and the part number for any "covered major part" that possesses the vehicle identification number. The requirement to collect
this information would place substantial burdens on automotive recyclers, including us, that otherwise would not normally exist. It would place similar burdens on repair shops, which may further
discourage the use by such shops of recycled products. The Department of Justice's comment period for the proposed regulations ended in June 2002, but final regulations have not been issued.

Legislation Affecting Aftermarket Parts

The legislatures in a majority of states have considered legislation seeking to prohibit or restrict the use of aftermarket parts in collision repair work. To
date, eight states have passed such legislation. Additional bills of this kind may be introduced in the future. An increase in the number of states passing such legislation or the passing of
legislation with prohibitions or restrictions that are more severe than current laws could have a material adverse impact on our aftermarket parts business.

In
addition, in 2000 a U.S. Congressman requested that the General Accounting Office ("GAO") review the role of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in regulating the
safety and quality of aftermarket replacement automotive parts. The GAO released its report in January 2001. This report may lead to Congressional hearings and possible future federal
legislation, which could adversely impact our aftermarket business.

ITEM 2.    PROPERTIES

Our properties are described in "Item 1—Our Facilities" above, and such description is incorporated by reference to this Item 2. Our properties

ITEM 7.    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Overview

The repair of automobiles includes the purchase of automotive replacement parts. Buyers of replacement parts have the option to purchase from primarily three
sources: new parts produced by original equipment manufacturers, which are commonly known as OEM parts; new parts produced by companies other than the OEM's, sometimes referred to generically as
"aftermarket" parts; and recycled parts originally produced by OEM's, which we refer to as recycled OEM products. We have historically sold primarily recycled OEM products. In 2004, we expanded our
product lines to include aftermarket collision automotive replacement parts. We believe that this expansion of our product offerings will allow us to fill more of our customers' requests.

Since
our formation in 1998, we have grown through both internal development and acquisitions. For the first 18 months of our existence, we focused on growth through acquisitions.
Our acquisition strategy has been to target companies with strong management teams, a record of environmental compliance, solid growth prospects and a reputation for quality and customer service.

Internal
growth is an important driver of our revenue and operating results. Since 1999, we have focused primarily on growing our recycled product sales and operating results within our
existing organization. We have done so by developing our regional distribution networks and by creating overnight product transfers between our facilities to better leverage our inventory investment
and to increase our ability to fill customer demand.

Our
revenue, cost of goods sold and operating results have fluctuated on a quarterly and annual basis in the past and can be expected to continue to fluctuate in the future as a result
of a number of
factors, some of which are beyond our control. Factors that may affect our operating results include, but are not limited to:

•

fluctuations
in the pricing of new OEM replacement parts;

•

the
availability and cost of inventory;

•

variations
in vehicle accident rates;

•

increasing
competition in the automotive parts industry;

•

changes
in state or federal laws or regulations affecting our business

•

changes
in the types of replacement parts that insurance carriers will accept in the repair process;

•

our
ability to integrate and manage our acquisitions successfully;

•

fluctuations
in fuel prices;

•

changes
in the demand for our products and the supply of our inventory due to severity of weather and seasonality of weather patterns;

•

the
amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures relating to the maintenance and expansion of our business, operations and infrastructure; and

•

declines
in the value of our assets.

Due
to the foregoing factors, our operating results in one or more future periods can be expected to fluctuate. Accordingly, our results of operations may not be indicative of future
performance.


Sources of Revenue

Our revenue from the sale of automotive replacement products and related services has typically ranged between 91% and 93% of our total revenue. We sell the
majority of our automotive replacement products to collision repair shops and mechanical repair shops. Our automotive replacement products include, for example, engines, transmissions,
front-ends, doors, trunk lids, bumpers, hoods, fenders, grilles, valances, headlights and taillights. We sell extended warranty contracts for certain mechanical products. These contracts
cover the cost of parts and labor and are sold for periods of six months, one year or two years. We defer the revenue from such contracts and recognize it ratably over the term of the contracts. The
demand for our products and services is influenced by several factors, including the number of vehicles in operation, the number of miles being driven, the frequency and severity of vehicle accidents,
availability and pricing of new parts, seasonal weather patterns and local weather conditions. Additionally, automobile insurers exert significant influence over collision repair shops as to how an
insured vehicle is repaired and the cost level of the products used in the repair process. Accordingly, we consider automobile insurers to be key demand drivers of our products. We provide insurance
companies services that include the review of vehicle repair order estimates, as well as direct quotation services to their adjusters. There is no standard price for recycled OEM products, but rather
a pricing structure that varies from day to day based upon such factors as product availability, quality, demand, new OEM replacement part prices and the age of the vehicle being repaired. The pricing
for aftermarket collision automotive replacement parts is determined based on a number of factors, including availability, quality, demand, new OEM replacement part prices and competitor pricing.

Approximately
7% to 9% of our revenue is obtained from other sources. These include bulk sales to mechanical remanufacturers and scrap sales.

When
we obtain mechanical products from dismantled vehicles and determine they are damaged or when we have a surplus of a certain mechanical product type, we sell them in bulk to
mechanical remanufacturers. The majority of these products are sorted by product type and model type. Examples of such products are engine blocks and heads, transmissions, starters, alternators, and
air conditioner compressors. After we have recovered all the products we intend to resell, the remaining materials are crushed and sold to scrap processors.

Cost of Goods Sold

Our cost of goods sold for recycled OEM products includes the price we pay for the salvage vehicle, as well as auction fees and storage, and towing, where
applicable. Our cost of goods sold also includes other costs such as labor and other costs we incur to acquire and dismantle such vehicles. Our labor and labor-related costs related to buying and
dismantling account for approximately 10% of our salvage cost of goods sold. The acquisition and dismantling of salvage vehicles is a manual process and, as a result, energy costs are not material.

Our
cost of goods sold for aftermarket collision automotive replacement parts includes the price we pay for the parts, freight and other inventoried costs such as labor and other costs
to acquire, including import fees and duties, where applicable. Our aftermarket collision automotive replacement parts are acquired from a number of vendors located primarily overseas, with the
majority of our overseas vendors located in Taiwan.

In
the event we do not have a recycled replacement part or suitable aftermarket replacement part in our inventory, we attempt to purchase the part from a competitor. We refer to these
parts acquired as brokered parts. The revenue from products that we obtain from third party recyclers to sell to our customers ranges from 8% to 10% of our total revenue. The gross margin on brokered
product sales as a percentage of revenue is generally less than half of what we achieve from sales of our own inventory because we must pay higher prices for these products.


Some
of our mechanical products are sold with a standard six-month warranty against defects. We record the estimated warranty costs at the time of sale using historical
warranty claim information to project future warranty claims activity and related expenses. Our warranty expense is approximately 1% of our total cost of goods sold. Our warranty reserve activity
during 2004 was as follows:

Warranty expense

2,011,000

Warranty claims

(1,966,000

)

Balance as of December 31, 2004

$

280,000

We
also sell separately priced extended warranty contracts for certain mechanical products. The expense related to extended warranty claims is recognized when the claim is made.

Expenses

Our facility and warehouse expenses primarily include our costs to operate our processing, redistribution, self-service and warehouse facilities.
These costs include labor for both plant management and facility and warehouse personnel, facility rent, property and liability insurance, utilities and other occupancy costs.

Our
distribution expenses primarily include our costs to deliver our products to our customers. Included in our distribution expense category are labor costs for drivers, local delivery
and transfer truck rentals and subcontractor costs, vehicle repairs and maintenance, insurance and fuel.

Our
selling and marketing expenses primarily include our advertising, promotion and marketing costs, salary and commission expenses for sales personnel, sales training, telephone and
other communication expenses, and bad debt expense. Personnel costs account for approximately 79% to 82% of our selling and marketing expenses. Most of our wholesale recycled sales personnel are paid
on a commission basis. The number and quality of our sales force is critical to our ability to respond to our customers' needs and increase our sales volume. We are continually evaluating our sales
force, developing and implementing training programs, and utilizing appropriate measurements to assess our selling effectiveness.

Our
general and administrative expenses include primarily the costs of our corporate and regional offices that provide corporate and field management, treasury, accounting, legal,
payroll, business development, human resources and information systems functions.

Seasonality

Our operating results are subject to quarterly variations based on a variety of factors, influenced primarily by seasonal changes in weather patterns. During the
winter months we tend to have higher demand for our products. In addition, the cost of salvage vehicles tends to be lower as more weather related accidents occur generating a larger supply of total
loss vehicles.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the
reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, assumptions and judgments
including those related to revenue recognition, warranty costs, inventory valuation, allowance for doubtful accounts, goodwill impairments,


self-insurance
programs, contingencies, asset impairments and taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under
the circumstances. The results of these estimates form the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and our recognition of revenue. Actual results may differ from
these estimates.

Revenue Recognition

We recognize and report revenue from the sale of automotive replacement products when they are shipped and title has transferred, subject to a reserve for
returns, discounts and allowances that management estimates based upon historical information. A repair product would ordinarily be returned within a few days of shipment. Discounts may be earned
based upon sales volumes or sales volumes coupled with prompt payment. Allowances are normally given within a few days following product shipment.

We
also sell separately priced extended warranty contracts for certain mechanical products. Revenue from these contracts is deferred and recognized ratably over the term of the
contracts.

Warranty Reserves

We issue a standard six-month warranty against defects on some of our mechanical products. We record an accrual for standard warranty claims at the
time of sale using historical warranty claim information to project future warranty claims activity and related expenses. We analyze historical warranty claim activity by referencing the claims made
and aging them from the original product sale date. We use this information to project future warranty claims on actual products sold that are still under warranty at the end of an accounting period.
A 10% increase in our historical annual warranty claims would result in an additional annual expense of approximately $200,000.

Inventory Accounting

Salvage Inventory.

Salvage inventory is recorded at the lower of cost or market. Our salvage inventory cost is established
based upon the price we pay for a vehicle, and includes buying, dismantling and, where applicable, auction fees and storage, and towing. Inventory carrying value is determined using the average cost
to sales percentage at each of our facilities and applying that percentage to the facility's inventory at expected selling prices. The average cost to sales percentage is derived from each facility's
historical vehicle profitability for salvage vehicles purchased at auction or from contracted rates for salvage vehicles acquired under direct procurement arrangements.

Aftermarket Inventory.

Aftermarket inventory is recorded at the lower of cost or market. Our aftermarket inventory cost is
based on the average price we pay for parts, and includes expenses incurred for freight and buying, where applicable. For items purchased from foreign companies, import fees and duties and
transportation insurance are also included.

For
all inventory, our inventory carrying value is reduced regularly to reflect the age and current anticipated demand for our products. If actual demand differs from our estimates,
additional reductions to our inventory carrying value would be necessary in the period such determination is made.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments. The allowance for
doubtful accounts is based on our assessment of the collectibility of specific customer accounts, the aging of the accounts receivable and our historical experience. Our allowance for doubtful
accounts at December 31, 2004 was approximately $1.7 million, which represents 5.3% of gross receivables. If actual defaults are higher than our historical experience,


our
allowance for doubtful accounts may be insufficient to cover the uncollectible receivables, which could have an adverse impact on our operating results in the period of occurrence. A 10% change in
the annual write-off rate would result in a change in the estimated allowance for doubtful accounts of approximately $94,000. Our exposure to uncollectible accounts receivable is limited
because we have a large number of small customers that are generally geographically dispersed. We control credit risk through credit approvals, credit limits and monitoring policies. We also have
certain customers that pay for products at the time of delivery.

Goodwill Impairment

We record goodwill as a result of our acquisitions. On January 1, 2002, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, "Goodwill
and Other Intangible Assets," which we refer to as SFAS 142, that requires us to analyze our goodwill for impairment at least annually. The determination of the value of goodwill requires us to
make estimates and assumptions that affect our consolidated financial statements. In assessing the recoverability of our goodwill, we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and
other factors to determine fair value of the respective assets. If these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets.
We perform goodwill impairment tests on an annual basis and between annual tests whenever events may indicate that an impairment exists. In response to changes in industry and market conditions, we
may be required to strategically realign our resources and consider restructuring, disposing of or otherwise exiting businesses, which could result in an impairment of goodwill.

We
utilize outside professionals in the valuation industry to validate the assumptions and overall methodology used to determine the fair value estimates used in our goodwill impairment
testing. As of December 31, 2004, we had $100.3 million in goodwill that will be subject to future impairment tests. If we were required to recognize goodwill impairments in future
periods, we would report those impairment losses as part of our operating results. We determined that no adjustments were necessary when we performed our annual impairment testing in the fourth
quarter of 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. A 10% decrease in the fair value estimates used in the fourth quarter of 2004 impairment test would not have changed this determination.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

We review long-lived assets for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be
recoverable. If our review indicates that the carrying value of long-lived assets is not recoverable, we reduce the carrying amount of the assets to fair value. We have had no adjustments
to the carrying value of long-lived assets in 2004 or 2003.

Self-Insurance Programs

We self-insure a portion of employee medical benefits under the terms of our employee health insurance program. We also self-insure a
portion of automobile, general liability and workers' compensation claims. We have purchased stop-loss insurance coverage that limits our exposure to both individual claims as well as our
overall claims. The cost of the stop-loss insurance is expensed over the contract periods.

We
record an accrual for the claims expense related to our employee medical benefits, automobile, general liability and workers' compensation claims based upon the expected amount of all
such claims. If actual claims are higher than what we anticipated, our accrual might be insufficient to cover our claims costs, which would have an adverse impact on our operating results in that
period. If we were to incur claims up to our aggregate stop-loss insurance coverage during the open policy years, we would have an additional expense of approximately $5.1 million
in 2004.


Contingencies

We are subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business resulting from litigation, claims and other commitments
and from a variety of environmental and pollution control laws and regulations. We consider the likelihood of loss or the incurrence of a liability, as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the
amount of loss, in determining loss contingencies. We accrue an estimated loss contingency when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. We
determine the amount of reserves, if any, with the assistance of our outside legal counsel. We regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether the accruals should be
adjusted. If the amount of an actual loss were greater than the amount we have accrued, the excess loss would have an adverse impact on our operating results in the period that the loss occurred. If
the loss contingency is subsequently determined to no longer be probable, the amount of loss contingency previously accrued would be included in our operating results in the period such determination
was made.

Accounting for Income Taxes

All income tax amounts reflect the use of the liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based upon the expected
future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial and income tax reporting purposes. We operate in multiple tax jurisdictions with
different tax rates and we determine the allocation of income to each of these jurisdictions based upon various estimates and assumptions. In the normal course of business we will undergo tax audits
by various tax jurisdictions. Such audits often require an extended period of time to complete and may result in income tax adjustments if changes to the allocation are required between jurisdictions
with different tax rates. Although we have recorded all probable income tax contingencies in accordance with SFAS No. 5, "Accounting for Contingencies" and SFAS No. 109, "Accounting for
Income Taxes," these accruals represent estimates that are subject to the inherent uncertainties associated with the tax audit process, and therefore include contingencies.

We
record a provision for taxes based upon our expected annual effective income tax rate. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that we expect
is more likely than not to be realized. We consider historical taxable income, expectations and risks associated with our estimates of future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in
assessing the need for a valuation allowance. We had a valuation allowance of $0.5 million and $0.2 million as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, against our deferred
tax assets. Should we determine that it is more likely than not that we would be able to realize all of our deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to
the net deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made. Conversely, should we determine that it is more likely than not that we would not be able to realize all of
our deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the net deferred tax assets would decrease income in the period such determination was made.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46 (subsequently revised in December 2003) "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities,
an Interpretation of ARB No. 51" (FIN 46). FIN 46 requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors in the entity
do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional financial support from other
parties. FIN 46 was effective for all variable interest entities or potential variable interest entities for periods ended after December 15, 2003. Application for all other types of entities
was required in financial statements for periods ended after March 15, 2004. We reviewed the interpretation and determined that it did not have an impact on our consolidated financial position,
results of operations or cash flows.


In
April 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 149, "Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" ("SFAS 149"). SFAS 149 amended and
clarified financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, and for hedging activities under SFAS 133,
"Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities." SFAS 149 was effective for contracts entered into or modified after June 30, 2003. We adopted the new standard and
determined that its implementation did not impact our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

In
May 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 150, "Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity" ("SFAS 150").
SFAS 150 establishes standards for classification and measurement of certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity and was effective for periods ending on or
after June 15, 2003. We adopted the new standard and determined that its implementation did not impact our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

In
November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, "Inventory Costs, an Amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4" ("SFAS 151"). SFAS 151 amends ARB 43, Chapter
4, to clarify that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs and wasted materials (spoilage) must be recognized as current period charges. It also requires that allocation of
fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities. SFAS 151 is effective for
inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005. We are currently assessing the impact SFAS 151 will have on our consolidated financial position, results of
operations or cash flows.

In
December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), "Share-Based Payment" ("SFAS 123R"), a revision of SFAS 123. SFAS 123R requires the
adoption of a fair-value method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation. SFAS 123R is effective as of the beginning of the first interim fiscal period that begins after
June 15, 2005. We are currently assessing the impact that SFAS 123R will have on our results of operations, but we expect that it will negatively impact such results for 2005 by
approximately $0.5 million or $0.02 per diluted share. We do not expect that the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or cash flows.

Acquisitions

During 2003, we acquired three automotive recycling businesses located in upstate New York, California and Nevada, respectively, for an aggregate of approximately
$3.3 million in cash, $0.2 million in notes issued and 50,000 redeemable shares of our common stock. The business combinations enabled us to serve new market areas.

In
the first quarter of 2004, we completed three acquisitions (two in the recycled OEM automotive parts business and one in the aftermarket automotive parts business) for an aggregate of
approximately $39.8 million in cash, $2.3 million in notes issued and 123,296 shares of our common stock. These acquisitions enabled us to serve new markets, become a significant
provider of aftermarket automotive replacement parts and become a provider of self-service retail automotive parts.

In
the second quarter of 2004, we completed two acquisitions in the recycled OEM automotive parts business, one with operations in Guatemala and Costa Rica and one located outside
Minneapolis, for an aggregate of approximately $3.8 million in cash, $0.1 million in notes issued and 63,402 shares of our common stock. The revenue of the Central American businesses is
not material, but we intend to use these facilities as a future platform to sell certain types of products into Central America from our U.S. based recycled OEM automotive replacement parts
facilities. Much of this product is currently being disposed of as scrap or mechanical core product by our U.S. facilities. The Minneapolis acquisition represents our establishment of production and
warehousing capabilities in that market.


In
late October 2004, we completed an acquisition of related companies with seven primary locations in the Northwestern United States, including three retail
self-service facilities, for an
aggregate of approximately $18.1 million in cash. This acquisition enables us to expand our presence in that region.

In
the first quarter of 2005, we completed an acquisition in the aftermarket automotive replacement parts business with two locations, near Philadelphia and Washington, D.C., for
approximately $15.4 million in cash. This acquisition enables us to expand our presence in these areas of the country.

Segment Reporting

Over 99% of our operations are conducted in the United States. During 2004, we acquired a recycled OEM automotive parts business with locations in Guatemala and
Costa Rica. Revenue generated and properties located outside of the United States are not material. We manage our operations geographically. Our automotive replacement parts operations are
organized into seven operating segments, six for recycled automotive replacement products and one for aftermarket automotive replacement products. These segments are aggregated into one reportable
segment because they possess similar economic characteristics and have common products and services, customers and methods of distribution. The automotive replacement parts operations account for over
90% of our revenue, earnings and assets.

Year Ended December 31, 2004 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2003

Revenue.

Our revenue increased 29.5%, from $328.0 million in 2003 to $424.8 million in 2004. The increase in
revenue is primarily due to the higher volume of products we sold and business acquisitions. Organic revenue growth was approximately 11.0% in 2004. We have continued to expand our services to the
insured repair industry and added local delivery routes and transfer routes that helped us to increase our market penetration. The revenue attributable to the six business acquisitions completed in
2004 accounted for approximately $60.3 million of total revenue for the year.


Cost of Goods Sold.

Our cost of goods sold increased 30.4%, from $174.2 million in 2003 to $227.1 million in
2004. As a percentage of revenue, cost of goods sold increased from 53.1% to 53.5%. The increase in cost of goods sold is primarily due to increased volume of products sold. The increase in cost of
goods sold percentage was due primarily to a change in inventory mix to higher end salvage during the third quarter and lower recovery on our shipping and handling costs.

Gross Margin.

Our gross margin increased 28.5%, from $153.7 million in 2003 to $197.6 million in 2004. Our
gross margin increased primarily due to increased volume. As a percentage of revenue, gross margin decreased from 46.9% to 46.5%. Our gross margin as a percentage of revenue decreased due primarily to
the factors noted above in

Cost of Goods Sold

. We shifted our buying in the fourth quarter to a lower average cost vehicle than we were purchasing
earlier in the year and are refocusing our sales force to recoup more of our shipping and handling costs through higher billings for these items. As a result, we saw our gross margin improve in the
fourth quarter compared to our third quarter.

Facility and Warehouse Expenses.

Facility and warehouse expenses increased 23.6%, from $38.7 million in 2003 to
$47.8 million in 2004. Our 2004 acquisitions accounted for $8.4 million of the increase in facility and warehouse expenses. Our remaining facility and warehouse expenses increased
primarily from higher wages due to increased headcount and higher repairs and maintenance expenses. This increase was partially offset by lower incentive compensation expense for field personnel and
lower rent expense due to our exercise of purchase options on certain production facilities that we previously leased. As a percentage of revenue, facility and warehouse expenses decreased from 11.8%
to 11.3%.

Distribution Expenses.

Distribution expenses increased 35.9%, from $35.3 million in 2003 to $47.9 million in
2004. As a percentage of revenue our distribution expenses increased from 10.8% to 11.3%. Our 2004 acquisitions accounted for $7.5 million of the increase in distribution expenses. Our
remaining distribution expenses increased as we have increased the number of local delivery trucks by
approximately 5.4%. We also operated 11.6% more daily transfer routes between our facilities due to the increase in parts volume. For the year ended December 31, 2004 we increased the amount of
product we moved between our facilities by approximately 30%, the majority of which was on our own transfer trucks. In addition, higher wages primarily from an increase in the number of employees, and
increased fuel costs, truck rentals and repairs, delivery supplies, contracted salvage transfer services and freight costs accounted for the remaining growth in distribution expenses. We renegotiated
our freight rates with substantially all of our common carriers in the fourth quarter of 2004, and we directed our sales force to recoup more of our shipping and handling costs. We expect to slow the
increase in our distribution costs as a percentage of revenue in future quarters.

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses.

Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 24.4%, from
$48.3 million in 2003 to $60.1 million in 2004. Our 2004 acquisitions accounted for $6.4 million of the increase in selling, general and administrative expenses. The majority of
the remaining expense increase was due to labor and labor-related expenses and costs associated with being a public company, partially offset by $0.3 million in lower incentive compensation,
lower bad debt expenses of $0.4 million and by improved insurance and legal claims experience of $0.9 million. Our selling expenses tend to rise as revenue increases due to our wholesale
recycled commissioned inside sales force. We incurred approximately $2.8 million in costs related to being a public company compared to $0.6 million in 2003. These costs primarily
included higher premiums for directors' and officers' liability insurance, higher directors' compensation expense and higher accounting and legal fees. As a percentage of revenue our selling, general
and administrative expenses decreased from 14.7% to 14.1%.

Depreciation and Amortization.

Depreciation and amortization increased 26.2%, from $5.4 million in 2003 to
$6.9 million in 2004. Our 2004 acquisitions accounted for $1.2 million of the increase in


depreciation
and amortization. As a percentage of revenue our depreciation and amortization decreased from 1.7% to 1.6%.

Operating Income.

Operating income increased 34.0%, from $26.1 million in 2003 to $35.0 million in 2004. As a
percentage of revenue, operating income increased from 7.9% to 8.2%.

Other (Income) Expense.

Net other expense decreased 44.9%, from $1.9 million in 2003 to $1.1 million in 2004.
As a percentage of revenue, net other expense decreased from 0.6% to 0.2%. Included in other income are approximately $0.4 million of proceeds from a corporate owned life insurance policy. We
use corporate owned life insurance policies to fund our obligations under our nonqualified deferred compensation plan. Net interest expense decreased 25.6% to $1.5 million in 2004 from
$2.0 million in 2003. In 2004, interest expense was related primarily to debt incurred to fund acquisitions. Included in interest expense in 2004 is $0.3 million in debt issuance costs
that were written off. These costs were attributable to our previous secured bank credit facility that was terminated in February 2004. See "Liquidity and Capital Resources" below for further
discussion of changes in our bank credit facilities. The decrease in net interest expense is due to both lower average debt levels and interest rates in 2004.

Provision for Income Taxes.

The provision for income taxes increased 38.7%, from $9.6 million in 2003 to
$13.3 million in 2004 due primarily to improved operating results. Our effective tax rate was 39.2% in 2004 and 39.7% in 2003. The decrease in our effective income tax rate in 2004 was due
primarily to the receipt of nontaxable life insurance proceeds of $0.4 million in the fourth quarter.

Year Ended December 31, 2003 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2002

Revenue.

Our revenue increased 14.2%, from $287.1 million in 2002 to $328.0 million in 2003. The increase in
revenue was primarily due to the higher volume of products we sold. We continued to expand our services to the insured repair industry and added local delivery routes and transfer routes that helped
us to increase our market penetration. We increased the number of customers we serve by approximately 5.8%. We also completed three business acquisitions during the first quarter of 2003. The revenue
attributable to these business acquisitions accounted for approximately $5.3 million of total revenue for the year.

Cost of Goods Sold.

Our cost of goods sold increased 12.7%, from $154.6 million in 2002 to $174.2 million in
2003. The increase in cost of goods sold was primarily due to increased volume of products sold. As a percentage of revenue, cost of goods sold decreased from 53.8% to 53.1%.

Gross Margin.

Our gross margin increased 16.0%, from $132.6 million in 2002 to $153.7 million in 2003. As a
percentage of revenue, gross margin increased from 46.2% to 46.9%. Our gross margin increased primarily due to increased volume. The increase in gross margin percentage was due primarily to higher
revenue growth in certain markets that have historically had higher gross margins as a percentage of revenue and our improving costs of salvage in certain regional operations.

Facility and Warehouse Expenses.

Facility and warehouse expenses increased 8.1%, from $35.8 million in 2002 to
$38.7 million in 2003. The increase in facilities and warehouse expenses was due primarily to higher wages from an increase in the number of employees, and higher costs of employee insurance,
repairs and maintenance, and property insurance. We had several large employee medical claims in 2003 that increased our self-insured costs. Repairs and maintenance has increased as our
volumes have increased. Property insurance rates were considerably higher in 2003. As a percentage of revenue, facility and warehouse expenses decreased from 12.5% to 11.8%.

Distribution Expenses.

Distribution expenses increased 23.6%, from $28.5 million in 2002 to $35.3 million in
2003. As a percentage of revenue, distribution expenses increased from 9.9% to 10.8%. We increased the number of transfer routes by approximately 18% and local delivery trucks by


approximately
14.0% in 2003. In addition, higher wages from an increase in the number of employees, increased fuel, freight and vehicle insurance costs, and higher employee medical claims accounted
for a portion of the growth in distribution expenses.

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses.

Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 13.9%, from
$42.4 million in 2002 to $48.3 million in 2003. The majority of the expense increase was due to labor and labor-related expenses. Our selling expenses tend to be more variable in nature
due to our commissioned inside sales force. In addition, costs in 2003 that were higher than in 2002 were due primarily to higher levels of salaried outside sales staff, increased advertising and
promotion activities and additional other incentive compensation expense. Finally, we incurred approximately $0.6 million in higher premiums for directors' and officers' liability insurance and
higher accounting fees and other costs in connection with becoming a public company in the fourth quarter of 2003. As a percentage of revenue, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased
from 14.8% to 14.7%.

Depreciation and Amortization.

Depreciation and amortization increased 8.6%, from $5.0 million in 2002 to
$5.4 million in 2003. As a percentage of revenue, depreciation and amortization remained constant at 1.7%. Increased levels of property and equipment account for the higher depreciation and
amortization expense in 2003 compared to 2002.

Operating Income.

Operating income increased 25.0%, from $20.8 million in 2002 to $26.0 million in 2003. As a
percentage of revenue, operating income increased from 7.3% to 7.9%.

Other (Income) Expense.

Net other expense decreased 26.0%, from $2.6 million in 2002 to $1.9 million in 2003.
As a percentage of revenue, net other expense decreased from 0.9% to 0.6%. Net interest expense decreased 30.4%, from $2.9 million in 2002 to $2.0 million in 2003. The decrease was the
result of both lower debts levels and interest rates in 2003, as well as higher debt issuance costs in 2002 from our previous credit facility that expired in June 2002. We paid down our bank
debt with the proceeds from our initial public offering in the fourth quarter of 2003. Other income decreased $0.2 million due primarily to the favorable settlement of a claim in 2002 relating
to an acquisition that was completed in 1998.

Provision for Income Taxes.

The provision for income taxes increased 31.9%, from $7.3 million in 2002 to
$9.6 million in 2003 due to improved operating results. Our effective income tax rate was 39.7% for 2003 and 39.8% for 2002.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Our primary sources of ongoing liquidity are our cash flow from operations and our credit facility. At December 31, 2004, we had cash and equivalents
amounting to $1.6 million, and we had $47.0 million outstanding under our $75 million unsecured bank credit facility. Our credit facility was utilized to finance our
January 2005 acquisition of an automotive aftermarket replacement parts business for approximately $15.4 million. At the time of this acquisition we increased the total capacity of our
bank credit facility to $100 million from $75 million. Based on our current plans, we expect to generate positive cash flow from operating activities for 2005 and believe that cash flow
from operating activities and availability under our bank credit facility will be adequate to fund our short term liquidity needs. As of March 1, 2005, debt outstanding under our credit
facility totaled approximately $59.0 million.

Our
liquidity needs are primarily to fund working capital requirements and expand our facilities and network. The procurement of inventory is the largest operating use of our funds. We
normally pay for salvage vehicles acquired at salvage auctions and under some direct procurement arrangements at the time that we take possession of the vehicles. We acquired approximately 84,600 and
75,000 wholesale salvage vehicles in the fiscal years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. We also


acquired
approximately 27,700 additional salvage vehicles for our self-service retail operations during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2004. Our purchases of aftermarket
replacement parts totaled $23.4 million in 2004.

We
intend to continue to evaluate markets for potential growth through the internal development of redistribution centers and processing facilities and through selected business
acquisitions. Our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors, including the costs and timing of our internal development efforts and the success of those efforts, the
costs and timing of expansion of our sales and marketing activities, and the costs and timing of future business acquisitions.

Net
cash provided by operating activities totaled $25.9 million in 2004, compared to $20.9 million in 2003. Cash was provided by net income adjusted for
non-cash items. Working capital uses of cash included increases in receivables and inventory, plus decreases in accounts payable and other noncurrent liabilities, partially offset by
decreases in prepaid expenses and other assets, plus increases in accrued expenses, income taxes payable and deferred revenue. Receivables increased due to our increased sales volumes and increases of
$0.6 million for employee relocation loans. Inventory increased to support our increased volume. Accounts payable decreased as we accelerated payments to certain foreign vendors in order to
realize improved pricing on certain aftermarket product purchases and also due to the timing of payments for certain facility construction projects and information systems licenses. Other noncurrent
liabilities decreased primarily due to reductions in legal claim reserves partially offset by an increase in employee deferred compensation liabilities. Prepaid expenses and other assets decreased due
primarily to amortization of directors' and officers' liability insurance
partially offset by an increase in deferred compensation plan assets and cash paid in connection with the exercise of a warrant, net of decreases in that investment's value subsequent to acquisition.
Accrued expenses increased primarily due to increases in our self-insurance reserves, property taxes, and timing of wage payments. Income taxes payable increased due primarily to our
higher levels of taxable income. Deferred revenue increased primarily due to higher sales of extended warranty contracts.

Net
cash used in investing activities totaled $87.8 million in 2004, compared to $12.2 million in 2003. We invested $61.6 million of cash in six acquisitions in 2004
compared to $3.3 million in three acquisitions in 2003, while net property and equipment purchases increased $16.6 million, due primarily to exercises of purchase options on previously
leased facilities and investments in facility expansions and information systems. We also exercised a warrant and paid an exercise price of $0.7 million in 2004. See Note 1 of the "Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements" for further discussion of this investment.

Net
cash provided by financing activities totaled $47.5 million in 2004, compared to $6.8 million in 2003. Included in these net cash amounts are $4.9 million in
2004 from the exercises of stock options and warrants and $60.0 million in 2003 from the sale of shares in our initial public offering and exercises of stock options and warrants. In addition,
we borrowed $47.0 million under our bank credit facility in 2004 primarily to fund acquisitions, compared to net repayments of $29.8 million in 2003. Repayments of long-term
debt obligations increased $3.8 million in 2004. We also used $0.2 million in 2004 for debt issuance costs related to our new unsecured credit facility compared to $0.1 million in
2003. In 2003, we repurchased 3,557,498 shares of our common stock for $22.9 million.

Net
cash provided by operating activities totaled $20.9 million in 2003, compared to $17.7 million in 2002. Cash was provided by net income adjusted for
non-cash items. Working capital uses of cash included an increase in receivables and prepaid expenses and other assets, partially offset by decreases in inventory and increases in
payables, deferred revenue and other operating liabilities. Prepaid expenses and other assets increased primarily due to increases in annual insurance premiums, increases in annual maintenance
contracts for information systems hardware, deferred costs incurred with respect to business acquisitions completed in early 2004 and an increase in prepaid income taxes that was refunded or applied
against our 2004 estimated tax payments. The increase in receivables and payables


is
consistent with our increased business activity. Our inventory decreased primarily due to a greater number of inventory turns. Deferred revenue increased primarily due to higher sales of extended
warranty contracts. Other noncurrent liabilities increased primarily due to increases in employee deferred compensation liabilities.

Net
cash used in investing activities totaled $12.2 million in 2003, compared to $6.7 million in 2002. In 2003, we invested $3.3 million of cash in three
acquisitions, while net property and equipment purchases increased $2.2 million, primarily due to investments in facility expansions and new information systems.

Net
cash provided by financing activities totaled $6.8 million in 2003, compared to net cash used in financing activities of $12.0 million in 2002. Before our initial
public offering, we repurchased 3,557,498 shares of our common stock in 2003 for $22.9 million, primarily funded by borrowings under our bank credit facility totaling $21.0 million. We
completed our initial public offering in the fourth quarter of 2003 resulting in net proceeds of $58.3 million after expenses. We then paid down the entire outstanding amount of
$45.0 million under our bank credit facility. We had net debt repayments of $11.3 million in 2002. We also received proceeds of $1.4 million from the exercise of stock options and
$0.3 million from the exercise of warrants in 2003, while our debt issuance costs decreased $0.5 million compared to 2002.

On
February 17, 2004, we entered into a new unsecured revolving credit facility that matures in February 2007, replacing a secured credit facility that would have expired
on June 30, 2005. The new revolving credit facility had a maximum availability of $75.0 million. In order to make any borrowing under the revolving credit facility, after giving effect
to any such borrowing, we must be in compliance with all of the covenants under the credit facility, including, without limitation, a senior debt to EBITDA ratio which cannot exceed 2.50 to 1.00. The
revolving credit facility contains customary covenants, including, among other things, limitations on our payment of cash dividends, restrictions on our payment of other dividends and on purchases,
redemptions and acquisitions of our stock, limitations on additional indebtedness, certain limitations on acquisitions, mergers and consolidations, and the maintenance of certain financial ratios. The
interest rate on advances under the revolving credit facility may be, at our option, either the bank prime lending rate, on the one hand, or the Interbank Offering Rate (IBOR) plus an additional
percentage ranging from .875% to 1.375%, on the other hand. The percentage added to IBOR is dependent upon our total funded debt to EBITDA ratio for the trailing four quarters.

On
January 31, 2005, we increased our unsecured credit facility availability with our bank group from $75 million to $100 million. In addition, we amended the credit
facility to provide for the option to further increase the facility from $100 million to $125 million, with the funding increase subject to approval from the banks.

We
may in the future borrow additional amounts under our revolving credit facility or enter into new or additional borrowing arrangements. We anticipate that any proceeds from such new
or additional borrowing arrangements will be used for general corporate purposes, including to develop and acquire businesses and redistribution facilities, to expand and improve existing facilities,
to purchase property, equipment and inventory, and for working capital.

During
August 2002, as required by our bank credit facility, we entered into a two-year interest rate swap agreement with a total notional amount of
$10.0 million and a fixed rate of 2.65%. The counterparty to the agreement was a member of our bank group. This swap agreement expired on August 22, 2004. Under the terms of the
agreement, we were required to make quarterly payments at the specified fixed rate and in return received payments at variable rates. The estimated fair value of the interest rate swap was a loss of
$0.1 million at December 31, 2003, and is included in Other Noncurrent Liabilities and Accrued expenses. In accordance with the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging


Activities,"
as amended, the changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap are included in current period earnings, as the agreement had not been designated as a hedging instrument.

In
February 2003, we repurchased 2,000,000 shares of our common stock from existing stockholders, including 1,878,684 shares repurchased from AutoNation, Inc., our largest
stockholder at the time, for a total of $12.0 million in cash. We partially funded the stock repurchase by obtaining a $9.0 million term loan, which originally had a maturity date of
February 20, 2004. On October 9, 2003, we fully paid the balance on the term loan.

On
February 28, 2003, in connection with a business acquisition, we issued two promissory notes totaling $0.2 million. The annual interest rate on the notes is 3.5% and
interest is payable upon maturity. The first $0.1 million note was paid on February 28, 2004 and the second $0.1 million note was paid on March 1, 2005.

In
May 2003, the Company repurchased 1,557,498 shares of its common stock from existing stockholders, including 1,500,000 shares repurchased from AutoNation, Inc., for a
total of $10.9 million in cash. The Company partially funded the stock repurchase by borrowing an additional $9.0 million against an existing revolving credit facility.

On
January 28, 2004, as part of the consideration for a business acquisition, we issued a promissory note in the amount of $1.0 million. The note is secured by certain real
property owned by us. The annual interest rate on the note is 3.5%. Monthly payments of interest and principal totaling $9,889 are required, with the remaining outstanding principal balance due in a
lump sum payment on January 28, 2009.

On
February 25, 2004, as part of the consideration for a business acquisition, we issued two promissory notes totaling $1.3 million. The annual interest rate on the notes
is 3.5% and interest is payable annually. The notes mature on February 25, 2006. At our option, the maturity of the notes may be extended to February 25, 2008. The annual interest rate
on the notes during the extension period would be 5.0%.

We
assumed certain liabilities in connection with a business acquisition during the first quarter of 2004, including two bankers acceptances totaling $1.2 million. The annual
interest rate on the bankers acceptances, which were paid during the second quarter of 2004, was 2.94%.

On
June 10, 2004, as part of the consideration for a business acquisition, we issued a note totaling $0.1 million. The annual interest rate on the note is 3.0%, and the
note, along with accrued interest, is payable at maturity on June 10, 2006.

As
of March 1, 2005, we had approximately 1.3 million warrants outstanding at an exercise price of $2.00 per share that expire on February 14, 2006, and
approximately 0.1 million warrants outstanding at an exercise price of $13.19 per share that expire on March 31, 2006.

We
estimate that our capital expenditures for 2005 will be approximately $18.5 million, excluding business acquisitions. We expect to use these funds for asset replacements,
completion of two new facilities, systems development projects and to expand current facilities. As of March 1, 2005, debt under our credit facility totaled approximately $59.0 million.
We anticipate that net cash provided by operating activities for 2005 will be between $22 million and $25 million.

We
believe that our current cash and equivalents, cash provided by operating activities and funds available under our existing credit facility will be sufficient to meet our current
operating and capital requirements. However, we may, from time to time, raise additional funds through public or private financing, strategic relationships or other arrangements. There can be no
assurance that additional funding, or refinancing of our current credit facility, if needed, will be available on terms attractive to us, or at all. Furthermore, any additional equity financing may be
dilutive to stockholders, and debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants. Our failure to raise capital if and when needed could have a material adverse impact on our business,
operating results and financial condition.


Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Future Commitments

We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, investments in special purpose entities or undisclosed borrowings or debt that would be required to
be disclosed pursuant to Item 303 of Regulation S-K under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Additionally, we have not entered into any derivative contracts other than
our interest rate swap agreement (that expired in August 2004) discussed above, nor do we have any synthetic leases.

The interest rate on advances under the revolving credit facility (our primary debt outstanding) may be, at our option, either the bank prime lending rate, on the
one hand, or the Interbank Offering Rate (IBOR) plus an additional percentage ranging from .875% to 1.375%, on the other hand. The percentage added to IBOR is dependent upon our total funded debt to
EBITDA ratio for the trailing four quarters.

Risk Factors

The risks described below are not the only ones that we face. Our business is also subject to the risks that many other companies face,
such as general economic conditions and geopolitical events. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be harmed. In such an event,
the trading price of our common stock could decline.

Risks Relating to Our Business

We face intense competition from local, national and internet-based automotive products providers, and this competition could negatively affect our business.

The automotive replacement parts industry is highly competitive and is served by numerous suppliers of OEM parts, recycled parts and aftermarket parts. Within
each of these categories of suppliers of automotive replacement parts, there are local owner-operated companies, larger regional suppliers, national providers, and internet-based suppliers. Providers
of automotive replacement parts that have traditionally sold only certain categories of such parts may decide to expand their product offerings into other categories of automotive replacement parts,
which may further increase the competition we face. Some of our current and potential competitors may have more operational expertise, greater financial, technical, manufacturing, distribution and
other resources, longer operating histories, lower cost structures, and better relationships in the insurance and automotive repair industries. In certain regions of the United States, local
automotive recycling companies have formed cooperative efforts to compete in the recycled parts industry. As a result of these factors, our competitors may be able to provide products that we are
unable to supply, to provide their products at lower costs, or to supply parts to customers unavailable to us.


An adverse change in our relationships with auction companies or our suppliers could increase our expenses and hurt our relationships with our customers.

Most of our salvage inventory consists of vehicles offered at salvage auctions by several companies that own auction facilities in numerous locations across the
United States. We do not have contracts with any auction companies. According to industry analysts, three companies control over 50% of the salvage auction market in the United States. In some
localities, the automotive auction business may be even more highly concentrated. If an auction company prohibited us from participating in its auctions, or significantly raised its fees, our business
could be adversely affected through higher costs or the resulting potential inability to service our customers. Moreover, auction companies have begun to allow bids to be submitted on salvage vehicles
through the internet, which increases the number of potential bidders and may increase our cost of goods sold for recycled automotive replacement parts.

We
also acquire some of our inventory directly from insurance companies, original equipment manufacturers, aftermarket parts manufacturers and others. To the extent that these suppliers
decide to discontinue these arrangements, our business could be adversely affected through higher costs or the resulting potential inability to service our customers.

In
addition, we purchase aftermarket parts primarily from foreign manufacturers in Taiwan. In the event that our business relationships with these suppliers deteriorated or terminated or
in the event
that the importing of products into the United States from Taiwan or the exporting of products by Taiwan to the United States was disrupted, our business could be adversely affected through higher
costs or the resulting inability to service our customers.

We may not be able to sell our products due to existing or new laws and regulations prohibiting or restricting the sale of recycled or aftermarket automotive products.

Some jurisdictions have enacted laws prohibiting or severely restricting the sale of certain recycled automotive products that we provide, such as airbags. These
and other jurisdictions could enact similar laws or could prohibit or severely restrict the sale of additional recycled automotive parts. Restrictions on the products we are able to sell could
decrease our revenue and have an adverse effect on our business and operations.

We
became involved in the aftermarket automotive parts business upon the closing of an acquisition in February 2004. Since 1998, legislatures in a majority of states have
introduced or considered bills that would prohibit or limit the use of aftermarket automotive parts in collision repair work and/or require enhanced disclosure or vehicle owner consent before using
aftermarket automotive parts. Additional bills of this kind may be introduced in the future. If a number of states adopt legislation prohibiting or restricting the use of aftermarket automotive parts,
it could have a material adverse impact on our aftermarket replacement parts business.

Certain
organizations test the quality and safety of automotive replacement parts. In the event that such organizations decide that a particular automotive part does not meet applicable
quality or safety standards, we may decide to discontinue sales of such part or insurance companies may decide to discontinue authorization of repairs using such part. Such events could adversely
affect our business.

In
2000, a U.S. Congressman requested that the General Accounting Office ("GAO") review the role of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in regulating the safety and
quality of aftermarket replacement automotive parts. The GAO released its report in January 2001. This report may lead to Congressional hearings and possible future federal legislation, which
could adversely impact our aftermarket replacement parts business.


If our business relationships with insurance companies end, we may lose important sales opportunities.

We rely on business relationships with certain insurance companies. These insurance companies encourage automotive repair facilities to use products we provide.
Because we do not have written agreements with these companies, these relationships may terminate at any time. We rely on these relationships for sales to some collision repair shops, and a
termination of these relationships may result in a loss of sales, which could adversely affect our results of operations.

We are subject to environmental regulations and incur costs relating to environmental matters.

We are subject to various federal, state and local environmental protection and health and safety laws and regulations governing, among other things:

•

the
emission and discharge of hazardous materials into the ground, air, or water;

•

the
exposure to hazardous materials; and

•

the
generation, handling, storage, use, treatment, identification, transportation and disposal of industrial by-products, waste water, storm water and hazardous
materials.

We
are also required to obtain permits from governmental authorities for certain of our operations. If we violate or fail to obtain or comply with these laws, regulations or permits, we
could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators. We could also become liable if employees or other third parties are improperly exposed to hazardous materials.

Under
certain environmental laws, we could be held responsible for all of the costs relating to any contamination at, or migrating to or from, our or our predecessors' past or present
facilities and at third party waste disposal sites. These laws often impose liability even if the owner or operator did not know of, or was not responsible for, the release of such hazardous
substances.

Environmental
laws are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. Our costs of complying with current and future environmental and health and safety
laws, and our liabilities arising from past or future releases of, or exposure to, hazardous substances may adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.

Governmental agencies may refuse to grant or renew our operating licenses and permits.

Our operating subsidiaries must receive certain licenses and permits from state and local governments to conduct their operations. When we develop or acquire a
new facility, we must seek the approval of state and local units of government. Governmental agencies often resist the establishment of an automotive recycling facility in their communities. There can
be no assurance that future approvals or transfers will be granted. In addition, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain and renew the licenses and permits our operating
subsidiaries currently hold.

Proposed regulations under the National Stolen Passenger Motor Vehicle Information System could harm our business.

In 1992, Congress enacted the Anti Car Theft Act to deter trafficking in stolen vehicles. This law included the establishment of the National Stolen Passenger
Motor Vehicle Information System to track and monitor stolen automotive parts. In April 2002, the Department of Justice published for comment proposed regulations to implement this system. The
proposed regulations require, among other things, that insurance companies, salvagers, dismantlers, recyclers and repairers inspect salvage vehicles for the purpose of collecting the vehicle
identification number and the part number for any covered major part that possesses the vehicle identification number. The requirement to collect this information would


place
burdens and costs on us that otherwise would not normally exist, and could discourage our customers from purchasing our products.

We could be subject to product liability claims.

If customers of repair shops that purchase our products are injured or suffer property damage, we could be subject to product liability claims. The successful
assertion of this type of claim could have an adverse effect on our business or financial condition.

We may lose business if recent litigation involving the use of parts that are not original equipment manufacturer parts results in insurance companies modifying arrangements
affecting the use of recycled or aftermarket automotive products in the repair process.

As a result of litigation against an insurance company for using parts manufactured by companies other than the original equipment manufacturer, some insurance
companies have curtailed or eliminated their requirement that repair shops use automotive parts that are not OEM parts. Although our products are primarily recycled OEM parts, we entered the
aftermarket parts business through an acquisition in February 2004. In addition, litigation or restrictive insurance company repair policies could be extended to limit the use of recycled OEM
parts.

In
an Illinois lawsuit involving State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company ("

Avery v. State Farm

"), a jury decided in
October 1999 that State Farm breached certain insurance contracts with its policyholders by using non-OEM parts to repair damaged vehicles when use of such parts did not restore the
vehicle to its "pre-loss condition." The jury found that State Farm misled its customers by not disclosing the use of non-OEM parts and the alleged inferiority of those parts.
The jury assessed damages against State Farm of $456 million, and the judge assessed an additional $730 million of disgorgement and punitive damages for violations of the Illinois
Consumer Fraud Act. In April 2001, the Illinois Appellate Court upheld the verdict but reduced the damage award by $130 million because of duplicative damage awards. In
October 2002, the Illinois Supreme Court agreed to hear the case, but no decision has yet been rendered. Some insurance companies have reduced or eliminated their use of aftermarket parts as a
result of this case. We sell primarily recycled OEM automotive products as well as aftermarket automotive repair parts to repair shops affiliated with insurance companies and these repair shops are an
important source of revenue for us. The recycled OEM products we sell were not the subject of

Avery v. State Farm

, but our financial results would
suffer if insurance companies modified or terminated the arrangements pursuant to which repair shops buy recycled automotive products from us due to a fear of similar claims with respect to recycled
products. Moreover, in the event that the

Avery v. State Farm

case is upheld by the Illinois Supreme Court, the demand for our aftermarket parts could
be further reduced.

We may not be able to successfully acquire new operations or integrate future acquisitions, which could cause our business to suffer.

We may not be able to successfully complete potential strategic acquisitions if we cannot reach agreement on acceptable terms or for other reasons. Future
acquisitions may require us to obtain additional financing, and such additional financing, whether sought through public or private debt or equity financing, may not be available when needed or may
not be available on terms acceptable to us, if at all. If we buy a company or a division of a company, we may experience difficulty integrating that company or division's personnel and operations,
which could negatively affect our operating results. In addition:

•

the
key personnel of the acquired company may decide not to work for us;

•

we
may experience additional financial and accounting challenges and complexities in areas such as tax planning, treasury management and financial reporting;


•

we
may be held liable for environmental risks and liabilities as a result of our acquisitions, some of which we may not have discovered during our due diligence;

•

our
ongoing business may be disrupted or receive insufficient management attention; and

•

we
may not be able to realize the cost savings or other financial benefits we anticipated.

In
connection with future acquisitions, we may assume the liabilities of the companies we acquire. These liabilities, including liabilities for environmental-related costs, could
materially and adversely affect our business. We may have to incur debt or issue equity securities to pay for any future acquisition, the issuance of which would involve restrictive covenants or be
dilutive to our existing stockholders.

Our existing credit facility imposes certain operating and financial restrictions on us and our subsidiaries and requires us to meet certain financial tests.

Our credit facility contains certain operating and financial restrictions that limit or prohibit us from engaging in certain transactions, including the
following:

•

incurring
or guarantying additional debt;

•

paying
dividends or other distributions to our stockholders or redeeming, repurchasing or retiring our capital stock or subordinated obligations;

•

making
investments and capital expenditures;

•

creating
liens on our assets;

•

selling,
transferring, leasing, licensing or otherwise disposing of assets;

•

engaging
in transactions with stockholders and affiliates;

•

engaging
in mergers, consolidations or acquisitions;

•

engaging
in any material line of business substantially different from, or unrelated to, those lines of business currently carried on by us; and

•

making
changes to our equity capital structure or amending our certificate of incorporation, bylaws, or any stockholder rights agreement.

The
credit facility requires that we satisfy certain financial tests. The failure to comply with any of these covenants would cause a default under the credit facility. We expect that a
default, if not waived, could result in acceleration of our debt, in which case the debt would become immediately due and payable. If this occurs, we may not be able to repay our debt or borrow
sufficient funds to refinance it. Even if new financing were available, it may be on terms that are less attractive to us than our existing facility or it may not be on terms that are acceptable to
us.

Our future capital needs may require that we seek debt financing or additional equity funding that, if not available, could cause our business to suffer.

We may need to raise additional funds in the future to, among other things, fund our existing operations, to improve or expand our operations, to respond to
competitive pressures or to make acquisitions. From time to time, we may raise additional funds through public or private financing, strategic alliances or other arrangements. If adequate funds are
not available on acceptable terms, we may be unable to meet our business or strategic objectives or compete effectively. If we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, stockholders may
experience dilution of their ownership interests, and the newly issued securities may have rights superior to those of the common stock. If we raise


additional
funds by issuing debt, we may be subject to further limitations on our operations. If we fail to raise capital when needed, our business will be negatively affected.

Our annual and quarterly performance may fluctuate.

Our revenue, cost of salvage vehicles and operating results have fluctuated on a quarterly and annual basis in the past and can be expected to continue to
fluctuate in the future as a result of a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control. Future factors that may affect our operating results include, but are not limited to, the following:

•

fluctuations
in the pricing of new OEM replacement parts;

•

the
availability and cost of inventory;

•

variations
in vehicle accident rates;

•

increasing
competition in the automotive parts industry;

•

changes
in state or federal laws or regulations affecting our business;

•

changes
in the types of replacement parts that insurance carriers will accept in the repair process;

•

our
ability to integrate and manage our acquisitions successfully;

•

fluctuations
in fuel prices;

•

changes
in the demand for our products and the supply of our inventory due to severity of weather and seasonality of weather patterns;

•

the
amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures relating to the maintenance and expansion of our business, operations and infrastructure; and

•

declines
in the values of our assets.

Due
to the foregoing factors, our operating results in one or more future periods can be expected to fluctuate. Accordingly, our results of operations may not be indicative of future
performance. These fluctuations in our operating results may cause our results to fall below the expectations of public market analysts and investors, which could cause our stock price to decline.

If we lose our key management personnel, we may not be able to successfully manage our business or achieve our objectives.

Our future success depends in large part upon the leadership and performance of our executive management team and key employees at the operating level. If we lose
the services of one or more of our executive officers or key employees, or if one or more of them decides to join a competitor or otherwise compete directly or indirectly with us, we may not be able
to successfully manage our business or achieve our business objectives. If we lose the services of any of our key employees at the operating or regional level, we may not be able to replace them with
similarly qualified personnel, which could harm our business.

If we experience problems with our fleet of trucks, our business could be harmed.

We use a fleet of trucks to deliver the majority of the vehicle parts we sell. We are subject to the risks associated with providing trucking services, including
inclement weather, disruptions in the transportation infrastructure, availability and price of fuel, and liabilities arising from accidents to the extent we are not covered by insurance. In addition,
our failure to deliver parts in a timely and


accurate
manner could harm our reputation and brand, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.

Risks Relating to Our Common Stock

Our executive officers, directors, and their affiliates hold a large percentage of our stock and their interests may differ from other stockholders.

As of December 31, 2004, our executive officers, directors, and their affiliates, in the aggregate, beneficially owned approximately 26% of our common
stock. If they were to act together, these stockholders would have significant influence over most matters requiring approval by stockholders, including the election of directors, any amendments to
our certificate of incorporation, and certain significant corporate transactions. These stockholders may take these actions even if they are opposed
by our other stockholders. In addition, without the consent of these stockholders, we could be delayed or prevented from entering into transactions that may be viewed as beneficial to us or our other
stockholders.

Future sales of our common stock may depress our stock price.

We and our stockholders may sell shares of common stock in the future. We may also issue shares of common stock in connection with future acquisitions. Certain of
our existing stockholders are parties to a registration rights agreement that provides such holders with the right to require us to effect the registration of their shares of common stock in specific
circumstances. In addition, if we propose to register any of our common stock under the Securities Act of 1933, whether for our own account or otherwise, some existing stockholders may be entitled to
include their shares of common stock in that registration. We cannot predict the size of future issuances of our common stock or the effect, if any, that future issuances and sales of shares of our
common stock will have on the value of our common stock. Sales of substantial amounts of common stock (including shares issued in connection with an acquisition), or the perception that such sales
could occur, may cause the value of our common stock to fall.

Delaware law and our charter documents may impede or discourage a takeover, which could affect the value of our stock.

The anti-takeover provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware law could, together or separately, impose various impediments
to the ability of a third party to acquire control of us, even if a change in control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders. Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws have provisions that
could discourage potential takeover attempts and make attempts by stockholders to change management more difficult. Our incorporation under Delaware law and these provisions could also impede a
merger, takeover or other business combination involving us or discourage a potential acquiror from making a tender offer for our common stock, which, under certain circumstances, could reduce the
value of our common stock.

Related Party Transactions

We have entered into a number of related party transactions that we believe are on terms no less favorable to us than we otherwise could have obtained from
unaffiliated third parties. For a description of these transactions, please see the information appearing under the caption "Certain Transactions" in the Proxy Statement, which information is
incorporated herein by reference.

ITEM 7A.    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Our results of operations are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily with respect to borrowings under our credit facility, where interest rates are tied
to either the prime rate or IBOR. As of December 31, 2004 we had $47.0 million outstanding under our credit facility. Our previous secured credit facility required that we enter into an
interest rate swap agreement to mitigate our interest rate risk on a portion of the balance outstanding. We do not however, as a matter of policy, enter into derivative contracts for trading or
speculative purposes. The swap agreement, which expired on August 22, 2004, had a notional amount of $10.0 million under which we paid a fixed rate of interest of 2.65% and received
payments based upon variable rates. The swap agreement was not designated as a hedging instrument and, as a result, changes in the fair value of the swap agreement were included in current period
earnings. We recorded non-cash credits of $90,000 and $69,000 during 2004 and 2003, respectively, related to the change in fair value of the interest rate swap agreement.

Based
upon our variable rate debt at December 31, 2004, a hypothetical 1% increase in interest rates would result in an annual increase in interest expense of approximately
$0.5 million.

The
Company is also exposed to currency fluctuations with respect to the purchase of aftermarket parts in Taiwan. While all transactions with manufacturers based in Taiwan are conducted
in U.S. dollars, changes in the relationship between the U.S. dollar and the New Taiwan dollar might impact the purchase price of aftermarket parts. We might not be able to pass on any price increases
to customers. Under our present policies, we do not attempt to hedge this currency exchange rate exposure.

Our
investment in our Central American operations is not material, and we do not attempt to hedge our foreign currency risk related to such operations.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To
the Board of Directors and Stockholders of LKQ Corporation:

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of LKQ Corporation and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the related consolidated
statements of operations, stockholders' equity and other comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2004. Our audits also included the
financial statement schedule included in Item 15 in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2004. These financial statements and financial statement
schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In
our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the
results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2004, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America. Also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material
respects the information set forth therein.

As
discussed in Note 1, effective January 1, 2002, the Company changed its method of accounting for goodwill and intangible assets upon adoption of Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 142,

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

.

We
have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated March 8, 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion on management's assessment of the effectiveness of the
Company's internal control over financial reporting and an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

LKQ CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Company Overview

LKQ Corporation, a Delaware corporation, believes it is the largest nationwide provider of recycled original equipment manufacturer ("OEM") automotive replacement
parts and related services, reaching most major markets in the United States. LKQ Corporation and its subsidiaries (the "Company") focus largely on the wholesale segment of this industry. In
February 2004, the Company expanded its product lines by acquiring Global Trade Alliance, Inc. (GTA), one of the largest suppliers of aftermarket collision automotive replacement parts
in the Midwest.

Principles of Consolidation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of LKQ Corporation and its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions and
accounts have been eliminated.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue
and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Revenue Recognition

The majority of the Company's revenue is derived from the sale of recycled automotive products and aftermarket collision automotive replacement parts. Revenue is
recognized when the products are shipped and title has transferred, subject to an allowance for estimated returns, discounts and allowances that management estimates based upon historical information.
The Company has recorded a reserve for estimated returns, discounts and allowances of approximately $2,182,000 and $1,062,000 at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Revenue from the sale
of separately-priced extended warranty contracts is reported as Deferred revenue and recognized ratably over the term of the contracts.

Shipping & Handling

Revenue also includes amounts billed to customers related to shipping and handling of approximately $5,944,000, $5,925,000, and $3,575,000 during the years ended
December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Distribution expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations are the costs incurred to prepare and deliver products to
customers.

Cash and Equivalents

The Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of 90 days or less to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents are carried at
cost, which approximates market value.

Receivables

The Company has recorded a reserve for uncollectible accounts of approximately $1,701,000 and $1,495,000 at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The
reserve is based upon management's


assessment
of the collectibility of specific customer accounts, the aging of the accounts receivable and historical experience. Receivables include travel advances and relocation loans to employees of
approximately $645,000 and $45,000 at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Concentrations of Credit Risk

Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant concentration of credit risk consist primarily of cash and equivalents and accounts
receivable. The majority of cash and equivalents are maintained with several major financial institutions. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited because a large
number of geographically diverse customers make up the Company's customer base. The Company controls credit risk through credit approvals, credit limits, and monitoring procedures.

Inventory

A salvage part is a recycled automotive part suitable for sale as a replacement part. A core is a recycled mechanical part that is not suitable for sale as a
replacement part without further remanufacturing work. Salvage inventory and cores are recorded at the lower of cost or market. Cost is established based upon the price the Company pays for a vehicle,
and includes average costs for buying, dismantling, and where applicable, auction fees and storage, and towing. Inventory carrying value is determined using the average cost to sales percentage at
each of our facilities and applying that percentage to the facility's inventory at expected selling prices. The average cost to sales percentage is derived from each facility's historical vehicle
profitability for salvage vehicles purchased at auction or from contracted rates for salvage vehicles acquired under certain direct procurement arrangements.

An
aftermarket part is a new automotive part manufactured by a company other than the original equipment manufacturer (OEM). Aftermarket inventory is recorded at the lower of cost or
market. Cost is established based upon the average price for purchased parts, and includes expenses incurred for freight and buying, where applicable. For items purchased from foreign companies,
import fees and duties and transportation insurance are also included.

For
all inventory, carrying value is reduced regularly to reflect the age of the inventory and current anticipated demand. If actual demand differs from management estimates, additional
reductions to inventory carrying value would be necessary in the period such determination is made.

Inventory
consists of the following:

Property and Equipment

Property and equipment are recorded at cost. Expenditures for major additions and improvements are capitalized. As property and equipment are sold or retired, the
applicable cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss thereon is recognized. Construction in progress consists primarily of building and land
improvements at existing Company facilities. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated
useful lives or, in the case of leasehold improvements, the term of the related lease, including renewal periods, if shorter. Other estimated useful lives are as follows:

Land improvements

20 years

Buildings and improvements

20-40 years

Furniture, fixtures and equipment

5-20 years

Computer equipment and software

3-5 years

Vehicles and trailers

Intangibles

Intangible assets consist primarily of goodwill (the cost of purchased businesses in excess of the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired) and
covenants not to compete.

On
January 1, 2002, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" ("SFAS 142").
SFAS 142 requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives must be tested for impairment at least annually and can no longer be amortized. Intangible assets with finite
useful lives will continue to be amortized over their estimated useful lives.

In
connection with the transitional goodwill impairment evaluation, SFAS 142 required the Company, by June 30, 2002, to perform an assessment of whether there was an
indication that goodwill was impaired as of the date of adoption. To accomplish this, the Company determined the carrying value of each of its reporting units as of January 1, 2002 and compared
them to the fair value estimates


of
those reporting units. The fair values of the Company's reporting units were estimated using the expected present value of future cash flows and market comparables. Professionals in the valuation
industry were utilized to validate the assumptions and overall methodology used to determine the fair value estimates. To the extent a reporting unit's carrying value exceeded its fair value estimate,
an indication existed that the reporting unit's goodwill was impaired and the Company then had to perform the second step of the transitional impairment test. The second step of the impairment test,
which had to be completed by December 31, 2002, required the Company to compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill, determined by allocating the reporting unit's fair value
to its individual assets and liabilities in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation in accordance with SFAS No. 141, "Business Combinations" ("SFAS 141"), to its carrying amount,
both of which were measured as of the date of adoption. SFAS 142 required the transitional impairment loss to be recognized as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the
Company's consolidated statement of operations.

At
the time of the transitional impairment test, valuations for some of the Company's acquisitions had declined significantly since the Company completed its acquisitions during 1998 and
1999 due to a number of factors, including lower earnings multiples applied in the valuations of comparable companies. As a result, the Company determined that the carrying value of certain reporting
units exceeded the fair value of those reporting units at January 1, 2002, and recorded an impairment of goodwill in the amount of $49,898,800, net of tax of $16,120,700.

The
Company has performed annual impairment tests during the fourth quarter of 2004, 2003 and 2002. The results of these tests indicated that goodwill was not impaired.

The
changes in the carrying amount of goodwill are as follows:

115,044,444

$

100,319,412

Other
intangible assets totaled approximately $88,900 and $371,700 at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Accumulated amortization of other intangible assets at
December 31, 2004 and 2003 was approximately $44,300 and $324,800, respectively. Amortization expense was approximately $8,000, $17,300 and $55,400 during the years ended December 31,
2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Covenants not to compete are amortized over the lives of the respective agreements on a straight-line basis. Estimated annual amortization expense for
the years ended December 31, 2005 through 2009 is approximately $8,200.


Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

Long-lived assets are reviewed for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be
recoverable. If such review indicates that the carrying amount of long-lived assets is not recoverable, the carrying amount of such assets is reduced to fair value. There were no
adjustments to the carrying value of long-lived assets in 2004, 2003 or 2002.

Investments

Included in Other Assets at December 31, 2003 is a warrant to purchase 100,000 common shares of Keystone Automotive Industries, Inc. at $6.50 per
share, which was obtained in connection with a supply agreement dated February 21, 2000. This warrant was not valued prior to December 31, 2003 as the
Company did not have an expectation of exercising the warrant due to the one year holding period requirement and liquidity considerations. Upon completion of the Company's initial public offering in
the fourth quarter of 2003 and the new unsecured revolving credit facility in February 2004 (Note 6), sufficient liquidity was available to the Company that would enable it to exercise
the warrant and hold the investment for the minimum one year holding period. As a result, the Company valued and recorded the warrant at December 31, 2003. The Company classified this warrant
as an available-for-sale investment security under Emerging Issues Task Force No. 96-11, "Accounting for Forward Contracts and Purchased Options to Acquire
Securities Covered by Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Statement No. 115," that requires the warrant to be accounted for consistent with SFAS No. 115, "Accounting for
Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities." Accordingly, the Company reported the warrant at fair value, with the unrealized gain excluded from earnings and included in Accumulated other
comprehensive income, net of applicable taxes of $746,500. The fair value of the warrant at December 31, 2003 was estimated at $1,885,000 using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model.

The
Company exercised its warrant in March 2004. The shares are restricted and therefore must either be registered or held for a period of one year in accordance with the
applicable securities laws. The Company classifies this investment as an available-for-sale investment security under SFAS 115. Accordingly, the Company has included the
investment at its fair value of $2,325,000 in Other Assets at December 31, 2004, with the unrealized gain of $1,675,000 excluded from earnings and included in Accumulated other comprehensive
income, net of applicable taxes of $663,200. The fair value of this investment at December 31, 2004 was estimated based upon the quoted market price for these securities.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

SFAS No. 107, "Disclosures About Fair Value of Financial Instruments," requires disclosure of the fair value of certain financial instruments. The
Company's financial instruments, excluding the available-for-sale securities discussed above, include cash and equivalents, trade receivables, accounts payable, debt and,
through August 2004, an interest rate swap. The carrying amounts of financial instruments approximate fair value.

Accrued Expenses

The Company has entered into certain arrangements whereby salvage vehicles are obtained directly from major insurance companies and automotive manufacturers at a
cost calculated as a percentage of


the
revenue generated from each vehicle. Accrued expenses include an estimated liability of $1,989,000 and $1,179,000 at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, for salvage inventory procured
under such arrangements.

The
Company self-insures for a portion of employee medical benefits under the terms of its employee health insurance program. The Company has purchased stop-loss
insurance coverage in order to limit its exposure to employee medical benefit claims. Other accrued expenses include an estimated liability of approximately $1,405,000 and $893,000 at
December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, for expenses incurred but not yet paid under the program.

The
Company also self-insures for a portion of general liability and workers compensation claims under the terms of its current insurance program, which began on
April 1, 2002. On April 1, 2003, the Company began self-insuring for a portion of automobile claims. The Company has purchased stop-loss insurance coverage in
order to limit its exposure to automobile, general liability and workers compensation claims. Other accrued expenses include an estimated liability of approximately $2,969,000 and $1,863,000, net of
claims deposits of $400,000 and $300,000, at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, for expenses incurred but not yet paid under the program. If the Company were to incur claims up to its
aggregate stop-loss insurance coverage during the open policy years, it would have an additional expense of approximately $5,100,000 in 2004.

Product Warranties

The Company generally warrants certain mechanical parts against defects for a period of six months. Based on historical warranty claims, the Company accrues the
estimated costs of the warranty coverage at the time of sale. A rollforward of the warranty reserve is as follows:

Other Noncurrent Liabilities

Other Noncurrent Liabilities include approximately $2,195,000 and $1,703,000 at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, related to employee deferred
compensation plans as discussed in Note 5.

Other
Noncurrent Liabilities also include approximately $1,497,000 and $2,610,000 at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, related to unasserted claims that are deemed
probable of assertion. In the event the unasserted claims are asserted and resolved for amounts different than those accrued, or are determined to no longer be probable in future periods, the amounts
so determined would be adjusted to income in the periods such determination is made. In 2004, approximately $900,000 was recognized in income, with approximately $1,120,000 due to the favorable
resolution of certain unasserted claims, partially offset by approximately $265,000 of higher insurance claims.


Stock-Based Compensation

The Company has three stock-based compensation plans, the LKQ Corporation 1998 Equity Incentive Plan (the "Equity Incentive Plan"), the Stock Option and
Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors (the "Director Plan"), and a separate stock option plan for our Chief Executive Officer (the "CEO Plan"), which are described more fully in
Note 3. The Company accounts for its stock compensation agreements under the provisions of Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees"
("APB 25"). The Company has adopted the disclosure-only provisions of SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation" ("SFAS 123"), as amended by SFAS No. 148
"Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation-Transition and Disclosures" ("SFAS 148").

Under
the CEO Plan, the difference between the fair market value of the options at the time granted in 1998 and the exercise price was recorded as deferred compensation expense and was
charged to operations over the vesting period of the options which ended in November 2003. No stock-based compensation cost is reflected in net income (loss) for the Equity Incentive Plan or
the Director Plan at the date of issuance of the options, as all options granted under these plans had an exercise price equal to or greater than the market value of the underlying common stock on the
date of grant.

On
December 27, 2004, the Company's Board of Directors amended the award of 200,000 options granted to its Chairman on January 29, 2004 under the Equity Incentive Plan,
accelerating the vesting schedule to make all unvested shares subject to the options immediately exercisable. The Company recognized compensation expense of approximately $157,000 in the fourth
quarter of 2004 in connection with this amendment.

The
following table illustrates the effect on net income (loss) and earnings (loss) per share if the Company had applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123 to the
Equity Incentive Plan and the Director Plan:

The
fair value of stock options used to compute the pro forma disclosures has been estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. This model requires the use of highly
subjective


assumptions,
including the expected volatility of the underlying stock. Projected data related to volatility and expected life of stock options is based upon historical and other information. Changes
in the subjective underlying assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimates. For purposes of pro forma disclosure, the estimated fair value of the options is amortized to expense over the
options' vesting periods. The following table summarizes the assumptions used to compute the weighted average fair value of stock option grants:

Rental Expense

The Company recognizes rental expense on a straight-line basis over the respective lease terms for all of its operating leases.

Earnings (Loss) per Share

Basic earnings (loss) per share are computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings (loss) per share
incorporate the incremental shares issuable upon the assumed exercise of stock options and warrants. Certain of the Company's stock options and warrants were excluded from the calculation of diluted
earnings (loss) per share because they were antidilutive, but these options and warrants could be dilutive in the future.

Segment Information

Over 99% of the Company's operations are conducted in the United States. During 2004, the Company acquired a recycled OEM automotive parts business with
locations in Guatemala and Costa Rica. Revenue generated and properties located outside of the United States are not material. The Company manages its operations geographically. The
Company's automotive replacement parts operations are organized into seven operating segments, six for recycled automotive replacement products and one for aftermarket automotive replacement products.
These segments are aggregated into one reportable segment because they possess similar economic characteristics and have common products and services, customers and methods of distribution. The
automotive replacement parts operations account for over 90% of the Company's revenue, earnings and assets.

Foreign Currency Translation

For the Company's foreign operations, the local currency is the functional currency. Assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars at the period-ending
exchange rate. Statement of Operations


amounts
are translated to U.S. dollars using average exchange rates during the period. Translation gains and losses are reported as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income in
Stockholders' Equity. Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are included in current earnings.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46, (subsequently revised in December 2003), "Consolidation of Variable Interest
Entities, an Interpretation of ARB No. 51" ("FIN 46"). FIN 46 requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors in
the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional financial support
from other parties. FIN 46 was effective for all variable interest entities or potential variable interest entities for periods ended after December 15, 2003. Application for all other types of
entities was required in financial statements for periods ending after March 15, 2004. The Company adopted the new standard and determined that its implementation did not impact its
consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

In
April 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 149, "Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" ("SFAS 149"). SFAS 149 amended and
clarified financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities under SFAS 133,
"Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities." SFAS 149 was effective for contracts entered into or modified after June 30, 2003. The Company adopted the new standard
and determined that its implementation did not impact its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

In
May 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 150, "Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity" ("SFAS 150").
SFAS 150 establishes standards for classification and measurement of certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity and was effective for periods ending on or
after June 15, 2003. The Company adopted the new standard and determined that its implementation did not impact its consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

In
November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, "Inventory Costs, an amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4" ("SFAS 151"). SFAS 151 amends Accounting
Research Bulletin No. 43, Chapter 4, to clarify that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs and wasted materials (spoilage) should be recognized as current-period
charges. In addition, SFAS 151 requires that allocation of fixed production overhead to inventory be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities. SFAS 151 is effective for
inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005. The Company is currently assessing the impact that SFAS 151 will have on its results of operations, financial
position or cash flows.

In
December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), "Share-Based Payment"("SFAS 123R"), a revision of SFAS 123. SFAS 123R supercedes APB 25
and requires the adoption of a fair-value method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation. SFAS 123R is effective as of the beginning of the first interim fiscal period
that begins after June 15, 2005. The Company is currently assessing the impact that SFAS 123R will have on its results of operations, but it expects that it will negatively impact such
results for 2005 by approximately $0.5 million or $0.02 per


diluted
share. The Company does not expect that the adoption of this standard will have a material effect on its consolidated financial position or cash flows.

Note 2. Capital Structure

On March 31, 1999, in connection with a business acquisition, the Company issued warrants to purchase 100,000 shares of its common stock at $15.00 per
share, with exercisability contingent upon the achievement of certain operating results in 2000. These results were achieved and the warrants became exercisable on March 31, 2001. These
warrants expire five years after they became exercisable. In accordance with the antidilution provisions of the warrant agreement, the total number of warrants issued and the exercise price at
December 31, 2004 and 2003 were 113,751 and $13.19 per share, as adjusted.

The
Company issued warrants on January 3, 2000 to purchase 150,000 shares of its common stock at exercise prices ranging from $15.00 to $35.00 per share, in connection with a
business acquisition completed in 1999. The warrants were valued at $144,500 at the date of grant. In August 2004, warrants to purchase 50,000 shares of the Company's common stock at a price of
$15.00 per share were exercised. Warrants to purchase 100,000 shares of the Company's common stock at prices ranging from $25.00 to $35.00 expired on August 31, 2004.

On
February 14, 2001 the Company issued warrants to purchase 1,961,112 shares of its common stock at an exercise price of $2.00 per share to certain stockholder guarantors. The
Company had breached certain covenants of its credit facility including covenants relating to operating income and the minimum required ratio of funded debt to earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization. The Company entered into an amendment to the credit agreement with its banks that waived the breaches and modified certain of the covenants. As part of the amendment,
the banks required that stockholders guaranty $10 million of the debt, with the guaranties secured by letters of credit or other highly liquid collateral acceptable to the banks. All the
Company's stockholders were given the opportunity to participate in this transaction and thirty of the Company's stockholders provided the guaranties. In exchange for providing the guaranties, each
guarantor received certain rights, including a guaranty fee. The guaranty fee consisted of each guarantor's pro rata portion of warrants to purchase a total of 1,961,112 shares of the Company's common
stock (10% of the then outstanding shares of common stock assuming exercise of these warrants) at an exercise price of $2.00
per share. The warrants became exercisable upon issuance and will expire on February 14, 2006. The warrants were valued at approximately $401,000 at the date of grant. Warrants to purchase
502,818 and 170,939 shares of the Company's common stock at a price of $2.00 per share were exercised during the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The stockholder guaranties
were cancelled in June 2002 when the Company entered into a new credit facility.

On
January 1, 2003, in connection with a business acquisition, the Company issued 50,000 shares of its common stock. The Company granted a put option on those shares with a single
exercise date of January 1, 2007 at a price of $15.00 per share and obtained a call option on those shares with a single exercise date of January 1, 2007 at a price of $22.50 per share.
These shares are reflected as Redeemable Common Stock in the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2004 and 2003.

In
February 2003, the Company repurchased 2,000,000 shares of its common stock from existing stockholders, including 1,878,684 shares repurchased from AutoNation, Inc., the
Company's largest stockholder at that time, for a total of $12,000,000 in cash. The Company partially funded the stock


repurchase
by obtaining a $9,000,000 term loan (see Note 6), with an original maturity date of February 20, 2004. On October 9, 2003, the Company fully paid the balance on the
term loan.

In
May 2003, the Company repurchased 1,557,498 shares of its common stock from existing stockholders, including 1,500,000 shares repurchased from AutoNation, Inc., for a
total of $10,902,486 in cash. The Company partially funded the stock repurchase by borrowing an additional $9,000,000 against an existing revolving credit facility (See Note 6).

In
June 2003, the Company sold certain assets no longer deemed pertinent to its operations to an existing stockholder in exchange for 80,000 shares of the Company's common stock.
The shares, which were subsequently retired, were valued at $560,000.

On
October 2, 2003, the Securities and Exchange Commission declared effective the registration statement pursuant to which the Company sold 5.0 million shares in its
initial public offering. Pursuant to the same registration statement, the selling stockholders named in the registration statement sold approximately 3.1 million shares of the Company's common
stock. On October 8, 2003, the transaction was closed and the Company received approximately $60,450,000, net of underwriting discount and before offering related expenses of approximately
$2,181,000, for the common stock it issued and sold. The Company did not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares by the selling stockholders.

On
October 8, 2003, the Company increased the number of its authorized shares of Common Stock from 100,000,000 shares to 500,000,000 shares.

On
February 20, 2004, in connection with a business acquisition, the Company issued 84,345 shares of its common stock. The purchase agreement contained a provision that if
the average market price of the Company's common stock on the five business days immediately preceding the first anniversary of such acquisition was below $16.00 per share, the Company would make an
additional payment per share (in cash or in common stock, at the Company's option) equal to $16.00 minus the average closing price over such five day period. The actual average closing price of the
Company's common stock on the five business days immediately preceding the first anniversary of the acquisition exceeded $16.00 per share, and no additional payment was required.

Note 3. Equity Incentive Plans

In February 1998, the Company adopted the Equity Incentive Plan to attract and retain employees and consultants. Under the Equity Incentive Plan, both
qualified and nonqualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, performance shares and performance units may be granted. On March 6, 2002, the Company's stockholders
approved an increase in the number of shares available under the Equity Incentive Plan from 3,000,000 to 5,000,000, subject to antidilution and other adjustment provisions.

In
November 1998, the Company also adopted the CEO Plan. The terms of the CEO Plan are substantially the same as the terms of the Equity Incentive Plan except that the exercise
price of options granted under the CEO Plan may be less than the fair market value of the Company's common stock on the date the option is granted. During 1998, the Company granted 175,000 options
under the CEO Plan with an exercise price of $10.00 per share at a time when the fair value of the Company's stock was $12.50 per share, thus creating deferred compensation expense. The difference
between the fair market value and the option exercise price was recorded as deferred compensation expense and


was
charged to operations over the vesting period of the options, which ended in November 2003. There are no additional shares available for award under the CEO Plan.

In
June 2003, the Company's Board of Directors adopted the Director Plan and in September 2003, the plan was approved by the Company's stockholders. Options granted under
the Director Plan are automatic and nondiscretionary, and the exercise price of the options is 100% of the fair market value of the Company's stock on the grant date. Only non-employee
directors are eligible for grants under the Director Plan. Under the plan, each non-employee director received an initial grant of an option to purchase 30,000 shares of common stock as of
October 2, 2003. The plan also provides for an initial grant to a new non-employee director of an option to purchase 30,000 shares of common stock upon election to the board of
directors. Subsequent to the initial grants, each non-employee director will be automatically granted an option to purchase 10,000 shares of common stock on each anniversary of the
granting of the initial stock option
to that non-employee director. The Director Plan will terminate in June 2013, unless the board of directors terminates it sooner. The number of shares available under the Director
Plan is 500,000, subject to antidilution and other adjustment provisions.

At
December 31, 2003 and 2002, options to purchase 1,903,233 and 1,646,865 shares of common stock were exercisable pursuant to the Company's stock-based compensation plans with a
weighted-average exercise price of $11.26 and $10.73, respectively.

Stock
options expire 10 years from the date they are granted. Options granted under the Equity Incentive Plan and the CEO Plan generally vest over a period of five years. Options
granted under the Director Plan vest six months after the date of grant.

On
December 27, 2004, the Company's Board of Directors amended the award of 200,000 options granted to its Chairman on January 29, 2004 under the Equity Incentive Plan,
accelerating the vesting schedule to make all unvested shares subject to the options immediately exercisable. The Company recognized compensation expense of approximately $157,000 in the fourth
quarter of 2004 in connection with this amendment. The Board of Directors decided to accelerate the vesting schedule of these options in order to conform the vesting to grants normally made under the
Director Plan. In addition, the Board of Directors decided it was in the best interests of stockholders to accelerate these options as the Company will avoid compensation expense in future periods
that would otherwise result from the effectiveness of SFAS 123R for periods beginning subsequent to June 15, 2005.

On
January 7, 2005, the Company's Board of Directors approved the 2005 annual grant of stock options to employees (the "2005 Options"). On January 14, 2005, options to
purchase a total of 422,000 shares of LKQ common stock with an exercise price of $17.68 per share were granted. The vesting schedule for each of the 2005 Options is as follows: June 14, 2005
with respect to 50% of the number of shares subject to such option and, with respect to an additional 5.555% of the number of shares subject to such option, January 14, 2006 and each six month
anniversary thereafter until January 14, 2010. This vesting schedule is different than the vesting schedule for options previously granted under the Equity Incentive Plan.

On
January 10, 2005, the Company's Board of Directors amended the vesting schedule of a total of 428,500 options granted to employees in 2004 under the Equity Incentive Plan,
accelerating the vesting schedule to make all unvested shares subject to the options exercisable on January 10, 2005. The Compensation Committee decided to accelerate the vesting schedule of
these options primarily as a supplement to compensation due to the expected reduction of cash bonuses to employees for the 2004 calendar year. The bonus formula established by the Company in January
2004 resulted in reduced 2004 bonuses for many LKQ employees as compared to 2003. In addition, the Compensation


Committee
decided it was in the best interests of stockholders to accelerate these options as the Company will avoid compensation expense in future periods that would otherwise result from the
effectiveness of SFAS 123R for periods beginning subsequent to June 15, 2005.

On
January 28, 2005, the Company's Board of Directors granted options to purchase a total of 300,000 shares of LKQ common stock at an exercise price $16.66 per share. The options
were immediately exercisable with respect to all of the shares subject to the options. This vesting schedule is different than the vesting schedule for options previously granted under the Equity

The Company subleased its corporate office space from an entity owned by one of its principal stockholders for a pro rata percentage of the rent that was charged
to that entity. The sublease expired on July 31, 2004. The total amounts paid to this entity were approximately $163,000, $254,000 and $263,000 during each of the years ended
December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Beginning in August 2004, the Company subleased a portion of its corporate office space to an entity owned by one of its principal
stockholders for a pro rata percentage of the rent that the Company is charged. The total amount received from this entity during 2004 was $33,900.

A
corporation owned by the Company's Chairman of the Board, who is one of the Company's principal stockholders, owns a private aircraft that the Company uses from time to time for
business trips. The Company reimburses this corporation for out-of-pocket and other related flight expenses, as well as for other direct expenses incurred. The total amounts
paid to this corporation were approximately $54,700, $152,900 and $12,800 during each of the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

The
Company sells products to various repair facilities owned by a company that was previously one of its principal stockholders. This corporation ceased being a stockholder of the
Company in October 2003. The amount of such sales totaled approximately $2,741,000 and $2,203,000 during the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

In
connection with the acquisitions of several businesses during 1998 and 1999, the Company entered into agreements with several sellers of those businesses, who became stockholders as a
result of those acquisitions, for the lease of certain properties used in its salvage operations. Typical lease terms included an initial term of five years, with three five-year renewal
options and purchase options at various times throughout the lease periods. The Company also maintains the right of first refusal concerning the sale of the leased property. Lease payments to a
principal stockholder who became an officer of the Company after the acquisition of his business were approximately $794,000, $747,000 and $714,000 during the years ended December 31, 2004,
2003 and 2002, respectively.


In June 2003, the Company sold certain assets no longer deemed pertinent to its operations to an existing stockholder in exchange for 80,000 shares of the
Company's common stock. See Note 2 for further discussion.

The
Company believes that the related party transactions described above are comparable to those available from unaffiliated third parties.

Note 5. Retirement Plans

The Company sponsors the LKQ Corporation Employees' Retirement Plan (the "Plan"), a qualified defined contribution plan covering substantially all full time
employees not covered by qualified plans maintained by subsidiaries. Employees may contribute up to 15% of eligible compensation, subject to certain Internal Revenue Service limitations. The Company
will match 50% of the portion of the employee's contributions that does not exceed 6% of the employee's salary. Matching Company contributions vest over a four year period and totaled $1,173,000,
$1,031,000 and $942,000 in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The Company may also, at its sole discretion, make annual profit-sharing contributions to the Plan. There were no such discretionary
profit sharing contributions to the Plan in 2004, 2003 or 2002. All contribution levels may be subject to further limits, under Internal Revenue Service guidelines.

Two
of the companies acquired by the Company during 2004, Foster Auto Parts, Inc. and Global Trade Alliance, Inc. (See Note 9), also maintain qualified defined
contribution plans covering substantially all of their full time employees. Expenses related to these plans totaled $105,000 during 2004.

The
Company also offers a nonqualified deferred compensation plan to eligible employees who, due to Internal Revenue Service guidelines, may not take full advantage of the LKQ
Corporation Employees' Retirement Plan. The plan allows each participant to defer up to 50% of eligible compensation, with a maximum deferral of $50,000 per year. The Company will match 50% of the
portion of the employee's contributions that does not exceed 6% of the employee's salary. The deferred compensation, together with Company matching contributions and accumulated earnings, is accrued
and is payable after
retirement or termination of employment, subject to vesting provisions. Participants may also elect to receive amounts deferred in a given year on any plan anniversary five or more years subsequent to
the year of deferral. Matching Company contributions vest over a four year period and totaled $5,000, $25,000 and $20,000 in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The deferred compensation plan is funded
under a trust agreement whereby the Company pays to the trust amounts deferred by employees, together with the Company match, with such amounts invested in the life insurance policies carried to meet
the obligations under the deferred compensation plan. The cash surrender value of these policies was approximately $1,688,000 and $1,183,000 at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, and is
included in Other Assets in the accompanying balance sheets. Total deferred compensation liabilities were approximately $2,085,000 and $1,482,000 at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively,
and are included in Accrued payroll-related liabilities and Other Noncurrent Liabilities in the accompanying balance sheets.

A
subsidiary of the Company has a nonqualified retirement plan that the Company agreed to continue when the subsidiary was acquired in 1998. The plan is funded by the Company through
premium payments on Company-owned life insurance policies that are carried to meet the obligations under the plan. The cash surrender value of these policies was approximately $169,000 and $143,000 at


December 31,
2004 and 2003, respectively, and is included in Other Assets in the accompanying balance sheets. The annual expense for this plan is approximately $30,000. Total obligations were
approximately $385,000 and $356,000 at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, and are included in Other Noncurrent Liabilities in the accompanying balance sheets.

On
February 17, 2004, the Company entered into a new unsecured revolving credit facility that matures in February 2007, replacing a secured credit facility that would have
expired on June 30, 2005. As a result, the Company recorded a loss of $346,000 in 2004 from the write-off of debt issuance costs related to the previous secured facility. The new
revolving credit facility had a maximum availability of $75,000,000. On January 31, 2005, the revolving credit facility was amended to increase the maximum availability from $75,000,000 to
$100,000,000. In order to make any borrowing under the revolving credit facility, after giving effect to such borrowing, the Company must be in compliance with all of the covenants under the credit
facility, including without limitation a senior debt to EBITDA ratio which cannot exceed 2.50 to 1.00. The revolving credit facility contains customary covenants, including, among other things,
limitations on the payment of cash dividends, restrictions on the payment of other dividends and on purchases, redemptions and acquisitions of the Company's stock, limitations on


additional
indebtedness, certain limitations on acquisitions, mergers and consolidations, and the maintenance of certain financial ratios. The interest rate on advances under the revolving credit
facility may be either the bank prime lending rate, on the one hand, or the Interbank Offering Rate ("IBOR") plus an additional percentage ranging from .875% to 1.375%, on the other hand, at the
Company's option. The percentage added to IBOR is dependent upon the Company's total funded debt to EBITDA ratio for the trailing four quarters. The Company was in compliance with all covenants
throughout 2004 and 2003. The weighted-average interest rate on borrowings outstanding against the Company's credit facility at December 31, 2004 was 3.16%. Borrowings against the credit
facility totaled $47,000,000 at December 31, 2004, and are classified as long-term obligations.

The
Company's previous secured credit facility consisted of a revolving line of credit (the "Revolving Facility") with a maximum availability of $40,000,000 and a $20,000,000 term loan
("Term Loan A"). Term Loan A required scheduled quarterly repayments beginning December 31, 2002 with a final payment due on June 30, 2005, but was fully paid during October 2003.
On February 20, 2003 the Company's previous credit facility was amended to provide an additional term loan ("Term Loan B") in the amount of $9,000,000. Term Loan B was scheduled to mature on
February 20, 2004, but was fully paid during October 2003. There were no borrowings outstanding against the Revolving Facility at December 31, 2003.

During
August 2002, the Company entered into a two-year interest rate swap agreement with a total notional amount of $10,000,000 and a fixed rate of 2.65%. The
agreement matured in August, 2004. The counterparty to the agreement was a member of the Company's bank group. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company was required to make quarterly payments at
the specified fixed rate and in return received payments at variable rates. The estimated fair value of the interest rate swap at December 31, 2003 was a loss of $105,666 and was included in
Other Noncurrent Liabilities and Accrued expenses. In accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," as amended, the changes in
the fair value of the interest rate swap were included in current period earnings, as the agreement had not been designated as a hedging instrument.

During
January 2004, the Company fully paid all of its outstanding capital lease obligations as permitted under the contracts and acquired the related properties. The Company
recorded a gain of $49,000 before taxes from the early extinguishment of these capital lease obligations.

On
January 28, 2004, as part of the consideration for a business acquisition, the Company issued a promissory note in the amount of $1,000,000. The note is secured by certain real
property owned by the Company. The annual interest rate on the note is 3.5%. Monthly payments of interest and principal totaling $9,889 are required, with the remaining outstanding principal balance
due in a lump sum payment on January 28, 2009.

On
February 25, 2004, as part of the consideration for a business acquisition, the Company issued two promissory notes totaling $1,250,000. The annual interest rate on the notes
is 3.5% and interest is payable annually. The notes mature on February 25, 2006. At the option of the Company, the maturity of the notes may be extended to February 25, 2008. The annual
interest rate on the notes during the extension period would be 5.0%.

On
June 10, 2004, as part of the consideration for a business acquisition, the Company issued a promissory note in the amount of $129,186. The annual interest rate on the note is
3.0% and the note, along with accrued interest, is payable at maturity on June 10, 2006.


The
Company assumed certain liabilities in connection with a business acquisition during the first quarter of 2004, including two bankers acceptances totaling $1,150,000. The annual
interest rate on the bankers acceptances, which were fully paid during the second quarter of 2004, was 2.94%.

Note 7. Commitments and Contingencies

The Company is obligated under noncancelable operating leases for corporate office space, warehouse and distribution facilities, trucks and certain equipment.

The
future minimum lease commitments under these leases at December 31, 2004 are as follows:

Years ending December 31:


$

10,061,000


8,274,000


7,511,000


6,604,000


3,094,000

Thereafter

499,000

$

36,043,000

Rental
expense for operating leases was approximately $9,631,000, $7,962,000 and $7,431,000 during the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

During
2003, the Company leased certain land and facilities under agreements that were classified as capital leases. Assets recorded under capital leases at December 31, 2003
consisted of:

Land and improvements

$

1,560,100

Buildings and improvements

2,147,264

3,707,364

Accumulated depreciation

(515,362

)

Net assets under capital leases

$

3,192,002

During
January 2004, the Company fully paid all the outstanding capital lease obligations as permitted under the contracts and acquired the related properties. The Company
recorded a gain of $49,000 before taxes from the early extinguishment of these capital lease obligations.

The
Company guaranties the residual values of the majority of its truck and equipment operating leases. The residual values decline over the lease terms to a defined percentage of
original cost. In the event the lessor does not realize the residual value when a piece of equipment is sold, the Company would be responsible for a portion of the shortfall. Similarly, if the lessor
realizes more than the residual value when a piece of equipment is sold, the Company would be paid the amount realized over the residual value. Had the Company terminated all of its operating leases
subject to these guaranties at December 31, 2004, the guarantied residual value would have totaled approximately $7,757,000.

The
Company also has certain other contingent liabilities resulting from litigation, claims and other commitments and is subject to a variety of environmental and pollution control laws
and regulations incident to the ordinary course of business. Management believes that the probable resolution of such


contingencies
will not materially affect the financial position, results of operations or cash flows of the Company.

Note 9. Business Combinations

During 2004, the Company acquired a 100% equity interest in each of six businesses (five in the recycled OEM automotive parts business, including on
October 26, 2004 Foster Auto Parts, Inc., and, on February 20, 2004, Global Trade Alliance, Inc., one of the largest suppliers of aftermarket collision automotive
replacement parts in the Midwest) for an aggregate of $61,651,000 in cash, of which $50,000 is to be paid subsequent to December 31, 2004, $2,379,000 in notes issued (see Note 6) and
186,698
shares of the Company's common stock. The acquisitions enabled the Company to serve new market areas, become a significant provider of aftermarket automotive collision parts and become a provider of
self-service retail automotive parts.

During
2003, the Company acquired three automotive recycling businesses located in upstate New York, California and Nevada for an aggregate of $3,286,000 in cash, $200,000 in notes
issued and 50,000 redeemable shares of the Company's common stock. The business combinations enabled the Company to serve new market areas. The Company did not complete any acquisitions during the
year ended December 31, 2002.

The
acquisitions are being accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and are included in the Company's financial statements from the dates of acquisition. The purchase prices
were allocated to the net assets acquired based upon estimated fair market values at the dates of acquisition.

The
purchase price allocations for the acquisitions completed during the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 are as follows:

Note 10. Income Taxes

The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with SFAS No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes." Accordingly, deferred income taxes have been provided
to show the effect of temporary
differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements. A valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets if it is more likely than
not that these items will either expire before the Company is able to realize their benefit, or that future deductibility is uncertain.

Prepaid
expenses included approximately $208,000 at December 31, 2003 in tax payments made by the Company, which were refunded or applied to the Company's 2004 income tax
liabilities.

In
connection with the adoption of SFAS 142, the Company recorded a deferred tax asset totaling $16,120,700 during 2002. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, the Company had net
operating loss carryforwards for certain of its state tax jurisdictions, the tax benefits of which total $2,332,000 and $2,100,000, respectively. A valuation allowance has been established for a
portion of these deferred tax assets. The tax benefits expire over the period from 2005 through 2024. While the Company expects to realize the deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances, changes
in estimates of future taxable income or in tax laws may alter this expectation.

The
Internal Revenue Service is currently performing an income tax audit of the Company for the 2002 tax year, and the Company has been notified by one state of an income tax audit for
the 2001, 2002 and 2003 tax years. Adjustments from such audits, if any, are not expected to have a material effect on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.

ITEM 9A.    CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

REPORT OF MANAGEMENT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

March 8, 2005

Management of LKQ Corporation and subsidiaries (the "Company") is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting
as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States. Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company, (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation
of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the Company, and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets
that could have a material effect on the Company's financial statements.

Internal
control over financial reporting includes the controls themselves, monitoring and internal auditing practices and actions taken to correct deficiencies as identified.

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Management
assessed the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004. Management based this assessment on criteria for
effective internal control over financial reporting described in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Management's assessment included an evaluation of the design of the Company's internal control over financial reporting and testing of the operational
effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting. Management reviewed the results of its assessment with the Audit Committee of the Company's Board of Directors.

Based
on this assessment, management determined that, as of December 31, 2004, the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting.

Deloitte &
Touche, LLP, independent registered public accounting firm, who audited and reported on the consolidated financial statements of the Company included in this report,
has issued an attestation report on management's assessment of internal control over financial reporting.


REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To
the Board of Directors and Stockholders of LKQ Corporation:

We
have audited management's assessment, included in the accompanying Report of Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting dated March 8, 2005, that LKQ Corporation
and subsidiaries (the "Company") maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on criteria established in

Internal
Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company's management is responsible for maintaining
effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
management's assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control
over financial reporting, evaluating management's assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we considered
necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A
company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company's principal executive and principal financial officers, or
persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company's board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;
(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that
receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and
(3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.

Because
of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material
misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to
future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In
our opinion, management's assessment that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, is fairly stated, in all material
respects, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
the Treadway Commission. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on the
criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission.


We
have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements and financial statement
schedule as of and for the year ended December 31, 2004 of the Company and our report dated March 8, 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and financial
statement schedule and included an explanatory paragraph related to a change in accounting for goodwill and intangible assets upon adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 142,

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
