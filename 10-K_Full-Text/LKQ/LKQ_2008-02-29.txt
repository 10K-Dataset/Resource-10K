ITEM 1.    BUSINESS

Overview

We provide replacement systems, components, and parts needed to repair light vehicles (cars and light trucks). Buyers of light vehicle replacement products have
the option to purchase from primarily three sources: new products produced by original equipment manufacturers ("OEMs"), which are commonly known as OEM products; new products produced by companies
other than the OEMs, which are sometimes referred to generically as "aftermarket" products; and recycled products originally produced by OEMs, which we refer to as recycled OEM products. We
participate in the market for recycled OEM products as well as the market for collision repair aftermarket products. We obtain aftermarket products and salvage vehicles from a variety of sources, and
we dismantle the salvage vehicles to obtain a comprehensive range of vehicle products that we distribute into the light vehicle repair market. We also refurbish bumpers, wheels, head lamps and tail
lamps.

We
are the largest nationwide provider of recycled OEM products and related services, with sales, processing, and distribution facilities that reach most major markets in the U.S. In
October 2007, we acquired Keystone Automotive Industries, Inc., the nation's leading distributer of aftermarket collision replacement products. As a result, we are the largest nationwide
provider of aftermarket collision replacement products, and refurbished bumper covers and wheels. We believe there are opportunities for growth in all of our product lines through acquisitions and
internal development.

We
procure salvage vehicles, primarily at auctions, using our locally based professionals, proprietary processes, and a disciplined procurement system. In addition, as an alternative
source of salvage
vehicles, we obtain some inventory directly from insurance companies, vehicle manufacturers, and other suppliers. Once we have received proper title, which serves as a safeguard that the vehicles have
not been stolen, we dismantle such vehicles for recycled OEM products. We purchase aftermarket products from manufacturers, primarily in Taiwan, using proprietary order management systems.

Our
customers include collision and mechanical repair shops and, indirectly, insurance companies, including extended warranty companies. The majority of our products and services are
sold to collision repair shops, also known as body shops, and mechanical repair shops. We indirectly rely on insurance companies, which ultimately pay the collision repair shops for the repair of
insured vehicles, as a source of business. These insurance companies exert significant influence in the vehicle repair decision, and


increasingly
look to a nationwide source for consistency, quality, and availability of replacement products. Because of their importance to the process, we have formed business relationships with
certain insurance companies, and with certain extended warranty providers, in order to be their preferred light vehicle alternative parts supplier. For example, with some insurance companies we have
vehicle repair order estimate review programs in place and provide their claims adjusters a part quote and locator service. In addition, we provide them an outlet to dispose of certain total loss
vehicles directly to us. We provide extended warranty companies a single national call desk to service their nationwide needs for mechanical products.

We
believe we provide customers a value proposition that includes high quality products, extensive product availability due to our regional inventory trading zones, product costs lower
than new OEM products, and quick delivery. We provide benefits to repair shops and insurance companies because the lower costs for our products enable many vehicles to be repaired rather than declared
a total loss. By expanding our product offerings to include recycled OEM products, aftermarket products, and refurbished bumpers, wheels and head and tail lamps, we now offer customers an extensive
range of light vehicle replacement products. We believe this unique combination of recycled, aftermarket and refurbished products allows us to serve as a "one-stop" solution for our
customers looking for the most cost advantageous way to repair vehicles.

We
believe that our business is environmentally responsible. Our recycled automotive products provide an alternative to the manufacture of new products, which would require the
expenditure of significantly more resources and energy and would generate a substantial amount of additional pollution. Also, we recycle materials, such as fuel, motor oil, and freon, from the salvage
vehicles that we procure.

Our History

We believe we were the first recycler of light vehicle products to achieve a national network and presence. Since our formation in 1998, we have grown through
both internal development and acquisitions. Our acquisition strategy has been to target companies with strategic locations and
significant market presence, strong management teams, a record of environmental compliance, solid growth prospects, and a reputation for quality and customer service.

In
February 2004, we expanded our product offerings by acquiring a supplier of aftermarket products and a provider of self-service retail recycled vehicle products.

In
January 2006, we acquired an aluminum alloy wheel refurbishing business.

In
January 2007, we acquired a head and tail lamp refurbishing company.

In
October 2007, we significantly increased our size by acquiring Keystone Automotive Industries, Inc. At the time of the acquisition, Keystone was the leading distributor of
aftermarket collision replacement parts. Keystone also refurbished alloy wheels, which added to our existing wheel business. The Keystone acquisition also expanded our product offerings with the
following: refurbishing of chrome plated and plastic bumpers and the distribution of paint and other materials used in the repair of damaged vehicles.

With
the acquisition of Keystone, the percentage of our revenue that will be derived from the sales of aftermarket and refurbished products and services will be higher than in previous
years. Assuming that we owned Keystone for the entire year ended December 31, 2007, revenue derived from recycled OEM products and related services would have represented approximately 31.2% of
our revenue, sales of aftermarket and refurbished products and services would have represented approximately 57.6% of our revenue, and sales of other products, such as scrap and other bulk products,
would have represented approximately 11.2% of our revenue.


Our Strengths

We Provide a National Solution to Insurance Companies and Extended Warranty Providers.

We believe that our nationwide presence gives us a unique ability to service the major automobile insurance companies and extended warranty providers. Insurance
companies and extended warranty providers operate generally at a national or regional level and play a critical role in the repair process. We believe we provide a direct benefit to these companies by
lowering the cost of repairs, decreasing the time required to return the repaired vehicle to the customer, and providing a replacement product that is of comparable quality to the part replaced.
Specifically, we assist insurance companies by purchasing insured total loss vehicles and by providing cost effective products through sales to collision repair shops, especially to repair shops that
are part of an insurance company network. We also provide a review of vehicle repair order estimates to insurance companies so they may assess the opportunity to increase usage of recycled OEM,
aftermarket, and refurbished products. For extended warranty providers, we provide a single national call desk to service their nationwide need for mechanical products.

We Believe We Have the Only National Network for Alternative Automotive Replacement Products and it Would be Difficult to Replicate.

We have invested significant capital developing a national network of recycled OEM and aftermarket product facilities that serves most major metropolitan areas
in the U.S. We have differentiated ourselves from our local competitors and made replication of our network difficult by developing our network through purchasing anchor companies that were among the
largest companies in the industry. The difficulty and time required to obtain proper zoning, as well as dismantling and other environmental permits necessary to operate newly-sited recycled OEM
facilities, would make establishing such new facilities challenging. In addition, there are difficulties associated with recruiting and hiring an experienced management team that has strong industry
knowledge and local relationships with customers. Finally, our national network allows us to enter new adjacent markets quickly by establishing redistribution facilities, which avoids the need for
local dismantling capabilities and inventory.

We Benefit From a Local Presence.

Our network of facilities allows us to develop and maintain our relationships with local repair shops, while providing a level of service to insurance companies
and national customers that is made possible by our nationwide presence. Our local presence allows us to provide daily deliveries that our customers require, using drivers who routinely deliver to the
same customers. Our sales force and local delivery drivers develop and maintain critical personal relationships with the local repair shops that benefit from access to our wide selection of products,
which we are able to offer as a result of our regional inventory network.

We Have a Proven and Effective Procurement Process.

We have information systems and methodologies designed to enable us to procure salvage vehicles and aftermarket products cost-effectively. As our
largest single expenditure, efficient procurement of salvage vehicles and aftermarket products is critical to the growth, operating results and cash flow of our business. Our processes and
know-how allow us to identify and value the parts that can be recycled on a damaged vehicle at auction and to determine rapidly the maximum price we will pay for the vehicle in order to
achieve our target margins on resale of the recycled OEM products. We carefully analyze the market and obtain aftermarket products and salvage vehicles of the type whose parts are in demand at prices
that we believe will allow us to sell products profitably. We have also taken advantage


of
our relationships with insurance companies and vehicle manufacturers to obtain salvage vehicles outside the auction process.

We Have a Broad and Deep Inventory of Products.

We believe that our customers place a high value on availability of a broad range of light vehicle replacement products. We also believe that our inventory of
recycled OEM, aftermarket and refurbished products allows us to fill a higher percentage of our customers' orders than our competitors. In addition, our ability to share inventory on a regional basis
increases the availability of replacement products and also helps us to fill a higher percentage of our customers' orders. We have developed regional trading zones within which we make our inventory
available to our local facilities, mostly via overnight product transfers. We manage our inventory and purchasing on a regional basis to enhance the availability of the products that we believe will
be in the highest demand within each region. Our broad and deep inventory furthers our ability to serve as a "one-stop" solution for our customers' recycled OEM, aftermarket and
refurbished product needs.

We Have Implemented Management Disciplines.

Our management and operations team is highly experienced, with many managers having spent their entire careers in the light vehicle replacement parts industry.
We have developed and built procurement, operating, and financial systems that have allowed us to grow and develop our national network and implement professional management techniques and
disciplines. As our business has grown, we have acquired additional management talent that has furthered the sharing of best practices throughout the company. In addition, our senior management team
has extensive acquisition experience and will continue to use our disciplined approach in targeting growth opportunities.

Our Strategies

Strengthen our North American Network Through Internal Growth and Acquisitions.

Our current focus is to integrate the Keystone operations into our own and attempt to maximize the synergies of the Keystone acquisition. Nevertheless, we intend
to continue to expand our market coverage through a combination of internal development and acquisitions and to look for opportunities to expand into new regions and into adjacent markets. We plan to
establish a presence in additional major metropolitan markets and a number of smaller markets in North America. We have applied an analytical and disciplined approach to our acquisition process and
have targeted companies with strong management teams, a record of environmental compliance, solid growth prospects, and a reputation for quality and customer service. We have also expanded our product
offerings and will continue to consider additional opportunities to expand our product offerings further.

Further Develop Business Relationships.

We intend to continue to develop business relationships with automobile insurance companies, extended warranty providers, and other industry participants. We
believe that insurance companies and extended warranty providers, as payors for many repairs, will take a more active role in the selection of replacement products in the repair process in order to
use lower cost alternatives to new OEM products. On behalf of certain insurance company customers, we provide a review of vehicle repair order estimates so they may assess the opportunity to increase
usage of recycled OEM, aftermarket and refurbished products in the repair process, thereby reducing their costs. Our employees also provide quotes for our products to assist several insurance
companies with their estimate and settlement processes. We also work with insurance companies and light vehicle manufacturers to procure salvage vehicles directly from them on a selected basis, which
provides us an additional source of supply and provides them improved economics on salvage vehicle sales. We believe we are positioned to take


advantage
of the increasing importance of these industry participants and will continue to look for ways to enhance our relationships.

Continue to Improve our Operating Results.

We are working to improve our operating results by applying our business disciplines to our most recently acquired facilities, continuing to build our network,
further centralizing certain functions, improving our use of technology, and increasing revenue at our lower volume facilities. Our higher volume facilities generally operate at a higher profitability
level as a percentage of revenue. We believe we can improve the profitability level at our lower volume facilities by achieving the higher volumes and improved economies of scale that we realize at
our higher volume facilities. We intend to continue to refine our procurement system, which uses methodologies that analyze demand levels for our products, existing inventory levels, and projected
margins on an individual vehicle basis.

Further Develop our Technology and Business Processes.

We continue to emphasize the use of technology in our processes to improve efficiency and to increase the standardization of our business. We continue to develop
our technology to allow us to better manage and analyze our inventory, to assist our sales people with up-to-date pricing and availability of our products, and to further
enhance our procurement process. For example, many of our representatives responsible for procuring vehicles, whom we refer to as "scouts," are equipped with handheld computing devices to assist them
in appraising the vehicles prior to submitting a bid to purchase the vehicle.

Raise Industry Standards by Being the Industry Leader.

Since our inception, we have employed a professional approach to the light vehicle recycling business and have applied the same approach to our aftermarket and
refurbished business. Our leadership position in the collision repair aftermarket industry was further enhanced with our acquisition of Keystone, which was the largest provider of collision repair
aftermarket products. We continue to seek new ways to improve our methodologies and to communicate our standards to our customers. We further believe that, by elevating industry standards in areas
such as customer service, integrity, product quality and availability, delivery time, warranty support, environmental compliance, and appearance of facilities, we can help promote the acceptability of
the use of recycled OEM, aftermarket and refurbished products.

Our Process

Our operations generally involve the procurement of inventory, vehicle processing (in the case of wholesale recycled OEM products), sales, and distribution. We
also perform refurbishing of OEM wheels, bumpers, head lamps and tail lamps. Such refurbishing work is primarily cosmetic.

Procurement of Inventory

We start the process of procuring recycled OEM products for our wholesale operations by acquiring severely damaged or totaled vehicles. We acquired approximately
126,000 salvage vehicles for our wholesale operations in 2007. We purchase the majority of our vehicles from salvage auctions. Wrecked vehicles are sold at salvage auctions held each weekday
throughout the country. Salvage auctions provide an outlet for salvage vehicles to be processed and sold primarily to automotive recyclers and rebuilders. We pay third parties fees to tow the vehicles
from the auction to our facilities. Salvage auctions charge fees both to the supplier of vehicles (primarily insurance companies) and to the purchaser (including us).


For
the vast majority of our salvage auction purchases, we send a scout in advance of each auction to investigate the vehicles we would be interested in buying. The scout obtains key
information such as the model, mileage, and damage assessment and determines which parts on the targeted vehicles are recyclable. This information is electronically forwarded to our bid specialists
via handheld computing devices or facsimile transmissions. The bid specialists analyze the data in light of current demand for the parts in question, the levels of our inventory with respect to such
parts, and the projected margins expected for each vehicle. The specialists then set a maximum bid price that our bidders use to purchase the vehicle at auction. We believe that this system provides a
disciplined approach to procurement.

We
also obtain salvage vehicles and parts from insurance companies, vehicle manufacturers, abandoned vehicle programs, and other salvage sources. Some of these arrangements allow us to
acquire salvage vehicles directly from the insurance company or vehicle manufacturer at a cost calculated as a percentage of revenue, which is remitted as products are sold from these vehicles. These
arrangements eliminate the fees we and the insurance company would otherwise pay to the salvage auction and provide us inventory with a lower initial expenditure of capital.

We
acquire inventory for our self-service recycled OEM products operations from a variety of sources, including but not limited to auctions, towing companies,
municipalities, insurance carriers, charitable organizations and the general public. In 2007, we purchased approximately 197,500 salvage vehicles for our self-service recycled OEM products
operations.

We
purchase aftermarket products from independent manufacturers. If we had owned Keystone for the entire year ended December 31, 2007, approximately 43% of our aftermarket
products would have been purchased and imported directly from manufacturers in Taiwan, and approximately 57% of our aftermarket products would have been purchased from locations in the U.S.; however,
we believe that the majority of these products are manufactured in Taiwan and other Asian countries. No single supplier currently provides more than 27% of our aftermarket products. We use proprietary
order management systems to procure our aftermarket inventory. The systems prompt inventory purchases based on stocking levels and historical sales data. We believe that the systems help us to procure
our aftermarket inventory efficiently and to maintain one of the highest fulfillment rates in the aftermarket products industry.

Vehicle Processing

Vehicle processing for our wholesale operations involves dismantling a salvage vehicle into recycled OEM products ready for delivery. When a salvage vehicle
arrives at one of our facilities, an inventory specialist identifies, catalogs, and schedules the vehicle for dismantling. We do not dismantle any vehicle until we have received proper title
documentation, which serves as a safeguard that the vehicle was not stolen.

The
dismantler removes components that will become products for sale. Products that are placed directly on inventory shelves generally include such items as the engine, transmission,
hood, trunk lid, head and tail lamp assemblies, rear bumper, and doors. We remove all recyclable items including fluids, freon, batteries, tires, and catalytic converters. These items are sold to
recyclers and reprocessors. Dismantlers also perform any required cutting of the vehicle frame or body.

Each
inventory item is entered into our inventory tracking system, inspected for quality, tagged for identification, and prepared for storage and delivery to our customers. Mechanical
products not in a condition to be sold as recycled products or that are in surplus supply are separated and sold in bulk to parts remanufacturers. The remaining vehicle hulks and components, such as
fabrics, rubber, plastics, and glass, are sold to scrap processors.


Refurbishing Process

We refurbish both chrome plated bumpers and plastic bumper covers. The refurbishing process for chrome plated bumpers generally includes some or all of the
following steps: straightening or reforming to original dimensions; welding breaks or cracks; surface grinding to remove rust or corrosion; chemical stripping to remove the original electroplated
finishes; metal polishing and buffing; electroplating layers of copper, or nickel and chromium; and inspecting and packaging.

The
refurbishing process for plastic bumper covers generally includes some or all of the following steps: straightening or reforming to original dimensions with heat; sanding or
sandblasting the surface; using plastic welding techniques when necessary; finishing the surface with various epoxies and similar materials; painting; texturing and color coating as needed; and
inspecting and packaging.

We
refurbish steel and alloy wheels. The refurbishing process for wheels generally includes some or all of the following steps: straightening; welding minor dents or chips;
hand-detailing; painting; machining; applying a clear powder coat; and inspecting and packaging.

We
refurbish head and tail lamps. The refurbishing process for lamps includes: a proprietary method of repairing the housing; sanding and buffing to remove imperfections; cleaning the
lamp; re-coating the lens with a UV protectant coat; reassembling; and inspecting and packaging.

Our
refurbished products are processed from cores obtained from our recycled OEM locations, from customers and from brokers. The higher quality cores are then refurbished. For popular
wheels, we also purchase aftermarket wheels from outside vendors to fill demand.

Sales

As of December 31, 2007, we employed 606 full-time sales staff in our wholesale recycled OEM products operations. Of these, 561 were located
at sales desks at our facilities and generally are responsible for accepting incoming calls from, and selling our inventory to, our customers. We put all of our sales personnel through a thorough
training program. Most of our sales personnel are paid primarily on a commission basis. In addition, as of December 31, 2007, we had approximately 45 traveling sales staff who visit our
customers and focus on business development in various markets.

In
our aftermarket products operations, sales orders are accepted by either our local delivery drivers or by our aftermarket and refurbished products sales personnel at our sales call
centers. As of December 31, 2007, we had approximately 600 employees selling aftermarket and refurbished products at such call centers. Our wholesale recycled OEM sales personnel can also sell
our aftermarket and refurbished products.

We
are continually reviewing and revising the pricing of our recycled OEM products. Our pricing specialists take into consideration factors such as location, recent demand, inventory
quantity, inventory turnover, new OEM product prices, recycled OEM product prices, aftermarket and refurbished product prices, and remanufactured part prices, with the goal of optimizing revenue. We
update the pricing of our aftermarket and refurbished products at least annually when we update our product catalogs or when standard pricing guides are provided to estimating systems. We may adjust
prices during the year in response to material price changes of OEM products.

The
inventory base of each of our facilities, supplemented by the inventory sharing system within our regional trading zones, gives us what we believe to be a competitive advantage
through our ability to meet our customers' requirements more frequently than smaller competitors.

Distribution

Each sale results in the generation of a work order. A dispatcher is then responsible for ensuring product accuracy, printing the final invoice, and including
the products on the appropriate truck route for delivery to the customer. We operate a delivery fleet of medium-sized trucks and smaller trucks and


vans.
These trucks deliver products to our customers within a specified territory, typically on a daily basis. In markets where we offer recycled OEM, aftermarket and refurbished products, we often
deliver more than one product type on the same delivery routes to help minimize distribution costs.

Additionally,
we have developed an internal distribution network to allow our sales representatives to sell recycled OEM, aftermarket and refurbished products from the inventory of
nearby facilities within our regional trading zones, thus improving our ability to fulfill customer requests and to improve inventory turnover. We operate approximately 265 daily transfer runs between
our facilities generally within our trading zones each weekday which carry recycled OEM, aftermarket and refurbished products. In addition, we have approximately 2,400 local delivery routes serving
our customers each weekday.

Our Products

When we procure salvage vehicles, we focus on vehicles for which the insured repair market has the most recycled OEM product demand. These tend to be popular
types of vehicles such as sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks, and automobile models with high sales volume. These vehicles generally are a few model years old, as insurers tend to use new OEM
products on repairs of vehicles that are one to two years old. Similarly, insurers are less likely to authorize the repair of vehicles more than ten model years old. The degree of damage is not a
significant factor in our process as we only assign value to the undamaged products when we prepare our bids.

Our
most popular recycled OEM products include engines, transmissions, vehicle front end assemblies, doors, trunk lids, bumper assemblies, wheels, head and tail lamp assemblies,
mirrors, fenders, and axles.

When
we obtain a mechanical product, wheels, bumpers or certain lighting products from a dismantled vehicle and determine that we have an excess supply of such product or it is
defective, the mechanical item is then sold in bulk to mechanical remanufacturers, while the wheel, bumper and lighting items are sent to our refurbishment locations. We refer to these items as core
products. The majority of the mechanical products are transferred to our core facility in Houston, Texas where we sort them by product and model type. Examples of such products are engine blocks and
heads, transmissions, starters, alternators, and air conditioner compressors.

When
we procure aftermarket products and decide which wheels, bumpers and lights to refurbish, we focus on products that are in the most demand by the insured repair market. Our most
popular aftermarket products are head lamps, tail lamps, grilles, hoods, mirrors, bumpers, bumper covers, and fenders. We offer paint and related repair materials (like tape, sandpaper, paint guns and
frame racks) so that our customers can purchase these products and the alternative automotive repair parts from a single source.

In
1987, the Certified Automotive Parts Association ("CAPA") was founded to provide insurance companies, distributors, collision repair shops and consumers with an objective method of
evaluating the functional equivalence of aftermarket collision replacement products and OEM collision replacement products. CAPA, a non-profit association of insurance companies,
manufacturers, importers, distributors, collision repair shops and consumer groups, establishes the specifications for, tests and certifies the quality of aftermarket collision replacement products.
Through independent testing laboratories, CAPA develops engineering specifications for aftermarket collision replacement products based upon an examination of OEM parts; certifies the factories,
manufacturing processes and quality control procedures used by independent manufacturers; and certifies the materials, fit and finish of specific aftermarket collision replacement products. Many major
insurance companies have adopted policies recommending or requiring the use of parts certified by CAPA, when available. We distribute parts certified by CAPA when available and actively participate
with CAPA, insurance companies and consumer groups in encouraging independent manufacturers of collision replacement products to seek CAPA certification.


Our Customers

Insurance Companies

We consider automobile insurance companies our customers, as they are a key demand driver for our products. Our products are delivered directly to the repair
shop or installer, because insurance companies and extended warranty providers generally do not take receipt of repair parts. While insurance companies do not pay for our products directly, the
insurance company does ultimately pay for the repair of the insured vehicle. As a result, the insurance company often exerts significant influence in the decision-making process as to how a damaged
vehicle is repaired, and the cost level of the product used in the repair process. Insurance companies are also concerned with customer satisfaction with the repair process and the total time to
return the repaired vehicle to its owner.

Repair Shops and Others

We sell the majority of our products wholesale to collision repair shops and mechanical repair shops. The majority of these customers tend to be
individually-owned small businesses, although over the last few years there has been a trend toward consolidation resulting in the formation of several national and regional repair companies. We also
sell our products to automobile dealerships and fleet management groups. In addition, we sell our products to individual retail customers at our self-service retail locations and at
certain of our wholesale recycled OEM, aftermarket and refurbished product locations.

Remanufacturers

A mechanical part that is not suitable for sale as a replacement part, or that is a product for which we have an excess supply, is sold to mechanical
remanufacturers in bulk shipments. Examples of mechanical parts we sell in this manner are engine blocks and heads, transmissions, starters, alternators, and air conditioner compressors.
Remanufacturers usually are significantly larger companies than repair shops. Our sales to them tend to be large orders and are dependent on their needs for a certain product line.

Our Employees

As of December 31, 2007, we had approximately 9,100 employees. In July 2006, approximately 60 of our employees at our Totowa, New Jersey facility voted to
be represented by a union. We signed a collective bargaining agreement with the union in July 2007. Approximately 200 of our employees at our bumper refurbishing plant in Mexico and approximately 130
of our employees at our recycled OEM parts facility in Quebec City, Canada are also represented by unions. Other than these locations, none of our employees is a member of a union or participates in
other collective bargaining arrangements.

Our Facilities

Our corporate headquarters are located at 120 North LaSalle Street, Suite 3300, Chicago, Illinois 60602. In February 2004, we entered into a new lease,
which became effective on August 1, 2004, to remain in our current office space. The term of the new lease is ten years, but either party can terminate the lease in July 2009. We also have
regional offices throughout the United States and Keystone offices in Nashville, Tennessee and Pomona, California, all of which perform corporate functions. The primary functions performed at our
corporate offices are financial, accounting, treasury, marketing, business development, human resources, information systems support, and legal. In addition to our corporate offices, we have numerous
operating facilities that handle recycled OEM, aftermarket, refurbished, and self-service retail products. We operate out of a total of approximately 300 physical locations. A majority of
these locations are leased. Some of our locations include more than one of our


different
types of products. Thus, some of our facilities may be described under more than one category below.

Recycled OEM Parts

Our wholesale recycled OEM parts facilities are located among eight geographic regions. A typical facility has processing, sales and distribution operations,
including a large warehouse with multiple bays to dismantle vehicles, indoor and outdoor storage areas, and administrative and sales offices. Equipment typically used at each facility includes
hydraulic lifts, forklifts and loaders, and hand tools to dismantle vehicles. We also have facilities that operate primarily as redistribution centers. As of December 31, 2007, we conducted our
wholesale recycled OEM parts operations from 70 facilities, 55 of which include a combination of processing, sales and redistribution operations, and 15 of which are primarily redistribution
facilities. We also have four recycled OEM parts facilities in Central America.

Aftermarket Parts

We conduct our aftermarket parts business from facilities that serve as sales, warehousing or distribution centers for these parts. As of December 31,
2007, we conducted our aftermarket parts operations from 191 facilities in the United States and Canada. This number of facilities will be reduced as we continue to integrate the Keystone acquisition
throughout 2008.

Refurbished Parts

We refurbish bumpers and wheels at 64 locations in the United States and Canada and one location in northeast Mexico. We refurbish head lamps and tail lamps
primarily at a facility in Grand Rapids, Michigan.

Self-Service Retail Parts

Our self-service retail parts facilities typically consist of several acres of vehicles stored outdoors and a retail building through which customers
access the vehicles. As of December 31, 2007, we conducted our self-service retail parts operations from 27 facilities in the United States.

Competition

We operate in a highly competitive industry. We consider all suppliers of light vehicle products to be competitors, including participants in the recycled OEM
product market, OEMs, parts remanufacturers, suppliers of aftermarket and refurbished products, and internet-based suppliers. We believe the principal areas of competition in our industry include
pricing, product quality, service, and availability of inventory.

We
compete with more than 6,000 domestic light vehicle product recyclers, most of which are single-unit operators. We believe most of the light vehicle parts recyclers in
the U.S. have less than $3.0 million in annual revenue. In some markets, smaller competitors have organized affiliations to share marketing and distribution resources. Greenleaf LLC, a
light vehicle recycling business started by Ford Motor Company, is our largest competitor in the light vehicle OEM product recycling business. Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc., a company with
operations in the steel manufacturing, metals recycling, and vehicle product recycling businesses, purchased Greenleaf on September 30, 2005. Schnitzer Steel is a significant operator in the
self-service retail recycling business.

We
also compete with distributors of aftermarket and refurbished collision light vehicle products. The distribution of aftermarket collision parts is highly fragmented and our
competitors, other than OEMs, generally are independently owned distributors having from one to three distribution centers.

Manufacturers
of new original equipment parts sell the majority of light vehicle replacement products. We believe, however, that as the insurance and repair industries come to
appreciate the


advantages
of recycled OEM, aftermarket and refurbished products, those products can account for a larger percentage of total vehicle replacement product sales.

Information Technology

We use a single third party facility management system in most of our wholesale recycled OEM operations. We believe that a single system helps us with the
continued implementation of standard operating procedures, training efficiency, employee transferability, access to a national inventory database, management reporting, and data storage. It also
eliminates the need to create multiple versions of proprietary applications and systems support processes.

The
major features of our facility management system include inventory control, customer selling and billing, sales analysis, vehicle tracking, and profitability reporting. The system
also supports an electronic exchange system for identifying and locating parts at other selected recyclers and facilitates brokered sales to fill customer orders for items not in stock.

We
have separate third party providers for our financial systems such as financial and budget reporting, general ledger accounting, accounts payable, payroll, and fixed assets. We
intend to implement a common financial reporting system throughout our organization.

We
currently protect our local customer, inventory, and corporate consolidated data, such as financial information, e-mail files, and other user files, with daily backups.
These backups are stored off site with a third party data protection vendor.

We
have consolidated our facility management systems onto regional system platforms. The hardware for all such platforms is located at a single data center. The center is in a secure
environment with around-the-clock monitoring; redundant power backup; and multiple, diverse data and telecommunication routing. Facility management system data is "mirrored"
(replicated) off site in real time to a disaster recovery facility located in a different part of the country. This disaster recovery facility is also housed in a secure environment with
around-the-clock monitoring; redundant power backup; and multiple, diverse data and telecommunications routing.

We
use a single third party facility management system in most of our aftermarket operations. The locations that currently use separate systems are earmarked for conversion to our
standard platform in 2008. Additional third party software packages have been implemented to leverage the centralized data and information that a single system provides, such as a data warehouse to
conduct enhanced analytics and reporting, an integrated budgeting system, a supply chain collaboration and EDI tool, and eCommerce tools to enhance our online
Business-to-Business initiative, OrderKeystone.com.

The
Company's critical aftermarket management systems are housed at a third-party, off site data center that is fully redundant across its infrastructure to ensure operations are
continuously maintained. The data center is secure and monitored 24 hours a day throughout the year by skilled technical staff. Systems are backed up daily and stored off site with a third party
storage and archiving company.

We
use a single facility management system in most of our refurbishing and self-service retail operations.

We
continually evaluate our systems with the goal of ensuring that all critical systems remain scaleable and operational as we continue to grow.

Regulation

Environmental Compliance

Our operations and properties, including the maintenance of our delivery vehicles, are subject to extensive federal, state, and local environmental protection
and health and safety laws and regulations. These environmental laws govern, among other things, the emission and discharge of hazardous


materials
into the ground, air, or water; exposure to hazardous materials; and the generation, handling, storage, use, treatment, identification, transportation, and disposal of industrial
by-products, waste water, storm water, and mercury and other hazardous materials.

We
have made and will continue to make capital and other expenditures relating to environmental matters. We have an environmental management process designed to facilitate and support
our compliance with these requirements. We cannot assure you, however, that we will at all times be in complete compliance with such requirements.

Although
we presently do not expect to incur any capital or other expenditures relating to environmental controls or other environmental matters in amounts that would be material to us,
we may be required to make such expenditures in the future. Environmental laws are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that
environmental laws will not change or become more stringent in the future in a manner that could have a material adverse effect on our business.

Contamination
resulting from vehicle recycling processes can include soil and ground water contamination from the release, storage, transportation, or disposal of gasoline, motor oil,
antifreeze, transmission fluid, CFCs from air conditioners, other hazardous materials, or metals such as aluminum, cadmium, chromium, lead, and mercury. Contamination from the refurbishment of chrome
plated bumpers can occur from the release of the plating material. Contamination can migrate on-site or off-site which can increase the risk, and the amount, of any potential
liability.

In
addition, many of our facilities are located on or near properties with a history of industrial use that may have involved hazardous materials. As a result, some of our properties
may be contaminated. Some environmental laws hold current or previous owners or operators of real property liable for the costs of cleaning up contamination, even if these owners or operators did not
know of and were not responsible for such contamination. These environmental laws also impose liability on any person who disposes of, treats, or arranges for the disposal or treatment of hazardous
substances, regardless of whether the affected site is owned or operated by such person, and at times can impose liability on companies deemed under law to be a successor to such person. Third parties
may also make claims against owners or operators of properties, or successors to such owners or operators, for personal injuries and property damage associated with releases of hazardous or toxic
substances.

When
we identify a potential material environmental issue during our acquisition due diligence process, we analyze the risks, and, when appropriate, perform further environmental
assessment to verify and quantify the extent of the potential contamination. Furthermore, where appropriate, we have established financial reserves for certain environmental matters. In addition, at
times we, or one of the sellers from whom we purchased a business, have undertaken remediation projects. We do not anticipate, based on currently available information and current laws, that we will
incur liabilities in excess of reserves to address environmental matters. However, in the event we discover new information or if laws change, we may incur significant liabilities, which may exceed
our reserves.

Title Laws

In some states, when a vehicle is deemed a total loss, a salvage title is issued. Whether states issue salvage titles is important to the light vehicle recycling
industry because an increase in vehicles that qualify as salvage vehicles provides greater availability and typically lowers the price of such vehicles. Currently, these titling issues are a matter of
state law. In 1992, the U.S. Congress commissioned an advisory committee to study problems relating to vehicle titling, registration, and salvage. Since then, legislation has been introduced seeking
to establish national uniform requirements in this area, including a uniform definition of a salvage vehicle. The light vehicle recycling industry will generally favor a uniform definition, since it
will avoid inconsistencies across state lines, and will generally favor a definition that expands the number of damaged vehicles that qualify as salvage. However, certain interest groups, including
repair shops and some insurance associations, may oppose


this
type of legislation. National legislation has not yet been enacted in this area, and there can be no assurance that such legislation will be enacted in the future.

National Stolen Passenger Motor Vehicle Information System

In 1992, Congress enacted the Anti Car Theft Act to deter trafficking in stolen vehicles. This law included the establishment of the National Stolen Passenger
Motor Vehicle Information System to track and monitor stolen automotive parts. In April 2002, the Department of Justice published for comment proposed regulations to implement the National Stolen
Passenger Motor Vehicle Information System. The proposed regulations require, among other things, that insurance companies, salvagers, dismantlers, recyclers, and repairers inspect salvage vehicles
for the purpose of collecting the vehicle identification number and the part number for any "covered major part" that possesses the vehicle identification number. The requirement to collect this
information would place substantial burdens on light vehicle recyclers, including us, that otherwise would not normally exist. It would place similar burdens on repair shops, which may further
discourage the use by such shops of recycled products. The Department of Justice's comment period for the proposed regulations ended in June 2002, but final regulations have not been issued. In
February 2008, several consumer groups sued the Department of Justice in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California requesting that the court order the Department of
Justice to implement the system.

Legislation Affecting Automotive Repair Parts

Most states have laws that restrict the use of aftermarket parts in collision repair work. These restrictions range from the requirement to disclose to the
vehicle owner the use of aftermarket parts in the repair process to the requirement to have aftermarket parts certified by an independent testing organization. Some jurisdictions have laws that
prohibit or restrict the sale of certain recycled OEM products that we provide, such as airbags. Additional laws of this kind may be introduced in the future. An increase in the number of states
passing such legislation or the passing of legislation with prohibitions or restrictions that are more severe than current laws could have a material adverse impact on our business. Additionally,
Congress could enact federal legislation restricting the use of aftermarket and recycled automotive parts in the repair process.

Seasonality

Our operating results are subject to quarterly variations based on a variety of factors, influenced primarily by seasonal changes in weather patterns. During the
winter months we tend to have higher demand for our products because there are more weather related accidents. In addition, the cost of salvage vehicles tends to be lower as more weather related
accidents occur generating a larger supply of total loss vehicles.


ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

Risks Relating to Our Business

We face intense competition from local, national, and internet-based light vehicle products providers, and this competition could negatively affect our
business.

The light vehicle replacement products industry is highly competitive and is served by numerous suppliers of OEM products, recycled OEM products, aftermarket
products, and refurbished products. Within each of these categories of suppliers, there are local owner-operated companies, larger regional suppliers, national providers, and internet-based suppliers.
Providers of light vehicle replacement products that have traditionally sold only certain categories of such products may decide to expand their product offerings into other categories of light
vehicle replacement products, which may further increase competition. Some of our current and potential competitors may have more operational expertise; greater financial, technical, manufacturing,
distribution, and other resources; longer operating histories; lower cost structures; and better relationships in the insurance and vehicle repair industries, than we do. In certain regions of the
U.S., local light vehicle recycling companies have formed cooperative efforts to compete in the recycled OEM products industry. As a result of these factors, our competitors may be able to provide
products that we are unable to supply, provide their products at lower costs, or supply products to customers that we are unable to serve.

We
believe that substantially in excess of 50% of collision parts by dollar amount are supplied by OEMs, with the balance being supplied by distributors like us. The OEMs are
therefore in a position to exert pricing pressure in the marketplace. We compete with the OEMs primarily on price and to a lesser extent on perceived quality. Recently, several OEMs have
experimented with reducing prices on specific products to meet the lower-priced alternative products. If such price reductions were to become widespread, it could have a material adverse impact on our
business.

Claims by OEMs relating to aftermarket products could adversely affect our business.

Original equipment manufacturers have attempted to use claims of intellectual property infringement against manufacturers and distributors of aftermarket
products to restrict or eliminate the sale of aftermarket products that are the subject of the claims. The original equipment manufacturers have brought such claims in federal court and with the
United States International Trade Commission. Since our acquisition of Keystone Automotive Industries, Inc. in October 2007, the distribution of aftermarket products constitutes a significantly
larger percentage of our business.

In
December 2005, Ford Global Technologies, LLC initiated a complaint with the International Trade Commission against six companies, including Keystone, alleging that certain
aftermarket parts imported into the United States infringed on 14 design patents held by Ford Global. In December 2006, an administrative law judge of the International Trade Commission preliminarily
ruled that seven of the Ford Global design patents were valid and that the importation of automotive parts covered by these seven patents violated Section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930. The
International Trade Commission affirmed the ruling of the administrative law judge and issued an order prohibiting further importation of automotive parts covered by the patents. The parties to the
action have appealed the decision to the United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.

United
States Patent and Trademark Office records indicate that OEMs are seeking and obtaining more design patents then they have in the past. To the extent that the original equipment
manufacturers are successful with intellectual property infringement claims, we could be restricted or prohibited from selling certain aftermarket products which could have an adverse effect on our
business. We will likely incur significant expenses investigating and defending intellectual property infringement claims. In addition, an unexpected result of the intellectual property infringement
litigation is that CAPA is decertifying parts that are the subject of the claims. Lack of CAPA


certification
may negatively impact us because many major insurance companies recommend or require the use of CAPA certified aftermarket parts.

An adverse change in our relationships with auction companies or our suppliers could increase our expenses and hurt our ability to serve our customers.

Most of our salvage inventory is obtained from vehicles offered at salvage auctions by several companies that own auction facilities in numerous locations across
the U.S. We do not have contracts with any auction company. According to industry analysts, two companies control over 65% of the salvage auction market in the U.S. In some localities, the automotive
auction business may be even more highly concentrated. If an auction company prohibited us from participating in its auctions, or
significantly raised its fees, our business could be adversely affected through higher costs or the resulting potential inability to service our customers. Moreover, we are facing increased
competition in the purchase of salvage vehicles from shredders and scrap recyclers, internet-based buyers, and others. This increase in the number of bidders may increase our cost of goods sold for
recycled OEM products.

We
also acquire inventory directly from insurance companies, original equipment manufacturers, aftermarket parts manufacturers, and others. To the extent that these suppliers decide to
discontinue these arrangements, our business could be adversely affected through higher costs or the resulting potential inability to service our customers.

We
are dependent on a relatively small number of suppliers of aftermarket products. Although alternative suppliers exist for substantially all aftermarket products distributed by us,
the loss of any one supplier could have a material adverse effect on us until alternative suppliers are located and have commenced providing products. Moreover, our operations are subject to the
customary risks of doing business abroad, including, among other things, transportation delays, political instability, currency fluctuations and the imposition of tariffs, import and export controls
and other non-tariff barriers (including changes in the allocation of quotas), as well as the uncertainty regarding future relations between China and Taiwan. Because a substantial volume
of our sales involves parts manufactured from sheet metal, we can be adversely impacted if sheet metal becomes unavailable or is only available at higher prices, which we may not be able to pass on to
our customers.

If our business relationships with insurance companies end, we may lose important sales opportunities.

We rely on business relationships with several insurance companies. These insurance companies encourage vehicle repair facilities to use products we provide. Our
arrangements with these companies may be terminated at any time. We rely on these relationships for sales to some collision repair shops, and a termination of these relationships may result in a loss
of sales, which could adversely affect our results of operations.

In
an Illinois lawsuit involving State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company (

"Avery v. State Farm"

), a jury decided in October 1999
that State Farm breached certain insurance contracts with its policyholders by using non-OEM parts to repair damaged vehicles when use of such parts did not restore the vehicle to its
"pre-loss condition." The jury found that State Farm misled its customers by not disclosing the use of non-OEM parts and the alleged inferiority of those parts. The jury
assessed damages against State Farm of $456 million, and the judge assessed an additional $730 million of disgorgement and punitive damages for violations of the Illinois Consumer Fraud
Act. In April 2001, the Illinois Appellate Court upheld the verdict but reduced the damage award by $130 million because of duplicative damage awards. On August 18, 2005, the Illinois
Supreme Court reversed the awards made by the circuit court and found, among other things, that the plaintiffs had failed to establish any breach of contract on the part of State Farm. The U.S.
Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal of this case. As a result of this case, some insurance companies had reduced or eliminated their use of aftermarket products. Our financial results could be
affected, perhaps adversely, if insurance companies


modified
or terminated the arrangements pursuant to which repair shops buy aftermarket or recycled OEM products from us due to a fear of similar claims with respect to such products.

We may not be able to sell our products due to existing or new laws and regulations prohibiting or restricting the sale of recycled OEM, aftermarket or
refurbished products.

Some jurisdictions have enacted laws prohibiting or severely restricting the sale of certain recycled OEM products that we provide, such as airbags. These and
other jurisdictions could enact similar laws or could prohibit or severely restrict the sale of additional recycled OEM products. Restrictions on the products we are able to sell could decrease our
revenue and have an adverse effect on our business and operations.

Most
states have passed laws that prohibit or limit the use of aftermarket products in collision repair work and/or require enhanced disclosure or vehicle owner consent before using
aftermarket products in such repair work. Additional legislation of this kind may be introduced in the future. If additional laws prohibiting or restricting the use of aftermarket products are passed,
it could have an adverse impact on our aftermarket products business.

Certain
organizations test the quality and safety of light vehicle replacement products. In the event that such organizations decide that a particular vehicle product does not meet
applicable quality or safety standards, we may decide to discontinue sales of such product or insurance companies may decide to discontinue authorization of repairs using such product. Such events
could adversely affect our business.

We may not be able to successfully acquire new operations or integrate acquisitions, which could cause our business to suffer.

We may not be able to successfully complete potential strategic acquisitions if we cannot reach agreement on acceptable terms or for other reasons. If we buy a
company or a division of a company, we may experience difficulty integrating that company's or division's personnel and operations, which could negatively affect our operating results. In addition:

•

the
key personnel of the acquired company may decide not to work for us;

•

we
may experience business disruptions as a result of information technology systems conversions;

•

we
may experience additional financial and accounting challenges and complexities in areas such as tax planning, treasury management, and financial reporting;

•

we
may be held liable for environmental risks and liabilities as a result of our acquisitions, some of which we may not have discovered during our due diligence;

•

our
ongoing business may be disrupted or receive insufficient management attention; and

•

we
may not be able to realize the cost savings or other financial benefits we anticipated.

Even
though we have acquired other businesses, Keystone has been our largest acquisition so far. The magnitude of the Keystone acquisition may present significant integration
challenges, including with respect to systems consolidation and the consolidation of locations that serve some of the same geographic areas. In addition, the costs of such integration may be
significantly higher than we anticipated. The successful integration of Keystone's business with our own will require substantial attention from our management and employees which may decrease the
time they devote to normal
and customary operating, selling and administrative functions. If we are unable to successfully integrate Keystone's business within a reasonable period of time, we may not be able to realize the
potential benefits anticipated from the Keystone acquisition. Our financial results could be adversely affected if we do not successfully integrate Keystone's business.


Furthermore,
even if we are able to successfully integrate Keystone's business with our own, we may not be able to realize the cost savings, synergies and revenue enhancements that we
anticipate from the Keystone acquisition, either in the amount or in the time frame that we expect.

In
connection with future acquisitions, we may assume the liabilities of the companies we acquire. These liabilities, including liabilities for environmental-related costs, could
materially and adversely affect our business. We may have to incur debt or issue equity securities to pay for any future acquisition, the issuance of which could involve the imposition of restrictive
covenants or be dilutive to our existing stockholders.

Financing the Keystone acquisition substantially increased our leverage and involves restrictions on our business.

In connection with the acquisition of Keystone, we entered into a senior secured debt financing facility with a group of lenders. Our total outstanding
indebtedness (including bank financing, letters of credit, and notes payable in connection with acquisitions) as of December 31, 2007 was 680.1 million. The increase in our indebtedness
may reduce our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions or to fund capital expenditure or working capital needs because we will require additional funds to service our
indebtedness.

In
addition, the new credit agreement contains operating and financial restrictions and requires that we satisfy certain financial covenants. The failure to comply with any of these
covenants would cause a default under the credit agreement. A default, if not waived, could result in acceleration of our debt, in which case the debt would become immediately due and payable. If this
occurs, we may not be able to repay our debt or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it. Even if new financing were available, it may be on terms that are less attractive to us than our existing
credit facility or it may not be on terms that are acceptable to us.

Keystone's business may have liabilities that are not known by us.

As a result of the Keystone acquisition, we assumed Keystone's liabilities. There may be liabilities that we failed, or were unable, to discover in the course of
performing due diligence investigations of Keystone. Any such liabilities, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our business. Also, we may learn additional
information about Keystone's business that adversely affects us, such as unknown or contingent liabilities and issues relating to compliance with applicable laws.

We may not be able to maintain Keystone's or our vendor relationships nor be able to retain key employees of Keystone.

Our combination with Keystone may cause vendors to discontinue business with the combined company, which may negatively affect our operating results.
Additionally, there can be no assurance that key employees of Keystone will remain with the combined company. If we lose the services of any of these key employees, we may not be able to replace them
with similarly qualified personnel, which could harm our business.

Our future capital needs may require that we seek debt financing or additional equity funding that, if not available, could cause our business to
suffer.

We may need to raise additional funds in the future to, among other things, fund our existing operations, improve or expand our operations, respond to
competitive pressures, or make acquisitions. From time to time, we may raise additional funds through public or private financing, strategic alliances, or other arrangements. If adequate funds are not
available on acceptable terms, we may be unable to meet our business or strategic objectives or compete effectively. If we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, stockholders may
experience dilution of their ownership interests, and the newly issued securities may have rights superior to those of the common stock. If we raise additional


funds
by issuing debt, we may be subject to further limitations on our operations. If we fail to raise capital when needed, our business will be negatively affected.

Our annual and quarterly performance may fluctuate.

Our revenue, cost of goods sold, and operating results have fluctuated on a quarterly and annual basis in the past and can be expected to continue to fluctuate
in the future as a result of a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control. Future factors that may affect our operating results include, but are not limited to, the following:

•

fluctuations
in the pricing of new OEM replacement products;

•

the
availability and cost of inventory;

•

variations
in vehicle accident rates;

•

competition
in the vehicle replacement parts industry;

•

changes
in state or federal laws or regulations affecting our business;

•

changes
in the types of replacement parts that insurance carriers will accept in the repair process;

•

our
ability to integrate and manage our acquisitions, including Keystone, successfully, and unanticipated costs of integration;

•

fluctuations
in fuel prices;

•

changes
in the demand for our products and the supply of our inventory due to severity of weather and seasonality of weather patterns;

•

the
amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures relating to the maintenance and expansion of our business, operations, and infrastructure; and

•

declines
in the values of our assets.

Due
to the foregoing factors, our operating results in future periods can be expected to fluctuate. Accordingly, our results of operations may not be indicative of future performance.
These fluctuations in our operating results may cause our results to fall below the expectations of public market analysts and investors, which could cause our stock price to decline.

Fluctuations in the prices of scrap metals could adversely affect our financial results.

Our wholesale recycled OEM operations generate scrap metal that we sell. Since 2004, we have operated self-service retail recycled OEM operations,
and we have increased our participation in this business over the last four years. The self-service retail recycled OEM business generates a larger percentage of its revenue from sales of
scrap metal than our wholesale business. As a result, the percentage of our total revenue from sales of scrap metal has increased over this time period. Due to our acquisition of Keystone the revenue
from our self-service retail OEM business and sales of scrap metal should decrease as a percentage of total revenue in the future. The prices of scrap metal have historically fluctuated due to market
factors, sometimes significantly. To the extent the prices of scrap metal decrease materially, our revenue from such sales will suffer. The cost of our self-service inventory purchases may
also decrease as a result of falling scrap metal prices, but there can be no assurance that our inventory purchasing cost will decrease the same amount or at the same rate as the scrap metal prices
and there may be a delay between the scrap metal price reductions and any inventory cost reductions.


If we determine that our goodwill has become impaired, we may incur significant charges to our pre-tax income.

Goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair market value of net assets acquired in business combinations. In the future, goodwill and intangible assets
may increase as a result of future acquisitions. Goodwill and intangible assets are reviewed at least annually for impairment. Impairment may result from, among other things, deterioration in the
performance of acquired businesses, adverse market conditions, and adverse changes in applicable laws or regulations, including changes that restrict the activities of the acquired business. Our
acquisition of Keystone in October 2007 resulted in a significant increase in the amount of goodwill on our balance sheet. As of December 31, 2007, our total goodwill, subject to future
impairment testing, was approximately $825.9 million.

If the number of vehicles involved in accidents declines, our business could suffer.

Because our business depends on vehicle accidents for both the supply of recycled OEM products and the demand for repairs using our products, factors which
influence the number and/or severity of accidents, including, but not limited to, the number of vehicles on the road, the number of miles driven, the ages of drivers, the use of cellular telephones
and other electronic equipment by drivers, the congestion of traffic, the occurrence and severity of certain weather conditions, the use of alcohol and drugs by drivers, and the condition of roadways,
impact our business. In this regard, a number of states and municipalities have adopted, or are considering adopting, legislation banning the use of handheld cellular telephones while driving and such
restrictions could lead to a decline in accidents. To the extent vehicle manufacturers develop new accident avoidance systems, the number and severity of accidents could decrease. Moreover, an
increase in fuel prices may cause the number of vehicles on the road to decline as motorists seek alternative transportation options and this also could lead to a decline in accidents.

Governmental agencies may refuse to grant or renew our operating licenses and permits.

Our operating subsidiaries must obtain licenses and permits from state and local governments to conduct their operations. When we develop or acquire a new
facility, we must seek the approval of state and local units of government. Governmental agencies often resist the establishment of a vehicle recycling facility in their communities. There can be no
assurance that future approvals or transfers will be granted. In addition, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain and renew the licenses and permits our operating subsidiaries
currently hold.

If we lose our key management personnel, we may not be able to successfully manage our business or achieve our objectives.

Our future success depends in large part upon the leadership and performance of our executive management team and key employees at the operating level. If we
lose the services of one or more of our executive officers or key employees, or if one or more of them decides to join a competitor or otherwise compete directly or indirectly with us, we may not be
able to successfully manage our business or achieve our business objectives. If we lose the services of any of our key employees at the operating or regional level, we may not be able to replace them
with similarly qualified personnel, which could harm our business.

We rely on information technology in critical areas of our operations and a disruption relating to such technology could harm our business.

We use information technology systems owned by other companies for management of our facilities and our financial functions. In the event that the providers of
these systems terminate their relationships with us, we could suffer disruptions to our operations.


In
addition, we continually monitor these systems to find areas for improvement. In the event that we decided to switch providers or to implement our own systems, we may also suffer
disruptions to our business. We may be unsuccessful in the development of our own systems, and we may underestimate the costs and expenses of developing and implementing our own systems. Also, our
revenue may be hampered during the period of implementing an alternative system, which period could extend longer than we anticipated.

If we experience problems with our fleet of trucks, our business could be harmed.

We use a fleet of trucks to deliver the majority of the products we sell. We are subject to the risks associated with providing trucking services, including
inclement weather, disruptions in the transportation infrastructure, availability and price of fuel, liabilities arising from accidents to the extent we are not covered by insurance, and insurance
premium increases. In addition, our failure to deliver products in a timely and accurate manner could harm our reputation and brand, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.

We are subject to environmental regulations and incur costs relating to environmental matters.

We are subject to various federal, state, and local environmental protection and health and safety laws and regulations governing, among other things:

•

the
emission and discharge of hazardous materials into the ground, air, or water;

•

exposure
to hazardous materials; and

•

the
generation, handling, storage, use, treatment, identification, transportation, and disposal of industrial by-products, waste water, storm water, and mercury
and other hazardous materials.

We
are also required to obtain environmental permits from governmental authorities for certain of our operations. If we violate or fail to obtain or comply with these laws, regulations,
or permits, we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators. We could also become liable if employees or other parties are improperly exposed to hazardous materials.

Under
certain environmental laws, we could be held responsible for all of the costs relating to any contamination at, or migration to or from, our or our predecessors' past or present
facilities and at independent waste disposal sites. These laws often impose liability even if the owner or operator did not know of, or was not responsible for, the release of such hazardous
substances.

Environmental
laws are complex, change frequently, and have tended to become more stringent over time. Our costs of complying with current and future environmental and health and safety
laws, and our liabilities arising from past or future releases of, or exposure to, hazardous substances, may adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition.

We could be subject to product liability claims.

If customers of repair shops that purchase our products are injured or suffer property damage, we could be subject to product liability claims. The successful
assertion of this type of claim could have an adverse effect on our business or financial condition.

Proposed regulations under the National Stolen Passenger Motor Vehicle Information System could harm our business.

In 1992, Congress enacted the Anti Car Theft Act to deter trafficking in stolen vehicles. This law included the establishment of the National Stolen Passenger
Motor Vehicle Information System to track and monitor stolen automotive parts. In April 2002, the Department of Justice published for comment proposed regulations to implement this system. The
proposed regulations require, among other things, that insurance companies, salvagers, dismantlers, recyclers, and repairers inspect salvage vehicles for the


purpose
of collecting the vehicle identification number and the part number for any covered major part that possesses the vehicle identification number. The requirement to collect this information
would place burdens and costs on us that otherwise would not normally exist, and could discourage our customers from purchasing our products if the proposed regulations are adopted. In February 2008,
several consumer groups sued the Department of Justice in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California requesting that the court order the Department of Justice to
implement the system.

Risks Relating to Our Common Stock

Future sales of our common stock may depress our stock price.

We and our stockholders may sell shares of common stock in the future. We may also issue shares of common stock under our equity incentive plan or in connection
with future acquisitions. Certain of our existing stockholders are parties to a registration rights agreement that provides such holders with the right to require us to effect the registration of
their shares of common stock in specific circumstances.
In addition, if we propose to register any of our common stock under the Securities Act, whether for our own account or otherwise, some existing stockholders may be entitled to include their shares of
common stock in that registration. We cannot predict the size of future issuances of our common stock or the effect, if any, that future issuances and sales of shares of our common stock will have on
the price of our common stock. Sales of substantial amounts of common stock (including shares issued in connection with an acquisition), or the perception that such sales could occur, may cause the
price of our common stock to fall.

Delaware law, our charter documents and our loan documents may impede or discourage a takeover, which could affect the price of our stock.

The anti-takeover provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, our loan documents and Delaware law could, together or separately,
impose various impediments to the ability of a third party to acquire control of us, even if a change in control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders. Our certificate of incorporation and
bylaws have provisions that could discourage potential takeover attempts and make attempts by stockholders to change management more difficult. The new credit agreement we entered into in connection
with our acquisition of Keystone provides that a change of control is an event of default. Our incorporation under Delaware law and these provisions could also impede an acquisition, takeover, or
other business combination involving us or discourage a potential acquiror from making a tender offer for our common stock, which, under certain circumstances, could reduce the price of our common
stock.


ITEM 1B.    UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS

None.

ITEM 2.    PROPERTIES

Our properties are described in "Item 1—Business—Our Facilities" above, and such description is incorporated by reference into
this Item 2. Our properties are sufficient to meet our present needs, and we do not anticipate any difficulty in securing additional space to conduct operations or additional office space, as
needed, on terms acceptable to us.

ITEM 3.    LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

We are from time to time subject to various claims and lawsuits incidental to our business. In the opinion of management, currently outstanding claims and suits
other than those described below, individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements.

On
December 2, 2005, Ford Global Technologies, LLC ("Ford") filed a complaint with the United States International Trade Commission ("USITC") against Keystone and five
other named Respondents, including four Taiwan-based manufacturers. On December 12, 2005, Ford filed an Amended Complaint. Both the Complaint and the Amended Complaint contended that Keystone
and the other Respondents infringed 14 design patents that Ford alleges cover eight parts on the 2004-2005 Ford
F-150 truck (the "Ford Design Patents"). Ford asked the USITC to issue a permanent general exclusion order excluding from entry into the United States all automotive parts that infringe
the Ford Design Patents and that are imported into the United States, sold for importation in the United States, or sold within the United States after importation. Ford also sought a permanent order
directing Keystone and the other Respondents to cease and desist from, among other things, selling, marketing, advertising, distributing and offering for sale imported automotive parts that infringe
the Ford Design Patents. On December 28, 2005, the USITC issued a Notice of Investigation based on Ford's Amended Complaint. The USITC's Notice of Investigation was published in the Federal
Register on January 4, 2006.

On
January 23, 2006, Keystone filed its Response to the Complaint and Notice of Investigation. In the Response, Keystone denied, among other things, that any of the Ford Design
Patents is valid and/or enforceable and, accordingly, denied each and every allegation of infringement. Keystone further asserted several affirmative defenses. In interlocutory rulings, the
Administrative Law Judge ("ALJ") struck Keystone's affirmative defenses of patent exhaustion, permissible repair, license and patent misuse and Keystone's affirmative defense that each of the patents
is invalid for failure to comply with the ornamentality requirement of 35 U.S.C.§171. Additionally, the ALJ granted Ford's request to drop four patents from the investigation. A hearing
before the ALJ took place the last week of August 2006.

On
December 4, 2006, the ALJ issued an Initial Determination upholding seven of Ford's design patents and declaring the remaining three design patents to be invalid. Both Ford
and the Respondents petitioned the Commission to review and set aside portions of the ALJ's Initial Determination. Keystone's petition also sought review of the ALJ's interlocutory rulings concerning
certain of its affirmative defenses. On March 20, 2007, the USITC decided not to review the ALJ's Initial Determination. Initially, the USITC determined that it would render its order on
remedy, bonding, and public policy on May 4, 2007. However, on April 30, 2007, the United States Supreme Court decided the case of KSR International Co. v. Teleflex Inc.,
which addressed claims of obviousness in patent law and which may have had potential implications relative to the Respondent's case before the USITC. The Respondents filed a petition for
reconsideration with the USITC on May 1, 2007 based on the decision in the KSR case. On May 4, 2007, the USITC extended the deadline for rendering its order on remedy, bonding, and
public policy until June 6, 2007, so that it could review its decision not to review the ALJ's Initial Determination in light of the KSR case.


On
June 6, 2007, the USITC issued its Notice of Final Determination. The Notice of Final Determination denied Respondent's petition for reconsideration and their motion for leave
to supplement their petition. In addition, the USITC issued a general exclusion order prohibiting the importation of certain automotive parts found to infringe the seven Ford design patents found
valid. The USITC's decision became final on August 6, 2007 upon the expiration without action of the 60-day Presidential review period. On May 18, 2007, Ford filed a Notice
of Appeal with the United States Federal Circuit Court of Appeals with regard to the three patents declared invalid in the ALJ's Initial Determination. On August 23, 2007, the Respondents filed
a Notice of Appeal with the
United States Federal Court of Appeals. The appeals were consolidated, and the parties are submitting their respective briefs to the appellate court.

We
will continue to defend this action vigorously. At the time the exclusion order was issued, the parts that are subject to the order comprised only a minimal amount of our sales.
However, as such parts become incorporated into more vehicles over time, it is likely that the amount of our sales of such parts would have increased substantially. If the 10 design patents in
question are ultimately found on appeal to be valid and infringed, it is not anticipated that the loss of sales of these parts will be materially adverse to our financial condition, cash flows or
results of operations. However, depending upon the nature and extent of any adverse ruling, other auto manufacturers may attempt to assert similar allegations based upon design patents on a
significant number of parts for several of their models, which over time could have a material adverse impact on the entire aftermarket parts industry.

In
July 2007, two putative class action lawsuits captioned

Lynch v. Keystone Automotive Industries, Inc.

, Case
No. BC374399, and

Shoys v. Keystone Automotive Industries, Inc.,

Case No. BC374480, were filed in the Superior Court of the State
of California, County of Los Angeles in connection with our acquisition of Keystone. On September 17, 2007, Keystone entered into a conditional memorandum of understanding with plaintiffs'
counsel and the other named defendants in the actions pursuant to which the parties agreed to settle the actions, subject to certain conditions, including confirmatory discovery and court approval of
the final settlement. If the court approves the settlement contemplated in the memorandum of understanding, the actions will be dismissed with prejudice. The hearing at which the court will consider
approval of the settlement is scheduled for April 2008.

We
have not paid any cash dividends on our common stock. We intend to continue to retain our earnings to finance our growth and for general corporate purposes. We do not anticipate
paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. In addition, our credit facility contains, and future financing agreements may contain, financial covenants and limitations on payment of any cash
dividends or other distributions of assets.

The
following graph compares the percentage change in the cumulative total returns on our common stock, the NASDAQ Stock Market (U.S.) Index and the following group of peer companies
(the "Peer Group"): Copart, Inc., O'Reilly Automotive, Inc., Genuine Parts Company, and Fastenal Co., for the period beginning on October 3, 2003 (the first day of trading
following our initial public offering) and ending on December 31, 2007 (which was the last day of our 2007 fiscal year). Our Peer Group changed this year with the exclusion of Keystone
Automotive Industries, Inc. (which we acquired in October 2007) and Aftermarket Technology Corp. (because its business and market capitalization have changed to become less comparable to ours)
and the addition of O'Reilly Automotive, Inc., Genuine Parts Company, and Fastenal Co. (all of which we believe are better comparison companies). The stock price performance in the
following graph is not necessarily indicative of future stock price performance. The graph assumes that the value of an investment in each of the Company's common stock, the NASDAQ Stock Market (U.S.)
Index and the Peer Group was $100 on October 3, 2003 and that all dividends, where applicable, were reinvested.

ITEM 7.    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Overview

We provide replacement systems, components, and parts needed to repair light vehicles (cars and light trucks). Buyers of light vehicle replacement products have
the option to purchase from primarily three sources: new products produced by original equipment manufacturers ("OEMs"), which are commonly known as OEM products; new products produced by companies
other than the OEMs, which are sometimes referred to generically as "aftermarket" products; and recycled products originally produced by OEMs, which we refer to as recycled OEM products. We
participate in the market for recycled OEM products as well as the market for collision repair aftermarket products. We obtain aftermarket
products and salvage vehicles from a variety of sources, and we dismantle the salvage vehicles to obtain a comprehensive range of vehicle products that we distribute into the light vehicle repair
market. We also refurbish bumpers, wheels, head lamps and tail lamps.

We
are the largest nationwide provider of recycled OEM products and related services, with sales, processing, and distribution facilities that reach most major markets in the U.S. In
October 2007, we acquired Keystone Automotive Industries, Inc., the nation's leading distributor of aftermarket collision parts. As a result, we are the largest nationwide provider of
aftermarket collision replacement products, and refurbished bumper covers and wheels. We believe there are opportunities for growth in both product lines through acquisitions and internal development.

Our
revenue, cost of goods sold, and operating results have fluctuated on a quarterly and annual basis in the past and can be expected to continue to fluctuate in the future as a result
of a number of


factors,
some of which are beyond our control. Factors that may affect our operating results include, but are not limited to:

•

fluctuations
in the pricing of new OEM replacement products;

•

the
availability and cost of inventory;

•

variations
in vehicle accident rates;

•

competition
in the vehicle replacement parts industry;

•

changes
in state or federal laws or regulations affecting our business;

•

changes
in the types of replacement parts that insurance carriers will accept in the repair process;

•

our
ability to integrate and manage all of our acquisitions, including Keystone, successfully, and unanticipated costs of integration;

•

fluctuations
in fuel prices;

•

changes
in the demand for our products and the supply of our inventory due to severity of weather and seasonality of weather patterns;

•

the
amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures relating to the maintenance and expansion of our business, operations, and infrastructure; and

•

declines
in the value of our assets.

Due
to the foregoing factors, our operating results in future periods can be expected to fluctuate. Accordingly, our historical results of operations may not be indicative of future
performance.

Acquisitions

Since our inception in 1998 we have pursued a growth strategy of both organic growth and acquisitions. We have pursued acquisitions that we believe will help
drive profitability, cash flow and stockholder value. We focus principally on companies that will expand our geographic presence and our ability to provide a wider choice of alternative light vehicle
replacement products and services to our customers.

During
2005, we acquired eight businesses (four in the recycled OEM automotive parts business and four in the aftermarket automotive parts business) for an aggregate of approximately
$110.0 million in cash, $6.4 million in notes issued to the sellers and $9 million contingently payable based on the achievement of certain future financial results. Certain terms
of one of the contingent payment agreements were modified in 2006 such that $1.0 million was immediately paid and the maximum
remaining amount contingently payable was reduced to $4.0 million. These business acquisitions enabled us to serve new markets and expand our presence in existing markets.

During
2006, we acquired ten businesses (one in the wheel refurbishing and distribution business, two in the aftermarket automotive parts business and seven in the recycled OEM
automotive parts business) for an aggregate of approximately $71.1 million in cash and $7.2 million in notes issued to the sellers. These business acquisitions enabled us to expand our
product offerings to our customers, serve new markets and expand our presence in existing markets.

In
October, 2007, we acquired Keystone, the nation's leading distributor of aftermarket collision parts, for $806.8 million, net of cash acquired. As a result, we are now the
largest nationwide provider of aftermarket collision replacement products and refurbished bumpers and wheels. During 2007, we also acquired eleven other businesses (eight in the recycled OEM products
business, one that refurbishes and distributes head lamps and tail lamps, and two in the aftermarket products business).


These
acquisitions included two businesses in Canada. These business acquisitions enabled us to expand our presence in existing markets, serve new market areas and expand our product line offering.

Sources of Revenue

Since 2005, our revenue from the sale of light vehicle replacement products and related services has ranged between 83% and 91% of our total revenue, of which
between 5% and 11% of our total revenue has come from our self-service facilities. We sell the majority of our light vehicle replacement products to collision repair shops and mechanical
repair shops. Our light vehicle replacement products include, engines, transmissions, front-ends, doors, trunk lids, bumpers, hoods, fenders, grilles, valances, wheels, head lamps, and
tail lamps. We sell extended warranty contracts for certain mechanical products. These contracts cover the cost of parts and labor and are sold for periods of six months, one year, or two years. We
defer the revenue from such contracts and recognize it ratably over the term of the contracts. The demand for our products and services is influenced by several factors, including the number of
vehicles in operation, the number of miles being driven, the frequency and severity of vehicle accidents, availability and pricing of new parts, seasonal weather patterns, and local weather
conditions. Additionally, automobile insurers exert significant influence over collision repair shops as to how an insured vehicle is repaired and the cost level of the products used in the repair
process. Accordingly, we consider automobile insurers to be key demand drivers of our products. We provide insurance companies services that include the review of vehicle repair order estimates, as
well as direct quotation services to their adjusters. There is no standard price for recycled OEM products, but rather a pricing structure that varies from day to day based upon such factors as
product availability, quality, demand, new OEM replacement product prices, the age of the vehicle being repaired, and competitor pricing. The pricing for aftermarket and refurbished products is
determined based on a number of factors, including availability, quality, demand, new OEM replacement product prices, and competitor pricing.

Since
2005, approximately 9% to 17% of our revenue has been obtained from other sources. These include bulk sales to mechanical remanufacturers, scrap sales, sales of aluminum ingots
and sows, and sales of damaged vehicles that we sell to vehicle repairers. Our revenue from other sources has increased since 2004 primarily due to our obtaining an aluminum smelter through a business
acquisition in 2006, higher scrap sales from our self-service retail and wheel operations, and higher bulk sales of certain products. Due to our acquisition of Keystone in
October 2007, our revenue from other sources is not expected to continue to increase as percentage of our total revenue.

When
we obtain mechanical products from dismantled vehicles and determine they are damaged, or when we have a surplus of a certain mechanical product type, we sell them in bulk to
mechanical remanufacturers. The majority of these products are sorted by product type and model type. Examples of such products are engine blocks and heads, transmissions, starters, alternators, and
air conditioner compressors. After we have recovered all the products we intend to resell, the remaining materials are crushed and sold to scrap processors.

Cost of Goods Sold

Our cost of goods sold for recycled OEM products includes the price we pay for the salvage vehicle and, where applicable, auction, storage, and towing fees. We
are facing increasing competition in the purchase of salvage vehicles from shredders and scrap recyclers, internet-based buyers, and others. Our cost of goods sold also includes labor and other costs
we incur to acquire and dismantle such vehicles. Since 2005, our labor and labor-related costs related to acquisition and dismantling have accounted for approximately 9% to 10% of our cost of goods
sold for vehicles we dismantle. The acquisition and dismantling of salvage vehicles is a manual process and, as a result, energy costs are not material.


Our
cost of goods sold for aftermarket products includes the price we pay for the parts, freight, and other inventoried costs such as import fees and duties, where applicable. Our
aftermarket products are acquired from a number of vendors. Our cost of goods sold for refurbished wheels, bumpers and lights includes the price we pay for cores, freight, and costs to refurbish the
parts, including overhead and depreciation costs.

In
the event we do not have a recycled OEM product or suitable aftermarket product in our inventory to fill a customer order, we attempt to purchase the part from a competitor. We refer
to these parts as brokered products. Since 2005, the revenue from brokered products that we sell to our customers has ranged from 4% to 8% of our total revenue. The gross margin on brokered product
sales as a
percentage of revenue is generally less than half of what we achieve from sales of our own inventory because we must pay higher prices for these products.

Some
of our mechanical products are sold with a standard six-month warranty against defects. We record the estimated warranty costs at the time of sale using historical
warranty claim information to project future warranty claims activity and related expenses. Our warranty activity during 2006 and 2007 was as follows (in thousands):

We also sell separately priced extended warranty contracts for certain mechanical products. The expense related to extended warranty claims is recognized when
the claim is made.

Expenses

Our facility and warehouse expenses primarily include our costs to operate our processing, redistribution, self-service, and warehouse facilities.
These costs include labor for both plant management and facility and warehouse personnel, stock-based compensation, facility rent, property and liability insurance, utilities, and other occupancy
costs.

distribution expenses primarily include our costs to deliver our products to our customers. Included in our distribution expense category are labor costs for drivers, local delivery
and transfer truck rentals and subcontractor costs, vehicle repairs and maintenance, insurance, and fuel.

Our
selling and marketing expenses primarily include our advertising, promotion, and marketing costs; salary and commission expenses for sales personnel; sales training; telephone and
other communication expenses; and bad debt expense. Since 2005, personnel costs have accounted for approximately 77% to 79% of our selling and marketing expenses. Most of our recycled OEM product
sales personnel are paid on a commission basis. The number and quality of our sales force is critical to our ability to respond to our customers' needs and increase our sales volume. Our objective is
to continually evaluate our sales force, develop and implement training programs, and utilize appropriate measurements to assess our selling effectiveness.

Our
general and administrative expenses include primarily the costs of our corporate and regional offices that provide corporate and field management, treasury, accounting, legal,
payroll, business development, human resources, and information systems functions. These costs include wages and benefits for corporate, regional and administrative personnel, stock-based
compensation, long term


incentive
compensation, accounting, legal and other professional fees, office supplies, telephone and other communication costs, insurance and rent.

Seasonality

Our operating results are subject to quarterly variations based on a variety of factors, influenced primarily by seasonal changes in weather patterns. During the
winter months we tend to have higher demand for our products because there are more weather related accidents. In addition, the cost of salvage vehicles tends to be lower as more weather related
accidents occur generating a larger supply of total loss vehicles.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. ("GAAP"). The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates, assumptions, and judgments that affect
the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, assumptions, and
judgments, including those related to revenue recognition,
inventory valuation, allowance for doubtful accounts, goodwill impairments, self-insurance programs, contingencies, stock-based compensation, and accounting for income taxes. We base our
estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. The results of these estimates form the basis for our judgments about the
carrying values of assets and liabilities and our recognition of revenue. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

Revenue Recognition

We recognize and report revenue from the sale of light vehicle replacement products when they are shipped and title has transferred, subject to a reserve for
returns, discounts, and allowances that management estimates based upon historical information. A replacement product would ordinarily be returned within a few days of shipment. Our customers may earn
discounts based upon sales volumes or sales volumes coupled with prompt payment. Allowances are normally given within a few days following product shipment. We analyze historical returns and
allowances activity by comparing the items to the original invoice amounts and dates. We use this information to project future returns and allowances on products sold.

We
also sell separately priced extended warranty contracts for certain mechanical products. Revenue from these contracts is deferred and recognized ratably over the term of the
contracts.

Inventory Accounting

Salvage Inventory.

Salvage inventory is recorded at the lower of cost or market. Our salvage inventory cost is established
based upon the price we pay for a vehicle, and includes buying; dismantling; and, where applicable, auction, storage, and towing fees. Inventory carrying value is determined using the average cost to
sales percentage at each of our facilities and applying that percentage to the facility's inventory at expected selling prices. The average cost to sales percentage is derived from each facility's
historical vehicle profitability for salvage vehicles purchased at auction or from contracted rates for salvage vehicles acquired under direct procurement arrangements.

Aftermarket and Refurbished Product Inventory.

Aftermarket and refurbished product inventory is recorded at the lower of
cost or market. Our aftermarket inventory cost is based on the average price we pay for parts, and includes expenses incurred for freight and buying, where applicable. For items purchased from foreign
sources, import fees and duties and transportation insurance are also included.


Our
refurbished product inventory cost is based on the average price we pay for wheel cores, and includes expenses incurred for freight, buying and refurbishing overhead.

For
all inventory, our carrying value is reduced regularly to reflect the age and current anticipated demand for our products. If actual demand differs from our estimates, additional
reductions to our inventory carrying value would be necessary in the period such determination is made.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments. The allowance for
doubtful accounts is based on our assessment of the collectibility of specific customer accounts, the aging of the accounts receivable, and our historical experience. Our allowance for doubtful
accounts at December 31, 2007 was approximately $4.3 million, which represents 3.3% of gross receivables. If actual defaults are higher than our historical experience, our allowance for
doubtful accounts may be insufficient to cover the uncollectible receivables, which would have an adverse impact on our operating results in the period of occurrence. A 10% change in the 2007 annual
write-off rate would result in a change in the estimated allowance for doubtful accounts of approximately $0.2 million. For our light vehicle replacement parts operations, our
exposure to uncollectible accounts receivable is limited because the majority of our sales are to a large number of small customers that are generally geographically dispersed. We also have certain
customers in our light vehicle replacement parts operations that pay for products at the time of delivery. The aluminum smelter and our mechanical core operation sell in larger quantities to a small
number of distributors, foundry customers and remanufacturers. As a result, our exposure to uncollectible accounts receivable is greater in these operations. We control credit risk through credit
approvals, credit limits, and monitoring policies.

Goodwill Impairment

We record goodwill as a result of our acquisitions. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,"
("SFAS 142") requires us to analyze our goodwill for impairment at least annually. The determination of the value of goodwill requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect our
consolidated financial statements. In assessing the recoverability of our goodwill, we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to
determine the fair value of the respective assets. If these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets. We perform
goodwill impairment tests annually in the fourth quarter and between annual tests whenever events may indicate that an impairment exists. In response to changes in industry and market conditions, we
may be required to strategically realign our resources and consider restructuring, disposing of, or otherwise exiting businesses, which could result in an impairment of goodwill.

Our
goodwill would be considered impaired if the net book value of a reporting unit exceeded its estimated fair value. The fair value estimates are primarily established using a
discounted cash flow methodology, supported by comparative market multiples where appropriate. As of December 31, 2007, we had $825.9 million in goodwill subject to future impairment
tests. If we were required to recognize goodwill impairments in future periods, we would report those impairment losses as part of our operating results. We determined that no adjustments were
necessary when we performed our annual impairment testing in the fourth quarters of 2007, 2006 and 2005. A 10% decrease in the fair value estimates used in the fourth quarter of 2007 impairment test
would not have changed this determination.

Self-Insurance Programs

We self-insure a portion of employee medical benefits under the terms of our employee health insurance program. We also self-insure a
portion of automobile, general liability, and workers'


compensation
claims. We have purchased both aggregate (in some cases) and specific (in all cases) stop-loss insurance coverage from third party insurers in order to limit our total
liability exposure. The cost of the stop-loss insurance is expensed over the contract periods.

We
record an accrual for the claims expense related to our employee medical benefits, automobile, general liability, and workers' compensation claims based upon the expected amount of
all such claims. If actual claims are higher than what we anticipated, our accrual might be insufficient to cover our claims costs, which would have an adverse impact on our operating results in that
period.

Contingencies

We are subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business resulting from litigation, claims and other
commitments, and from a variety of environmental and pollution control laws and regulations. We consider the likelihood of loss or the incurrence of a
liability, as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss, in determining loss contingencies. We accrue an estimated loss contingency when it is probable that a liability has been
incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. We determine the amount of reserves, if any, with the assistance of our outside legal counsel. We regularly evaluate current information
available to us to determine whether the accruals should be adjusted. If the amount of an actual loss were greater than the amount we have accrued, the excess loss would have an adverse impact on our
operating results in the period that the loss occurred. If the loss contingency is subsequently determined to no longer be probable, the amount of loss contingency previously accrued would be included
in our operating results in the period such determination was made.

Accounting for Income Taxes

All income tax amounts reflect the use of the liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based upon the expected
future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial and income tax reporting purposes. We operate in multiple tax jurisdictions with
different tax rates, and we determine the allocation of income to each of these jurisdictions based upon various estimates and assumptions.

We
record a provision for taxes based upon our effective income tax rate. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that we expect is more likely
than not to be realized. We consider historical taxable income, expectations, and risks associated with our estimates of future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need
for a valuation allowance. We had a valuation allowance of $0.7 million, $0.9 million, and $0.7 million at December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, against our
deferred tax assets. Should we determine that it is more likely than not that we would be able to realize all of our deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the net deferred tax asset
would increase income in the period such determination was made. Conversely, should we determine that it is more likely than not that we would not be able to realize all of our deferred tax assets in
the future, an adjustment to the net deferred tax assets would decrease income in the period such determination was made.

We
adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Interpretation No. 48, "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes" ("FIN 48"), effective January 1, 2007.
FIN 48 establishes a threshold for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in tax returns. Only those positions that meet the
more-likely-than-not recognition threshold may be recognized in the financial statements. We recognize interest accrued relating to unrecognized tax benefits in our
income tax expense. As a result of the implementation of FIN 48, we recorded a $0.4 million increase in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits, an increase in deferred tax assets of
$0.1 million and a decrease of $0.3 million in the January 1, 2007 retained earnings balance. Prior to 2007, we recorded accruals for tax contingencies and related interest when
it was determined that it was probable that we had incurred a liability and the amount could reasonably be estimated based on


specific
events such as an audit by a taxing authority. In the normal course of business we will undergo tax audits by various tax jurisdictions. Such audits often require an extended period of time
to complete and may result in income tax adjustments if changes to the allocation are required between jurisdictions with different tax rates. Under existing GAAP, changes in accruals for
uncertainties arising from the resolution of pre-acquisition contingencies of acquired businesses are charged or credited to goodwill. Adjustments to other tax accruals we make are
generally recognized in the period they are determined. Under proposed Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141 (revised 2007), "Business Combinations" ("SFAS 141R"), changes
in accruals for uncertainties arising from the resolution of pre-acquisition contingencies of acquired businesses will be recorded in earnings in the period the changes are determined
after the effective date of SFAS 141R. See "Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements" and Note 12, "Income Taxes" in Item 8, of this Form 10-K for further
discussion.

Stock-Based Compensation

In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123R, "Share-Based Payment" ("SFAS 123R"), a revision of SFAS 123. SFAS 123R supersedes
Accounting Principles Board ("APB") Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees," and amends SFAS 95, "Statement of Cash Flows." SFAS 123R requires us to measure
compensation cost for all share-based payments (including employee stock options) at fair value and to recognize the cost over the vesting period, and was effective for us on January 1, 2006.
In March 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107 ("SAB 107") regarding the SEC staff position concerning the application of
SFAS 123R, including interpretive guidance. We implemented the provisions of SFAS 123R and SAB 107 in the first quarter of 2006 using the modified prospective method, pursuant to
which prior periods are not restated. Compensation expense for all share-based payments granted or modified after the effective date is recognized prospectively based upon the requirements of
SFAS 123R and compensation expense for all unvested share-based payments as of January 1, 2006 that were issued subsequent to the filing of our registration statement for our initial
public offering in October 2003 is recognized prospectively based on the grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of SFAS 123, "Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation," net of estimated forfeitures. We have elected to recognize compensation expense for all awards on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the
award.

Several
key factors and assumptions affect the valuation models currently utilized for valuing our stock option awards under SFAS 123R. We have been in existence since early 1998
and have been a public company since October 2003. As a result, we do not have the historical data necessary to consider using a lattice valuation model at this time. We have therefore elected to use
the Black-Scholes valuation model. In December 2007, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin 110 (SAB 110) to amend the SEC's views discussed in Staff Accounting Bulletin 107
(SAB 107) regarding the use of the simplified method in developing an estimate of expected life of share options in accordance with SFAS No. 123(R). We will continue to use the
simplified method until we have the historical data necessary to provide a reasonable estimate of expected life in accordance with SAB 107, as amended by SAB 110. For expected term, we
have what SAB 107 defines as "plain-vanilla" stock options, and therefore used a simple average of the vesting period and the contractual term for options granted subsequent to
January 1, 2006 as permitted by SAB 107. Volatility is a measure of the amount by which our stock price is expected to fluctuate during the expected term of the option. For volatility,
we considered our own volatility for the limited time we have been a public company as well as the disclosed volatilities of companies that are considered comparable to us. Our forfeiture assumption
is based on historical forfeiture rates both pre-IPO and since we have been a public company. SFAS 123R requires that forfeitures be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if
necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. The dividend yield represents the dividend rate expected to be paid over the option's expected term, and we
currently have no plans to pay dividends. The risk-free interest rate is based on zero-coupon U.S. government issues available at the time each


option
is granted that have a remaining life approximately equal to the option's expected life. Key assumptions used in determining the fair value of stock options granted in 2007 were: expected term
of 6.4 years; risk-free interest rate of 4.37%; dividend yield of 0%; forfeiture rate of 5.0%; and volatility of 40%.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

In July 2006, the FASB issued FIN 48. FIN 48 provides guidance on the measurement, recognition, and disclosure of tax positions taken or expected
to be taken in a tax return. FIN 48 provides that a tax position should only be recognized if it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination by the appropriate
taxing authority. This interpretation also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, transition and disclosure. We adopted FIN 48 in the first quarter of 2007,
which resulted in an increase in the liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits of $0.4 million, an increase in our deferred tax assets of $0.1 million, and a decrease in our beginning
retained earnings of $0.3 million.

In
September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, "Fair Value Measurements" ("SFAS 157"). SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair
value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. In February 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position 157-1, "Application of FASB Statement No. 157 to FASB Statement
No. 13 and Other Accounting Pronouncements That Address Fair Value Measurements for Purposes of Lease Classification or
Measurement under Statement 13" ("FSP 157-1") and FSP 157-2, "Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157" ("FSP 157-2"). FSP 157-1 amends
SFAS 157 to remove certain leasing transactions from its scope. FSP 157-2 delays the effective date of SFAS 157 for all non-financial assets and
non-financial liabilities, except for those items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis, until the calendar year 2009. The
measurement and disclosure requirements related to financial assets and liabilities are effective beginning in calendar year 2008. We are currently assessing the impact of SFAS 157 on our
consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.

In
February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, "The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities" ("SFAS 159"). SFAS 159 permits entities to
choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value, and amends SFAS No. 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities." SFAS 159
is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. We do not expect the adoption of SFAS 159 to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position, results of
operations, and cash flows.

In
December 2007, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin 110 (SAB 110) to amend the SEC's views discussed in Staff Accounting Bulletin 107 (SAB 107)
regarding the use of the simplified method in developing an estimate of expected life of share options in accordance with SFAS No. 123(R). We will continue to use the simplified method until we
have the historical data necessary to provide a reasonable estimate of expected life in accordance with SAB 107, as amended by SAB 110.

In
December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007), "Business Combinations" ("SFAS 141R"). Under SFAS 141R, companies will be required to, among other
things, recognize the assets acquired, liabilities assumed, including contractual contingencies, and contingent consideration at fair value on the date of acquisition. SFAS 141R also requires
that acquisition-related expenses be expensed as incurred, restructuring costs be expensed in periods subsequent to the acquisition date, and changes in accounting for deferred income tax asset
valuation allowances and acquired income tax uncertainties after the measurement period be expensed in income tax expense. SFAS 141R will be effective in calendar 2009 and will change our
accounting for business combinations upon adoption. We are currently assessing the impact that adoption of SFAS 141R will have on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and
cash flows.


Segment Reporting

Over 97% of our operations are conducted in the U.S. During 2004, we acquired a recycled OEM products business with locations in Guatemala and Costa Rica. In May
and July 2007, we acquired two recycled OEM products businesses located in Canada. Keystone has bumper refurbishing operations in Mexico and two aftermarket products businesses in Canada. Revenue
generated and properties located outside of the U.S. are not material. We manage our operations geographically. Our light vehicle replacement products operations are organized into ten operating
segments, eight for recycled OEM products, one for aftermarket products and one for refurbished products. These segments are aggregated into one reportable segment because they possess similar
economic characteristics and have common products and services, customers, and methods of distribution. Our light vehicle replacement products operations account for over 93% of our revenue, earnings,
and assets.

Year Ended December 31, 2007 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2006

Revenue.

Our revenue increased 42.7%, from $789.4 million in 2006 to $1,126.8 million in 2007. The increase in
revenue was primarily due to the higher volume of products we sold and business acquisitions. Organic revenue growth was approximately 12.4% in 2007. We continued to expand our services to the insured
repair industry and added local delivery routes and transfer routes that helped us to increase our market penetration. We have also continued to integrate the sale and distribution of our aftermarket,
wheel and refurbished light vehicle replacement product offerings with our recycled OEM products in more locations in order to provide a wider selection of products to our customers. Business
acquisitions completed in 2007 (including Keystone since the closing of that transaction on October 12, 2007) and the full year impact of our 2006 acquisitions accounted for approximately
$239.6 million of incremental revenue for the year.

Cost of Goods Sold.

Our cost of goods sold increased 43.8%, from $431.8 million in 2006 to $621.1 million in
2007. As a percentage of revenue, cost of goods sold increased from 54.7% to 55.1%. The increase in cost of goods sold was primarily due to increased volume of products sold. Our cost of goods sold
percentage increased primarily due to the lower gross margin of our aluminum smelter and purchase accounting inventory adjustments as described below relating to SFAS 141. This smelter had
revenue of $38.4 million at a gross margin of 4.8% in 2007, compared to $28.2 million at a gross


margin
of 7.1% during 2006. We were also required to write-up the value of Keystone's finished goods and work in process inventories for refurbished products in accordance with SFAS 141. As a
result, we recorded an additional $1.8 million in cost of goods sold for the period we owned Keystone in 2007. We will record an additional $1.1 million of cost of goods sold in the
first quarter of 2008 related to this SFAS 141 write-up.

Gross Margin.

Our gross margin increased 41.4%, from $357.5 million in 2006 to $505.7 million in 2007. Our
gross margin increased primarily due to increased volume. As a percentage of revenue, gross margin decreased from 45.3% to 44.9%. Our gross margin as a percentage of revenue decreased due primarily to
the factors noted above in

Cost of Goods Sold.

Facility and Warehouse Expenses.

Facility and warehouse expenses increased 35.1%, from $86.3 million in 2006 to
$116.6 million in
2007. Our acquisitions accounted for $24.0 million of the increase. Our remaining facility and warehouse expenses increased primarily due to $4.4 million of higher wages and fringe
benefits resulting from an increase in the number of employees necessary to handle higher parts volume. The balance of the increase is primarily related to the higher cost of rent, repairs and
maintenance, and supplies. As a percentage of revenue, facility and warehouse expenses decreased from 10.9% to 10.3%, primarily due to expense leverage on increased revenue.

Distribution Expenses.

Distribution expenses increased 35.1%, from $80.1 million in 2006 to $108.2 million in
2007. Our acquisitions accounted for $20.3 million of the increase. Our remaining distribution expenses increased primarily due to $4.1 million of higher wages and fringe benefits from
an increase in the number of employees to handle higher parts volumes, increased fuel costs of $1.8 million and higher freight, repairs and rental costs. As a percentage of revenue,
distribution expenses decreased from 10.1% to 9.6%, primarily due to expense leverage on increased revenue.

Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses.

Selling, general, and administrative expenses increased 37.8%, from
$102.2 million in 2006 to $140.8 million in 2007. Our acquisitions accounted for $32.7 million of the increase. The remaining increase in our selling, general and administrative
expenses is due to higher compensation and fringe benefits costs. As a percentage of revenue, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased from 12.9% to 12.5%, primarily due to expense
leverage on increased revenue.

Restructuring Expenses.

Restructuring expenses totaled $0.4 million in 2007. Restructuring expenses include severance
and lease termination costs that we incurred when we combined some of our existing facilities into Keystone facilities.

Depreciation and Amortization.

Depreciation and amortization increased 44.6%, from $11.8 million in 2006 to
$17.1 million in 2007. Our acquisitions accounted for $3.6 million of the increase in depreciation and amortization. As a percentage of revenue, depreciation and amortization was 1.5% in
both 2006 and 2007.

Operating Income.

Operating income increased 59.0% from $77.2 million in 2006 to $122.7 million in 2007. As a
percentage of revenue, operating income increased from 9.8% to 10.9%.

Other (Income) Expense.

Net other expense increased 231.1% from $4.3 million in 2006 to $14.4 million in 2007.
Net interest expense increased 174.9% to $16.0 million in 2007 from $5.8 million in 2006. Our average bank borrowings increased approximately $152.3 million during 2007 as
compared to 2006, due primarily to the Keystone acquisition. In addition, our average effective interest rate on our bank debt also increased in 2007. We had $0.9 million of proceeds from
corporate owned life insurance in 2007. We use corporate owned life insurance policies to fund our obligations under our nonqualified deferred compensation plan. Included in other income in 2006 is a
gain of $0.7 million on the sale of equity securities. As a percentage of revenue, net other expense increased from 0.6% in 2006 to 1.3% in 2007, due primarily to higher interest expense.


Provision for Income Taxes.

The provision for income taxes increased 49.1%, from $28.4 million in 2006 to
$42.4 million in 2007, due primarily to improved operating results. Our effective tax rate was 39.1% in 2007 and 39.0% in 2006. Our effective tax rate in 2007 was impacted by several items. We
had $0.9 million of non-taxable life insurance proceeds from corporate owned life insurance. In addition, we reduced certain deferred tax assets and net income by $0.6 million due to a
change in a state's income tax law where we have operations. We also were able to utilize certain state tax net operating loss carry forwards that we did not expect would be realized and adjusted tax
reserves due to the statutory closing of certain tax years. Without all of these adjustments the effective tax rate would have been 40.0%.

Year Ended December 31, 2006 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2005

Revenue.

Our revenue increased 44.2%, from $547.4 million in 2005 to $789.4 million in 2006. The increase in
revenue was primarily due to the higher volume of products we sold and business acquisitions. Organic revenue growth was approximately 11.6% in 2006. We continued to expand our services to the insured
repair industry and added local delivery routes and transfer routes that helped us to increase our market penetration. We have also continued to integrate the sale and distribution of our aftermarket
and wheel product offerings with recycled parts in more locations in order to provide a wider selection of products to our customers. Business acquisitions completed in 2006 and the full year impact
of our 2005 acquisitions accounted for approximately $178.4 million of incremental revenue for the year.

Cost of Goods Sold.

Our cost of goods sold increased 49.0%, from $289.8 million in 2005 to $431.8 million in
2006. As a percentage of revenue, cost of goods sold increased from 52.9% to 54.7%. The increase in cost of goods sold was primarily due to increased volume of products sold. Our cost of goods sold
percentage increase was due primarily to our acquisition of Transwheel Corporation. We were required to write-up the value of Transwheel's finished goods and work in process inventories
for refurbished wheels in accordance with SFAS 141. In addition, Transwheel's aluminum smelter, that is used to economically dispose of wheels that cannot be refurbished, operates at a low
gross margin. This smelter had revenue of $28.2 million at a gross margin of 7.1% in 2006. Without these two items related to Transwheel, our cost of goods sold percentage would have increased
from 52.9% in 2005 to 53.3% in 2006.

Gross Margin.

Our gross margin increased 38.8%, from $257.6 million in 2005 to $357.5 million in 2006. Our
gross margin increased primarily due to increased volume. As a percentage of revenue, gross margin decreased from 47.1% to 45.3%. Our gross margin as a percentage of revenue decreased due primarily to
the factors noted above in

Cost of Goods Sold.

Facility and Warehouse Expenses.

Facility and warehouse expenses increased 43.6%, from $60.1 million in 2005 to
$86.3 million in 2006.
Our acquisitions accounted for $20.6 million of the increase. Our remaining facility and warehouse expenses increased primarily due to $3.3 million in higher wages and fringe benefits
resulting from increased headcount and stock option expenses (which we were first required to expense in 2006) for field personnel. The balance of the increase primarily related to higher insurance
reserves and legal claims experience, repairs and maintenance and utilities expenses. As a percentage of revenue, facility and warehouse expenses decreased from 11.0% to 10.9%.

Distribution Expenses.

Distribution expenses increased 30.3%, from $61.5 million in 2005 to $80.1 million in
2006. Our acquisitions accounted for $12.7 million of the increase. Our remaining distribution expenses increased as we operated approximately 6% more daily transfer routes between our salvage
facilities due to the increase in parts volume. In addition, higher wages primarily from an increase in the number of employees, increased fuel costs, truck rentals and repairs, delivery supplies, and
contracted salvage transfer services accounted for the remaining growth in distribution expenses. Fuel prices increased approximately 12.8% in 2006 compared to 2005. While fuel costs accounted for


approximately
$1.4 million of the increase in distribution expenses, they represented only 1.7% of our consolidated revenue. As a percentage of revenue, our distribution expenses decreased from
11.2% to 10.1%.

Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses.

Selling, general, and administrative expenses increased 37.2%, from
$74.5 million in 2005 to $102.2 million in 2006. Our acquisitions accounted for $18.3 million of the increase. The majority of the remaining expense increase was a result of an
increase in labor and labor-related expenses of $3.8 million due primarily to higher sales commission expenses and increased headcount, $1.8 million for the expensing of stock options
that began for the first time in 2006, and $1.8 million related to our new 2006 long term incentive plan, $0.5 million for higher insurance and legal claims experience, and higher sales
promotion, professional fees, credit card processing fees, and data, telephone and e-commerce expenses. Our selling expenses tend to rise as revenue increases due to our commissioned sales
forces. As a percentage of revenue our selling, general, and administrative expenses decreased from 13.6% to 12.9%.

Depreciation and Amortization.

Depreciation and amortization increased 37.9%, from $8.6 million in 2005 to
$11.8 million in 2006. Our acquisitions accounted for $2.2 million of the increase in depreciation and amortization. As a percentage of revenue, depreciation and amortization decreased
from 1.6% in 2005 to 1.5% in 2006.

Operating Income.

Operating income increased 45.8% from $52.9 million in 2005 to $77.2 million in 2006. As a
percentage of revenue, operating income increased from 9.7% to 9.8%. We incurred stock option expense that totaled $2.4 million in 2006. In addition, our cost of goods sold in 2006 was higher
due to our Transwheel acquisition as we noted above in

Cost of Goods Sold

. Without the effect of these items, our operating income as a percentage of
revenue would have improved to 10.3% in 2006 compared to 9.7% in 2005.

Other (Income) Expense.

Net other expense increased 245.3% from $1.3 million in 2005 to $4.3 million in 2006.
Net interest expense increased 208.8% to $5.8 million in 2006 from $1.9 million in 2005. Our average bank borrowings increased approximately $39.2 million during 2006 as compared
to 2005, due primarily to acquisitions. In addition, our average effective interest rate on our bank debt also increased in 2006. Other income increased to $1.5 million in 2006 from
$0.6 million in 2005. Included in other income in 2006 is a gain of $0.7 million on the sale of equity securities compared to $0.3 million in 2005. As a percentage of revenue, net
other expense increased from 0.2% in 2005 to 0.6% in 2006.

Provision for Income Taxes.

The provision for income taxes increased 36.7%, from $20.8 million in 2005 to
$28.4 million in 2006, due primarily to improved operating results. Our effective tax rate was 39.0% in 2006 and 40.2% in 2005. The decrease in the effective tax rate was due primarily to the
reversal in the third quarter of 2006 of $0.7 million of accrued income tax liabilities no longer deemed necessary with the statutory closing of certain tax years. Without the third quarter
reversals, the effective tax rate would have been 40.0%. In addition, state tax adjustments were recorded in the second quarter of 2005 that increased the effective tax rate in 2005.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Our primary sources of ongoing liquidity are cash flow from our operations and our credit facility. At December 31, 2007 we had $74.2 million in
cash and cash equivalents. On September 25, 2007 we completed a public offering of 27.6 million shares of our common stock, with 23.6 million shares sold by us and
4.0 million shares sold by certain selling stockholders. We received approximately $349.5 million in net proceeds from the offering, after deducting underwriting discounts and expenses
of the offering. We paid all amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility at that time and temporarily invested the remaining proceeds in cash equivalents pending the acquisition of
Keystone on October 12, 2007.


In
order to finance our acquisition of Keystone and to re-finance our unsecured credit facility, we obtained a senior secured debt financing facility ("Credit Agreement")
from Lehman Brothers Inc. ("Lehman") and Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. ("Deutsche Bank") on October 12, 2007, which was amended on October 26, 2007. The Credit Agreement
has a six year term and includes a $610 million term loan, a $40 million Canadian currency term loan, a $100 million U.S. dollar revolving credit facility, and a
$15 million dual currency facility for drawings of either U.S. dollars or Canadian dollars. The Credit Agreement also provides for the issuance of letters of credit of up to $35 million
in U.S. dollars and up to $10 million in either U.S. or Canadian dollars, for a swing line credit facility of $25 million under the $100 million revolving credit facility, and the
opportunity for us to add additional term loan facilities and/or increase the $100 million revolving credit facility's commitments, provided that such additions or increases do not exceed
$150 million in the aggregate. The letter of credit facilities and the swing line facility are part of the revolving credit facilities identified above and use of such facilities is taken into
account when determining availability under such credit facilities. All of the obligations under the Credit Agreement are unconditionally guaranteed by each of our domestic subsidiaries. Obligations
under the Credit Agreement, including the related guarantees, are collateralized by a security interest in substantially all of our domestic assets and our U.S. subsidiaries and a pledge of not more
than 65% of the total outstanding voting interests of any direct or indirect non-U.S. subsidiary of ours that is a "controlled foreign corporation." Amounts under each term loan facility
are due and payable in quarterly installments of increasing amounts beginning in 2008, with the balance payable in full at the end of year six. Amounts due under each revolving credit facility will be
due and payable at the end of year six. We are also required to prepay the term loan
facilities upon the sale of certain assets, upon the incurrence of certain debt, upon receipt of certain insurance and condemnation proceeds, and with up to 50% of our excess cash flow, with the
amount of such excess cash flow determined based upon our total leverage ratio.

Indebtedness
made and payable in U.S. dollars under the Credit Agreement bears interest, at our option, at (i) a base rate (the higher of (x) the rate that is the prime
lending rate as set forth on the British Banking Association Reuters Page 5 or, under certain circumstances, such other comparable page as the agents may choose, as in effect from time to time,
and (y) 0.5% in excess of the overnight federal funds rate) plus an applicable margin currently of 1.25% per annum, or (ii) a Eurodollar rate as determined by the administrative agent
for the respective interest period plus an applicable margin currently of 2.25% per annum, except that indebtedness in respect of swing line loans bears interest only at the rate referred to in
clause (i). Indebtedness made and payable in Canadian dollars under the Credit Agreement is made, at our option, as bankers' acceptance loans or loans that bear interest at a rate equal to the
rate per annum of interest publicly quoted or established as the "prime rate" of Deutsche Bank AG Canada Branch for commercial loans in Canadian dollars to its Canadian borrowers (which does not
necessarily represent the lowest or best rate actually available) plus an applicable margin currently of 1.25% per annum. Under each bankers' acceptance loan, each Canadian lender will purchase a bill
of exchange, including a depository bill issued in accordance with the Depository Bills and Notes Act (Canada), denominated in Canadian dollars and discount notes, and we will sell such bill of
exchange, at the applicable discount rate which, (1) in respect of any bill of exchange accepted by a lender named on Schedule I to the Bank Act (Canada), is the average of the annual
rates for bankers' acceptances having the same specified term and face amount as the loan to be made to us that is reported by the Reuters Screen CDOR Page as of 10:00 a.m. on such day (or the
next preceding business day if such day is not a business day) (or if not reported by the Reuters Screen, then will be the average of the discount rate offered by the five largest (by assets) Canadian
charter banks) and (2) in respect of any other lender, the CDOR described above plus 0.10%. We will also pay an acceptance fee for each bankers' acceptance loan currently equal to 2.25% per
annum. The applicable margin and acceptance fee for loans under the revolving credit facilities are subject to a decrease of 0.25% based upon our total leverage ratio and the interest rate option
chosen. Interest will be payable quarterly in arrears, except that interest based on a Eurodollar rate or bankers' acceptance loans is payable in arrears on the last day of the relevant interest
period and, for any Eurodollar


interest
period longer than three months, quarterly. Any default in the payment of principal, interest, or other overdue amounts bears interest at 2% above the rate otherwise applicable (or, if there
is no applicable rate, at 2% above the base rate referred to in clause (i) above for loans made in U.S. dollars and the "prime rate" referred to in the second sentence of this paragraph for
loans made in Canadian dollars). All overdue amounts are payable on demand.

The
Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties, and contains customary covenants that restrict our ability to, among other things (i) incur liens,
(ii) incur any indebtedness (including guarantees or other contingent obligations), (iii) engage in mergers and consolidations, (iv) engage in sales, transfers, and other
dispositions of property and assets (including sale-leaseback transactions), (v) make loans, acquisitions, joint ventures, and other investments, (vi) make dividends and
other distributions to, and redemptions and repurchases from, equity holders, (vii) prepay, redeem, or repurchase certain debt, (viii) make changes in the nature of our business,
(ix) amend our organizational documents, or amend or otherwise modify certain of our debt documents, (x) change our fiscal quarter and fiscal year ends, (xi) enter into
transactions with LKQ's
affiliates, (xii) make dividends, loans, and other transfers by subsidiaries of LKQ, and (xiii) issue certain equity interests. The Credit Agreement also requires us to comply with
certain financial and affirmative covenants.

We
completed the sale of 23.6 million shares of our common stock at a price of $15.50 per share in a public offering in September 2007 in order to help fund our acquisition of
Keystone. This resulted in approximately $349.5 million of cash proceeds to us, net of underwriting discounts and commissions and expenses of the offering. Certain selling stockholders also
sold 4.0 million shares in this offering, but we did not receive any proceeds from the sale of their shares. In connection with the offering, certain members of management exercised stock
options to purchase 1.0 million shares of our common stock, resulting in approximately $2.8 million of proceeds to us. We used all of the proceeds from the offering and the option
exercises to pay down our then existing bank debt and invested the remaining proceeds in short term cash equivalents until we used them for general corporate purposes, which included the Keystone
acquisition and three other acquisitions completed by the end of 2007.

We
generated $54.4 million of cash flow from operating activities in 2007 and believe that cash flow from operating activities and availability under our Credit Agreement will be
adequate to fund our short term liquidity needs. Our liquidity needs are primarily to fund working capital requirements and expand our facilities and network. The procurement of inventory is the
largest operating use of our funds. We normally pay for salvage vehicles acquired at salvage auctions and under some direct procurement arrangements at the time that we take possession of the
vehicles. We normally pay for aftermarket product purchases at the time of shipment or on standard payment terms, depending on the manufacturer and payment options offered. Wheel cores acquired from
third parties are normally paid on standard payment terms. We acquired approximately 97,600, 111,400, and 126,000 wholesale salvage vehicles in 2005, 2006, and 2007, respectively. In addition, we
acquired approximately 55,800, 138,700 and 197,500 salvage vehicles for our self-service retail operations in 2005, 2006 and 2007, respectively. Our purchases of aftermarket parts and
wheels totaled approximately $46.0 million, $94.5 million and $190.1 million in 2005, 2006 and 2007, respectively.

Net
cash provided by operating activities totaled $54.4 million in 2007, compared to $52.4 million in 2006. Cash was provided by net income adjusted for
non-cash items. Working capital uses of cash included increases in receivables and inventory, partially offset by increases in payables, accruals, income taxes and other noncurrent
liabilities. Receivables increased primarily due to our increased sales volumes. Inventory increased to support our increased sales volume and to increase availability of our recycled OEM products.
Accounts payable and accrued expenses increased primarily due to our increased volume and restructuring costs. Income taxes, before considering the excess tax benefit from the exercise of stock
options, increased due to the timing of tax payments. Other noncurrent liabilities increased primarily due to increases in our long term incentive plan and deferred compensation liabilities.


Net
cash used in investing activities totaled $905.8 million in 2007, compared to $110.7 million in 2006. We used $868.0 million of cash for acquisitions in 2007,
with $806.8 million used for the Keystone acquisition, compared to $73.5 million used for acquisitions in 2006. Our net property and equipment purchases increased $1.9 million in
2007. In 2006, we repaid $2.6 million from escrow liabilities related to a 2004 acquisition.

Net
cash provided by financing activities totaled $921.6 million in 2007, compared to $59.1 million in 2006. We received $349.5 million from the sale of
23.6 million shares of our common stock in a public offering in 2007. We also borrowed approximately $650 million under our new term loan used to finance the Keystone acquisition in
2007. Exercises of stock options totaled $12.1 million in 2007 compared to $5.5 million in 2006, while the excess tax benefit from such option exercises was $19.3 million in 2007
and $7.1 million in 2006. We exercised a call option and retired $1.1 million of redeemable common stock in 2007. In connection with our debt refinancing, we paid $12.8 million in
debt issuance costs in 2007. We repaid $88.2 million in 2007 under our previous revolving credit facility compared to net borrowings of $48.0 million in 2006. Repayments of long-term
obligations increased $5.9 million in 2007.

Net
cash provided by operating activities totaled $52.4 million in 2006, compared to $37.5 million in 2005. Cash was provided by net income adjusted for
non-cash items. Working capital uses of cash included increases in receivables, inventory, prepaid expenses and other assets, and a decrease in accounts payable, partially offset by
increases in accrued liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities. Receivables increased due to our increased sales volume, partially offset by repayments of employee relocation loans and other
receivables. Inventory increased to support our increased volume and to expand the geographic availability of aftermarket and wheel products to a number of locations. Accounts payable decreased due
primarily to the timing of payments. Accruals increased primarily due to increases in self-insurance and legal claims reserves, and interest and property tax accruals. Other noncurrent
liabilities increased primarily due to liabilities of $1.8 million associated with the new long term incentive plan and increases of $1.0 million in employee deferred compensation
liabilities.

Net
cash used in investing activities totaled $110.7 million in 2006, compared to $126.0 million in 2005. We invested $73.5 million of cash for acquisitions in 2006
compared to $103.8 million in 2005. We repaid $2.6 million from escrow liabilities in 2006 compared to receiving $2.6 million deposited in 2005, all related to a 2004 acquisition.
Net property and equipment purchases increased $10.5 million in 2006, due primarily to land acquisitions and facility expansions.

Net
cash provided by financing activities totaled $59.1 million in 2006, compared to $90.0 million in 2005. Exercises of stock options and warrants totaled
$6.3 million in 2006 and $11.8 million in 2005. Included in 2005 net cash from financing activities is $87.9 million from the sale of 6.4 million shares of common stock in
a public offering. In addition, we had net borrowings of $48.0 million under our credit facility in 2006, compared to net repayments of $9.0 million in 2005. Repayments of
long-term debt obligations increased $1.9 million in 2006. The excess tax benefit from share-based payment arrangements provided $7.1 million of cash in 2006 and is shown in
cash flow from financing activities in accordance with SFAS 123R. These tax benefits for periods prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R were included in cash flow from operating activities
and totaled $6.2 million in 2005.

We
may in the future borrow additional amounts under our credit facility or enter into new or additional borrowing arrangements. We anticipate that any proceeds from such new or
additional borrowing arrangements will be used for general corporate purposes, including to develop and acquire businesses and redistribution facilities; to further the integration of our aftermarket,
wheel refurbishing and recycled OEM product facilities; to expand and improve existing facilities; to purchase property, equipment, and inventory; and for working capital.

As
part of the consideration for business acquisitions completed during 2005, 2006 and 2007, we issued promissory notes totaling approximately $6.4, $7.2 and $1.7 million,
respectively. The notes bear


interest
at annual rates of 3.0% to 6.0%, and interest is payable at maturity or in monthly installments. We also assumed certain liabilities in connection with a business acquisition during the
second quarter of 2005, including a promissory note with a remaining principle balance of approximately $0.2 million. The annual interest rate on the note, which was retired during 2006, was
5.1%.

We
estimate that our capital expenditures for 2008, excluding business acquisitions, will be between $65.0 and $75.0 million. We expect to use these funds for several major
facility expansions, improvement of current facilities, real estate acquisitions and systems development projects. We anticipate that net cash provided by operating activities for 2008 will be in
excess of $85.0 million.

We
believe that our current cash and equivalents, cash provided by operating activities and funds available under our credit facility will be sufficient to meet our current operating
and capital requirements. However, we may, from time to time, raise additional funds through public or private financing, strategic relationships, or other arrangements. There can be no assurance that
additional funding, or refinancing of our credit facility, if needed, will be available on terms attractive to us, or at all. Furthermore, any additional equity financing may be dilutive to
stockholders, and debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants. Our failure to raise capital if and when needed could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating
results, and financial condition.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Future Commitments

We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, investments in special purpose entities or undisclosed borrowings or debt that would be required
to be disclosed pursuant to Item 303 of Regulation S-K under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Additionally, we have not entered into any derivative contracts nor do we
have any synthetic leases.

Our long-term debt under contractual obligations above includes interest on the balance outstanding under our variable rate credit facility as of
December 31, 2007. The long term debt outstanding at December 31, 2007 in the above table includes interest computed at the average effective rate of 7.53% at December 31, 2007.

ITEM 7A.    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Our results of operations are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily with respect to borrowings under our credit facility, where interest rates are tied
to either the prime rate or a Eurodollar rate. As of December 31, 2007, we had $650.3 million outstanding under our credit facility. We have not, as a matter of policy, entered into
derivative contracts for trading or speculative


purposes.
We may consider entering into interest rate hedging contracts to lock in interest rates on some of our variable rate debt. Based upon our variable rate debt at December 31, 2007, a
hypothetical 1% increase in interest rates would result in an annual increase in interest expense of approximately $6.5 million.

The
Company is also exposed to currency fluctuations with respect to the purchase of aftermarket parts in Taiwan. While all transactions with manufacturers based in Taiwan are conducted
in U.S. dollars, changes in the relationship between the U.S. dollar and the New Taiwan dollar might impact the purchase price of aftermarket parts. We might not be able to pass on any price increases
to customers. Under our present policies, we do not attempt to hedge this currency exchange rate exposure.

Our
investments in our Central American, Canadian and Mexican operations are not material, and we do not attempt to hedge our foreign currency risk related to such operations.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements



REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To
the Board of Directors and Stockholders of LKQ Corporation:

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of LKQ Corporation and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the related consolidated
statements of income, stockholders' equity and other comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2007. Our audits also included the
financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15. These financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on the financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In
our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of LKQ Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31,
2007 and 2006, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2007, in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents
fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.

As
discussed in Note 2, effective January 1, 2006, the Company changed its method of accounting for stock-based compensation upon adoption of Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 123(R),

Share-Based Payment

.

As
discussed in Note 2, effective January 1, 2007, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Tax—an Interpretation of Financial
Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 109

.

We
have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2007, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 28, 2008 expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

The accompanying notes are an integral part of the consolidated financial statements.


LKQ CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note 1. Business

The financial statements presented in this report represent the consolidation of LKQ Corporation, a Delaware corporation, and its subsidiaries. LKQ Corporation
is a holding company and all operations are conducted by subsidiaries. When the terms "the Company," "we," "us," or "our" are used in this document, those terms refer to LKQ Corporation and its
consolidated subsidiaries.

We
are the largest nationwide provider of recycled light vehicle original equipment manufacturer ("OEM") products and related services, and with our acquisition of Keystone Automotive
Industries, Inc. ("Keystone") on October 12, 2007, we are also the largest nationwide provider of aftermarket collision replacement products, and refurbished bumper covers and wheels. We
operate out of a total of approximately 300 facilities offering our customers a broad range of replacement systems, components, and parts to repair light vehicles.

Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Principles of Consolidation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of LKQ Corporation and its subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions and accounts have
been eliminated.

Use of Estimates

In preparing our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States we are required to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue
and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Per Share Amounts

All per share amounts and the number of shares for all periods have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the two-for-one stock splits
declared on December 15, 2005 and November 5, 2007. See Note 3 for further discussion.

Revenue Recognition

The majority of our revenue is derived from the sale of recycled OEM products and aftermarket products. Revenue is recognized when the products are shipped and
title has transferred, subject to an allowance for estimated returns, discounts and allowances that we estimate based upon historical information. We have recorded a reserve for estimated returns,
discounts and allowances of approximately $7.5 million and $4.0 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Revenue from the sale of separately-priced extended warranty
contracts is reported as Deferred revenue and recognized ratably over the term of the contracts.

Shipping & Handling

Revenue also includes amounts billed to customers related to shipping and handling of approximately $11.3 million, $8.8 million and
$7.6 million during the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Distribution expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of income are the costs incurred to
prepare and deliver products to customers, including shipping and handling costs.


LKQ CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

Cash and Equivalents

We consider all highly liquid investments with original maturities of 90 days or less to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents are carried at cost, which
approximates market value.

Restricted Cash

In connection with a business acquisition on January 31, 2005, we held approximately $0.6 million in restricted cash. During the year ended
December 31, 2005, the amount of cash restricted was reduced by $0.1 million. During June 2006, the remaining restrictions were removed.

Receivables

We have recorded a reserve for uncollectible accounts of approximately $4.3 million and $2.6 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006,
respectively. The reserve is based upon our assessment of the collectibility of specific customer accounts, the aging of the accounts receivable and historical experience.

Concentrations of Credit Risk

Financial instruments that potentially subject us to significant concentration of credit risk consist primarily of cash and equivalents and accounts receivable.
We control our exposure to credit risk associated with these instruments by (i) placing our cash and equivalents with several major financial institutions; (ii) holding
high-quality financial instruments; and (iii) maintaining strict policies over credit extension that include credit evaluations, credit limits and monitoring procedures. In
addition, our overall credit risk with respect to accounts receivable is limited to some extent because a large number of geographically diverse customers make up our customer base.

Inventory

A salvage product is a recycled vehicle part suitable for sale as a replacement part. A core is a recycled mechanical part that is not suitable for sale as a
replacement part without further remanufacturing work. Salvage inventory and cores are recorded at the lower of cost or market. Cost is established based upon the price we pay for a vehicle, and
includes average costs for buying, dismantling, and where applicable, auction fees and storage, and towing. Inventory carrying value is determined using the average cost to sales percentage at each of
our facilities and applying that percentage to the facility's inventory at expected selling prices. The average cost to sales percentage is derived from each facility's historical vehicle
profitability for salvage vehicles purchased at auction or from contracted rates for salvage vehicles acquired under certain direct procurement arrangements.

An
aftermarket product is a new vehicle product manufactured by a company other than the OEM. Cost is established based upon the average price for purchased parts, and includes expenses
incurred for freight and buying, where applicable. For items purchased from foreign companies, import fees and duties and transportation insurance are also included. Refurbished inventory cost is
based upon the average price paid for cores, and also includes expenses incurred for freight, buying and refurbishing overhead. Aftermarket products and refurbished inventory is recorded at the lower
of cost or market.

For
all inventory, carrying value is reduced regularly to the lower of cost or market to reflect the age of the inventory and current anticipated demand. If actual demand differs from
our estimates,

Property and Equipment

Property and equipment are recorded at cost. Expenditures for major additions and improvements are capitalized. As property and equipment are sold or retired,
the applicable cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss thereon is recognized. Construction in progress consists primarily of building and land
improvements at our existing facilities and costs associated with the development of internal-use software projects. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method
over the estimated useful lives or, in the case of leasehold improvements, the term of the related lease, including renewal periods, if shorter. Other estimated useful lives are as follows:

Statement
of Position 98-1, "Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use."

Intangibles

Intangible assets consist primarily of goodwill (the cost of purchased businesses in excess of the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired), and other
specifically identifiable intangible assets such as the tradename acquired in connection with our acquisition of Keystone during 2007, covenants not to compete and trademarks.

Goodwill
and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized but instead are tested for impairment at least annually. We performed annual impairment tests during the
fourth quarter of 2007, 2006 and 2005. The results of these tests indicated that goodwill was not impaired.

The
changes in the carrying amount of goodwill are as follows (in thousands):

Other intangible assets totaled approximately $75.9 million and $0.2 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Accumulated
amortization of other intangible assets at December 31, 2007 and 2006 was approximately $1.0 million and $0.1 million, respectively. Amortization expense was approximately
$871,000, $20,000 and $19,000 during the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Covenants not to compete are amortized over the lives of the respective agreements on a
straight-line basis. The Keystone tradename is valued at approximately $74.8 million and is being amortized over 20 years on a straight-line basis. Estimated
annual amortization expense for the years ended December 31, 2008 through 2012 is approximately $3.8 million.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

Long-lived assets are reviewed for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be
recoverable. If such review
indicates that the carrying amount of long-lived assets is not recoverable, the carrying amount of such assets is reduced to fair value. There were no adjustments to the carrying value of
long-lived assets during the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 or 2005.


LKQ CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

Investments

Prior to our acquisition of Keystone on October 12, 2007, we held common shares of Keystone, which were classified as an
available-for-sale investment security under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity
Securities" ("SFAS 115"). Accordingly, the investment was included in Other Assets at its fair value of approximately $2.2 million at December 31, 2006, with the unrealized gain
excluded from earnings and included in Accumulated other comprehensive income, net of applicable taxes. The fair value of this investment at December 31, 2006 was estimated based upon the
quoted market price for these securities. We sold a portion of our investment and included the realized gains of $0.7 million and $0.3 million in Other (income) expense during the years
ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Upon our acquisition of Keystone on October 12, 2007, the unrealized gain was removed from Accumulated other comprehensive income, net of
applicable taxes, and the original cost of the common shares was considered a component of the purchase price.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

SFAS No. 107, "Disclosures About Fair Value of Financial Instruments," requires disclosure of the fair value of certain financial instruments. Our
financial instruments include cash and equivalents, net trade receivables, accounts payable and debt. The carrying amounts of financial instruments approximate fair value, including debt as it
consists of primarily variable interest rate notes.

Accounts Payable

In accordance with Financial Interpretation No. 39, "Offsetting of Amounts Related to Certain Contracts," we have reclassified net book overdrafts of
approximately $11.3 million to Accounts payable at December 31, 2007.

Escrow Liability

In February 2004, in connection with a business acquisition, we issued 337,380 shares of our common stock, which were to be held in escrow for a period of
two years as collateral for the accuracy of certain representations and warranties. The terms of the agreement granted the shareholders the option to sell any or all of these shares during the escrow
period, provided that all proceeds from such sale were delivered to us. In September 2005, the shareholders sold all such shares held in escrow and delivered $2.6 million to us. In February
2006, the seller's representation and warranty provisions were resolved, and the escrowed funds plus accrued interest at an annual rate of 3% were returned to the sellers.

Accrued Expenses

We have entered into certain arrangements whereby salvage vehicles are obtained directly from major insurance companies and automotive manufacturers at a cost
calculated as a percentage of the revenue generated from each vehicle. Accrued expenses include an estimated liability of approximately $1.5 million and $1.4 million at
December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, for salvage inventory procured under such arrangements.

We
self-insure for a portion of our general and automotive liability, workers' compensation and the health care claims of our employees, although we have purchased both
aggregate (in some cases) and specific (in all cases) stop-loss insurance coverage from third-party insurers in order to limit our


LKQ CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

total
liability exposure. The cost of stop-loss insurance is expensed over the contract periods. A reserve for liabilities associated with these losses is established for claims filed and
claims incurred but not yet reported based upon our estimate of ultimate cost, which is calculated using analyses of historical data. We monitor new claims and claim development as well as trends
related to the claims incurred but not reported in order to assess the adequacy of our insurance reserves. Other accrued expenses include insurance reserves of approximately $19.6 million and
$7.4 million, net of claims deposits of $2.0 million and $1.0 million, at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. While we do not expect the amounts ultimately paid to
differ significantly from our estimates, our insurance reserves and corresponding expenses could be affected if future claim experience differs significantly from historical trends and assumptions.

Product Warranties

We generally warrant certain mechanical parts against defects for a period of six months. Based on historical warranty claims, we accrue the estimated costs of
the warranty coverage at the time of sale. The changes in the warranty reserve are as follows (in thousands):

Income Taxes

Deferred income taxes have been provided to show the effect of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts
in the financial statements. A valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that these items will either expire before we are able to realize their benefit, or
that future deductibility is uncertain.

Other Noncurrent Liabilities

Other Noncurrent Liabilities include approximately $4.4 million and $4.1 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, related to
employee nonqualified deferred compensation plans as discussed in
Note 10 and approximately $3.9 million and $1.8 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, related to a long term incentive plan for certain key employees as
discussed in Note 14.

Other
Noncurrent Liabilities also include approximately $0.7 million and $0.8 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, related to unasserted claims that
are deemed probable of assertion. In the event the unasserted claims are asserted and resolved for amounts different than those accrued, or are determined to no longer be probable in future periods,
the amounts so determined would be adjusted to income in the periods such determination is made. During each of the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, approximately
$0.1 million was recognized in income due to the favorable resolution of certain unasserted claims.

Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

Depreciation Expense

Included in Cost of Goods Sold is depreciation expense associated with refurbishing and smelting operations.

Stock-Based Compensation

On January 1, 2006, we adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), "Share-Based Payment" ("SFAS 123R"), requiring us to recognize
expense related to the fair value of our share-based compensation awards (see Note 4). We elected to use the modified prospective transition method, pursuant to which prior periods are not
restated. Compensation expense for all share-based payments granted or modified after the effective date is recognized prospectively based upon the requirements of SFAS 123R and compensation
expense for all unvested share-based payments as of January 1, 2006 that were issued subsequent to the filing of the registration statement regarding our initial public offering in October 2003
is recognized prospectively based on the grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation"
("SFAS 123"), net of estimated forfeitures. When estimating forfeitures, we consider voluntary and involuntary termination behavior as well as analysis of our historical option forfeitures. We
have elected to recognize compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award.

Prior
to the adoption of SFAS 123R, we accounted for our stock compensation arrangements under the provisions of SFAS 123, as amended by SFAS 148, "Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation-Transition and Disclosures" ("SFAS 148"), which allowed the application of existing accounting rules under Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25,
"Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees" ("APB 25"). Under APB 25, we recognized compensation expense based on an award's intrinsic value, the difference between the exercise price of
the option and the fair market value of the underlying common stock at the time the options were granted. For nonqualified stock options granted with an exercise price equal to the market value of the
stock on the date of grant, no compensation cost was recognized. As required by SFAS 148 prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R, we provided pro forma net income and pro forma earnings per
share disclosures for stock-based awards, as if the fair-value-based method defined in SFAS 123 had been applied.

The
following table sets forth the stock-based compensation expense resulting from stock options included in our Consolidated Statements of Income (in thousands):

Expected
life—The expected life represents the period that our stock-based awards are expected to be outstanding. Due to the limited information available regarding
historical exercise experience, we have elected to use the simplified expected term method as permitted by the Securities
and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107 ("SAB 107"), as amended by Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 110 ("SAB 110").

Risk-free
interest rate—We base the risk free interest rate used in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model on the implied yield currently available on U.S.
Treasury zero-coupon issues with the same or substantially equivalent remaining term.

Expected
volatility—We use the trading history and historical volatility of our common stock, and because of limited historical data available on the price of our publicly
traded shares, the volatility of similar entities whose share prices are publicly available in determining an estimated volatility factor for the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.

Expected
dividend yield—We have not declared and have no plans to declare dividends and have therefore used a zero value for the expected dividend yield in the Black-Scholes
option-pricing model.

Estimated
forfeitures—When estimating forfeitures, we consider voluntary and involuntary termination behavior as well as analysis of historical forfeitures. A forfeiture
rate of 7.0% has been used for valuing employee option grants, while a forfeiture rate of 0% has been used for valuing director and executive officer option grants.

Prior
to the adoption of SFAS 123R, we included all tax benefits associated with share-based compensation as operating cash flows in the Statement of Cash Flows. SFAS 123R
requires any reduction in taxes payable resulting from tax deductions that exceed the recognized compensation expense (excess tax benefits) to be classified as financing cash flows. We have included
$19.3 million and $7.1 million of excess tax benefits in cash flows from financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. During the year ended
December 31, 2005, excess tax benefits of $6.2 million were included in net cash provided by operating activities.

Rental Expense

We recognize rental expense on a straight-line basis over the respective lease terms for all of our operating leases.

Capitalized Interest

We capitalize interest on certain assets under construction or development, including internal-use software. Total interest costs capitalized during
the year ended December 31, 2007 were approximately $0.4 million. There were no interest costs capitalized during 2006 and 2005.

Earnings per Share

Basic earnings per share are computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share incorporate
the incremental shares issuable upon the assumed exercise of stock options and warrants. Certain of our stock options were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share because they were
antidilutive, but these options could be dilutive in the future.

Segment Information

Over 97% of our operations are conducted in the United States. During 2004, we acquired a recycled OEM products business with locations in Guatemala and Costa
Rica. In May and July 2007,


LKQ CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

we
acquired two recycled OEM products businesses located in Canada. Keystone, which we acquired in October 2007, has bumper refurbishing operations in Mexico and two aftermarket products businesses
located in Canada. Revenue generated and properties located outside of the United States are not material. We manage our operations geographically. Our light vehicle replacement products operations
are organized into ten operating segments, eight for recycled OEM products, one for aftermarket products and one for refurbished products. These segments are aggregated into one reportable segment
because they possess similar economic characteristics and have common products and services, customers and methods of distribution. The light vehicle replacement products operations account for over
93% of our revenue, earnings and assets.

Foreign Currency Translation

For our foreign operations, the local currency is the functional currency. Assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars at the period-ending exchange
rate. Statement of Income amounts are translated to U.S. dollars using average exchange rates during the period. Translation gains and losses are reported as a component of Accumulated other
comprehensive income in Stockholders' Equity. Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are included in current earnings.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

Effective January 1, 2007, we adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Financial Interpretation No. 48, "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income
Taxes" ("FIN 48") (see Note 12).

In
September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, "Fair Value Measurements" ("SFAS 157"). SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair
value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. In February 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position 157-1, "Application of FASB Statement No. 157 to FASB Statement
No. 13 and Other Accounting Pronouncements That Address Fair Value Measurements for Purposes of Lease Classification or Measurement under Statement 13" ("FSP 157-1") and FSP
157-2, "Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157" ("FSP 157-2"). FSP 157-1 amends SFAS 157 to remove certain leasing transactions from its scope. FSP
157-2 delays the effective date of SFAS 157 for all non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities, except for those items that are recognized or
disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis, until the calendar year 2009. The measurement and disclosure requirements related to financial assets and liabilities are
effective beginning in calendar year 2008. We are currently assessing the impact of SFAS 157 on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.


LKQ CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

In
February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, "The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities" ("SFAS 159"). SFAS 159 permits entities to
choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value, and amends SFAS No. 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities." SFAS 159
is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. We do not expect the adoption of SFAS 159 to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position, results of
operations, and cash flows.

In
December 2007, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued SAB 110 to amend the SEC's views discussed in SAB 107 regarding the use of the simplified method
in developing an estimate of expected life of share options in accordance with SFAS No. 123(R). We will continue to use the simplified method until we have the historical data necessary to
provide a reasonable estimate of expected life in accordance with SAB 107, as amended by SAB 110.

In
December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007), "Business Combinations" ("SFAS 141R"). Under SFAS 141R, companies will be required to, among other
things, recognize the assets acquired, liabilities assumed, including contractual contingencies, and contingent consideration at fair value on the date of acquisition. SFAS 141R also requires
that acquisition-related expenses be expensed as incurred, restructuring costs be expensed in periods subsequent to the acquisition date, and changes in accounting for deferred income tax asset
valuation allowances and acquired income tax uncertainties after the measurement period be expensed in income tax expense. SFAS 141R will be effective in calendar 2009 and will change our
accounting for business combinations upon adoption. We are currently assessing the impact that the adoption of SFAS 141R will have on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and
cash flows.

Note 3. Capital Structure

On March 31, 1999, in connection with a business acquisition, we issued warrants to purchase 400,000 shares of our common stock at $3.75 per share, with
exercisability contingent upon the achievement of certain operating results in 2000. These results were achieved and the warrants became exercisable on March 31, 2001. These warrants were to
expire five years after they became exercisable. In accordance
with the antidilution provisions of the warrant agreement, the total number of warrants issued and the exercise price at December 31, 2003 were adjusted to 455,004 and $3.30 per share. In June
2005, the warrants were exercised utilizing a cashless exercise feature as provided in the original agreement. As a result, we issued 232,724 shares of our common stock upon the exercise of the
warrants. The 222,280 shares retained by us were retired.

On
February 14, 2001, we issued warrants to purchase 7,844,448 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $0.50 per share to certain stockholder guarantors. We had
breached certain covenants of our credit facility including covenants relating to operating income and the minimum required ratio of funded debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization. We entered into an amendment to the credit agreement with our banks that waived the breaches and modified certain of the covenants. As part of the amendment, the banks required that
stockholders guaranty $10 million of the debt, with the guaranties secured by letters of credit or other highly liquid collateral acceptable to the banks. All of our stockholders were given the
opportunity to participate in this transaction and thirty of our stockholders provided the guaranties. In exchange for providing the guaranties, each guarantor received certain rights, including a
guaranty fee. The guaranty fee consisted of each guarantor's pro rata portion of warrants to purchase a total of 7,844,448 shares of our common

stock
(10% of the then outstanding shares of common stock assuming exercise of these warrants) at an exercise price of $0.50 per share. The warrants became exercisable upon issuance and were to expire
on February 14, 2006. All such warrants were exercised prior to the expiration date. The warrants were valued at approximately $401,000 at the date of grant. Warrants to purchase 1,570,144 and
3,527,972 shares of our common stock at a price of $0.50 per share were exercised during the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The stockholder guaranties were cancelled in
June 2002 when we entered into a new credit facility.

On
January 1, 2003, in connection with a business acquisition, we issued 200,000 shares of our common stock. We granted a put option on those shares with a single exercise date
of January 1, 2007 at a price of $3.75 per share and obtained a call option on those shares with a single exercise date of January 1, 2007 at a price of $5.625 per share. We exercised
the call option in 2007 and retired the shares. These shares are reflected as Redeemable Common Stock in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2006.

On
October 4, 2005, we completed the sale of 12,870,000 shares of our common stock pursuant to a registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Pursuant to the same registration statement, the selling stockholders named in the registration statement sold 3,000,000 shares of our common stock. We received $87.9 million, net of
underwriting discount and offering related expenses of approximately $0.7 million, for the common stock we issued and sold. We did not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares by the selling
stockholders. We also received approximately $2.1 million in proceeds from the exercise of 1,200,000 stock options by certain members of management in connection with the offering.

On
September 25, 2007, we completed the sale of 23,600,000 shares of our common stock pursuant to a registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Pursuant to the same registration statement, the selling stockholders named in the registration statement sold 4,000,000 shares of our common stock. We received $349.5 million, net of
underwriting discount and offering related expenses of approximately $0.7 million, for the common stock we issued and sold. We did not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares by the selling
stockholders. We also received approximately $2.8 million in proceeds from the exercise of 1,000,000 stock options by certain members of management in connection with the offering.

On
December 15, 2005, our Board of Directors approved a two-for-one split of our common stock in the form of a stock dividend. Each stockholder of record
at the close of business on January 3, 2006 received an additional share of common stock for every outstanding share held. The payment date was January 13, 2006, and the common stock
began trading on a split-adjusted basis on January 17, 2006. On November 5, 2007, our Board of Directors approved a two-for-one split of our common stock payable
as a stock dividend. Each stockholder of record at the close of business on November 16, 2007 received an additional share of common stock for every outstanding share held. The payment date was
December 3, 2007, and the common stock began trading on a split-adjusted basis on December 4, 2007. All share and per share amounts for all periods presented have been adjusted to
reflect the stock splits.

Note 4. Equity Incentive Plans

In February 1998, we adopted the Equity Incentive Plan to attract and retain employees and consultants. Under the Equity Incentive Plan, both qualified and
nonqualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, performance shares and performance units may be granted. On


LKQ CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Note 4. Equity Incentive Plans (Continued)

March 6,
2002, our stockholders approved an increase in the number of shares available under the Equity Incentive Plan from 12.0 million to 20.0 million, subject to antidilution
and other adjustment provisions. On May 9, 2005, our stockholders approved an increase in the number of shares available under the Equity Incentive Plan from to 20.0 million to
28.0 million, subject to antidilution and other adjustment provisions.

In
November 1998, we also adopted the CEO Plan. The terms of the CEO Plan were substantially the same as the terms of the Equity Incentive Plan except that the exercise price of options
granted under
the CEO Plan could be less than the fair market value of our common stock on the date the option is granted. During 1998, we granted 700,000 options under the CEO Plan with an exercise price of $2.50
per share at a time when the fair value of our common stock was $3.125 per share. The difference between the fair market value and the option exercise price was recorded as deferred compensation
expense and was charged to operations over the vesting period of the options, which ended in November 2003. There are no additional shares available for award under the CEO Plan.

In
June 2003, our Board of Directors adopted the Director Plan and in September 2003, the plan was approved by our stockholders. Options granted under the Director Plan are automatic
and nondiscretionary, and the exercise price of the options is 100% of the fair market value of our common stock on the grant date. Only non-employee directors are eligible for grants
under the Director Plan. On March 5, 2007, our Board of Directors amended the Director Plan to eliminate the annual option grants to non-employee directors. The amendment was
effective commencing with the second quarter of 2007. On October 12, 2007, our Board of Directors further amended the Director Plan to eliminate the initial option grant to new, non-employee
directors. The Director Plan will terminate in June 2013, unless our Board of Directors terminates it sooner. The number of shares available under the Director Plan is 2,000,000, subject to
antidilution and other adjustment provisions.

expected to vest. The total grant-date fair value of options that vested during the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 was approximately $3.6 million,
$2.4 million and $8.2 million, respectively.

Note 4. Equity Incentive Plans (Continued)

The
aggregate intrinsic value (market value of our common stock less option exercise price) of outstanding, expected to vest and exercisable stock options at December 31, 2007 is
$176.1 million, $175.4 million and $149.3 million, respectively. The aggregate intrinsic value represents the total pre-tax intrinsic value, based on the closing price
of our common stock on December 31, 2007, which would have been received by the option holders had all option holders exercised their options as of that date. This amount changes based upon the
fair market value of our common stock.
The total intrinsic value of stock options exercised was $52.4 million, $18.5 million and $16.5 million during the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005,
respectively.

Stock
options expire 10 years from the date they are granted. Most of the options granted under the Equity Incentive Plan and the CEO Plan vest over a period of five years.
Options granted under the Director Plan vest six months after the date of grant. We expect to issue new shares of common stock to cover future stock option exercises.

On
January 7, 2005, our Board of Directors authorized the Compensation Committee to make the 2005 annual grant of stock options to employees (the "2005 Options"). On
January 14, 2005, the Compensation Committee granted options to purchase a total of 1,688,000 shares of our common stock with an exercise price of $4.42 per share. The vesting schedule for each
of the 2005 Options is as follows: June 14, 2005 with respect to 50% of the number of shares subject to such option and, with respect to an additional 5.555% of the number of shares subject to
such option, January 14, 2006 and each six month anniversary thereafter until January 14, 2010. This vesting schedule is different than the typical vesting schedule for options granted
under the Equity Incentive Plan.

On
January 10, 2005, the Compensation Committee amended the vesting schedule of a total of 1,714,000 options granted to employees in 2004 under the Equity Incentive Plan,
accelerating the vesting schedule to make all unvested shares subject to the options exercisable on January 10, 2005. The Compensation Committee decided to accelerate the vesting schedule of
these options primarily as a supplement to compensation due to the expected reduction of cash bonuses to employees for the 2004 calendar year. The bonus formula established by us in January 2004
resulted in reduced 2004 bonuses for many of our employees as compared to 2003. In addition, the Compensation Committee decided it was in the best interests of stockholders to accelerate these options
as we avoided compensation expense in future periods that would otherwise result from the effectiveness of SFAS 123R for periods beginning subsequent to December 31, 2005.

On
January 28, 2005, our Board of Directors granted options to employees to purchase a total of 1,200,000 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $4.165 per share. The
options were immediately exercisable with respect to all of the shares subject to the options. This vesting schedule is different than the typical vesting schedule for options granted under the Equity
Incentive Plan.

On
March 3, 2005, our Board of Directors authorized the submission to our stockholders of an amendment to the Equity Incentive Plan to increase the shares reserved for issuance
under the plan from 20,000,000 to 28,000,000. The amendment was approved by our stockholders on May 9, 2005.

During
January 2006, 2007 and 2008, our Board of Directors made an annual grant of options to employees to purchase a total of 923,200, 965,000 and 1,434,875 shares of our common stock
at an exercise price of $9.755, $10.06 and $19.135 per share, respectively. The options vest over a period of five years.

On
January 11, 2008, our Board of Directors also granted a total of 190,000 shares of restricted stock to certain of our key employees under our Equity Incentive Plan. Until the
shares of restricted stock vest, they may not be sold, pledged or otherwise transferred and are subject to forfeiture upon the recipient's voluntary termination of employment or termination for cause.
The restricted stock vests over a period of five years.

would have expired on June 30, 2005. This revolving credit facility initially had a maximum availability of $75 million, which was amended to $100 million on January 31,
2005. On June 1, 2005, the agreement was further amended to increase the maximum availability to $135 million, extend the maturity date to June 1, 2010 and modify certain other
terms. On April 25, 2007, the agreement was further amended to increase the maximum availability to $205.0 million, to provide, with the consent of the participating banks, for a further
increase in the maximum availability to $305.0 million, to extend the maturity to April 25, 2012, and to modify certain other terms. On May 30, 2007, the agreement was further
amended and restated to enable us, among other things, to borrow funds in either U.S. or Canadian dollars. On October 12,

from Lehman Brothers Inc. ("Lehman") and Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. ("Deutsche Bank") on October 12, 2007, which was amended on October 26, 2007. The Credit Agreement
has a six year term and includes a $610 million term loan, a $40 million Canadian currency term loan, a $100 million U.S. dollar revolving credit facility, and a
$15 million dual currency facility for drawings of either U.S. dollars or Canadian dollars. The Credit Agreement also provides for the issuance of letters of credit of up to $35 million
in U.S. dollars and up to $10 million in either U.S. or Canadian dollars, for a swing line credit facility of $25 million under the $100 million revolving credit facility, and for
the opportunity for us to add additional term loan facilities and/or increase the $100 million revolving credit facility's commitments, provided that such additions or increases do not exceed
$150 million in the aggregate. The letter of credit facilities and the swing line facility are part of the revolving credit facilities identified above and use of such facilities is taken into
account when determining availability under such credit facilities. All of the obligations under the Credit Agreement are unconditionally guaranteed by each of our domestic subsidiaries. Obligations
under the Credit Agreement, including the related guarantees, are collateralized by a security interest in substantially all of our domestic assets and our U. S. subsidiaries and a pledge of not more
than 65% of the total outstanding voting interests of any direct or indirect non-U.S. subsidiary of ours that is a "controlled foreign corporation." Amounts under each term loan facility
are due and payable in quarterly installments of increasing amounts beginning in 2008, with the balance payable in full at the end of year six. Amounts due under each revolving credit facility will be
due and payable at the end of year six. We are also required to prepay the term loan facilities upon the sale of certain assets, upon the incurrence of certain debt, upon receipt of certain insurance
and condemnation proceeds, and with up to 50% of our excess cash flow, with the amount of such excess cash flow determined based upon our total leverage ratio.

Indebtedness
made and payable in U.S. dollars under the Credit Agreement bears interest, at our option, at (i) a base rate (the higher of (x) the rate that is the prime
lending rate as set forth on the British Banking Association Reuters Page 5 or, under certain circumstances, such other comparable page as the agents may choose, as in effect from time to time,
and (y) 0.5% in excess of the overnight federal funds rate) plus an applicable margin currently of 1.25% per annum, or (ii) a Eurodollar rate as determined by the administrative agent
for the respective interest period plus an applicable margin currently of 2.25% per annum, except that indebtedness in respect of swing line loans bears interest only at the rate referred to in
clause (i). Indebtedness made and payable in Canadian dollars under the Credit Agreement is made, at our option, as bankers' acceptance loans or loans that bear interest at a rate equal to the
rate per annum of interest publicly quoted or established as the "prime rate" of Deutsche Bank AG Canada Branch for commercial loans in Canadian dollars to its Canadian borrowers (which does not
necessarily represent the lowest or best rate actually available) plus an applicable margin currently of 1.25% per annum. Under each bankers' acceptance loan, each Canadian lender will purchase a bill
of exchange, including a depository bill issued in accordance with the


LKQ CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Note 5. Long-Term Obligations (Continued)

Depository
Bills and Notes Act (Canada), denominated in Canadian dollars and discount notes, and we will sell such bill of exchange, at the applicable discount rate which, (1) in respect of any
bill of exchange accepted by a lender named on Schedule I to the Bank Act (Canada), is the average of the annual rates for bankers' acceptances having the same specified term and face amount as
the loan to be made to us that is reported by the Reuters Screen CDOR Page as of 10:00 a.m. on such day (or the next preceding business day if such day is not a business day) (or if not
reported by the Reuters Screen, then will be the average of the discount rate offered by the five largest (by assets) Canadian charter banks) and (2) in respect of any other lender, the CDOR
described above plus 0.10%. We will also pay an acceptance fee for each bankers' acceptance loan currently equal to 2.25% per annum. The applicable margin and acceptance fee for loans under the
revolving credit facilities are subject to a decrease of 0.25% based upon our total leverage ratio and the interest rate option chosen. Interest will be payable quarterly in arrears, except that
interest based on a Eurodollar rate or bankers' acceptance loans is payable in arrears on the last day of the relevant interest period and, for any Eurodollar interest period longer than three months,
quarterly. Any default in the payment of principal, interest, or other overdue amounts bears interest at 2% above the rate otherwise applicable (or, if there is no applicable rate, at 2% above the
base rate referred to in clause (i) above for loans made in U.S. dollars and the "prime rate" referred to in the second sentence of this paragraph for loans made in Canadian dollars). All
overdue amounts are payable on demand.

The
Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties, and contains customary covenants that restrict our ability to, among other things (i) incur liens,
(ii) incur any indebtedness (including guarantees or other contingent obligations), (iii) engage in mergers and consolidations, (iv) engage in sales, transfers, and other
dispositions of property and assets (including sale-leaseback transactions), (v) make loans, acquisitions, joint ventures, and other investments, (vi) make dividends and
other distributions to, and redemptions and repurchases from, equity holders, (vii) prepay, redeem, or repurchase certain debt, (viii) make changes in the nature of our business,
(ix) amend our organizational documents, or amend or otherwise modify certain of our debt documents, (x) change our fiscal quarter and fiscal year ends, (xi) enter into
transactions with LKQ's affiliates, (xii) make dividends, loans, and other transfers by subsidiaries of LKQ, and (xiii) issue certain equity interests. The Credit Agreement also requires
us to comply with certain financial and affirmative covenants.

The
Credit Agreement contains events of default that include (i) the Company's failure to pay principal when due or interest, fees, or other amounts after grace periods,
(ii) covenant defaults, (iii) the Company's material breach of any representation or warranty, (iv) cross defaults to certain other indebtedness, (v) bankruptcy,
insolvency, or other similar proceedings, (vi) the Company's inability to pay debts, (vii) judgment defaults of $15 million or more, (viii) customary ERISA and
environmental defaults, (ix) actual or asserted invalidity of any material provision of the loan documentation or impairment of a portion of the collateral, (x) failure of subordinated
indebtedness to be validly and sufficiently subordinated, and (xi) a change of control.

The
weighted-average interest rate on borrowings outstanding against the Company's senior secured credit facility at December 31, 2007 was 7.53%. Borrowings against the senior
secured credit facility totaled $650.3 million at December 31, 2007, $10.0 million of which are classified as current maturities and $640.3 million of which are classified
as long-term obligations.

Note 5. Long-Term Obligations (Continued)

As
part of the consideration for business acquisitions completed during 2007, 2006 and 2005, we issued promissory notes totaling approximately $1.7 million, $7.2 million
and $6.4 million, respectively. The notes bear interest at annual rates of 3.0% to 6.0%, and interest is payable at maturity or in monthly installments. We also assumed certain liabilities in
connection with a business acquisition during the second quarter of 2005, including a promissory note with a remaining principle balance of approximately $0.2 million. The annual interest rate
on the note, which was retired during 2006, was 5.1%.

Note 6. Commitments and Contingencies

Operating Leases

We are obligated under noncancelable operating leases for corporate office space, warehouse and distribution facilities, trucks and certain equipment.

Rental
expense for operating leases was approximately $27.4 million, $18.6 million and $12.2 million during the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005,
respectively.

We
guaranty the residual values of the majority of our truck and equipment operating leases. The residual values decline over the lease terms to a defined percentage of original cost.
In the event the lessor does not realize the residual value when a piece of equipment is sold, we would be responsible for a portion of the shortfall. Similarly, if the lessor realizes more than the
residual value when a piece of equipment is sold, we would be paid the amount realized over the residual value. Had we terminated all of our operating leases subject to these guaranties at
December 31, 2007, the guarantied residual value would have totaled approximately $24.0 million.

Litigation and Related Contingencies

On December 2, 2005, Ford Global Technologies, LLC ("Ford") filed a complaint with the United States International Trade Commission ("USITC")
against Keystone and five other named Respondents, including four Taiwan-based manufacturers. On December 12, 2005, Ford filed an Amended Complaint. Both the Complaint and the Amended Complaint
contended that Keystone and the other Respondents infringed 14 design patents that Ford alleges cover eight parts on the 2004-2005


LKQ CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Note 6. Commitments and Contingencies (Continued)

Ford
F-150 truck (the "Ford Design Patents"). Ford asked the USITC to issue a permanent general exclusion order excluding from entry into the United States all automotive parts that
infringe the Ford Design Patents and that are imported into the United States, sold for importation in the United States, or sold within the United States after importation. Ford also sought a
permanent order directing Keystone and the other Respondents to cease and desist from, among other things, selling, marketing, advertising, distributing and offering for sale imported automotive parts
that infringe the Ford Design Patents. On December 28, 2005, the USITC issued a Notice of Investigation based on Ford's Amended Complaint. The USITC's Notice of Investigation was published in
the Federal Register on January 4, 2006.

On
January 23, 2006, Keystone filed its Response to the Complaint and Notice of Investigation. In the Response, Keystone denied, among other things, that any of the Ford Design
Patents is valid and/or enforceable and, accordingly, denied each and every allegation of infringement. Keystone further asserted several affirmative defenses. In interlocutory rulings, the
Administrative Law Judge ("ALJ") struck Keystone's affirmative defenses of patent exhaustion, permissible repair, license and patent misuse and Keystone's affirmative defense that each of the patents
is invalid for failure to comply with the ornamentality requirement of 35 U.S.C.§171. Additionally, the ALJ granted Ford's request to drop four patents from the investigation. A hearing
before the ALJ took place the last week of August 2006.

On
December 4, 2006, the ALJ issued an Initial Determination upholding seven of Ford's design patents and declaring the remaining three design patents to be invalid. Both Ford
and the Company petitioned the Commission to review and set aside portions of the ALJ's Initial Determination. Keystone's petition also sought review of the ALJ's interlocutory rulings concerning
certain of its affirmative defenses. On March 20, 2007, the USITC decided not to review the ALJ's Initial Determination. Initially, the USITC determined that it would render its order on
remedy, bonding, and public policy on May 4, 2007. However, on April 30, 2007, the United States Supreme Court decided the case of KSR International Co. v. Teleflex Inc.,
which addressed claims of obviousness in patent law and which may have had potential implications relative to the Respondent's case before the USITC. The Respondents filed a petition for
reconsideration with the USITC on May 1, 2007 based on the decision in the KSR case. On May 4, 2007, the USITC extended the deadline for rendering its order on remedy, bonding, and
public policy until June 6, 2007, so that it could review its decision not to review the ALJ's Initial Determination in light of the KSR case.

On
June 6, 2007, the USITC issued its Notice of Final Determination. The Notice of Final Determination denied Respondent's petition for reconsideration and their motion for leave
to supplement their petition. In addition, the USITC issued a general exclusion order prohibiting the importation of certain automotive parts found to infringe the seven Ford design patents found
valid. The USITC's decision became final on August 6, 2007 upon the expiration without action of the 60-day Presidential review period. On May 18, 2007, Ford filed a Notice
of Appeal with the United States Federal Circuit Court of Appeals with regard to the three patents declared invalid in the ALJ's Initial Determination. On August 23, 2007, the Respondents filed
a Notice of Appeal with the United States Federal Court of Appeals. The appeals were consolidated, and the parties are submitting their respective briefs to the appellate court.

We
will continue to defend this action vigorously. At the time the exclusion order was issued, the parts that are subject to the order comprised only a minimal amount of our sales.
However, as such


LKQ CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Note 6. Commitments and Contingencies (Continued)

parts
become incorporated into more vehicles over time, it is likely that the amount of our sales of such parts would have increased substantially. If the 10 design patents in question are ultimately
upheld on appeal as valid and infringed, it is not anticipated that the loss of sales of these parts over time will be materially adverse to our financial condition, cash flows or results of
operations. However, depending upon the nature and extent of any adverse ruling, other auto manufacturers may attempt to assert similar allegations based upon design patents on a significant number of
parts for several of its models, which over time could have a material adverse impact on the entire aftermarket parts industry.

We
also have certain other contingent liabilities resulting from litigation, claims and other commitments and are subject to a variety of environmental and pollution control laws and
regulations incident to the ordinary course of business. We believe that the probable resolution of such contingencies will not materially affect our financial position, results of operations or cash
flows.

In
July 2007, two putative class action lawsuits captioned

Lynch v. Keystone Automotive Industries, Inc.,

Case No. BC374399, and

Shoys v. Keystone Automotive Industries, Inc.,

Case No. BC374480, were filed in the Superior Court of the State of California, County of Los Angeles in
connection with our acquisition of Keystone. On September 17, 2007, Keystone entered into a conditional memorandum of understanding with plaintiffs' counsel and the other named defendants in
the actions pursuant to which the parties agreed to settle the actions, subject to certain conditions, including confirmatory discovery and court approval of the final settlement. If the court
approves the settlement contemplated in the memorandum of understanding, the actions will be dismissed with prejudice. The hearing at which the court will consider approval of the settlement is
scheduled for April 2008.

Note 7. Business Combinations

On October 12, 2007, we completed our acquisition of 100% of the outstanding stock of Keystone, the nation's leading distributor of aftermarket collision
parts. Under the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger ("Merger Agreement") among the Company, Keystone and LKQ Acquisition Company, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company ("Merger Sub"), Merger
Sub was merged with and into Keystone with Keystone being the surviving corporation and becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. Under the Merger Agreement, holders of shares of Keystone
common stock received $48.00 in cash in exchange for each such share, representing an aggregate cash consideration, including transaction costs, net of deferred taxes, and assumed cash of
approximately $807 million on a fully diluted basis.

Also
in 2007, we acquired a 100% equity interest in each of eleven businesses (eight in the recycled OEM products business, including on July 3, 2007 Pintendre Autos, a recycled
parts business located near Quebec City, Canada, two in the aftermarket products business, and one that refurbishes and distributes head lamps and tail lamps) for an aggregate of $59.3 million
in cash and $1.7 million in notes issued to the sellers (see Note 5). These 2007 acquisitions enabled us to expand our presence in existing markets, serve new market areas and expand our
product line offering.

During
2006, we acquired a 100% equity interest in each of ten businesses (seven in the recycled OEM automotive parts business, two in the aftermarket automotive parts business and, on
January 31, 2006, Transwheel Corporation, an aluminum alloy wheel refurbishing and distribution business) for an aggregate of $71.1 million in cash and $7.2 million in notes
issued to the sellers (see Note 5). The


LKQ CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Note 7. Business Combinations (Continued)

acquisitions
enabled us to serve new market areas and become a significant provider of refurbished wheels.

During
2005, we acquired a 100% equity interest in each of eight businesses (four in the aftermarket products business, including on December 29, 2005 Fit-Rite Body
Parts, Inc. ("Fit-Rite")) for an aggregate of $110.0 million in cash, of which $1.9 million is to be paid subsequent to December 31, 2007, and approximately
$6.4 million in notes issued to the sellers (see Note 5). In addition, in connection with the Fit-Rite acquisition, the Company was obligated to pay up to $9.0 million
of contingent payments based upon the achievement of certain financial results over the thirty months following the closing of the acquisition. Certain terms of one of
the contingent payment agreements were modified in 2006 such that $1.0 million was immediately paid and the total remaining amount contingently payable was reduced to $4.0 million.
Payments totaling approximately $1.9 million were made during 2007, and we have recorded an additional $1.9 million payable under the terms of the contingent payment agreements at
December 31, 2007. The acquisitions enabled us to serve new market areas and expand our presence in other areas.

The
acquisitions are being accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and are included in our consolidated financial statements from the dates of acquisition. The purchase
prices were allocated to the net assets acquired based upon estimated fair market values at the dates of acquisition. In connection with the 2007 business acquisitions, the purchase price allocations
are preliminary as we are in the process of determining the following: 1) which operations acquired will be closed or combined with existing operations; 2) valuation amounts for certain
of the inventories and fixed assets acquired and the fair value of liabilities assumed; and 3) the final estimation of the tax basis of the entities acquired. During the year ended
December 31, 2007, we made adjustments to the preliminary purchase price allocations to finalize the inventory valuations and the estimated tax basis for certain of the businesses acquired in
2006. We also recorded a liability and made additional payments that increased the purchase price for additional consideration earned based upon the achievement of certain financial results in 2007 in
accordance with the contingent earnout provisions in the acquisition agreements. These adjustments increased goodwill related to these 2005 and 2006 acquisitions by $1.9 million.

Note 8. Restructuring and Integration Costs

We have undertaken certain restructuring activities in connection with our acquisition of Keystone during the fourth quarter of 2007. The restructuring
activities primarily include reductions in staffing

levels
and the closure of excess facilities. To the extent these restructuring activities are associated with Keystone operations, they are being accounted for in accordance with EITF Issue
No. 95-3, "Recognition of Liabilities in Connection with a Purchase Business Combination." Restructuring activities associated with our existing operations are being accounted for
in accordance with SFAS No. 146, "Accounting for Costs Associated With Exit or Disposal Activities."

In
connection with the Keystone restructuring activities, as part of the cost of the acquisition, we established reserves as detailed below. In accordance with EITF Issue
No. 95-3, we intend to finalize our restructuring plans no later than one year from the date of our acquisition of Keystone. Upon finalization of restructuring plans or settlement
of obligations for less than the expected amount, any excess reserves will be reversed with a corresponding decrease in goodwill. Accrued acquisition expenses are included in Other accrued expenses in

Note 9. Related Party Transactions

We sublease a portion of our corporate office space to an entity owned by the son of one of our principal stockholders for a pro rata percentage of the rent that
we are charged. The total amounts received from this entity were approximately $54,000, $70,000 and $49,000 during the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. We also paid
this entity approximately $0.4 million during 2007 for consulting fees incurred in connection with our new secured debt facility.

A
corporation owned by our Chairman of the Board, who is also one of our principal stockholders, owns private aircraft that we use from time to time for business trips. We reimburse
this corporation for out-of-pocket and other related flight expenses, as well as for other direct expenses incurred. The total amounts paid to this corporation were
approximately $102,000, $6,400 and $122,000 during each of the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

In
connection with the acquisitions of several businesses, we entered into agreements with several sellers of those businesses, who became stockholders as a result of those
acquisitions, for the lease of certain properties used in our operations. Typical lease terms include an initial term of five years, with three five-year renewal options and purchase
options at various times throughout the lease periods. We also maintain the right of first refusal concerning the sale of the leased property. Lease payments to a principal stockholder who became an
officer of the Company after the acquisition of his business were approximately $0.8 million during each of the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Note 9. Related Party Transactions (Continued)

We
believe that the terms of related party transactions described above are comparable to those available from unaffiliated third parties.

Note 10. Retirement Plans

401(k) Plans

We sponsor 401(k) defined contribution plans that cover substantially all of our eligible, full time U.S. employees. Contributions to the plans are made by both
the employee and us. Our contributions are
based on the level of employee contributions and are subject to certain vesting provisions based upon years of service. Expenses related to these plans totaled approximately $2.7 million,
$2.0 million and $1.6 million during 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan

We also offer a nonqualified deferred compensation plan to eligible employees who, due to Internal Revenue Service guidelines, may not take full advantage of our
401(k) defined contribution plans. The plan allows participants to defer up to 50% of eligible compensation, with a maximum deferral of $50,000 per year. We will match 50% of the portion of the
employee's contributions that does not exceed 6% of the employee's salary. The deferred compensation, together with our matching contributions and accumulated earnings, is accrued and is payable after
retirement or termination of employment, subject to vesting provisions. Participants may also elect to receive amounts deferred in a given year on any plan anniversary five or more years subsequent to
the year of deferral. Our matching contributions vest over a four year period and totaled $52,000, $50,000 and $13,000 in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, net of allowable transfers into our 401(k)
defined contribution plans. The nonqualified deferred compensation plan is funded under a trust agreement whereby we pay to the trust amounts deferred by employees, together with our match, with such
amounts invested in life insurance policies carried to meet the obligations under the deferred compensation plan. The cash surrender value of these policies was approximately $4.6 million and
$3.7 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, and is included in Other Assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Total deferred compensation liabilities were
approximately $4.5 million and $3.8 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, and are included in Accrued payroll-related liabilities and Other Noncurrent Liabilities
in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Defined Benefit Pension Plan

Keystone, which we acquired on October 12, 2007, also maintained a qualified defined benefit pension plan which was suspended effective January 1,
1997. We have begun the steps necessary to terminate the plan and all obligations are expected to be paid out in 2008. The accumulated benefit obligation at December 31, 2007 was
$6.7 million, and the fair value of plan assets was $5.3 million. The resulting unfunded benefit obligation of $1.4 million is included in Accrued payroll-related liabilities in
the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2007. Since the plan is being terminated and the amounts are not material, we have omitted the more detailed disclosures prescribed
by SFAS No. 158.

Note 12. Income Taxes (Continued)

During
2006, the Internal Revenue Service completed its audit of our 2002 and 2003 tax returns. As a result of the completion of this audit and the statutory closing of 2002 and prior
tax years, we recorded a tax benefit in the third quarter of 2006 of approximately $0.7 million consisting of the reversal of accrued income tax liabilities no longer deemed necessary.

In
April 2007, a new income tax law was enacted (retroactive to January 1, 2007) in a state in which we operate. As a result of this new tax law we recorded a reduction of
certain deferred tax assets and net income of approximately $0.6 million in the second quarter of 2007, coinciding with the tax law enactment date.

We
are currently the subject of income tax audits by two states for the tax years 2000 through 2004 as well as an audit by the Internal Revenue Service for our 2005 tax year.
Adjustments from such audits, if any, are not expected to have a material effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements.

We
adopted the provisions of FIN 48 effective January 1, 2007. FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold a tax position is
required to meet before being recognized. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, measurement, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and
transition. As a result of the implementation of FIN 48, we recognized an increase of approximately $0.3 million (net of tax effect) in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits which was accounted
for as a reduction to the January 1, 2007, balance of retained earnings.

A
reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits is as follows (in thousands):

As
of December 31, 2007, we have accumulated interest and penalties included in gross unrecognized tax benefits of $0.8 million, of which $0.1 million was accrued during 2007. We
additionally have a deferred tax asset of $0.3 million related to these balances. The amount of the unrecognized tax benefits which if resolved favorably (in whole or in part) would reduce our
effective tax rate is approximately $2.6 million at December 31, 2007. The $2.1 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits associated with our acquisition of Keystone during 2007 is preliminary
and any adjustment would result in an adjustment to the goodwill recorded in our preliminary purchase price allocation.

It
is our continuing policy to account for interest and penalties associated with income tax obligations as a component of income tax expense.

During
the twelve months beginning January 1, 2008, it is reasonably possible that we will reduce gross unrecognized tax benefits by up to approximately $1.5 million, of which
approximately $0.5 million would impact our effective tax rate, primarily as a result of the expiration of certain statutes of limitations.

Note 14. Long Term Incentive Plan

On January 26, 2006, our Board of Directors approved, and our stockholders approved at the annual meeting on May 8, 2006, the LKQ Corporation Long
Term Incentive Plan. The purpose of the Long Term Incentive Plan is to offer certain key employees the opportunity to receive long-term performance rewards. Each participant will be
entitled to a performance award for each performance period under the plan. Performance periods will begin on January 1 and end on December 31 of the third calendar year thereafter.
Performance awards will be equal to the participant's base salary (at the end of the applicable performance period) multiplied by an "Award Percentage." A participant's Award Percentage is determined
by three components: the growth over the performance period of each of the Company's earnings per share, total revenue, and return on equity. The Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors will
determine for each participant the range of Award Percentages based on different growth scenarios of the components. One half of any performance award achieved is payable promptly after the end of the
performance period. A participant must be an employee of the Company throughout the performance period to be eligible for the first 50% payment. The other half of the performance award is deferred and
payable in three equal installments on each one year anniversary of the end of the performance period over a total of three years. A participant must be an employee on each such anniversary date to be
eligible for the respective deferred payment, unless the participant is not an employee as a result of death, total disability or normal retirement at age 65, in which case the participant (or his or
her estate) will be entitled to all of the deferred payments upon such death, disability or retirement. Interest on the deferred portion of the performance award will accrue at the prime rate and be
payable to the participant at the same time as the deferred installments are paid. We

ITEM 9A.    CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

As of December 31, 2007, the end of the period covered by this report, an evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of
LKQ Corporation's management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of our "disclosure controls and procedures" (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the design and operation of these disclosure controls and
procedures were effective to ensure that the Company is able to collect, process and disclose, within the required time periods, the information we are required to disclose in the reports we file with
the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Report of Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting February 28, 2008

Management of LKQ Corporation and subsidiaries (the "Company") is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting
as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States. Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company, (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation
of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the Company, and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company's assets
that could have a material effect on the Company's financial statements.

Internal
control over financial reporting includes the controls themselves, monitoring and internal auditing practices and actions taken to correct deficiencies as identified. Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to
the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Management
assessed the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007. Management based this assessment on criteria for
effective internal control over financial reporting described in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Management's assessment included an evaluation of the design of the Company's internal control over financial reporting and testing of the operational
effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting. Management reviewed the results of its assessment with the Audit Committee of the Company's Board of Directors.

Based
on this assessment, management determined that, as of December 31, 2007, the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting. Deloitte &
Touche LLP, independent registered public accounting firm, who audited and reported on the consolidated financial statements of


the
Company included in this report, has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007.

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

The Company completed the acquisition of Keystone on October 12, 2007. The Company believes that the internal controls of Keystone have a material effect
on the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Except for the foregoing, there was no change in the Company's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the Company's
most recently completed fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.


REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To
the Board of Directors and Stockholders of LKQ Corporation:

We
have audited the internal control over financial reporting of LKQ Corporation and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2007, based on criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated
Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company's
management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the
accompanying Report of Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our
audit.

We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control
over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and
performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A
company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company's principal executive and principal financial officers, or
persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company's board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;
(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that
receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because
of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material
misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to
future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In
our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on the criteria established
in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.


We
have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements and financial statement
schedule of the Company as of and for the year ended December 31, 2007 and our report dated February 28, 2008 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and financial
statement schedule and included explanatory paragraphs regarding the Company's adoption in 2006 of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123(R),
