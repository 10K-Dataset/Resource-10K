ITEM 1.

BUSINESS

Overview

We provide replacement
systems, components, and parts needed to repair light vehicles (cars and light
trucks). Buyers of light vehicle replacement products have the option to
purchase from primarily three sources: new products produced by original
equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”), which are commonly known as OEM products; new
products produced by companies other than the OEMs, which are sometimes
referred to generically as “aftermarket” products; and recycled products
originally produced by OEMs, which we refer to as recycled OEM products. We
participate in the market for recycled OEM products as well as the market for
collision repair aftermarket products. We obtain aftermarket products and
salvage vehicles from a variety of sources, and we dismantle the salvage
vehicles to obtain a comprehensive range of vehicle products that we distribute
into the light vehicle repair market. We are not involved in the manufacture of
automotive products and do not maintain any manufacturing or remanufacturing operations.

We believe we are the
largest nationwide provider of recycled OEM products and related services, with
sales, processing, and distribution facilities that reach most major markets in
the U.S. We believe that we are the second largest nationwide provider of
aftermarket collision replacement products. While we currently service the
majority of the major metropolitan areas in the U.S. with both recycled OEM and
aftermarket products, we estimate our current share of the light vehicle
recycling market to be less than 10%, and our current share of the aftermarket
products market to be less than 10%. We believe there are opportunities for
growth in both product lines through acquisitions and internal development.

We procure salvage
vehicles, primarily at auctions, using our locally based professionals,
proprietary processes, and a disciplined procurement system. In addition, as an
alternative source of salvage vehicles, we obtain some inventory directly from
insurance companies, vehicle manufacturers, and other suppliers. Once we have
received proper title, which assures us that the vehicles have not been stolen,
we dismantle such vehicles for recycled OEM products. We purchase aftermarket
products from manufacturers, primarily in Taiwan, using a proprietary order
management system.

Our customers include
collision and mechanical repair shops and, indirectly, insurance companies,
including extended warranty companies. The majority of our products and
services are sold to collision repair shops, also known as body shops, and
mechanical repair shops. We indirectly rely on insurance companies, which
ultimately pay the collision repair shops for the repair of insured vehicles,
as a source of business. These insurance companies exert significant influence in
the vehicle repair decision, and increasingly look to a nationwide source for
consistency, quality, and availability of replacement products. Because of
their importance to the process, we have formed business relationships with
certain insurance companies, and with certain extended warranty providers, in
order to be their preferred light vehicle parts supplier. For example, with
some insurance companies we have vehicle repair order estimate review programs
in place and provide their claims adjusters a part quote and locator service.
In addition, we provide them an outlet to dispose of certain total loss
vehicles directly to us. We provide extended warranty companies a single
national call desk to service their nationwide needs for mechanical products.


We believe we provide
customers a value proposition that includes high quality products, extensive
product availability due to our regional inventory trading zones, product costs
lower than new OEM products, and quick delivery. We provide benefits to repair shops
and insurance companies because the lower costs for our products enable many
vehicles to be repaired rather than declared a total loss. By expanding our
product offerings to include both recycled OEM products and aftermarket
products we now offer customers a more extensive range of light vehicle
replacement products. We believe this unique combination of recycled and
aftermarket product offerings allows us to serve as a “one-stop” solution for
our customers looking for the most cost advantageous way to repair vehicles.

Our History

We believe we were the
first recycler of light vehicle products to achieve a national network and
presence. Since our formation in 1998, we have grown through both internal
development and acquisitions. Our acquisition strategy has been to target
companies with strategic locations and significant market presence, strong
management teams, a record of environmental compliance, solid growth prospects,
and a reputation for quality and customer service. We currently have 65 locations
in the U.S. that supply wholesale recycled OEM products. In February 2004,
we expanded our product offerings by also becoming a supplier of aftermarket
products and a provider of self-service retail recycled vehicle products. We
currently have approximately 45 locations that supply aftermarket products,
serving 23 states primarily east of the Mississippi River, and 12 locations
providing self-service retail recycled vehicle products in Florida, Illinois,
Oregon, and Tennessee. On January 31, 2006, we acquired Transwheel
Corporation, an aluminum alloy wheel refurbishing and distribution business. Transwheel
currently operates refurbishing and distribution facilities in Indiana,
Connecticut, Florida and Maryland and distribution facilities in Illinois and
Michigan.

For the year ended December 31,
2005, revenue derived from recycled OEM products and related services
represented approximately 75% of our revenue, sales of aftermarket products and
services represented approximately 15.5% of our revenue, and sales of other
products, such as scrap and other bulk products, represented approximately 9.5%
of our revenue.

Our Strengths

We
Provide a National Solution to Insurance Companies and Extended Warranty
Providers.

We believe that our
nationwide presence gives us a unique ability to service the major automobile
insurance companies and extended warranty providers. Insurance companies and
extended warranty providers operate generally at a national or regional level
and play a critical role in the repair process. We believe we provide a direct
benefit to these companies by lowering the cost of repairs, decreasing the time
required to return the repaired vehicle to the customer, and providing a
replacement product that is of comparable quality to the part replaced.
Specifically, we assist insurance companies by purchasing insured total loss
vehicles and by providing cost effective products through sales to collision repair
shops, especially to repair shops that are part of an insurance company
network. We also provide a review of vehicle repair order estimates to
insurance companies so they may assess the opportunity to increase usage of
recycled OEM and aftermarket products. For extended warranty providers, we
provide a single national call desk to service their nationwide need for
mechanical products.

We
Believe We have the Only National Network for Recycled OEM Products and it
Would be Difficult to Replicate.

We have invested
significant capital developing a national network of recycled OEM product
facilities that serves most major metropolitan areas in the U.S. We have
differentiated ourselves from our local competitors and made replication of our
network difficult by developing our network through purchasing anchor companies
that were among the largest companies in the industry. The difficulty and time
required to obtain proper zoning, as well as dismantling and other
environmental permits necessary to operate newly-sited facilities, would
make establishing new facilities challenging. In addition, there are
difficulties


associated
with recruiting and hiring an experienced management team that has strong
industry knowledge and local relationships with customers. Finally, our
national network allows us to enter new adjacent markets quickly by
establishing redistribution facilities, which avoids the need for local
dismantling capabilities and inventory.

We
Benefit From a Local Presence.

Our network of facilities
allows us to develop and maintain our relationships with local repair shops,
while providing a level of service to insurance companies and national
customers that is made possible by our nationwide presence. Our local presence
allows us to provide daily deliveries that our customers require, using drivers
who routinely deliver to the same customers. Our sales force and local delivery
drivers develop and maintain critical personal relationships with the local
repair shops that benefit from access to our wide selection of products which
we are able to offer as a result of our regional inventory network.

We
Have a Proven and Effective Procurement Process.

We have designed
information systems and methodologies to procure salvage vehicles and
aftermarket products cost-effectively. As our largest single expenditure,
efficient procurement of salvage vehicles is critical to the growth, operating
results and cash flow of our business. Our processes and know-how allow us to
identify and value the parts that can be recycled on a damaged vehicle at
auction and to determine rapidly the maximum price we will pay for the vehicle
in order to achieve our target margins on resale of the recycled OEM products.
We carefully analyze the market and obtain aftermarket products and salvage vehicles
of the type whose parts are in demand at prices that we believe will allow us
to sell products profitably. We have also taken advantage of our relationships
with insurance companies and vehicle manufacturers to obtain salvage vehicles
outside the auction process.

We
Have a Broad and Deep Inventory of Products.

We believe that our
customers place a high value on availability of a broad range of light vehicle
replacement products. We also believe that our inventory of both recycled OEM
and aftermarket products allows us to fill a higher percentage of our customers’
orders than our competitors. In addition, our ability to share inventory on a
regional basis increases the availability of replacement products and also
helps us to fill a higher percentage of our customers’ orders. We have
developed regional trading zones within which we make our inventory available
to our local facilities, mostly via overnight product transfers. We manage our
inventory and purchasing on a regional basis to enhance the availability of the
products that we believe will be in the highest demand within each region. Our
broad and deep inventory furthers our ability to serve as a “one-stop” solution
for our customers’ recycled OEM and aftermarket product needs.

We
Have Implemented Management Disciplines.

Our management and
operations team is highly experienced, with many managers having spent their
entire careers in the light vehicle recycling industry. We have developed and
built procurement, operating, and financial systems that have allowed us to
grow and develop our national network and implement professional management
techniques and disciplines. As our business has grown, we have acquired
additional management talent which has furthered the sharing of best practices
throughout the company. In addition, our senior management team has extensive
acquisition experience and will continue to use our disciplined approach in
targeting growth opportunities.

Our Strategies

Strengthen
our National Network Through Internal Growth and Acquisitions.

We intend to continue to
expand our market coverage through a combination of internal development and
acquisitions and to look for opportunities to expand into new regions and into
adjacent markets. We plan to establish a presence in additional major
metropolitan markets and a number of smaller markets in


the U.S.
We have applied an analytical and disciplined approach to our acquisition
process and have targeted companies with strong management teams, a record of
environmental compliance, solid growth prospects, and a reputation for quality
and customer service.

Further
Develop Business Relationships.

We intend to continue to
develop business relationships with automobile insurance companies, extended
warranty providers, and other industry participants. We believe that insurance
companies and extended warranty providers, as payors for many repairs, will
take a more active role in the selection of replacement products in the repair
process in order to use lower cost alternatives to new OEM products. On behalf
of certain insurance company customers, we provide a review of vehicle repair
order estimates so they may assess the opportunity to increase usage of
recycled OEM and aftermarket products in the repair process, thereby reducing
their costs. Our employees also provide quotes for our products to assist
several insurance companies with their estimate and settlement processes. We
also work with insurance companies and vehicle manufacturers to procure salvage
vehicles directly from them on a selected basis, which provides us an
additional source of supply and provides them improved economics on salvage
vehicle sales. We believe we are positioned to take advantage of the increasing
importance of these industry participants and will continue to look for ways to
enhance our relationships.

Continue
to Improve our Operating Results.

We are working to improve
our operating results by applying our business disciplines to our most recently
acquired facilities, continuing to build our network, further centralizing certain
functions, improving our use of technology, and increasing revenue at our lower
volume facilities. Our higher volume facilities generally operate at a higher
profitability level as a percentage of revenue. We believe we can improve the
profitability level at our lower volume facilities by achieving the higher
volumes and improved economies of scale that we realize at our higher volume
facilities. We intend to continue to refine our procurement system, which uses
methodologies that analyze demand levels for our products, existing inventory
levels, and projected margins on an individual vehicle basis.

Further
Develop our Technology and Business Processes.

We continue to emphasize
the use of technology in our processes to improve efficiency and to increase
the standardization of our business. Our technology and proprietary processes
enhance procurement, pricing, and inventory management. We continue to develop
our technology to allow us to better manage and analyze our inventory, to
assist our sales people with up-to-date pricing and availability of our
products, and to further enhance our procurement process. For example, many of
our representatives responsible for procuring vehicles, whom we refer to as “scouts,”
are equipped with handheld computing devices to assist them in appraising the
vehicles prior to submitting a bid to purchase the vehicle. Additionally, we
have begun implementing a bar code system that we believe will facilitate
improved inventory tracking and management of our recycled products.

Raise
Industry Standards by Being the Industry Leader.

Since our inception, we
have employed a professional approach to the light vehicle recycling business.
We continue to seek new ways to improve our methodologies and to communicate
our standards to our customers. We further believe that, by elevating industry
standards in areas such as customer service, integrity, product quality and
availability, delivery time, warranty support, environmental compliance, and
appearance of facilities, we can help promote the acceptability of the use of
recycled OEM and aftermarket products.

Our Process

Our operations generally
involve the procurement of inventory, vehicle processing (in the case of
wholesale recycled OEM products), sales, and distribution.


Procurement
of Inventory

We start the process of
procuring recycled OEM products for our wholesale operations by acquiring
severely damaged or totaled vehicles. We acquired approximately 97,000 salvage
vehicles for our wholesale operations in 2005. We purchase the majority of our
vehicles from salvage auctions. Wrecked vehicles are sold at salvage auctions
held each weekday throughout the country. Salvage auctions provide an outlet
for salvage vehicles to be processed and sold primarily to automotive recyclers
and rebuilders. We pay third parties fees to tow the vehicles from the auction
to our facilities. Salvage auctions charge fees both to the supplier of
vehicles (primarily insurance companies) and to the purchaser (including us).

For the vast majority of
our salvage auction purchases, we send a scout in advance of each auction to
investigate the vehicles we would be interested in buying. The scout obtains
key information such as the model, mileage, and damage assessment and
determines which parts on the targeted vehicles are recyclable. This
information is electronically forwarded to our bid specialists via handheld
computing devices or facsimile transmissions. The bid specialists analyze the
data in light of current demand for the parts in question, the levels of our
inventory with respect to such parts, and the projected margins expected for
each vehicle. The specialists then set a maximum bid price that our bidders use
to purchase the vehicle at auction. We believe that this system provides a
disciplined approach to procurement.

We also obtain salvage
vehicles and parts from insurance companies, vehicle manufacturers, abandoned
vehicle programs, and other salvage sources. Some of these arrangements allow
us to acquire salvage vehicles directly from the insurance company or vehicle
manufacturer at a cost calculated as a percentage of revenue from such
vehicles, which is remitted as products are sold from these vehicles. These
arrangements eliminate the fees we and the insurance company would otherwise pay
to the salvage auction and provide us inventory with a lower initial
expenditure of capital.

We acquire inventory for
our self-service retail recycled OEM products operations from a variety of
sources, including but not limited to auctions, towing companies,
municipalities, insurance carriers, charitable organizations and the general
public. In 2005, we purchased approximately 55,800 salvage vehicles for our
retail operations.

We purchase aftermarket
products from independent manufacturers. Approximately 90% of the aftermarket
products we purchase originate in Taiwan. We obtain the balance of our
aftermarket products from sources in the U.S. No single supplier currently
provides more than 21% of our aftermarket products. We use a proprietary order
management system to procure our aftermarket inventory. The system prompts
inventory purchases based on stocking levels and historical sales data. We
believe that the system helps us to procure our aftermarket inventory
efficiently and to maintain one of the highest fulfillment rates in the
aftermarket products industry.

Vehicle
Processing

Vehicle processing for our
wholesale operations involves dismantling a salvage vehicle into recycled OEM
products ready for delivery. When a salvage vehicle arrives at one of our
facilities, an inventory specialist identifies, catalogs, and schedules the
vehicle for dismantling. We do not dismantle any vehicle until we have received
proper title documentation, thereby assuring that the vehicle was not stolen.

The dismantler removes
components that will become products for sale. Products that are placed
directly on inventory shelves generally include such items as the engine,
transmission, hood, trunk lid, head and tail lamp assemblies, rear bumper, and
doors. We remove all recyclable items including fluids, freon, batteries,
tires, and catalytic converters. These items are sold to recyclers and
reprocessors. Dismantlers also perform any required cutting of the vehicle
frame or body.

Each inventory item is
entered into our inventory tracking system, inspected for quality, tagged for
identification, and prepared for storage and delivery to our customers.
Mechanical products not in a condition to be sold as recycled products or that
are in surplus supply are separated and sold in bulk to


parts
remanufacturers. The remaining vehicle hulks and components, such as fabrics,
rubber, plastics, and glass, are delivered to automobile shredders, crushers,
and scrap processors.

Sales

As of December 31,
2005, we employed approximately 475 full-time sales staff in our wholesale
recycled OEM products operations. Of these, approximately 450 were located at
sales desks at our facilities and generally are responsible for accepting
incoming calls from, and selling our inventory to, our customers. We put all of
our sales personnel through a thorough training program. Most of our sales
personnel are paid primarily on a commission basis. In addition, as of December 31,
2005, we had approximately 25 traveling sales staff who visit our customers and
focus on business development in various markets. In our aftermarket products
operations, sales orders are accepted by either our local delivery drivers or
by our dedicated aftermarket products sales call center located in Columbus,
Ohio.

We are continually reviewing
and revising the pricing of our recycled OEM products. Our pricing specialists
take into consideration factors such as location, recent demand, inventory
quantity, inventory turnover, new OEM product prices, recycled OEM product
prices, aftermarket product prices, and remanufactured part prices, with the
goal of optimizing revenue. We update the pricing of our aftermarket products
at least annually when we update our product catalog, and we may adjust
aftermarket prices during the year in response to material price changes of OEM
products.

The inventory base of each
of our facilities, supplemented by the inventory sharing system within our
regional trading zones, gives us what we believe to be a competitive advantage
through our ability to meet our customers’ requirements more frequently than
smaller competitors.

Distribution

Each sale results in the
generation of a work order. A dispatcher is then responsible for ensuring
product accuracy, printing the final invoice, and including the products on the
appropriate truck route for delivery to the customer. We operate a delivery
fleet of medium-sized trucks and smaller trucks and vans. These trucks
deliver products to our customers within a specified territory, typically on a
daily basis. In markets where we offer both recycled OEM and aftermarket
products, we deliver both types of products on the same delivery routes to help
minimize distribution costs.

Additionally, we have
developed an internal distribution network to allow our sales representatives
to sell both recycled OEM and aftermarket products from the inventory of nearby
facilities within our regional trading zones, thus improving our ability to
fulfill customer requests and to improve inventory turnover. We operate
approximately 55

recycled OEM product and 26
aftermarket product transfers between our facilities within our regional
trading zones each weekday.

Our Products

When we procure salvage
vehicles, we focus on vehicles for which the insured repair market has the most
recycled OEM product demand. These tend to be popular types of vehicles such as
sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks, and popular models, like the Accord,
Taurus, Camry, Lumina, and Explorer. These vehicles generally are a few model
years old, as insurers tend to use new OEM products on repairs of vehicles that
are one to two years old. Similarly, insurers are less likely to authorize the
repair of vehicles more than ten model years old. The degree of damage is not a
significant factor in our process as we only assign value to the undamaged
product when we prepare our bids.

Our most popular recycled
OEM products include engines, vehicle front end assemblies, doors,
transmissions, trunk lids, bumper assemblies, wheels, head and tail lamp
assemblies, mirrors, fenders, and axles.


When we obtain a
mechanical product from a dismantled vehicle and determine that we have an
excess supply of such product or it is defective, it is then sold in bulk to
mechanical remanufacturers. We refer to these items as core products. The
majority of these products are transferred to our core facility in Houston,
Texas where we sort them by product and model type. Examples of such products
are engine blocks and heads, transmissions, starters, alternators, and air
conditioner compressors.

When we procure aftermarket
products, we focus on aftermarket products that are in the most demand by the
insured repair market. Our most popular aftermarket products are head lamps,
tail lamps, grilles, hoods, and mirrors. We also focus on aftermarket products
that would best complement our recycled OEM product inventory.

Our Customers

Insurance
Companies

We consider automobile
insurance companies our customers, as they are a key demand driver for our
products. Our products are delivered directly to the repair shop or installer,
because insurance companies and extended warranty providers generally do not
take receipt of repair parts. While insurance companies do not pay for our
products directly, the insurance company does ultimately pay for the repair of
the insured vehicle. As a result, the insurance company often exerts
significant influence in the decision-making process as to how a damaged
vehicle is repaired, and the cost level of the product used in the repair
process. Insurance companies are also concerned with customer satisfaction with
the repair process and the total time to return the repaired vehicle to its
owner.

Repair Shops and
Others

We sell the majority of
our products wholesale to collision repair shops and mechanical repair shops.
The majority of these customers tend to be individually-owned small
businesses, although over the last few years there has been a trend toward
consolidation resulting in the formation of several national and regional
repair companies. We also sell our products to automobile dealerships and fleet
management groups. In addition, we sell our products to individual retail
customers at our self-service retail locations and at certain of our wholesale
recycled OEM and aftermarket product locations.

Remanufacturers

A mechanical part that is
not suitable for sale as a replacement part, or that is a product for which we
have an excess supply, is sold to mechanical remanufacturers in bulk shipments.
Examples of mechanical parts we sell in this manner are engine blocks and
heads, transmissions, starters, alternators, and air conditioner compressors.
Remanufacturers usually are significantly larger companies than repair shops.
Our sales to them tend to be large orders and are dependent on their needs for
a certain product line.

Our Employees

As of December 31,
2005, we had approximately 3,370 employees performing operational functions and
approximately 130 corporate and regional employees. None of our employees is a
member of a union or participates in other collective bargaining arrangements.

Our Facilities

Our corporate headquarters
are located at 120 North LaSalle Street, Suite 3300, Chicago, Illinois
60602. In February 2004, we entered into a new lease, which became
effective on August 1, 2004, to remain in our current office space. The term
of the new lease is ten years, but either party can terminate the lease in July 2009.
The primary functions performed at our corporate headquarters are financial,
accounting, treasury, marketing, business development, human resources,
information systems support, and legal. In


addition
to our corporate headquarters, we have numerous operating facilities that
handle recycled OEM products, aftermarket products, and self-service retail
products.

Recycled OEM Parts

Our wholesale recycled OEM
parts facilities are located among eight geographic regions. A typical facility
has processing, sales and distribution operations, including a large warehouse
with multiple bays to dismantle vehicles, indoor and outdoor storage areas, and
administrative and sales offices. Equipment typically used at each facility
includes hydraulic lifts, forklifts and loaders, and hand tools to dismantle
vehicles. We also have facilities that operate primarily as redistribution
centers. As of March 1, 2006, we conducted our wholesale recycled OEM
parts operations from 65 facilities, 52 of which include a combination of
processing, sales and redistribution operations, and 13 of which are primarily
redistribution facilities. We also have three recycled OEM parts facilities in
San Jose, Costa Rica; Guatemala City, Guatemala; and Xela, Guatemala.

Aftermarket Parts

We conduct our aftermarket
parts business from facilities that serve as sales, warehousing or distribution
centers for these parts. As of March 1, 2006, we conducted our aftermarket
parts operations from approximately 
45  facilities. The largest of
these facilities are located in Columbus, Ohio; Charlotte, North Carolina;
Dallas, Texas; Oakland, California; Pennsauken, New Jersey; Totowa, New Jersey;
Landover, Maryland; Atlanta, Georgia; Chicago, Illinois; Webster, Massachusetts
and Topeka, Kansas.

Self-Service Retail Parts

Our self-service retail
parts facilities typically consist of several acres of vehicles stored outdoors
and a retail building through which customers access the vehicles. As of March 1,
2006, we conducted our self-service retail parts operations from 12 facilities
in the United States.

Competition

We operate in a highly
competitive industry. We consider all suppliers of light vehicle products to be
competitors, including participants in the recycled OEM product market, OEMs,
parts remanufacturers, and suppliers of aftermarket products. We believe the
principal areas of competition in our industry include pricing, product quality,
service, and availability of inventory.

We compete with more than
6,000 domestic light vehicle product recyclers, most of which are single-unit
operators. We believe most of the light vehicle parts recyclers in the U.S.
have less than $3.0 million in annual revenue. In some markets, smaller
competitors have organized affiliations to share marketing and distribution
resources. Greenleaf LLC, a light vehicle recycling business, started by Ford
Motor Company, is our largest competitor in the light vehicle OEM product
recycling business. Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc., a company with
operations in the steel manufacturing, metals recycling, and vehicle product
recycling businesses, reported that it purchased Greenleaf on
September 30, 2005. Schnitzer Steel is a significant operator in the
self-service retail recycling business.

We also compete with
distributors of aftermarket collision light vehicle products. The largest
distributor of these products in the U.S. is Keystone Automotive
Industries, Inc.

Manufacturers of new
original equipment parts sell the majority of light vehicle replacement
products. We believe, however, that as the insurance and repair industries come
to appreciate the advantages of recycled OEM and aftermarket products, those
products can account for a larger percentage of total vehicle replacement
product sales.


Information Technology

We use a single third party facility management system
in most of our wholesale recycled OEM operations. We believe that a single
system helps us with the continued implementation of standard operating
procedures, training efficiency, employee transferability, access to a national
inventory database, management reporting, and data storage. It also eliminates
the need to create multiple versions of proprietary applications and systems
support processes.

The major features of our facility management system
include inventory control, customer selling and billing, sales analysis,
vehicle tracking, and profitability reporting. The system also supports an
electronic exchange system for identifying and locating parts at other selected
recyclers and facilitates brokered sales to fill customer orders for items not
in stock.

We have separate third party providers for our
financial systems such as financial and budget reporting, general ledger
accounting, accounts payable, payroll, and fixed assets. We utilize the same
common financial systems throughout the majority of our operations.

We currently protect our local customer, inventory,
and corporate consolidated data, such as financial information, e-mail files,
and other user files, with daily backups. These backups are stored off site
with a third party data protection vendor.

We have consolidated our facility management systems
onto regional system platforms. The hardware for all such platforms is located
at a single data center. The center is in a secure environment with
around-the-clock monitoring; redundant power backup; and multiple, diverse data
and telecommunication routing. Facility management system data is “mirrored”
(replicated) off site in real time to a disaster recovery facility located in a
different part of the country. This disaster recovery facility is also housed
in a secure environment with around-the-clock monitoring; redundant power
backup; and multiple, diverse data and telecommunications routing.

Currently our aftermarket
and self-service retail operations each use a separate facility management
system.

Regulation

Environmental Compliance

Our operations and properties, including the
maintenance of our delivery vehicles, are subject to extensive federal, state,
and local environmental protection and health and safety laws and regulations.
These environmental laws govern, among other things, the emission and discharge
of hazardous materials into the ground, air, or water; the exposure to
hazardous materials; and the generation, handling, storage, use, treatment,
identification, transportation, and disposal of industrial by-products, waste
water, storm water, and mercury and other hazardous materials.

We have made and will continue to make capital and
other expenditures relating to environmental matters. We have an environmental
management process designed to facilitate and support our compliance with these
requirements. We cannot assure you, however, that we will at all times be in
complete compliance with such requirements.

Although we presently do not expect to incur any
capital or other expenditures relating to environmental controls or other
environmental matters in amounts that would be material to us, we may be
required to make such expenditures in the future. Environmental laws are
complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time.
Accordingly, we cannot assure you that environmental laws will not change or
become more stringent in the future in a manner that could have a material
adverse effect on our business.


Contamination resulting
from vehicle recycling processes can include soil and ground water
contamination from the release, storage, transportation, or disposal of
gasoline, motor oil, antifreeze, transmission fluid, CFCs from air conditioners,
other hazardous materials, or metals such as aluminum, cadmium, chromium, lead,
and mercury. Contamination can migrate on-site or off-site which can increase
the risk, and the amount, of any potential liability.

In addition, many of our
facilities are located on or near properties with a history of industrial use
which may have involved hazardous materials. As a result, some of our
properties may be contaminated. Some environmental laws hold current or
previous owners or operators of real property liable for the costs of cleaning
up contamination, even if these owners or operators did not know of and were
not responsible for such contamination. These environmental laws also impose
liability on any person who disposes of, treats, or arranges for the disposal
or treatment of hazardous substances, regardless of whether the affected site
is owned or operated by such person, and at times can impose liability on
companies deemed under law to be a successor to such person. Third parties may
also make claims against owners or operators of properties, or successors to
such owners or operators, for personal injuries and property damage associated
with releases of hazardous or toxic substances.

When we identify a
potential material environmental issue during our acquisition due diligence
process, we analyze the risks, and, when appropriate, perform further
environmental assessment to verify and quantify the extent of the potential
contamination. Furthermore, where appropriate, we have established financial
reserves for certain environmental matters. In addition, at times we, or one of
the sellers from whom we purchased a business, have undertaken remediation
projects. We do not anticipate, based on currently available information and
current laws, that we will incur liabilities in excess of reserves to address
environmental matters. However, in the event we discover new information or if
laws change, we may incur significant liabilities, which may exceed our
reserves.

Title Laws

In some states, when a
vehicle is deemed a total loss, a salvage title is issued. Whether states issue
salvage titles is important to the light vehicle recycling industry because an
increase in vehicles that qualify as salvage vehicles provides greater
availability and typically lowers the price of such vehicles. Currently, these
titling issues are a matter of state law. In 1992, the U.S. Congress
commissioned an advisory committee to study problems relating to vehicle
titling, registration, and salvage. Since then, legislation has been introduced
seeking to establish national uniform requirements in this area, including a
uniform definition of a salvage vehicle. The light vehicle recycling industry
will generally favor a uniform definition, since it will avoid inconsistencies
across state lines, and will generally favor a definition that expands the
number of damaged vehicles that qualify as salvage. However, certain interest
groups, including repair shops and some insurance associations, may oppose this
type of legislation. National legislation has not yet been enacted in this
area, and there can be no assurance that such legislation will be enacted in
the future.

National Stolen
Passenger Motor Vehicle Information System

In 1992, Congress enacted
the Anti Car Theft Act to deter trafficking in stolen vehicles. This law
included the establishment of the National Stolen Passenger Motor Vehicle
Information System to track and monitor stolen automotive parts. In April 2002,
the Department of Justice published for comment proposed regulations to
implement the National Stolen Passenger Motor Vehicle Information System. The
proposed regulations require, among other things, that insurance companies,
salvagers, dismantlers, recyclers, and repairers inspect salvage vehicles for
the purpose of collecting the vehicle identification number and the part number
for any “covered major part” that possesses the vehicle identification number.
The requirement to collect this information would place substantial burdens on
light vehicle recyclers, including us, that otherwise would not normally exist.
It would place similar burdens on repair


shops,
which may further discourage the use by such shops of recycled products. The
Department of Justice’s comment period for the proposed regulations ended in June 2002,
but final regulations have not been issued.

Legislation
Affecting Automotive Repair Parts

Most states have laws that
restrict the use of aftermarket parts in collision repair work. These
restrictions range from the requirement to disclose to the vehicle owner the
use of aftermarket parts in the repair process to the requirement to have
aftermarket parts certified by an independent testing organization. Some
jurisdictions have laws that prohibit or restrict the sale of certain recycled
OEM products that we provide, such as airbags. Additional laws of this kind may
be introduced in the future. An increase in the number of states passing such
legislation or the passing of legislation with prohibitions or restrictions
that are more severe than current laws could have a material adverse impact on
our business. Additionally, Congress could enact federal legislation
restricting the use of aftermarket and recycled automotive parts in the repair
process.

ITEM 1A.   RISK
FACTORS

Risks
Relating to Our Business

We face intense
competition from local, national, and internet-based light vehicle
products providers, and this competition could negatively affect our business.

The light vehicle
replacement products industry is highly competitive and is served by numerous
suppliers of OEM products, recycled OEM products, and aftermarket products.
Within each of these categories of suppliers, there are local owner-operated
companies, larger regional suppliers, national providers, and internet-based
suppliers. Providers of light vehicle replacement products that have
traditionally sold only certain categories of such products may decide to
expand their product offerings into other categories of light vehicle
replacement products, which may further increase competition. Some of our
current and potential competitors may have more operational expertise; greater
financial, technical, manufacturing, distribution, and other resources; longer
operating histories; lower cost structures; and better relationships in the
insurance and vehicle repair industries. In certain regions of the U.S., local
light vehicle recycling companies have formed cooperative efforts to compete in
the recycled OEM products industry. As a result of these factors, our
competitors may be able to provide products that we are unable to supply,
provide their products at lower costs, or supply products to customers that we
are unable to serve.

An adverse change
in our relationships with auction companies or our suppliers could increase our
expenses and hurt our relationships with our customers.

Most of our salvage
inventory consists of vehicles offered at salvage auctions by several companies
that own auction facilities in numerous locations across the U.S. We do not
have contracts with any auction company. According to industry analysts, three
companies control over 50% of the salvage auction market in the U.S. In some
localities, the automotive auction business may be even more highly
concentrated. If an auction company prohibited us from participating in its
auctions, or significantly raised its fees, our business could be adversely
affected through higher costs or the resulting potential inability to service
our customers. Moreover, auction companies have begun to allow bids to be
submitted on salvage vehicles through the internet, which increases the number
of potential bidders and may increase our cost of goods sold for recycled OEM
products.

We also acquire some of
our inventory directly from insurance companies, original equipment
manufacturers, aftermarket parts manufacturers, and others. To the extent that
these suppliers decide to


discontinue
these arrangements, our business could be adversely affected through higher
costs or the resulting potential inability to service our customers.

In addition, we purchase
aftermarket parts primarily from foreign manufacturers in Taiwan. In the event
that our business relationships with these suppliers deteriorated or
terminated, or in the event that the importing of products into the U.S. from
Taiwan or the exporting of products by Taiwan to the U.S. was disrupted, our
business could be adversely affected through higher costs or the resulting
inability to service our customers.

We may not be able
to sell our products due to existing or new laws and regulations prohibiting or
restricting the sale of recycled OEM or aftermarket products.

Some jurisdictions have
enacted laws prohibiting or severely restricting the sale of certain recycled
OEM products that we provide, such as airbags. These and other jurisdictions
could enact similar laws or could prohibit or severely restrict the sale of
additional recycled OEM products. Restrictions on the products we are able to
sell could decrease our revenue and have an adverse effect on our business and
operations.

We became involved in the
aftermarket products business upon the closing of an acquisition in February 2004.
Since 1998, most states have passed laws that prohibit or limit the use of
aftermarket products in collision repair work and/or require enhanced
disclosure or vehicle owner consent before using aftermarket products in such
repair work. Additional bills of this kind may be introduced in the future. If
additional laws prohibiting or restricting the use of aftermarket products are
passed, it could have an adverse impact on our aftermarket products business.

Certain organizations test
the quality and safety of light vehicle replacement products. In the event that
such organizations decide that a particular vehicle product does not meet
applicable quality or safety standards, we may decide to discontinue sales of
such product or insurance companies may decide to discontinue authorization of
repairs using such product. Such events could adversely affect our business.

If our business
relationships with insurance companies end, we may lose important sales
opportunities.

We rely on business
relationships with certain insurance companies. These insurance companies
encourage vehicle repair facilities to use products we provide. Our
arrangements with these companies may be terminated at any time. We rely on
these relationships for sales to some collision repair shops, and a termination
of these relationships may result in a loss of sales, which could adversely
affect our results of operations.

We are subject to
environmental regulations and incur costs relating to environmental matters.

We are
subject to various federal, state, and local environmental protection and
health and safety laws and regulations governing, among other things:

·

the
emission and discharge of hazardous materials into the ground, air, or water;

·

the
exposure to hazardous materials; and

·

the
generation, handling, storage, use, treatment, identification, transportation,
and disposal of industrial by-products, waste water, storm water, and mercury
and other hazardous materials.

We are also required to
obtain environmental permits from governmental authorities for certain of our
operations. If we violate or fail to obtain or comply with these laws,
regulations, or permits, we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by
regulators. We could also become liable if employees or other third parties are
improperly exposed to hazardous materials.


Under certain
environmental laws, we could be held responsible for all of the costs relating
to any contamination at, or migration to or from, our or our predecessors’ past
or present facilities and at third party waste disposal sites. These laws often
impose liability even if the owner or operator did not know of, or was not
responsible for, the release of such hazardous substances.

Environmental laws are
complex, change frequently, and have tended to become more stringent over time.
Our costs of complying with current and future environmental and health and
safety laws, and our liabilities arising from past or future releases of, or
exposure to, hazardous substances, may adversely affect our business, results
of operations, or financial condition.

Governmental
agencies may refuse to grant or renew our operating licenses and permits.

Our operating subsidiaries
must receive certain licenses and permits from state and local governments to
conduct their operations. When we develop or acquire a new facility, we must
seek the approval of state and local units of government. Governmental agencies
often resist the establishment of a vehicle recycling facility in their
communities. There can be no assurance that future approvals or transfers will
be granted. In addition, there can be no assurance that we will be able to
maintain and renew the licenses and permits our operating subsidiaries
currently hold.

Proposed
regulations under the National Stolen Passenger Motor Vehicle Information
System could harm our business.

In 1992, Congress enacted
the Anti Car Theft Act to deter trafficking in stolen vehicles. This law
included the establishment of the National Stolen Passenger Motor Vehicle
Information System to track and monitor stolen automotive parts. In April 2002,
the Department of Justice published for comment proposed regulations to
implement this system. The proposed regulations require, among other things,
that insurance companies, salvagers, dismantlers, recyclers, and repairers
inspect salvage vehicles for the purpose of collecting the vehicle
identification number and the part number for any covered major part that
possesses the vehicle identification number. The requirement to collect this
information would place burdens and costs on us that otherwise would not
normally exist, and could discourage our customers from purchasing our products
if the proposed regulations are adopted.

We could be subject
to product liability claims.

If customers of repair
shops that purchase our products are injured or suffer property damage, we
could be subject to product liability claims. The successful assertion of this
type of claim could have an adverse effect on our business or financial
condition.

We may lose
business if recent litigation involving the use of aftermarket parts results in
insurance companies modifying arrangements affecting the use of recycled OEM or
aftermarket products in the repair process.

In an Illinois lawsuit
involving State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company (

“Avery v. State Farm”

), a jury decided in October 1999
that State Farm breached certain insurance contracts with its policyholders by
using non-OEM parts to repair damaged vehicles when use of such parts did not
restore the vehicle to its “pre-loss condition.” The jury found that State Farm
misled its customers by not disclosing the use of non-OEM parts and the alleged
inferiority of those parts. The jury assessed damages against State Farm of
$456 million, and the judge assessed an additional $730 million of
disgorgement and punitive damages for violations of the Illinois Consumer Fraud
Act. In April 2001, the Illinois Appellate Court upheld the verdict but
reduced the damage award by $130 million because of duplicative damage
awards. On August 18, 2005, the Illinois Supreme Court reversed the awards
made by the circuit court and found, among other things, that the plaintiffs
had failed to establish any breach of contract on the part of State Farm. As a
result of this case, some insurance companies had reduced or eliminated their
use of


aftermarket
products. Although our products are primarily recycled OEM parts, we entered
the aftermarket products business through an acquisition in February 2004.
Because the decision by the Illinois Supreme Court was rendered so recently, we
are uncertain how the decision will affect the practices of insurance companies
in the future, but our financial results could be affected, perhaps adversely,
if insurance companies modified or terminated the arrangements pursuant to
which repair shops buy aftermarket or recycled OEM products from us due to a
fear of similar claims with respect to such products.

If the number of
vehicles involved in accidents declines, our business could suffer.

Because our business
depends on vehicle accidents for both the supply of recycled OEM products and
the demand for repairs using our products, factors which influence the number
and/or severity of accidents, including, but not limited to, the number of
vehicles on the road, the number of miles driven, the ages of drivers, the use
of cellular telephones and other electronic equipment by drivers, the
congestion of traffic, the occurrence and severity of certain weather
conditions, the use of alcohol and drugs by drivers, and the condition of
roadways, impact our business. In this regard, a number of states and
municipalities have adopted, or are considering adopting, legislation banning
the use of handheld cellular telephones while driving and such restrictions
could lead to a decline in accidents. Moreover, rising fuel prices may cause
the number of vehicles on the road to decline as motorists seek alternative
transportation options and this also could lead to a decline in accidents.

We may not be able
to successfully acquire new operations or integrate future acquisitions, which
could cause our business to suffer.

We may
not be able to successfully complete potential strategic acquisitions if we
cannot reach agreement on acceptable terms or for other reasons. If we buy a
company or a division of a company, we may experience difficulty integrating
that company’s or division’s personnel and operations, which could negatively
affect our operating results. In addition:

·

the
key personnel of the acquired company may decide not to work for us;

·

we
may experience business disruptions as a result of information technology
systems conversions;

·

we
may experience additional financial and accounting challenges and complexities
in areas such as tax planning, treasury management, and financial reporting;

·

we
may be held liable for environmental risks and liabilities as a result of our
acquisitions, some of which we may not have discovered during our due
diligence;

·

our
ongoing business may be disrupted or receive insufficient management attention;
and

·

we
may not be able to realize the cost savings or other financial benefits we
anticipated.

In connection with future
acquisitions, we may assume the liabilities of the companies we acquire. These
liabilities, including liabilities for environmental-related costs, could
materially and adversely affect our business. We may have to incur debt or
issue equity securities to pay for any future acquisition, the issuance of
which could involve the imposition of restrictive covenants or be dilutive to
our existing stockholders.


Our credit facility
imposes certain operating and financial restrictions on us and our subsidiaries
and requires us to meet certain financial tests.

Our
credit facility contains certain operating and financial restrictions that
limit or prohibit us from engaging in certain transactions, including the
following:

·

incurring
or guarantying additional debt;

·

paying
dividends or other distributions to our stockholders or redeeming,
repurchasing, or retiring our capital stock or subordinated obligations;

·

making
investments and capital expenditures;

·

creating
liens on our assets;

·

selling,
transferring, leasing, licensing, or otherwise disposing of assets other than
in the ordinary course of business;

·

engaging
in transactions with stockholders and affiliates;

·

engaging
in mergers, consolidations, or acquisitions;

·

engaging
in any material line of business substantially different from, and unrelated
to, those lines of business currently carried on by us; and

·

making
changes to our equity capital structure or amending our certificate of
incorporation, bylaws, or any stockholder rights agreement.

The credit facility also
requires that we satisfy certain financial tests. The failure to comply with
any of these covenants would cause a default under the credit facility. A
default, if not waived, could result in acceleration of our debt, in which case
the debt would become immediately due and payable. If this occurs, we may not
be able to repay our debt or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it. Even if
new financing were available, it may be on terms that are less attractive to us
than our existing credit facility or it may not be on terms that are acceptable
to us.

Our future capital
needs may require that we seek debt financing or additional equity funding
that, if not available, could cause our business to suffer.

We may need to raise
additional funds in the future to, among other things, fund our existing
operations, improve or expand our operations, respond to competitive pressures,
or make acquisitions. From time to time, we may raise additional funds through
public or private financing, strategic alliances, or other arrangements. If adequate
funds are not available on acceptable terms, we may be unable to meet our
business or strategic objectives or compete effectively. If we raise additional
funds by issuing equity securities, stockholders may experience dilution of
their ownership interests, and the newly issued securities may have rights
superior to those of the common stock. If we raise additional funds by issuing
debt, we may be subject to further limitations on our operations. If we fail to
raise capital when needed, our business will be negatively affected.


Our annual and quarterly performance may fluctuate.

Our
revenue, cost of goods sold, and operating results have fluctuated on a
quarterly and annual basis in the past and can be expected to continue to
fluctuate in the future as a result of a number of factors, some of which are
beyond our control. Future factors that may affect our operating results
include, but are not limited to, the following:

·

fluctuations
in the pricing of new OEM replacement products;

·

the
availability and cost of inventory;

·

variations
in vehicle accident rates;

·

competition
in the vehicle replacement parts industry;

·

changes
in state or federal laws or regulations affecting our business;

·

changes
in the types of replacement parts that insurance carriers will accept in the
repair process;

·

our
ability to integrate and manage our acquisitions successfully;

·

fluctuations
in fuel prices;

·

changes
in the demand for our products and the supply of our inventory due to severity
of weather and seasonality of weather patterns;

·

the
amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures relating to the
maintenance and expansion of our business, operations, and infrastructure; and

·

declines
in the values of our assets.

Due to the foregoing
factors, our operating results in future periods can be expected to fluctuate.
Accordingly, our results of operations may not be indicative of future
performance. These fluctuations in our operating results may cause our results
to fall below the expectations of public market analysts and investors, which
could cause our stock price to decline.

If we lose our key
management personnel, we may not be able to successfully manage our business or
achieve our objectives.

Our future success depends
in large part upon the leadership and performance of our executive management
team and key employees at the operating level. If we lose the services of one
or more of our executive officers or key employees, or if one or more of them
decides to join a competitor or otherwise compete directly or indirectly with
us, we may not be able to successfully manage our business or achieve our
business objectives. If we lose the services of any of our key employees at the
operating or regional level, we may not be able to replace them with similarly
qualified personnel, which could harm our business.

We rely on
information technology in critical areas of our operations and a disruption
relating to such technology could harm our business.

We use information
technology systems owned by other companies for management of our facilities
and our financial functions. In the event that the providers of these systems
terminate their relationships with us, we could suffer disruptions to our
operations.

In addition, we continually monitor these systems to
find areas for improvement. In the event that we decided to switch providers or
to implement our own systems, we may also suffer disruptions to our


business.
We may be unsuccessful if we try to develop our own systems, and we may
underestimate the costs and expenses of developing and implementing our own
systems. Also, our revenue may be hampered during the period of implementing an
alternative system, which period could extend longer than we anticipated.

If we experience
problems with our fleet of trucks, our business could be harmed.

We use a fleet of trucks
to deliver the majority of the products we sell. We are subject to the risks
associated with providing trucking services, including inclement weather,
disruptions in the transportation infrastructure, availability and price of fuel,
liabilities arising from accidents to the extent we are not covered by
insurance, and insurance premium increases. In addition, our failure to deliver
products in a timely and accurate manner could harm our reputation and brand,
which could have a material adverse effect on our business.

If we determine
that our goodwill has become impaired, we may incur significant charges to our
pre-tax income.

Goodwill represents the
excess of cost over the fair market value of net assets acquired in business
combinations. In the future, goodwill and intangible assets may increase as a
result of future acquisitions. Goodwill and intangible assets are reviewed at
least annually for impairment. Impairment may result from, among other things,
deterioration in the performance of acquired businesses, adverse market
conditions, and adverse changes in applicable laws or regulations, including
changes that restrict the activities of the acquired business. As of
December 31, 2005, our total goodwill, subject to future impairment
testing, was approximately $181.8 million.

Challenges to the
validity of aftermarket products could adversely effect our business.

Original equipment
manufacturers have attempted to use claims of intellectual property
infringement against manufacturers and distributors of aftermarket products to
restrict or eliminate the sale of aftermarket products that are the subject of
the claims. The original equipment manufacturers have brought such claims in
federal court and with the United States International Trade Commission. To the
extent that the original equipment manufacturers are successful with these
claims, we could be restricted or prohibited from selling certain aftermarket
products which could have an adverse effect on our business.

Risks Relating to Our Common Stock

Our executive officers, directors, and their
affiliates hold a large percentage of our stock and their interests may differ
from other stockholders.

As of December 31,
2005, our executive officers, directors, and their affiliates, in the aggregate,
beneficially owned approximately 21%

of our common
stock. If they were to act together, these stockholders would have significant
influence over most matters requiring approval by stockholders, including the
election of directors, any amendments to our certificate of incorporation, and
certain significant corporate transactions. These stockholders may take these
actions even if they are opposed by our other stockholders. In addition,
without the consent of these stockholders, we could be delayed or prevented
from entering into transactions that may be viewed as beneficial to us or our
other stockholders.

Future sales of our common stock may depress our stock
price.

We and our stockholders
may sell shares of common stock in the future. We may also issue shares of
common stock in connection with the exercise of outstanding options or in
connection with future acquisitions. Certain of our existing stockholders are
parties to a registration rights agreement that provides such holders with the
right to require us to effect the registration of their shares of common stock


in
specific circumstances. In addition, if we propose to register any of our
common stock under the Securities Act of 1933, whether for our own account or
otherwise, some existing stockholders may be entitled to include their shares
of common stock in that registration. We cannot predict the size of future
issuances of our common stock or the effect, if any, that future issuances and
sales of shares of our common stock will have on the price of our common stock.
Sales of substantial amounts of common stock (including shares issued in
connection with an acquisition), or the perception that such sales could occur,
may cause the price of our common stock to fall.

Delaware law and our charter documents may impede or
discourage a takeover, which could affect the price of our stock.

The anti-takeover
provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware law
could, together or separately, impose various impediments to the ability of a
third party to acquire control of us, even if a change in control would be
beneficial to our existing stockholders. Our certificate of incorporation and
bylaws have provisions that could discourage potential takeover attempts and
make attempts by stockholders to change management more difficult. Our
incorporation under Delaware law and these provisions could also impede a
merger, takeover, or other business combination involving us or discourage a
potential acquiror from making a tender offer for our common stock, which,
under certain circumstances, could reduce the price of our common stock.

SELECTED
FINANCIAL DATA

The
following selected financial data should be read together with “Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and
our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included
elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.


(a)

We recorded a non-cash Goodwill impairment
charge of $49,899,000 in 2002.

(b)

We repurchased 4,000,000 shares of our
common stock in February 2003 and repurchased an additional 3,114,996
shares of our common stock in May 2003. In addition, we sold 10,000,000
shares of our common stock on October 2, 2003 in connection with our
initial public offering. Accordingly, the shares used in the per share
calculation for basic and diluted earnings per share in 2003 do not fully
reflect the impact of these transactions. We also sold 6,435,000 shares of our

EBITDA consists of income (loss) before
provision for income taxes and cumulative effect of change in accounting
principle plus depreciation and amortization, interest expense, and stockholder
loan guarantee fee, less interest income. We have presented EBITDA information
solely as a supplemental disclosure because we believe it provides a helpful
analysis of our operating results. EBITDA should not be construed as an
alternative to operating income, net income (loss) or net cash provided by
(used in) operating activities, as determined in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States. In addition, not all
companies that report EBITDA information calculate EBITDA in the same manner as
we do and, accordingly, our calculation is not necessarily comparable to
similarly entitled measures of other companies and may not be an appropriate
measure for performance relative to other companies.

MANAGEMENT’S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Overview

We provide replacement systems, components, and parts
needed to repair light vehicles (cars and light trucks). Buyers of light
vehicle replacement products have the option to purchase from primarily three
sources: new products produced by original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”),
which are commonly known as OEM products; new products produced by companies
other than the OEMs, which are sometimes referred to generically as “aftermarket”
products; and recycled products originally produced by OEMs, which we refer to
as recycled OEM products. We participate in the market for recycled OEM
products as well as the market for collision repair aftermarket products. We
obtain aftermarket products and salvage vehicles from a variety of sources, and
we dismantle the salvage vehicles to obtain a comprehensive range of vehicle
products that we distribute into the light vehicle repair market. We are not
involved in the manufacture of automotive products and do not maintain any
manufacturing or remanufacturing operations.

Our revenue, cost
of goods sold, and operating results have fluctuated on a quarterly and annual
basis in the past and can be expected to continue to fluctuate in the future as
a result of a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control. Factors
that may affect our operating results include, but are not limited to:

·

fluctuations
in the pricing of new OEM replacement products;

·

the
availability and cost of inventory;

·

variations
in vehicle accident rates;

·

competition
in the vehicle replacement parts industry;

·

changes
in state or federal laws or regulations affecting our business;

·

changes
in the types of replacement parts that insurance carriers will accept in the
repair process;

·

our
ability to integrate and manage our acquisitions successfully;

·

fluctuations
in fuel prices;

·

changes
in the demand for our products and the supply of our inventory due to severity
of weather and seasonality of weather patterns;

·

the
amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures relating to the
maintenance and expansion of our business, operations, and infrastructure; and

·

declines
in the value of our assets.

Due to the foregoing
factors, our operating results in future periods can be expected to fluctuate.
Accordingly, our historical results of operations may not be indicative of
future performance.

Acquisitions

Since our inception in 1998 we have pursued a growth
strategy of both organic growth and acquisitions. We have pursued acquisitions
that we believe will help drive profitability, cash flow and stockholder value.
Our principal focus for acquisitions is companies that will expand our
geographic presence and our ability to provide a wider choice of alternative
light vehicle replacement products and services to our customers.


During 2003, we acquired three automotive recycling
businesses located in upstate New York, California and Nevada, respectively,
for an aggregate of approximately $3.3 million in cash, $0.2 million
in notes issued and 100,000 redeemable shares of our common stock. These
business acquisitions enabled us to serve new market areas.

During 2004, we acquired six businesses (five in the
recycled OEM automotive parts business and one in the aftermarket automotive
parts business) for an aggregate of approximately $61.7 million in cash, $2.4
million in notes issued and 373,396 shares of our common stock. These business
acquisitions enabled us to serve new markets, expand our presence in certain
markets, become a significant provider of aftermarket automotive replacement
parts and become a provider of self-service retail automotive parts. One of the
acquisitions had operations in Guatemala and Costa Rica. The revenue of the
Central American businesses is not material, but we are using these facilities
as a platform to sell certain types of products into Central America from our
U.S. based recycled OEM automotive replacement parts facilities.

During 2005, we acquired eight businesses (four in the
recycled OEM automotive parts business and four in the aftermarket automotive
parts business) for an aggregate of approximately $105.2 million in cash, $6.4
million in notes issued and $9 million contingently payable based on the
achievement of certain future financial results. These business acquisitions
enabled us to serve new markets and expand our presence in existing markets.

In the first quarter of
2006, we completed an acquisition in the wheel refurbishment and distribution
business, with four locations for the refurbishment and distribution of wheels
and two additional distribution locations. This acquisition allows us to expand
our product offerings to our customers. We also acquired three recycled OEM
automotive parts businesses (two in the self-serve retail business) in the
first quarter. These business acquisitions enable us to expand our presence in
existing markets and serve new market areas.

Sources of Revenue

Since 2003, our revenue from the sale of light vehicle
replacement products and related services has ranged between 90% and 93% of our
total revenue. We sell the majority of our light vehicle replacement products
to collision repair shops and mechanical repair shops. Our light vehicle
replacement products include, for example, engines, transmissions, front-ends,
doors, trunk lids, bumpers, hoods, fenders, grilles, valances, headlights, and
taillights. We sell extended warranty contracts for certain mechanical
products. These contracts cover the cost of parts and labor and are sold for
periods of six months, one year, or two years. We defer the revenue from such
contracts and recognize it ratably over the term of the contracts. The demand
for our products and services is influenced by several factors, including the
number of vehicles in operation, the number of miles being driven, the
frequency and severity of vehicle accidents, availability and pricing of new
parts, seasonal weather patterns, and local weather conditions. Additionally,
automobile insurers exert significant influence over collision repair shops as
to how an insured vehicle is repaired and the cost level of the products used
in the repair process. Accordingly, we consider automobile insurers to be key
demand drivers of our products. We provide insurance companies services that
include the review of vehicle repair order estimates, as well as direct
quotation services to their adjusters. There is no standard price for recycled
OEM products, but rather a pricing structure that varies from day-to-day based
upon such factors as product availability, quality, demand, new OEM replacement
product prices, the age of the vehicle being repaired, and competitor pricing.
The pricing for aftermarket products is determined based on a number of
factors, including availability, quality, demand, new OEM replacement product
prices, and competitor pricing.

Since 2003, approximately 7% to 10% of our revenue has
been obtained from other sources. These include bulk sales to mechanical
remanufacturers, scrap sales, and sales of damaged vehicles that we sell to
vehicle repairers.


When we obtain mechanical
products from dismantled vehicles and determine they are damaged, or when we
have a surplus of a certain mechanical product type, we sell them in bulk to
mechanical remanufacturers. The majority of these products are sorted by
product type and model type. Examples of such products are engine blocks and
heads, transmissions, starters, alternators, and air conditioner compressors.
After we have recovered all the products we intend to resell, the remaining
materials are crushed and sold to scrap processors.

Cost of Goods Sold

Our cost of goods sold for recycled OEM products
includes the price we pay for the salvage vehicle and, where applicable,
auction, storage, and towing fees. Our cost of goods sold also includes labor
and other costs we incur to acquire and dismantle such vehicles. Since 2003,
our labor and labor-related costs related to acquisition and dismantling
have accounted for approximately 10% of our cost of goods sold for vehicles we
dismantle. The acquisition and dismantling of salvage vehicles is a manual
process and, as a result, energy costs are not material.

Our cost of goods sold for aftermarket products
includes the price we pay for the parts, freight, and other inventoried costs
such as other costs to acquire, including import fees and duties, where
applicable. Our aftermarket products are acquired from a number of vendors
located primarily overseas, with the majority of our overseas vendors located
in Taiwan.

In the event we do not have a recycled OEM product or
suitable aftermarket product in our inventory, we attempt to purchase the part
from a competitor. We refer to these parts as brokered products. Since 2003,
the revenue from brokered products that we sell to our customers has ranged
from 7% to 10% of our total revenue. The gross margin on brokered product sales
as a percentage of revenue is generally less than half of what we achieve from
sales of our own inventory because we must pay higher prices for these products.

Some
of our mechanical products are sold with a standard six-month warranty against
defects. We record the estimated warranty costs at the time of sale using
historical warranty claim information to project future warranty claims
activity and related expenses. Our warranty activity during 2004 and 2005 was
as follows (in thousands):

We also sell separately
priced extended warranty contracts for certain mechanical products. The expense
related to extended warranty claims is recognized when the claim is made.

Expenses

Our facility and warehouse expenses primarily include
our costs to operate our processing, redistribution, self-service, and
warehouse facilities. These costs include labor for both plant management and
facility and warehouse personnel, facility rent, property and liability
insurance, utilities, and other occupancy costs.


Our distribution expenses
primarily include our costs to deliver our products to our customers. Included
in our distribution expense category are labor costs for drivers, local
delivery and transfer truck rentals and subcontractor costs, vehicle repairs
and maintenance, insurance, and fuel.

Our selling and marketing
expenses primarily include our advertising, promotion, and marketing costs;
salary and commission expenses for sales personnel; sales training; telephone
and other communication expenses; and bad debt expense. Since 2003, personnel
costs have accounted for approximately 80% of our selling and marketing
expenses. Most of our recycled OEM product sales personnel are paid on a
commission basis. The number and quality of our sales force is critical to our
ability to respond to our customers’ needs and increase our sales volume. Our
objective is to continually evaluate our sales force, develop and implement
training programs, and utilize appropriate measurements to assess our selling
effectiveness.

Our general and
administrative expenses include primarily the costs of our corporate and
regional offices that provide corporate and field management, treasury,
accounting, legal, payroll, business development, human resources, and
information systems functions.

Seasonality

Our operating results are
subject to quarterly variations based on a variety of factors, influenced
primarily by seasonal changes in weather patterns. During the winter months we
tend to have higher demand for our products because there are more weather
related accidents. In addition, the cost of salvage vehicles tends to be lower
as more weather related accidents occur generating a larger supply of total loss
vehicles.

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates

The discussion and
analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon
our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance
with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. The preparation of
these financial statements requires us to make estimates, assumptions, and
judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and
expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an
ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, assumptions, and judgments, including
those related to revenue recognition, warranty costs, inventory valuation,
allowance for doubtful accounts, goodwill impairments, self-insurance programs,
contingencies, asset impairments, and taxes. We base our estimates on
historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are
reasonable under the circumstances. The results of these estimates form the
basis for our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and
our recognition of revenue. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

Revenue Recognition

We recognize and report
revenue from the sale of light vehicle replacement products when they are
shipped and title has transferred, subject to a reserve for returns, discounts,
and allowances that management estimates based upon historical information. A
replacement product would ordinarily be returned within a few days of shipment.
Our customers may earn discounts based upon sales volumes or sales volumes
coupled with prompt payment. Allowances are normally given within a few days
following product shipment. We analyze historical returns and allowances
activity by comparing the items to the original invoice amounts and dates. We
use this information to project future returns and allowances on products sold.

We also sell separately
priced extended warranty contracts for certain mechanical products. Revenue
from these contracts is deferred and recognized ratably over the term of the
contracts.


Warranty Reserves

We issue a standard
six-month warranty against defects on some of our mechanical products. We
record an accrual for standard warranty claims at the time of sale using
historical warranty claim information to project future warranty claims
activity and related expenses. We analyze historical warranty claim activity by
referencing the claims made and aging them from the original product sale date.
We use this information to project future warranty claims on actual products
sold that are still under warranty at the end of an accounting period. A 10%
increase in our historical 2005 annual warranty claims would result in an
additional annual expense of approximately $0.2 million.

Inventory
Accounting

Salvage Inventory.

Salvage inventory is recorded at the lower of cost or
market. Our salvage inventory cost is established based upon the price we pay
for a vehicle, and includes buying; dismantling; and, where applicable,
auction, storage, and towing fees. Inventory carrying value is determined using
the average cost to sales percentage at each of our facilities and applying
that percentage to the facility’s inventory at expected selling prices. The
average cost to sales percentage is derived from each facility’s historical
vehicle profitability for salvage vehicles purchased at auction or from
contracted rates for salvage vehicles acquired under direct procurement
arrangements.

Aftermarket Inventory.

Aftermarket inventory is recorded at the lower of
cost or market. Our aftermarket inventory cost is based on the average price we
pay for parts, and includes expenses incurred for freight and buying, where
applicable. For items purchased from foreign sources, import fees and duties
and transportation insurance are also included.

For all inventory, our carrying
value is reduced regularly to reflect the age and current anticipated demand
for our products. If actual demand differs from our estimates, additional
reductions to our inventory carrying value would be necessary in the period
such determination is made.

Allowance for
Doubtful Accounts

We maintain an allowance
for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of
customers to make required payments. The allowance for doubtful accounts is
based on our assessment of the collectibility of specific customer accounts,
the aging of the accounts receivable, and our historical experience. Our
allowance for doubtful accounts at December 31, 2005 was approximately
$2.1 million, which represents 5.0% of gross receivables. If actual
defaults are higher than our historical experience, our allowance for doubtful
accounts may be insufficient to cover the uncollectible receivables, which
would have an adverse impact on our operating results in the period of
occurrence. A 10% change in the 2005 annual write-off rate would result in a
change in the estimated allowance for doubtful accounts of approximately
$0.2 million. Our exposure to uncollectible accounts receivable is limited
because we have a large number of small customers that are generally geographically
dispersed. We control credit risk through credit approvals, credit limits, and
monitoring policies. We also have certain customers that pay for products at
the time of delivery.

Goodwill Impairment

We record goodwill as a result of our acquisitions.
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, “Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets,” which we refer to as SFAS 142, requires us to analyze
our goodwill for impairment at least annually. The determination of the value
of goodwill requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect our
consolidated financial statements. In assessing the recoverability of our
goodwill, we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and
other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets. If these
estimates or their related assumptions change in the future, we may be required
to record impairment charges for these assets. We perform goodwill impairment
tests on an annual basis and between annual tests whenever events may indicate
that


an impairment exists. In
response to changes in industry and market conditions, we may be required to
strategically realign our resources and consider restructuring, disposing of,
or otherwise exiting businesses, which could result in an impairment of
goodwill.

We utilize outside
professionals in the valuation industry to validate our assumptions and overall
methodology used to determine the fair value estimates used in our goodwill
impairment testing. As of December 31, 2005, we had $181.8 million in
goodwill subject to future impairment tests. If we were required to recognize
goodwill impairments in future periods, we would report those impairment losses
as part of our operating results. We determined that no adjustments were
necessary when we performed our annual impairment testing in the fourth quarter
of 2005, 2004 and 2003. A 10% decrease in the fair value estimates used in the
fourth quarter of 2005 impairment test would not have changed this
determination.

Impairment of
Long-Lived Assets

We review long-lived
assets for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that
the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. If our review
indicates that the carrying value of long-lived assets is not recoverable, we
reduce the carrying amount of the assets to fair value. We have had no
adjustments to the carrying value of long-lived assets in 2005, 2004, or 2003.

Self-Insurance
Programs

We self-insure a portion of employee medical benefits
under the terms of our employee health insurance program. We also self-insure a
portion of automobile, general liability, and workers’ compensation claims. We
have purchased stop-loss insurance coverage that limits our exposure to both
individual claims as well as our overall claims. The cost of the stop-loss
insurance is expensed over the contract periods.

We record an accrual for
the claims expense related to our employee medical benefits, automobile,
general liability, and workers’ compensation claims based upon the expected
amount of all such claims. If actual claims are higher than what we
anticipated, our accrual might be insufficient to cover our claims costs, which
would have an adverse impact on our operating results in that period. If we
were to incur claims up to our aggregate stop-loss insurance coverage during
the open policy years, we would have an additional expense of approximately
$8.9 million.

Contingencies

We are subject to the
possibility of various loss contingencies arising in the ordinary course of
business resulting from litigation, claims and other commitments, and from a
variety of environmental and pollution control laws and regulations. We
consider the likelihood of loss or the incurrence of a liability, as well as
our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss, in determining loss
contingencies. We accrue an estimated loss contingency when it is probable that
a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably
estimated. We determine the amount of reserves, if any, with the assistance of
our outside legal counsel. We regularly evaluate current information available
to us to determine whether the accruals should be adjusted. If the amount of an
actual loss were greater than the amount we have accrued, the excess loss would
have an adverse impact on our operating results in the period that the loss
occurred. If the loss contingency is subsequently determined to no longer be
probable, the amount of loss contingency previously accrued would be included
in our operating results in the period such determination was made.

Accounting for
Income Taxes

All income tax amounts reflect the use of the
liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are
determined based upon the expected future tax consequences of temporary
differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for
financial and income tax reporting purposes. We operate in multiple tax
jurisdictions with different tax rates and we determine the allocation of
income to


each of these
jurisdictions based upon various estimates and assumptions. In the normal
course of business we will undergo tax audits by various tax jurisdictions.
Such audits often require an extended period of time to complete and may result
in income tax adjustments if changes to the allocation are required between
jurisdictions with different tax rates. Although we have recorded all probable
income tax contingencies in accordance with SFAS No. 5, “Accounting for
Contingencies” and SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes,” these
accruals represent estimates that are subject to the inherent uncertainties
associated with the tax audit process, and therefore include contingencies.

We record a provision for
taxes based upon our expected annual effective income tax rate. We record a
valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that we
expect is more likely than not to be realized. We consider historical taxable
income, expectations, and risks associated with our estimates of future taxable
income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a
valuation allowance. We had a valuation allowance of $0.2 million,
$0.5 million, and $0.7 million at December 31, 2003 and 2004 and
2005, respectively, against our deferred tax assets. Should we determine that
it is more likely than not that we would be able to realize all of our deferred
tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the net deferred tax asset would
increase income in the period such determination was made. Conversely, should
we determine that it is more likely than not that we would not be able to
realize all of our deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the net
deferred tax assets would decrease income in the period such determination was
made.

Recently
Issued Accounting Pronouncements

In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151,
“Inventory Costs, an Amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4” (“SFAS 151”).
SFAS 151 amends ARB 43, Chapter 4, to clarify that abnormal
amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs, and wasted materials
(spoilage) must be recognized as current period charges. It also requires that
allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on
the normal capacity of the production facilities. SFAS 151 is effective
for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after June 15,
2005. We do not expect SFAS 151 to have a material impact on our
consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123
(revised 2004), “Share-Based Payment” (“SFAS 123R”), a revision of
SFAS 123. SFAS 123R supersedes Accounting Principles Board (“APB”)
Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,” and amends
SFAS 95, “Statement of Cash Flows.” Under the standard, companies will no
longer be able to account for stock-based employee compensation using the
intrinsic value method in accordance with APB No. 25. Instead,
SFAS 123R requires the adoption of a fair-value method of accounting for
stock-based employee compensation. SFAS 123R is effective for us as
of January 1, 2006. We have historically accounted for stock-based
compensation to employees under APB No. 25’s intrinsic value method and
accordingly, have generally not recognized compensation expense for options
granted to employees. We will adopt the provisions of SFAS 123R using the
modified prospective method, in which prior periods are not restated and
compensation expense for all share-based payments granted or modified after the
effective date is recognized prospectively based upon the requirements of SFAS 123R
and compensation expense for all unvested share-based payments as of January 1,
2006 that were issued subsequent to our initial public offering in October 2003
is recognized prospectively based on SFAS 123. In applying the fair value
concepts of SFAS 123R, we will be required to choose among alternative
valuation models and other assumptions. Our current estimates concerning 2006
indicate we will recognize equity-based compensation expense of approximately
$0.03 per diluted share. This amount is subject to revisions as we finalize our
assumptions, including the amount of future awards and forfeiture rates. SFAS 123R
also requires us to calculate the pool of excess tax benefits available to
absorb tax deficiencies that arise subsequent to adopting SFAS 123R (the “APIC
Pool.”) We are currently evaluating the acceptable methods for calculating our
APIC Pool. SFAS 123R further requires that the benefits of tax deductions
in excess of


recognized book
compensation expense be reported as a financing cash flow item as opposed to an
operating cash flow item. We cannot estimate what the future tax benefits will
be as the amounts depend on, among other things, future employee stock option
exercises and the price of our stock if and when such exercises occur.

In March 2005, the FASB issued Interpretation
No. 47, “Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirements—an interpretation of
SFAS No. 143” (“FIN 47”). FIN 47 clarifies that uncertainty
about the timing and (or) method of settlement of a conditional asset
retirement obligation should be factored into the measurement of the liability
when sufficient information exists to make a reasonable estimate of the fair
value of the obligation. We have adopted FIN 47 and its adoption did not
have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of
operations or cash flows.

In May 2005, the FASB
issued SFAS No. 154, “Accounting Changes and Error Corrections” (“SFAS 154”).
SFAS 154 replaces Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 20 “Accounting
Changes” and SFAS No. 3, “Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim
Financial Statements-An Amendment of APB Opinion No. 28.” SFAS 154
provides guidance on the accounting for and reporting of accounting changes and
error corrections. SFAS 154 requires “retrospective application” of the
direct effect of a voluntary change in accounting principle to prior periods’
financial statements where it is practicable to do so. SFAS 154 also
redefines the term “restatement” to mean the correction of an error by revising
previously issued financial statements. SFAS 154 is effective for
accounting changes and error corrections made in fiscal years beginning after December 15,
2005 unless adopted early. We do not expect the adoption of SFAS 154 to
have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of
operations, or cash flows, except to the extent that the statement subsequently
requires retrospective application of a future item.

Segment Reporting

Over 99% of our operations
are conducted in the U.S. During 2004, we acquired a recycled OEM products
business with locations in Guatemala and Costa Rica. Revenue generated and
properties located outside of the U.S. are not material. We manage our
operations geographically. Our light vehicle replacement products operations
are organized into nine operating segments, eight for recycled OEM products and
one for aftermarket products. These segments are aggregated into one reportable
segment because they possess similar economic characteristics and have common
products and services, customers, and methods of distribution. Our light
vehicle replacement products operations account for over 90% of our revenue,
earnings, and assets.


Results of
Operations

The following table
sets forth statement of income data as a percentage of total revenue for the
periods indicated:

Year Ended December 31, 2005 Compared to Year
Ended December 31, 2004

Revenue.

Our revenue increased 28.9%, from $424.8 million
in 2004 to $547.4 million in 2005. The increase in revenue was primarily
due to the higher volume of products we sold and business acquisitions. Organic
revenue growth was approximately 12.2% in 2005. We continued to expand our
services to the insured repair industry and added local delivery routes and
transfer routes that helped us to increase our market penetration. We have also
continued to integrate our aftermarket and recycled parts inventories in more
locations in order to provide a wider selection of products to our customers.
Business acquisitions completed in 2005 and the full year impact of our 2004
acquisitions accounted for approximately $70.6 million of incremental revenue
for the year.

Cost of Goods Sold.

Our cost of goods sold increased 27.6%, from
$227.1 million in 2004 to $289.8 million in 2005. As a percentage of
revenue, cost of goods sold decreased from 53.5% to 52.9%. The increase in cost
of goods sold was primarily due to increased volume of products sold. The
decrease in cost of goods sold percentage was due primarily to improved pricing
and availability of wholesale salvage vehicles, coupled with improved
procurement and inventory management.

Gross Margin.

Our gross margin increased 30.4%, from
$197.6 million in 2004 to $257.6 million in 2005. Our gross margin
increased primarily due to increased volume. As a percentage of revenue, gross
margin increased from 46.5% to 47.1%. Our gross margin as a percentage of
revenue increased due primarily to the factors noted above in

Cost of Goods Sold

.

Facility and Warehouse
Expenses

.

Facility and warehouse expenses increased 25.7%, from
$47.8 million in 2004 to $60.1 million in 2005. Our acquisitions
accounted for $9.1 million of the increase. Our remaining facility and
warehouse expenses increased primarily due to higher wages resulting from
increased headcount and incentive compensation expense for field personnel, and
higher repairs and maintenance and supplies expenses. As a percentage of
revenue, facility and warehouse expenses decreased from 11.3% to 11.0%.


Distribution Expenses.

Distribution expenses increased 28.3%, from
$47.9 million in 2004 to $61.5 million in 2005. Our acquisitions
accounted for $7.2 million of the increase. Our remaining distribution
expenses increased as we operated approximately 8% more daily transfer routes
between our salvage facilities due to the increase in parts volume. For the
year ended December 31, 2005, we increased the amount of product we moved
between our facilities by approximately 24%, the majority of which was on our
own transfer trucks. In addition, higher wages primarily from an increase in
the number of employees, increased fuel costs, auto insurance, truck rentals
and repairs, delivery supplies, and contracted salvage transfer services,
partially offset by lower freight costs, accounted for the remaining growth in
distribution expenses. Fuel prices increased approximately 33% in 2005 compared
to 2004. While fuel costs accounted for approximately $2.3 million of the
increase in distribution expenses, they represented only 1.7% of our
consolidated revenue. We renegotiated our freight rates with substantially all
of our common carriers in the fourth quarter of 2004, and we directed our sales
force to recoup more of our shipping and handling costs. As a percentage of
revenue, our distribution expenses decreased from 11.3% to 11.2%.

Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses

.

Selling, general, and administrative expenses
increased 24.0%, from $60.1 million in 2004 to $74.5 million in 2005.
Our acquisitions accounted for $8.0 million of the increase. The majority
of the remaining expense increase was a result of an increase in labor and
labor-related expenses of $3.3 million due primarily to increased
headcount, increased incentive compensation expense of $1.1 million, higher
insurance and legal claims experience of $0.9 million, and higher sales
promotion, bad debts, telephone and e-commerce expenses, partially offset by
lower costs associated with being a public company. Our selling expenses tend
to rise as revenue increases due to our commissioned sales forces. We incurred
approximately $2.5 million in costs related to being a public company in
2005 compared to $2.8 million in 2004. The cost reductions were primarily
from lower premiums for directors’ and officers’ liability insurance, and lower
accounting and legal fees. As a percentage of revenue our selling, general, and
administrative expenses decreased from 14.1% to 13.6%.

Depreciation and
Amortization.

Depreciation
and amortization increased 24.8%, from $6.9 million in 2004 to
$8.6 million in 2005. Our acquisitions accounted for $1.0 million of
the increase in depreciation and amortization. As a percentage of revenue,
depreciation and amortization was 1.6% in 2005 and 2004.

Operating Income.

Operating income increased 51.7%,
from $34.9 million in 2004 to $52.9 million in 2005. As a percentage
of revenue, operating income increased from 8.2% to 9.7%.

Other (Income) Expense.

Net other expense increased 19.9%,
from $1.1 million in 2004 to $1.3 million in 2005. Net interest
expense increased 25.3% to $1.9 million in 2005 from $1.5 million in
2004. Interest expense was related primarily to debt incurred to fund
acquisitions. The increase in net interest expense was due to both higher
average debt levels and interest rates in 2005. In addition, included in
interest expense in 2004 was $0.3 million in debt issuance costs that were
written off. These costs were attributable to our previous secured bank credit
facility that was terminated in February 2004. See “Liquidity and Capital
Resources” below for further discussion of changes in our bank credit
facilities. Included in other income in 2005 was approximately $0.3 million in
gain on the sale of investment securities. Included in other income in 2004 are
approximately $0.4 million of proceeds from a corporate owned life
insurance policy. We use corporate owned life insurance policies to fund our
obligations under our nonqualified deferred compensation plan. As a percentage
of revenue, net other expense was 0.2% in 2005 and 2004.

Provision for Income Taxes.

The provision for income taxes
increased 56.6%, from $13.3 million in 2004 to $20.8 million in 2005
due primarily to improved operating results. Our effective tax rate was 40.2%
in 2005 and 39.2% in 2004. The increase in our effective income tax rate in
2005 was due primarily to the receipt of nontaxable life insurance proceeds of
approximately $0.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2004.


Year Ended December 31,
2004 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2003

Revenue.

Our revenue increased 29.5%, from
$328.0 million in 2003 to $424.8 million in 2004. The increase in
revenue was primarily due to the higher volume of products we sold and business
acquisitions. Organic revenue growth was approximately 11.0% in 2004. We continued
to expand our services to the insured repair industry and added local delivery
routes and transfer routes that helped us to increase our market penetration.
Business acquisitions completed in 2004 accounted for approximately
$60.3 million of incremental revenue for the year.

Cost of Goods Sold.

Our cost of goods sold increased
30.4%, from $174.2 million in 2003 to $227.1 million in 2004. The
increase was primarily due to increased volume of products sold. As a
percentage of revenue, cost of goods sold increased from 53.1% to 53.5%. The
increase in cost of goods sold percentage was due primarily to a change in
inventory mix to higher end salvage during the third quarter and lower recovery
on our shipping and handling costs.

Gross Margin.

Our gross margin increased 28.5%,
from $153.7 million in 2003 to $197.6 million in 2004. Our gross
margin increased primarily due to increased volume. As a percentage of revenue,
gross margin decreased from 46.9% to 46.5%. Our gross margin as a percentage of
revenue decreased due primarily to the factors noted above in Cost of Goods
Sold. We shifted our buying in the fourth quarter to a lower average cost
vehicle than we were purchasing earlier in the year and refocused our sales
force to recoup more of our shipping and handling costs through higher billings
for these items. As a result, we saw our gross margin improve in the fourth
quarter compared to our third quarter.

Facility and Warehouse
Expenses.

Facility
and warehouse expenses increased 23.6%, from $38.7 million in 2003 to
$47.8 million in 2004. Our 2004 acquisitions accounted for
$8.4 million of the increase. Our remaining facility and warehouse
expenses increased primarily due to higher wages resulting from increased
headcount and higher repairs and maintenance expenses. This increase was
partially offset by lower incentive compensation expense for field personnel
and lower rent expense due to our exercise of purchase options on certain
production facilities that we previously leased. As a percentage of revenue,
facility and warehouse expenses decreased from 11.8% to 11.3%.

Distribution Expenses.

Distribution expenses increased
35.9%, from $35.3 million in 2003 to $47.9 million in 2004. As a
percentage of revenue our distribution expenses increased from 10.8% to 11.3%.
Our 2004 acquisitions accounted for $7.5 million of the increase in
distribution expenses. Our remaining distribution expenses increased as we
increased the number of local delivery trucks by approximately 5.4%. We also
operated 11.6% more daily transfer routes between our facilities due to the
increase in parts volume. For the year ended December 31, 2004 we
increased the amount of product we moved between our facilities by
approximately 30%, the majority of which was on our own transfer trucks. In
addition, higher wages primarily from an increase in the number of employees,
increased fuel costs, truck rentals and repairs, delivery supplies, contracted
salvage transfer services, and freight costs accounted for the remaining growth
in distribution expenses. We renegotiated our freight rates with substantially
all of our common carriers in the fourth quarter of 2004, and we directed our
sales force to recoup more of our shipping and handling costs.

Selling, General, and
Administrative Expenses.

Selling, general, and administrative expenses
increased 24.4%, from $48.3 million in 2003 to $60.1 million in 2004.
Our 2004 acquisitions accounted for $6.4 million of the increase. The
majority of the remaining expense increase was due to labor and labor-related
expenses and costs associated with being a public company, partially offset by
$0.3 million in lower incentive compensation, lower bad debt expenses of
$0.4 million, and by improved insurance and legal claims experience of
$0.9 million. Our selling expenses tend to rise as revenue increases due
to our recycled OEM product commissioned inside sales force. We incurred
approximately $2.8 million in costs related to being a public company
compared to $0.6 million in 2003. These costs primarily included higher


premiums for
directors’ and officers’ liability insurance, higher directors’ compensation
expense, and higher accounting and legal fees. As a percentage of revenue our
selling, general, and administrative expenses decreased from 14.7% to 14.1%.

Depreciation and
Amortization.

Depreciation
and amortization increased 26.2%, from $5.4 million in 2003 to
$6.9 million in 2004. Our 2004 acquisitions accounted for
$1.2 million of the increase. As a percentage of revenue our depreciation
and amortization decreased from 1.7% to 1.6%.

Operating Income.

Operating income increased 34.0%,
from $26.1 million in 2003 to $34.9 million in 2004. As a percentage
of revenue, operating income increased from 7.9% to 8.2%.

Other (Income) Expense.

Net other expense decreased 44.9%,
from $1.9 million in 2003 to $1.1 million in 2004. As a percentage of
revenue, net other expense decreased from 0.6% to 0.2%. Included in other
income are approximately $0.4 million of proceeds from a corporate owned
life insurance policy. We use corporate owned life insurance policies to fund
our obligations under our nonqualified deferred compensation plan. Net interest
expense decreased 25.6% to $1.5 million in 2004 from $2.0 million in
2003. In 2004, interest expense was related primarily to debt incurred to fund
acquisitions. Included in interest expense in 2004 was $0.3 million in
debt issuance costs that were written off. These costs were attributable to our
previous secured bank credit facility that was terminated in February 2004.
See “Liquidity and Capital Resources” below for further discussion of changes
in our bank credit facilities. The decrease in net interest expense was due to
both lower average debt levels and interest rates in 2004.

Provision for Income Taxes.

The provision for income taxes
increased 38.7%, from $9.6 million in 2003 to $13.3 million in 2004
due primarily to improved operating results. Our effective tax rate was 39.2%
in 2004 and 39.7% in 2003. The decrease in our effective income tax rate in 2004
was due primarily to the receipt of nontaxable life insurance proceeds of
$0.4 million in the fourth quarter.

Liquidity
and Capital Resources

Our primary sources of
ongoing liquidity are cash flow from our operations and our credit facility. At
December 31, 2005, we had cash and equivalents amounting to
$3.2 million, and we had $38.0 million outstanding under our
$135 million unsecured bank credit facility. We generated $37.5 million in
cash flow from operating activities in 2005 and based on our current plans, we
expect to generate positive cash flow from operating activities for 2006. We
believe that cash flow from operating activities and availability under our
credit facility will be adequate to fund our short term liquidity needs.

Our liquidity needs are
primarily to fund working capital requirements and expand our facilities and
network. The procurement of inventory is the largest operating use of our
funds. We normally pay for salvage vehicles acquired at salvage auctions and
under some direct procurement arrangements at the time that we take possession
of the vehicles. We normally pay for aftermarket parts purchases at the time of
shipment or on standard payment terms, depending on the manufacturer and
payment options offered. We acquired approximately 75,000, 85,000, and 97,000 wholesale
salvage vehicles in 2003, 2004, and 2005, respectively. In addition, we
acquired approximately 27,700 and 55,800 salvage vehicles for our self-service
retail operations in 2004 and 2005, respectively. Our purchases of aftermarket
parts totaled approximately $23.4 million and $45.2 million in 2004 and
2005, respectively.

We completed the sale of
6.4 million shares of our common stock at a price of $14.50 per share in a public
offering in October 2005, as adjusted for our January 2006
two-for-one stock split. This resulted in approximately $87.9 million of cash
proceeds to us, net of underwriting discounts and commissions and expenses of
the offering. In connection with the offering, certain members of management
exercised stock options to purchase 600,000 shares of our common stock,
resulting in approximately $2.1 million of proceeds to us. We used all of the
proceeds from the offering and the option exercises to pay down our then
outstanding bank debt and invested the remaining proceeds in short term cash
equivalents until we


used
them for general corporate purposes, which included three acquisitions
completed by the end of the year.

We intend to continue to
evaluate markets for potential growth through the internal development of
redistribution centers, processing facilities, and aftermarket warehouses,
through further integration of aftermarket and recycled OEM product facilities,
and through selected business acquisitions. Our future liquidity and capital
requirements will depend upon numerous factors, including the costs and timing
of our internal development efforts and the success of those efforts, the costs
and timing of expansion of our sales and marketing activities, and the costs
and timing of future business acquisitions.

Net cash provided by
operating activities totaled $37.5 million in 2005, compared to
$25.9 million in 2004. Cash was provided by net income adjusted for
non-cash items. Working capital uses of cash included increases in receivables
and inventory, and decreases in accounts payable, partially offset by increases
in escrow liabilities, accruals and income taxes payable. Receivables increased
due to our increased sales volume, partially offset by repayments of employee
relocation loans and other receivables. Inventory increased to support our
increased volume and to add aftermarket products to some of our wholesale
recycled salvage locations. Accounts payable decreased as we accelerated
payments to certain foreign vendors in order to realize improved pricing on
certain aftermarket product purchases. Escrow liabilities increased as a result
of the deposit in escrow with us of $2.6 million in cash as collateral in
connection with an acquisition by us. Accrued liabilities increased primarily
due to the timing of wage payments, higher incentive compensation accruals, and
higher self-insurance reserves for workers’ compensation and auto liability
claims. Income taxes payable increased primarily due to higher levels of
taxable income.

Net cash used in investing
activities totaled $126.0 million in 2005, compared to $87.8 million
in 2004. We invested $103.8 million of cash in eight acquisitions in 2005
compared to $61.6 million in six acquisitions in 2004. We received $2.6
million in proceeds from the escrow deposit. We also realized $0.7 million in
increased proceeds from the sale of property and equipment and $0.4 million
from the sale of investment securities in 2005.

Net cash provided by
financing activities totaled $90.0 million in 2005, compared to
$47.5 million in 2004. Included in 2005 net cash amounts is
$87.9 million from the sale of 6.4 million shares of common stock in a
public offering. Exercises of stock options and warrants totaled $11.8 million
in 2005 and $4.9 million in 2004. In addition, we had net repayments of
$9.0 million under our credit facility in 2005, compared to net borrowings of
$47.0 million in 2004. Repayments of long-term debt obligations decreased $3.9
million in 2005.

Net cash provided by
operating activities totaled $25.9 million in 2004, compared to
$20.9 million in 2003. Cash was provided by net income adjusted for
non-cash items. Working capital uses of cash included increases in receivables
and inventory, plus decreases in accounts payable and other noncurrent
liabilities, partially offset by decreases in prepaid expenses and other
assets, plus increases in accrued expenses, income taxes payable, and deferred
revenue. Receivables increased due to our increased sales volume and increases
of $0.6 million for employee relocation loans. Inventory increased to
support our increased volume. Accounts payable decreased as we accelerated
payments to certain foreign vendors in order to realize improved pricing on
certain aftermarket product purchases and also due to the timing of payments
for certain facility construction projects and information systems licenses.
Other noncurrent liabilities decreased primarily due to reductions in legal
claim reserves partially offset by an increase in employee deferred
compensation liabilities. Prepaid expenses and other assets decreased due
primarily to amortization of directors’ and officers’ liability insurance
partially offset by an increase in deferred compensation plan assets and cash
paid in connection with the exercise of a warrant, net of decreases in that
investment’s value subsequent to acquisition. Accrued expenses increased
primarily due to increases in our self-insurance reserves, property taxes, and
timing of wage payments. Income taxes payable increased due primarily to our
higher levels of taxable income. Deferred revenue increased primarily due to
higher sales of extended warranty contracts.


Net cash used in investing
activities totaled $87.8 million in 2004, compared to $12.2 million
in 2003. We invested $61.6 million of cash in six acquisitions in 2004
compared to $3.3 million in three acquisitions in 2003, while net property
and equipment purchases increased $16.6 million, due primarily to
exercises of purchase options on previously leased facilities and investments
in facility expansions and information systems. We also exercised a warrant and
paid an exercise price of $0.7 million in 2004. See Note 1 of the
“Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for further discussion of this
investment.

Net cash provided by financing activities totaled
$47.5 million in 2004, compared to $6.8 million in 2003. Included in
these net cash amounts are $4.9 million in 2004 from the exercises of
stock options and warrants and $60.0 million in 2003 from the sale of
shares in our initial public offering and exercises of stock options and
warrants. In addition, we borrowed $47.0 million under our credit facility
in 2004 primarily to fund acquisitions, compared to net repayments of
$29.8 million in 2003. Repayments of long-term debt obligations increased
$3.8 million in 2004. We also incurred $0.2 million in 2004 for debt
issuance costs related to our new unsecured credit facility compared to
$0.1 million in 2003. In 2003, we repurchased 3,557,498 shares of our
common stock for $22.9 million.

On February 17, 2004, we entered into a new
unsecured revolving credit facility that originally matured in February 2007,
replacing a secured credit facility that would have expired on June 30,
2005. The new credit facility initially had a maximum availability of
$75.0 million, which was amended to $100 million on January 31,
2005. On June 1, 2005, the agreement was further amended to increase the
maximum availability to $135 million, extend the maturity date to June 1,
2010, and modify certain other terms. In order to make any borrowing under the
credit facility, after giving effect to any such borrowing, we must be in
compliance with all of the covenants under the credit facility, including,
without limitation, a senior debt to EBITDA ratio, which cannot exceed 3.00 to
1.00. The credit facility contains customary covenants, including, among other
things, limitations on payment of cash dividends, restrictions on our payment
of other dividends and on purchases, redemptions, and acquisitions of our
stock, limitations on additional indebtedness, certain limitations on
acquisitions, mergers, and consolidations, and the maintenance of certain
financial ratios. We were in compliance with all covenants throughout all of
2005 and 2004. The interest rate on advances under the credit facility may be,
at our option, either the bank prime lending rate, on the one hand, or the
Interbank Offering Rate (IBOR) plus an additional percentage ranging from .875%
to 1.625%, on the other hand. The percentage added to IBOR is dependent upon
our total funded debt to EBITDA ratio for the trailing four quarters.

We may in the future borrow additional amounts under
our credit facility or enter into new or additional borrowing arrangements. We
anticipate that any proceeds from such new or additional borrowing arrangements
will be used for general corporate purposes, including to develop and acquire
businesses and redistribution facilities; to further the integration of our
aftermarket, wheel refurbishing and recycled OEM product facilities; to expand
and improve existing facilities; to purchase property, equipment, and
inventory, and for working capital.

During August 2002, as required by our credit
facility, we entered into a two-year interest rate swap agreement with a total
notional amount of $10.0 million and a fixed rate of 2.65%. The
counterparty to the agreement was a member of our bank group. This swap agreement
expired on August 22, 2004. Under the terms of the agreement, we were
required to make quarterly payments at the specified fixed rate and in return
received payments at variable rates. The estimated fair value of the interest
rate swap was a loss of $0.1 million at December 31, 2003 and a gain
of $0.1 million at December 31, 2004. In accordance with the
provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, “Accounting
for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,” as amended, the changes in
the fair value of the interest rate swap are included in current period
earnings, as the agreement had not been designated as a hedging instrument.


During 2004, as part of the consideration for business
acquisitions completed during the year, we issued promissory notes totaling
approximately $2.4 million. The notes bear interest at annual rates of 3.0% to
5.0%, and interest is payable at maturity. One of these notes for $1.0 million
is secured by certain real property that we acquired in the acquisition. We
also assumed certain liabilities in connection with a business acquisition,
which included two bankers acceptances totaling $1.15 million, which were fully
paid in the second quarter of 2004.

During 2005, as part of the consideration for business
acquisitions completed during the year, we issued promissory notes totaling
approximately $6.4 million. The notes bear interest at annual rates of 3.0% to
3.5%, and interest is payable at maturity. We also assumed certain liabilities
in connection with a business acquisition, which included a promissory note
with a remaining principal balance of $0.2 million. The annual interest rate on
that note is 5.0%

We estimate that our capital expenditures for 2006
will be approximately $33.0 million, excluding business acquisitions. We
expect to use these funds for four major facility expansions, improvement of
current facilities, consolidation of two wholesale recycling operations and
conversion of one to a self-service operation, real estate acquisitions and systems
development projects. We anticipate that net cash provided by operating
activities for 2006 will be approximately $40.0 million.

We believe that our
current cash and equivalents, cash provided by operating activities and funds
available under our credit facility will be sufficient to meet our current
operating and capital requirements. However, we may, from time to time, raise
additional funds through public or private financing, strategic relationships,
or other arrangements. There can be no assurance that additional funding, or
refinancing of our credit facility, if needed, will be available on terms
attractive to us, or at all. Furthermore, any additional equity financing may
be dilutive to stockholders, and debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive
covenants. Our failure to raise capital if and when needed could have a
material adverse impact on our business, operating results, and financial
condition.

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements and Future Commitments

We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements,
investments in special purpose entities or undisclosed borrowings or debt that
would be required to be disclosed pursuant to Item 303 of Regulation S-K
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Additionally, we have not
entered into any derivative contracts other than our interest rate swap
agreement discussed above (that expired in August 2004), nor do we have
any synthetic leases.

The
following table represents our future commitments under contractual obligations
as of December 31, 2005:

Our long-term debt under contractual obligations above
includes interest on the balance outstanding under our variable rate credit
facility as of December 31, 2005. The $38.0 million outstanding at December 31,
2005 was assumed to remain unpaid until the facility matures on June 1,
2010, and interest was computed at the average effective rate of 7.25% at December 31,
2005. The $38.0 million balance


outstanding at December 31,
2005 was converted to an IBOR-based loan at a rate of 5.415% on January 4,
2006.

The interest rate on
advances under the credit facility (our primary debt outstanding) may be, at
our option, either the bank prime lending rate, on the one hand, or the
Interbank Offering Rate (IBOR) plus an additional percentage ranging from .875%
to 1.625%, on the other hand. The percentage added to IBOR is dependent upon
our total funded debt to EBITDA ratio (as defined) for the trailing four
quarters.

ITEM 7A.

QUANTITATIVE
AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Our results of operations are exposed to changes in
interest rates primarily with respect to borrowings under our credit facility,
where interest rates are tied to either the prime rate or IBOR. As of December 31,
2005, we had $38.0 million outstanding under our credit facility. Our
previous secured credit facility required that we enter into an interest rate
swap agreement to mitigate our interest rate risk on a portion of the balance
outstanding. We do not however, as a matter of policy, enter into derivative
contracts for trading or speculative purposes. The swap agreement, which
expired on August 22, 2004, had a notional amount of $10.0 million
under which we paid a fixed rate of interest of 2.65% and received payments
based upon variable rates. The swap agreement was not designated as a hedging
instrument and, as a result, changes in the fair value of the swap agreement
were included in current period earnings. We recorded non-cash credits of
$69,000 and $90,000 during 2003 and 2004, respectively, related to the change
in fair value of the interest rate swap agreement.

Based upon our variable rate debt at December 31,
2005, a hypothetical 1% increase in interest rates would result in an annual
increase in interest expense of approximately $0.4 million.

The Company is also exposed to currency fluctuations
with respect to the purchase of aftermarket parts in Taiwan. While all transactions
with manufacturers based in Taiwan are conducted in U.S. dollars, changes in
the relationship between the U.S. dollar and the New Taiwan dollar might impact
the purchase price of aftermarket parts. We might not be able to pass on any
price increases to customers. Under our present policies, we do not attempt to
hedge this currency exchange rate exposure.

Our investment in our Central American operations is
not material, and we do not attempt to hedge our foreign currency risk related
to such operations.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING
FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of LKQ
Corporation:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance
sheets of LKQ Corporation and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31,
2005 and 2004, and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders’
equity and other comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended December 31, 2005. Our audits also included the

LKQ CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Company Overview

LKQ Corporation, a
Delaware corporation, believes it is the largest nationwide provider of light
vehicle recycled original equipment manufacturer (“OEM”) products and related
services, reaching most major markets in the United States, and is also one of
the nation’s largest suppliers of light vehicle aftermarket products, operating
primarily east of the Mississippi River.

Principles of
Consolidation

The accompanying
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of LKQ Corporation and
its subsidiaries (the “Company”). All significant intercompany transactions and
accounts have been eliminated.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of
financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Per Share Amounts

All per share amounts and
the number of shares for all periods have been retroactively adjusted to
reflect the two-for-one stock split declared on December 15, 2005. See
Note 2 for further discussion.

Revenue Recognition

The majority of the
Company’s revenue is derived from the sale of recycled OEM products and
aftermarket products. Revenue is recognized when the products are shipped and
title has transferred, subject to an allowance for estimated returns, discounts
and allowances that management estimates based upon historical information. The
Company has recorded a reserve for estimated returns, discounts and allowances
of approximately $3.1 million and $2.2 million at December 31, 2005 and
2004, respectively. Revenue from the sale of separately-priced extended
warranty contracts is reported as Deferred revenue and recognized ratably over
the term of the contracts.

Shipping & Handling

Revenue also includes
amounts billed to customers related to shipping and handling of approximately
$7.6 million and $5.9 million during the years ended December 31, 2005 and
2004, respectively. Distribution expenses in the accompanying consolidated
statements of income are the costs incurred to prepare and deliver products to
customers.

Cash and Equivalents

The Company considers all
highly liquid investments with original maturities of 90 days or less to be
cash equivalents. Cash equivalents are carried at cost, which approximates
market value.

Restricted Cash

In connection with a
business acquisition on January 31, 2005, the Company held approximately
$599,000 in restricted cash. During the year ended December 31, 2005, the
amount of cash restricted was reduced by $149,000.

Receivables

The Company has recorded a
reserve for uncollectible accounts of approximately $2.1 million and $1.7
million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The reserve is based
upon management’s assessment of the collectibility of specific customer
accounts, the aging of the accounts receivable and historical experience.
Receivables include travel advances and relocation loans to employees of
approximately $0.2 million and $0.6 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004,
respectively.

Concentrations of
Credit Risk

Financial instruments that
potentially subject the Company to significant concentration of credit risk
consist primarily of cash and equivalents and accounts receivable. The majority
of cash and equivalents are maintained with several major financial
institutions. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable
are limited because a large number of geographically diverse customers make up
the Company’s customer base. The Company controls credit risk through credit
approvals, credit limits, and monitoring procedures.

Inventory

A salvage vehicle product is a recycled vehicle part
suitable for sale as a replacement part. A core is a recycled mechanical part
that is not suitable for sale as a replacement part without further
remanufacturing work. Salvage inventory and cores are recorded at the lower of
cost or market. Cost is established based upon the price the Company pays for a
vehicle, and includes average costs for buying, dismantling, and where
applicable, auction fees and storage, and towing. Inventory carrying value is
determined using the average cost to sales percentage at each of the Company’s
facilities and applying that percentage to the facility’s inventory at expected
selling prices. The average cost to sales percentage is derived from each
facility’s historical vehicle profitability for salvage vehicles purchased at
auction or from contracted rates for salvage vehicles acquired under certain
direct procurement arrangements.

An aftermarket product is a new vehicle product
manufactured by a company other than the OEM. Aftermarket inventory is recorded
at the lower of cost or market. Cost is established based upon the average
price for purchased parts, and includes expenses incurred for freight and
buying, where applicable. For items purchased from foreign companies, import
fees and duties and transportation insurance are also included.

For all inventory, carrying value is reduced regularly
to reflect the age of the inventory and current anticipated demand. If actual
demand differs from management estimates, additional reductions to inventory
carrying value would be necessary in the period such determination is made.

Inventory consists of the following (in thousands):

Property and Equipment

Property and equipment are
recorded at cost. Expenditures for major additions and improvements are
capitalized. As property and equipment are sold or retired, the applicable cost
and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any resulting
gain or loss thereon is recognized. Construction in progress consists primarily
of building and land improvements at existing Company facilities. Depreciation
is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives
or, in the case of leasehold improvements, the term of the related lease,
including renewal periods, if shorter. Other estimated useful lives are as
follows:

Intangibles

Intangible assets consist primarily of goodwill (the
cost of purchased businesses in excess of the fair value of the identifiable
net assets acquired) and covenants not to compete.

Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful
lives should not be amortized but instead should be tested for impairment at
least annually. The Company has performed annual impairment tests during the
fourth quarter of 2005, 2004 and 2003. The results of these tests indicated
that goodwill was not impaired.

The
changes in the carrying amount of goodwill are as follows (in thousands):

Other intangible assets
totaled approximately $151,700 and $88,900 at December 31, 2005 and 2004,
respectively. Accumulated amortization of other intangible assets at December 31,
2005 and 2004 was approximately $63,300 and $44,300, respectively. Amortization
expense was approximately $19,000, $8,000 and $17,300 during the years ended December 31,
2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Covenants not to compete are amortized over
the lives of the respective agreements on a straight-line basis. Estimated
annual amortization expense for the years ended December 31, 2006 through
2009 is approximately $20,500 and for the year ended December 31, 2010 is
approximately $3,200.

Impairment of
Long-Lived Assets

Long-lived assets are
reviewed for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that
the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. If such review
indicates that the carrying amount of long-lived assets is not recoverable, the
carrying amount of such assets is reduced to fair value. There were no
adjustments to the carrying value of long-lived assets during the years ended December 31,
2005, 2004 or 2003.

Investments

The Company obtained a warrant to purchase 100,000
common shares of Keystone Automotive Industries, Inc. at $6.50 per share,
in connection with a supply agreement dated February 21, 2000. This
warrant was not valued prior to December 31, 2003 as the Company did not
have an expectation of exercising the warrant due to the one year holding
period requirement and liquidity considerations. Upon

completion of the Company’s
initial public offering in the fourth quarter of 2003 (Note 2) and the new
unsecured revolving credit facility in February 2004 (Note 6), sufficient
liquidity was available to the Company that would enable it to exercise the
warrant and hold the investment for the minimum one year holding period. As a
result, the Company valued and recorded the warrant at December 31, 2003.
The Company classified this warrant as an available-for-sale investment
security under Emerging Issues Task Force No. 96-11, “Accounting for
Forward Contracts and Purchased Options to Acquire Securities Covered by
Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Statement no. 115,” that requires
the warrant to be accounted for consistent with SFAS No. 115, “Accounting
for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities” (“SFAS 115”). Accordingly,
the Company reported the warrant at fair value, with the unrealized gain
excluded from earnings and included in Accumulated other comprehensive income,
net of applicable taxes of $0.7 million. The fair value of the warrant at December 31,
2003 was estimated at approximately $1.9 million using a Black-Scholes
option-pricing model.

The Company exercised its
warrant in March 2004. The shares were restricted and therefore were required
to either be registered or held for a period of one year in accordance with
applicable securities laws. During September 2005, the Company sold a
portion of its investment and has included the realized gain of $0.3 million in
Other (income) expense. The Company classifies this investment as an
available-for-sale investment security under SFAS 115. Accordingly, the Company
has included the investment at its fair value of approximately $2.7 million and
$2.3 million in Other Assets at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively,
with the unrealized gain excluded from earnings and included in Accumulated
other comprehensive income, net of applicable taxes. The fair value of this
investment at December 31, 2005 and 2004 was estimated based upon the
quoted market price for these securities.

Fair Value of
Financial Instruments

SFAS No. 107, “Disclosures About Fair Value of
Financial Instruments,” requires disclosure of the fair value of certain
financial instruments. The Company’s financial instruments, excluding the
available-for-sale securities discussed above, include cash and equivalents,
trade receivables, accounts payable, debt and, through August 2004, an
interest rate swap. The carrying amounts of financial instruments approximate
fair value.

Escrow Liability

In February 2004, in
connection with a business acquisition, the Company issued 168,690 shares of
its common stock, which were to be held in escrow for a period of two years as
collateral for the accuracy of certain representations and warranties made by
the sellers. The terms of the agreement granted the stockholders the option to
sell any or all of these shares during the escrow period, provided that all
proceeds from such sale were delivered to the Company. In September 2005,
the stockholders sold all such shares held in escrow and delivered $2.6 million
to the Company. The escrow funds, which are included in Escrow liability on the
accompanying balance sheet,  bear
interest at an annual rate of 3%. In February 2006, the sellers’ representation
and warranty provisions were resolved, and the escrowed funds plus accrued
interest were returned to the sellers.

Accrued Expenses

The Company has entered into certain arrangements
whereby salvage vehicles are obtained directly from major insurance companies
and automotive manufacturers at a cost calculated as a percentage of the
revenue generated from each vehicle. Accrued expenses include an estimated
liability of approximately $2.5 million and $2.0 million at December 31,
2005 and 2004, respectively, for salvage inventory procured under such
arrangements.

The Company self-insures for a portion of employee
medical benefits under the terms of its employee health insurance program. The
Company has purchased stop-loss insurance coverage in order to limit its
exposure to employee medical benefit claims. Other accrued expenses include an
estimated liability of approximately $1.5 million and $1.4 million at December 31,
2005 and 2004, respectively, for expenses incurred but not yet paid under the
program.

The Company also
self-insures for a portion of general liability and workers compensation claims
under the terms of its current insurance program, which began on April 1,
2002. On April 1, 2003, the Company began self-insuring for a portion of
automobile claims. The Company has purchased stop-loss insurance coverage in
order to limit its exposure to automobile, general liability and workers
compensation claims. Other accrued expenses include an estimated liability of
approximately $5.4 million and $3.0 million, net of claims deposits of $0.7
million and $0.4 million, at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, for
expenses incurred but not yet paid under the program. If the Company were to
incur claims up to its aggregate stop-loss insurance coverage during the open
policy years, it would have an additional expense of approximately $8.9
million.

Product Warranties

The Company generally warrants certain mechanical
parts against defects for a period of six months. Based on historical warranty
claims, the Company accrues the estimated costs of the warranty coverage at the
time of sale.

related to employee deferred compensation plans as discussed in Note 5.

Other Noncurrent
Liabilities also include approximately $1.0 million and $1.5 million at December 31,
2005 and 2004, respectively, related to unasserted claims that are deemed
probable of assertion. In the

event
the unasserted claims are asserted and resolved for amounts different than
those accrued, or are determined to no longer be probable in future periods, the
amounts so determined would be adjusted to income in the periods such
determination is made. During the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004,
approximately $0.5 million and $1.1 million, respectively, was recognized in
income due to the favorable resolution of certain unasserted claims.

Stock-Based
Compensation

The Company has three stock-based compensation plans,
the LKQ Corporation 1998 Equity Incentive Plan 
(the “Equity Incentive Plan”), the Stock Option and Compensation Plan
for Non-Employee Directors (the “Director Plan”), and a separate stock option
plan for our Chief Executive Officer (the “CEO Plan”), which are described more
fully in Note 3. The Company has historically accounted for its stock
compensation agreements under the provisions of Accounting Principles Board
(APB) Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees” (“APB 25”).
The Company has adopted the disclosure-only provisions of SFAS No. 123, “Accounting
for Stock-Based Compensation” (“SFAS 123”), as amended by SFAS No. 148 “Accounting
for Stock-Based Compensation-Transition and Disclosures” (“SFAS 148”). As of January 1,
2006, the Company will adopt SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), “Share-Based
Payment” (“SFAS 123R”), a revision of SFAS 123. See Recent Accounting
Pronouncements below for further discussion.

Under the CEO Plan, the difference between the fair
market value of the options at the time granted in 1998 and the exercise price
was recorded as deferred compensation expense and was being charged to
operations over the vesting period of the options, which ended in November 2003.
No stock-based compensation cost is reflected in net income for the Equity
Incentive Plan or the Director Plan at the date of issuance of the options, as
all options granted under these plans had an exercise price equal to or greater
than the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant.

On December 27, 2004, the Company’s Board of
Directors amended the award of 400,000 options granted to its Chairman on January 29,
2004 under the Equity Incentive Plan, accelerating the vesting schedule to make
all unvested shares subject to the options immediately exercisable. The Company
recognized compensation expense of approximately $0.2 million in the fourth
quarter of 2004 in connection with this amendment.

The following table
illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share if the Company had
applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123 to the Equity
Incentive Plan and the Director Plan (in thousands, except per share amounts):

The fair value of stock options used to compute the
pro forma disclosures has been estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing
model. This model requires the use of highly subjective assumptions, including
the expected volatility of the underlying stock. Projected data related to
volatility and expected life of stock options is based upon historical and
other information. Changes in the subjective underlying assumptions can
materially affect the fair value estimates.  For purposes of pro forma disclosure, the
estimated fair value of the options is amortized to expense over the options’
vesting periods.

The
following table summarizes the assumptions used to compute the weighted average
fair value of stock option grants:

A
volatility assumption of 0% was used for options granted prior to the Company’s
initial public offering in October 2003.

Rental Expense

The Company recognizes rental expense on a
straight-line basis over the respective lease terms for all of its operating
leases.

Earnings per Share

Basic earnings per share are computed using the
weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted
earnings per share incorporate the incremental shares issuable upon the assumed
exercise of stock options and warrants. Certain of the Company’s stock options
and warrants were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share
because they were antidilutive, but these options and warrants could be
dilutive in the future.

Segment Information

Over 99% of the Company’s
operations are conducted in the United States. During 2004, the Company
acquired a recycled OEM products business with locations in Guatemala and Costa
Rica. Revenue generated and properties located outside of the United States are
not material. The Company manages its operations geographically. The Company’s
light vehicle replacement products operations are organized into nine operating
segments, eight for recycled OEM products and one for aftermarket products.
These segments are aggregated into one reportable segment because they possess
similar economic characteristics and have common products and services,
customers and methods of distribution. The light vehicle replacement products
operations account for over 90% of the Company’s revenue, earnings and assets.

Foreign Currency
Translation

For the Company’s foreign
operations, the local currency is the functional currency. Assets and
liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars at the period-ending exchange
rate. Statement of Income amounts are translated to U.S. dollars using average
exchange rates during the period. Translation gains and losses are reported as
a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income in Stockholders’ Equity.
Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are included in current
earnings.

Recent Accounting
Pronouncements

In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151,
“Inventory Costs, an amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4” (“SFAS 151”).
SFAS 151 amends Accounting Research Bulletin No. 43, Chapter 4, to clarify
that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs and
wasted materials (spoilage) should be recognized as current period charges. It
also requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of
conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities. SFAS
151 is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning
after June 15, 2005. The Company does not expect that the adoption of this
standard will have a material impact on its consolidated financial position,
results of operations or cash flows.

In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123
(revised 2004), “Share-Based Payment” (“SFAS 123R”), a revision of SFAS 123.
SFAS 123R supersedes Accounting Principles Board (“APB”) Opinion No. 25, “Accounting
for Stock Issued to Employees,” and amends SFAS 95, “Statement of Cash Flows.”
Under the standard, companies will no longer be able to account for stock-based
employee compensation using the intrinsic method in accordance with APB No. 25.
Instead, SFAS 123R requires the adoption of a fair-value method of accounting
for stock-based employee compensation. SFAS 123R is effective for the
Company as of January 1, 2006. The Company has historically accounted for
stock-based compensation to employees under APB No. 25’s intrinsic value
method and accordingly, has generally not recognized


LKQ CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 1.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

compensation expense for
options granted to employees. The Company will adopt the provisions of SFAS
123R using the modified prospective method, in which prior periods are not
restated and compensation expense for all share-based payments granted or
modified after the effective date is recognized prospectively based upon the
requirements of SFAS 123R and compensation expense for all unvested share-based
payments as of January 1, 2006 that were issued subsequent to the
Company’s initial public offering in October 2003 is recognized prospectively
based on SFAS 123. In applying the fair value concepts of SFAS 123R, the
Company will be required to choose among alternative valuation models and other
assumptions. The Company currently estimates that it will recognize
equity-based compensation expense of approximately $0.03 per diluted share in
2006. This amount is subject to revisions as assumptions are finalized,
including the amount of future awards and forfeiture rates. SFAS also requires
the Company to calculate the pool of excess tax benefits available to absorb
tax deficiencies that arise subsequent to adopting SFAS 123R (the “APIC Pool.”)  The Company is currently evaluating the
acceptable methods for calculating the APIC Pool. SFAS 123R further requires
that the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized book compensation
expense be reported as a financing cash flow item as opposed to an operating
cash flow item. The Company cannot estimate what the future tax benefits will be
as the amounts depends on, among other things, future employee stock option
exercises and the price of its stock if and when such exercises occur.

In March 2005, the FASB issued Interpretation
No. 47, “Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirements—an interpretation of
SFAS No. 143” (“FIN 47”). FIN 47 clarifies that uncertainty
about the timing and (or) method of settlement of a conditional asset
retirement obligation should be factored into the measurement of the liability
when sufficient information exists to make a reasonable estimate of the fair
value of the obligation. The Company has adopted FIN 47 and its adoption
did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial
position, results of operations or cash flows.

In May 2005, the FASB
issued SFAS No. 154, “Accounting Changes and Error Corrections” (“SFAS 154”).
SFAS 154 replaces Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 20 “Accounting
Changes” and SFAS No. 3, “Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim
Financial Statements-An Amendment of APB Opinion No. 28.” SFAS 154
provides guidance on the accounting for and reporting of accounting changes and
error corrections. SFAS 154 requires “retrospective application” of the direct
effect of a voluntary change in accounting principle to prior periods’
financial statements where it is practicable to do so. SFAS 154 also redefines
the term “restatement” to mean the correction of an error by revising
previously issued financial statements. SFAS 154 is effective for accounting
changes and error corrections made in fiscal years beginning after December 15,
2005 unless adopted early. The Company does not expect the adoption of SFAS 154
to have a material impact on its consolidated financial position, results of
operations or cash flows, except to the extent that the statement subsequently
requires retrospective application of a future item.

Note 2. Capital Structure

On March 31, 1999, in connection with a business
acquisition, the Company issued warrants to purchase 200,000 shares of its
common stock at $7.50 per share, with exercisability contingent upon the
achievement of certain operating results in 2000. These results were achieved
and the warrants became exercisable on March 31, 2001. These warrants were
to expire five years after they became exercisable. In

accordance with the
antidilution provisions of the warrant agreement, the total number of warrants
issued and the exercise price at December 31, 2003 were adjusted to
227,502 and $6.59 per share. In June 2005, the warrants were exercised
utilizing a cashless exercise feature as provided in the original agreement. As
a result, the Company issued 116,362 shares of its common stock upon the
exercise of the warrants. The 111,140 shares retained by the Company were
retired.

The Company issued warrants on January 3, 2000 to
purchase 300,000 shares of its common stock at exercise prices ranging from
$7.50 to $17.50 per share, in connection with a business acquisition completed
in 1999. The warrants were valued at $144,500 at the date of grant. In August 2004,
warrants to purchase 100,000 shares of the Company’s common stock at a price of
$7.50 per share were exercised. Warrants to purchase 200,000 shares of the
Company’s common stock at prices ranging from $12.50 to $17.50 expired on August 31,
2004.

On February 14, 2001, the Company issued warrants
to purchase 3,922,224 shares of its common stock at an exercise price of $1.00
per share to certain stockholder guarantors. The Company had breached certain
covenants of its credit facility including covenants relating to operating
income and the minimum required ratio of funded debt to earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. The Company entered into an
amendment to the credit agreement with its banks that waived the breaches and
modified certain of the covenants. As part of the amendment, the banks required
that stockholders guaranty $10 million of the debt, with the guaranties secured
by letters of credit or other highly liquid collateral acceptable to the banks.
All of the Company’s stockholders were given the opportunity to participate in
this transaction, and thirty of the Company’s stockholders provided the
guaranties. In exchange for providing the guaranties, each guarantor received
certain rights, including a guaranty fee. The guaranty fee consisted of each
guarantor’s pro rata portion of warrants to purchase a total of 3,922,224
shares of the Company’s common stock (10% of the then outstanding shares of
common stock assuming exercise of these warrants) at an exercise price of $1.00
per share. The warrants became exercisable upon issuance and were to expire on February 14,
2006. The warrants were valued at approximately $401,000 at the date of grant.
Warrants to purchase 1,763,986 and 1,005,636 shares of the Company’s common
stock at a price of $1.00 per share were exercised during the years ended December 31,
2005 and 2004, respectively. All such warrants outstanding at December 31,
2005 were exercised prior to the expiration date. The stockholder guaranties
were cancelled in June 2002 when the Company entered into a new credit
facility.

On January 1, 2003, in connection with a business
acquisition, the Company issued 100,000 shares of its common stock. The Company
granted a put option on those shares with a single exercise date of January 1,
2007 at a price of $7.50 per share and obtained a call option on those shares
with a single exercise date of January 1, 2007 at a price of $11.25 per
share. These shares are reflected as Redeemable Common Stock in the
consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2005 and 2004.

In February 2003, the Company repurchased
4,000,000 shares of its common stock from existing stockholders, including
3,757,368 shares repurchased from AutoNation, Inc., the Company’s largest
stockholder at that time, for a total of $12.0 million in cash. The Company
partially funded the stock repurchase by obtaining a $9.0 million term loan
(see Note 6), with an original maturity date of February 20, 2004. On October 9,
2003, the Company fully paid the balance on the term loan.

In May 2003, the Company repurchased 3,114,996
shares of its common stock from existing shareholders, including 3,000,000
shares repurchased from AutoNation, Inc., for a total of approximately


LKQ CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Note 2. Capital
Structure (Continued)

$10.9 million in cash. The
Company partially funded the stock repurchase by borrowing an additional $9.0
million against an existing revolving credit facility (See Note 6).

In June 2003, the Company sold certain assets no
longer deemed pertinent to its operations to an existing stockholder in
exchange for 160,000 shares of the Company’s common stock. The shares, which
were subsequently retired, were valued at approximately $0.6 million.

On October 2, 2003, the Securities and Exchange
Commission declared effective the registration statement pursuant to which the
Company sold 10.0 million shares in its initial public offering. Pursuant to
the same registration statement, the selling stockholders named in the
registration statement sold approximately 6.2 million shares of the Company’s
common stock. On October 8, 2003, the transaction was closed and the
Company received approximately $60.5 million, net of underwriting discount and
before offering related expenses of approximately $2.2 million, for the common
stock it issued and sold. The Company did not receive any proceeds from the
sale of shares by the selling stockholders.

On October 8, 2003, the Company increased the
number of its authorized shares of Common Stock from 100 million shares to 500
million shares.

On February 20, 2004, in connection with a
business acquisition, the Company issued 168,690 shares of its common stock. The
purchase agreement contained a provision that if the average market price of
the Company’s common stock on the five business days immediately preceding the
first anniversary of such acquisition was below $8.00 per share, the Company
would make an additional payment per share (in cash or in common stock, at the
Company’s option) equal to $8.00 minus the average closing price over such five
day period. The actual average closing price of the Company’s common stock on
the five business days immediately preceding the first anniversary of the
acquisition exceeded $8.00 per share, and no additional payment was required.

On October 4, 2005, the Company completed the
sale of 6,435,000 shares of its common stock pursuant to a registration
statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Pursuant to the
same registration statement, the selling stockholders named in the registration
statement sold 1,500,000 shares of the Company’s common stock. The Company
received $88.6 million, net of underwriting discount and before
offering-related expenses of approximately $744,000, for the common stock it
issued and sold. The Company did not receive any proceeds from the sale of
shares by the selling stockholders. The Company also received approximately
$2.1 million in proceeds from the exercise of 600,000 stock options by certain
members of management in connection with the offering.

On December 15, 2005,
the Company’s Board of Directors approved a two-for-one split of the Company’s
common stock. Each stockholder of record at the close of business on January 3,
2006 received an additional share of common stock for every outstanding share
held. The payment date was January 13, 2006, and the common stock began
trading on a split-adjusted basis on January 17, 2006.

In February 1998, the Company adopted the Equity
Incentive Plan to attract and retain employees and consultants. Under the
Equity Incentive Plan, both qualified and nonqualified stock options, stock
appreciation rights, restricted stock, performance shares and performance units
may be granted. On March 6, 2002, the Company’s stockholders approved an
increase in the number of shares available under


LKQ CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 3. Equity
Incentive Plans

(Continued)

the Equity Incentive Plan
from 6.0 million to 10.0 million, subject to antidilution and other adjustment
provisions. On May 9, 2005, the Company’s stockholders approved an
increase in the number of shares available under the Equity Incentive Plan from
to 10.0 million to 14.0 million, subject to antidilution and other adjustment
provisions.

In November 1998, the Company also adopted the
CEO Plan. The terms of the CEO Plan were substantially the same as the terms of
the Equity Incentive Plan except that the exercise price of options granted
under the CEO Plan could be less than the fair market value of the Company’s
common stock on the date the option is granted. During 1998, the Company
granted 350,000 options under the CEO Plan with an exercise price of $5.00 per
share at a time when the fair value of the Company’s stock was $6.25 per share.
The difference between the fair market value and the option exercise price was
recorded as deferred compensation expense and was charged to operations over
the vesting period of the options, which ended in November 2003. There are
no additional shares available for award under the CEO Plan.

In June 2003, the Company’s Board of Directors
adopted the Director Plan and in September 2003, the plan was approved by
the Company’s stockholders. Options granted under the Director Plan are
automatic and nondiscretionary, and the exercise price of the options is 100%
of the fair market value of the Company’s stock on the grant date. Only
non-employee directors are eligible for grants under the Director Plan. Under
the plan, each non-employee director received an initial grant of an option to
purchase 60,000 shares of common stock as of October 2, 2003. The plan
also provides for an initial grant to a new non-employee director of an option
to purchase 60,000 shares of common stock upon election to the board of
directors. Subsequent to the initial grants, each non-employee director will be
automatically granted an option to purchase 20,000 shares of common stock on
each anniversary of the granting of the initial stock option to that
non-employee director. The Director Plan will terminate in June 2013,
unless the board of directors terminates it sooner. The number of shares
available under the Director Plan is 1,000,000, subject to antidilution and
other adjustment provisions.

Note 3. Equity
Incentive Plans (Continued)

A summary of transactions
in the Company’s stock-based compensation plans is as follows:

The following table
summarizes information about outstanding and exercisable stock options at December 31,
2005:

At December 31, 2004
and 2003, options to purchase 5,022,940 and 3,806,466 shares of common stock
were exercisable pursuant to the Company’s stock-based compensation plans with
a weighted-average exercise price of $5.98 and $5.63, respectively.

Stock options expire 10
years from the date they are granted. Most of the options granted under the
Equity Incentive Plan and the CEO Plan vest over a period of five years.
Options granted under the Director Plan vest six months after the date of
grant.

On December 27, 2004,
the Company’s Board of Directors amended the award of 400,000 options granted
to its Chairman on January 29, 2004 under the Equity Incentive Plan,
accelerating the vesting schedule to make all unvested shares subject to the
options immediately exercisable. The Company recognized compensation expense of
approximately $0.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2004


LKQ CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 3. Equity
Incentive Plans (Continued)

in
connection with this amendment. The Board of Directors decided to accelerate
the vesting schedule of these options in order to conform the vesting to grants
normally made under the Director Plan. In addition, the Board of Directors
decided it was in the best interests of stockholders to accelerate these
options to avoid compensation expense in future periods that would otherwise
result from the effectiveness of SFAS 123R for periods beginning subsequent to December 31,
2005.

On January 7, 2005,
the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the Compensation Committee to make
the 2005 annual grant of stock options to employees (the “2005 Options”). On January 14,
2005, the Compensation Committee granted options to purchase a total of 844,000
shares of LKQ common stock with an exercise price of $8.84 per share. The
vesting schedule for each of the 2005 Options is as follows: June 14, 2005
with respect to 50% of the number of shares subject to such option and, with
respect to an additional 5.555% of the number of shares subject to such option,
January 14, 2006 and each six month anniversary thereafter until January 14,
2010. This vesting schedule is different than the typical vesting schedule for
options granted under the Equity Incentive Plan.

On January 10, 2005,
the Compensation Committee amended the vesting schedule of a total of 857,000
options granted to employees in 2004 under the Equity Incentive Plan,
accelerating the vesting schedule to make all unvested shares subject to the
options exercisable on January 10, 2005. The Compensation Committee
decided to accelerate the vesting schedule of these options primarily as a
supplement to compensation due to the expected reduction of cash bonuses to
employees for the 2004 calendar year. The bonus formula established by the
Company in January 2004 resulted in reduced 2004 bonuses for many LKQ
employees as compared to 2003. In addition, the Compensation Committee decided
it was in the best interests of stockholders to accelerate these options to
avoid compensation expense in future periods that would otherwise result from
the effectiveness of SFAS 123R for periods beginning subsequent to December 31,
2005.

On January 28, 2005,
the Compensation Committee granted options to employees to purchase a total of
600,000 shares of LKQ common stock at an exercise price of $8.33 per share. The
options were immediately exercisable with respect to all of the shares subject
to the options. This vesting schedule is different than the typical vesting
schedule for options granted under the Equity Incentive Plan.

On March 3, 2005, the
Company’s Board of Directors authorized the submission to the Company’s
stockholders of an amendment to the Equity Incentive Plan to increase the
shares reserved for issuance under the plan from 10,000,000 to 14,000,000. The
amendment was approved by the Company’s stockholders on May 9, 2005.

On January 13, 2006,
the Company’s Board of Directors granted options to employees to purchase a
total of 461,600 shares of LKQ common stock at an exercise price of $19.51 per
share. The options vest over a period of five years.

The Company subleased its
corporate office space from an entity owned by one of its principal
stockholders for a pro rata percentage of the rent that was charged to that
entity. The sublease expired on July 31, 2004. The total amounts paid to
this entity were approximately $0.2 million and $0.3 million during each of the
years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Beginning in August 2004,
the Company subleased a portion of its corporate office space to an entity
owned by one of its principal stockholders for a pro rata percentage of the
rent that the Company is charged. The total amounts

(Continued)

received from this entity
were approximately $33,900 and $49,000 during the five month period ended December 31,
2004 and the year ended December 31, 2005, respectively.

A corporation owned by the Company’s Chairman of the
Board, who is one of the Company’s principal stockholders, owns a private
aircraft that the Company uses from time to time for business trips. The
Company reimburses this corporation for out-of-pocket and other related flight
expenses, as well as for other direct expenses incurred. The total amounts paid
to this corporation were approximately $122,000, $54,700 and $152,900 during
each of the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

The Company sells products to various repair
facilities owned by a company that was previously one of its principal
stockholders. This corporation ceased being a stockholder of the Company in October 2003.
The amount of such sales totaled approximately $2.7 million during the year
ended December 31, 2003.

In connection with the acquisitions of several
businesses, the Company entered into agreements with several sellers of those
businesses, who became stockholders as a result of those acquisitions, for the
lease of certain properties used in its operations. Typical lease terms include
an initial term of five years, with three five-year renewal options and
purchase options at various times throughout the lease periods. The Company
also maintains the right of first refusal concerning the sale of the leased
property. Lease payments to a principal stockholder who became an officer of
the Company after the acquisition of his  business were approximately $0.8 million, $0.8
million and $0.7 million during the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004
and 2003, respectively.

In June 2003, the Company sold certain assets no
longer deemed pertinent to its operations to an existing stockholder in
exchange for 160,000 shares of the Company’s common stock. See Note 2 for
further discussion. In April 2005, the Company sold additional assets no
longer deemed pertinent to its operations to the same stockholder for $0.6
million.

The Company believes that
the terms of the related party transactions described above are comparable to
those that could have been available from unaffiliated parties.

Note 5. Retirement
Plans

The Company sponsors the LKQ Corporation Employees’
Retirement Plan (the “Plan”), a qualified defined contribution plan covering
substantially all full time employees not covered by qualified plans maintained
by subsidiaries. Employees may contribute up to 15% of eligible compensation,
subject to certain Internal Revenue Service limitations. The Company will match
50% of the portion of the employee’s contributions that does not exceed 6% of
the employee’s salary. Matching Company contributions vest over a four year
period and totaled approximately $1.4 million, $1.2 million and $1.0 million in
2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The Company may also, at its sole
discretion, make annual profit-sharing contributions to the Plan. There were no
such discretionary profit sharing contributions to the Plan in 2005, 2004 or
2003. All contribution levels may be subject to further limits, under Internal
Revenue Service guidelines.


LKQ CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Note 5.

Retirement
Plans (Continued)

Two of the companies acquired by the Company during
2004, Foster Auto Parts, Inc. and Global Trade Alliance, Inc. (See
Note 9), also maintain qualified defined contribution plans covering
substantially all of their full time employees. Expenses related to these plans
totaled approximately $0.1 million during each of 2005 and 2004. The plan
maintained by Foster Auto Parts, Inc. was merged into the LKQ Corporation
Employees’ Retirement Plan during 2005. Bodymaster Auto Parts, Inc. and
Mid-State Aftermarket Auto Parts, Inc., which were acquired by the Company
in 2005 (See Note 9), also maintain qualified defined contribution plans
covering substantially all of their full time employees. Expenses related to
these plans totaled approximately $0.1 million during 2005.

The Company also offers a nonqualified deferred
compensation plan to eligible employees who, due to Internal Revenue Service
guidelines, may not take full advantage of the LKQ Corporation Employees’
Retirement Plan. The nonqualified plan allows participants to defer up to 50%
of eligible compensation, with a maximum deferral of $50,000 per year. The
Company will match 50% of the portion of the employee’s contributions that does
not exceed 6% of the employee’s salary. The deferred compensation, together
with Company matching contributions and accumulated earnings, is accrued and is
payable after retirement or termination of employment, subject to vesting
provisions. Participants may also elect to receive amounts deferred in a given
year on any plan anniversary five or more years subsequent to the year of
deferral. Matching Company contributions vest over a four year period and
totaled $13,000, $5,000 and $25,000 in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, net
of allowable transfers into the LKQ Corporation Employee’s Retirement Plan. The
deferred compensation plan is funded under a trust agreement whereby the
Company pays to the trust amounts deferred by employees, together with the
Company match, with such amounts invested in life insurance policies carried to
meet the obligations under the deferred compensation plan. The cash surrender
value of these policies was approximately $2.8 million and $1.7 million at December 31,
2005 and 2004, respectively, and is included in Other Assets in the
accompanying balance sheets. Total deferred compensation liabilities were
approximately $2.7 million and $2.1 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004,
respectively, and are included in Accrued payroll-related liabilities and Other
Noncurrent Liabilities in the accompanying balance sheets.

A subsidiary of the Company has a nonqualified
retirement plan that the Company agreed to continue when the subsidiary was
acquired in 1998. The plan is funded by the Company through premium payments on
Company-owned life insurance policies that are carried to meet the obligations
under the plan. The cash surrender value of these policies was approximately
$0.2 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004 and is included in Other Assets
in the accompanying balance sheets. The annual expense for this plan is
approximately $30,000. Total obligations were approximately $0.4 million at December 31,
2005 and 2004, and are included in Other Noncurrent Liabilities in the
accompanying balance sheets.

On February 17, 2004, the Company entered into a
new unsecured revolving credit facility that originally matured in February 2007,
replacing a secured credit facility that would have expired on June 30,
2005. As a result, the Company recorded a loss of approximately $0.3 million in
2004 from the write-off of debt issuance costs related to the previous secured
facility. The new revolving credit facility initially had a maximum
availability of $75.0 million, which was amended to $100.0 million on January 31,
2005. On June 1, 2005, the agreement was further amended to increase the
maximum availability to $135.0 million, extend the maturity date to June 1,
2010 and modify certain other terms. In order to make any borrowing under the
revolving credit facility, after giving effect to such borrowing, the Company
must be in compliance with all of the covenants under the credit facility,
including, without limitation, a senior debt to EBITDA ratio which cannot
exceed 3.00 to 1.00. The revolving credit facility contains customary
covenants, including, among other things, limitations on the payment of cash
dividends; restrictions on the payment of other dividends; restrictions on
purchases, redemptions and acquisitions of the Company’s stock; limitations on
additional indebtedness; certain limitations on acquisitions, mergers and
consolidations; and the maintenance of certain financial ratios. The interest
rate on advances under the revolving credit facility may be either the bank
prime lending rate, on the one hand, or the Interbank Offering Rate (“IBOR”)
plus an additional percentage ranging from .875% to 1.625%, on the other hand,
at the Company’s option. The percentage added to IBOR is dependent upon the
Company’s total funded debt to EBITDA ratio for the trailing four quarters. The
Company was in compliance with all covenants throughout 2005, 2004 and 2003.
The weighted-average interest rate on borrowings outstanding against the
Company’s credit facility at December 31, 2005 and 2004 was 7.25% and
3.16%, respectively. Borrowings

Long-Term Obligations (Continued)

against the credit
facility totaled $38.0 million and $47.0 million at December 31, 2005 and
2004, respectively, and are classified as long-term obligations.

The $38.0 million balance outstanding at December 31,
2005 was converted to an IBOR-based loan at a rate of 5.415% on January 4,
2006.

During August 2002, the Company entered into a
two-year interest rate swap agreement with a total notional amount of $10.0
million and a fixed rate of 2.65%. The agreement matured in August 2004.
The counterparty to the agreement was a member of the Company’s bank group.
Under the terms of the agreement, the Company was required to make quarterly
payments at the specified fixed rate and in return received payments at
variable rates. In accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 133, “Accounting
for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,” as amended, the changes in
the fair value of the interest rate swap were included in current period
earnings, as the agreement had not been designated as a hedging instrument.

During 2004, as part of the consideration for business
acquisitions completed during the year, the Company issued promissory notes
totaling approximately $2.4 million. One of these notes in the amount of $1.0
million is secured by certain real property owned by the Company. The notes
bear interest at annual rates of 3.0% to 5.0%, and interest is payable at
maturity. The Company also assumed certain liabilities in connection with a
business acquisition during the first quarter of 2004, including two bankers
acceptances totaling $1.15 million, which were fully paid during the second
quarter of 2004.

During 2005, as part of
the consideration for business acquisitions completed during the year, the
Company issued promissory notes totaling approximately $6.4 million. The notes
bear interest at annual rates of 3.0% to 3.5%, and interest is payable at
maturity. The Company also assumed certain liabilities in connection with a
business acquisition during the second quarter of 2005, including a promissory
note with a remaining principle balance of approximately $0.2 million. The
annual interest rate on the note is 5.1%.

Note 7. Commitments
and Contingencies

The Company is obligated under noncancelable operating
leases for corporate office space, warehouse and distribution facilities,
trucks and certain equipment.

The future minimum lease
commitments under these leases at December 31, 2005 are as follows (in
thousands):

Rental expense for operating leases was approximately
$12.2 million, $9.6 million and $8.0 million during the years ended December 31,
2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.


LKQ CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 7.

Commitments
and Contingencies (Continued)

The Company guaranties the residual values of the
majority of its truck and equipment operating leases. The residual values
decline over the lease terms to a defined percentage of original cost. In the
event the lessor does not realize the residual value when a piece of equipment
is sold, the Company would be responsible for a portion of the shortfall.
Similarly, if the lessor realizes more than the residual value when a piece of
equipment is sold, the Company would be paid the amount realized over the
residual value. Had the Company terminated all of its operating leases subject
to these guaranties at December 31, 2005, the guarantied residual value
would have totaled approximately $8.9 million.

The Company also has
certain other contingent liabilities resulting from litigation, claims and
other commitments and is subject to a variety of environmental and pollution
control laws and regulations incident to the ordinary course of business.
Management believes that the probable resolution of such contingencies will not
materially affect the financial position, results of operations or cash flows
of the Company.

Business
Combinations

During 2005, the Company acquired a 100% equity
interest in each of eight businesses (four in the recycled OEM products
business and four in the aftermarket products business, including on December 29,
2005 Fit-Rite Body Parts, Inc. (“Fit-Rite”)) for an aggregate of $105.2
million in cash, of which $1.4 million is to be paid subsequent to December 31,
2005, and approximately $6.4 million in notes issued (see Note 6). In addition,
in connection with the Fit-Rite acquisition, the Company is obligated to pay up
to  $9.0 million of contingent payments
based upon the achievement of certain financial results over the thirty months
following the closing of the acquisition. The acquisitions enabled the Company
to serve new market areas and expand its presence in existing areas.

During 2004, the Company acquired a 100% equity
interest in each of six businesses (five in the recycled OEM products business,
including on October 26, 2004 Foster Auto Parts, Inc., and, on February 20,
2004, Global Trade Alliance, Inc., one of the largest suppliers of
aftermarket products in the Midwest) for an aggregate of $61.7 million in cash,
of which $50,000 remains payable at December 31, 2005, approximately $2.4
million in notes issued (see Note 6) and 373,396 shares of the Company’s common
stock. The acquisitions enabled the Company to serve new market areas, become a
significant provider of aftermarket products and become a provider of
self-service retail recycled vehicle products.

During 2003, the Company acquired three recycled OEM
products businesses for an aggregate of $3.3 million in cash, $0.2 million in
notes issued and 100,000 redeemable shares of the Company’s common stock. The
business combinations enabled the Company to serve new market areas.

The acquisitions are being accounted for under the
purchase method of accounting and are included in the Company’s financial
statements from the dates of acquisition. The purchase prices were allocated to
the net assets acquired based upon estimated fair market values at the dates of
acquisition. In connection with the 2005 business acquisitions, the purchase
price allocations are preliminary as the Company is in the process of
determining the following: 1) whether any operations acquired will be closed or
combined with existing operations; 2) valuation amounts for certain of its
inventories acquired; and 3) the final estimation of the tax basis of the
entities acquired. During the year ended December 31, 2005, the Company made
adjustments to the preliminary purchase price allocations to finalize the
inventory valuations and the estimated tax basis for certain of the businesses
acquired in 2004. These adjustments decreased goodwill related to these 2004
acquisitions by $1.4 million to $48.1 million.

assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements.
A valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets if it is more likely
than not that these items will either expire before the Company is able to
realize their benefit, or that future deductibility is uncertain. Income taxes
provided during interim periods are based upon the Company’s anticipated annual
effective income tax rate.

At December 31, 2005 and 2004, the Company had
net operating loss carryforwards for certain of its state tax jurisdictions,
the tax benefits of which total approximately $2.4 million and $2.3 million,
respectively. A valuation allowance has been established for a portion of these
deferred tax assets. The tax benefits expire over the period from 2006 through
2025. While the Company expects to realize the deferred tax assets, net of
valuation allowances, changes in estimates of future taxable income or in tax
laws may alter this expectation.

The Internal Revenue
Service is currently performing an income tax audit for the 2002 and 2003 tax
years. The Company has also been the subject of an income tax audit by one
state for the 2001, 2002 and 2003 tax years. Adjustments from such audits, if

Report of Management on Internal Control Over

Management of LKQ
Corporation and subsidiaries (the “Company”) is responsible for establishing
and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined
in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Company’s internal control over financial
reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States. Internal control over financial reporting
includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company, (ii) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
of the Company, and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition
of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the Company’s
financial statements.

Internal control over financial reporting includes the
controls themselves, monitoring and internal auditing practices and actions
taken to correct deficiencies as identified. Because of its inherent
limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to
future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate
because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the
policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005.
Management based this assessment on criteria for effective internal control
over financial reporting described in

Internal
Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Management’s assessment of the
effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2005 excluded A-Reliable Auto Parts, Inc. and its affiliated companies,
which were acquired by the Company in a purchase transaction on December 6,
2005 (“A-Reliable”) and

Fit-Rite
Body Parts, Inc. and its affiliated companies, which were acquired in a
purchase transaction on December 31, 2005 (“Fit-Rite”). Both A-Reliable
and Fit-Rite are wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company whose combined total
assets and total net sales represented less than 6% of consolidated total
assets and less than 1% of consolidated net sales,


respectively, of the Company as of and for the year
ended December 31, 2005. Under guidelines established by the Securities
and Exchange Commission, companies are allowed to exclude acquisitions from their
assessment of internal control over financial reporting during the first year
of an acquisition while integrating the acquired company.

Management’s
assessment included an evaluation of the design of the Company’s internal
control over financial reporting and testing of the operational effectiveness
of its internal control over financial reporting. Management reviewed the
results of its assessment with the Audit Committee of the Company’s Board of
Directors.

Based on this assessment, management determined that,
as of December 31, 2005, the Company maintained effective internal control
over financial reporting. Deloitte & Touche, LLP, independent
registered public accounting firm, who audited and reported on the consolidated
financial statements of the Company included in this report, has issued an
attestation report on management’s assessment of internal control over
financial reporting.

There was no change in the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the
Company’s most recently completed fiscal quarter that has materially affected,
or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control
over financial reporting.


REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING
FIRM

To the Board of Directors
and Shareholders of LKQ Corporation:

We have audited
management’s assessment, included in the accompanying Report of Management on
Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting, that LKQ Corporation and  subsidiaries (the “Company”) maintained
effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2005, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated
Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission. As described in the Report of Management on Internal
Controls Over Financial Reporting, management excluded from their assessment
the internal control over financial reporting at Fit-Rite Body Parts, Inc.
and its affiliated companies, which were acquired on December 31, 2005
(“Fit-Rite”), and A-Reliable Auto Parts, Inc. and its affiliated companies,
which were acquired on December 6, 2005 (“A-Reliable”), and whose
financial statements reflect total assets and revenues constituting less than 6
and 1 percent, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement
amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2005. Accordingly, our
audit did not include the internal control over financial reporting at Fit-Rite
and A-Reliable. The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining
effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of
the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based
on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an
understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating
effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a
reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting
is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company’s principal
executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar
functions, and effected by the company’s board of directors, management, and
other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable
detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the
assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a
material effect on the financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal
control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or
improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error
or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections
of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial
reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may
become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.


In our opinion, management’s assessment that the
Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2005, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on the criteria
established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Also
in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, based
on the criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated
Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission.

We have also audited, in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States), the consolidated financial statements and financial statement
schedule of LKQ Corporation and subsidiaries as of and for the year ended December 31,
2005 and our report dated March 8, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion
on those financial statements and financial statement schedule.
