PART I

Item 1.
    Business

GENERAL

Starbucks Corporation (together with its subsidiaries,
    “Starbucks” or the “Company”) was formed in
    1985. Starbucks purchases and roasts high-quality whole bean
    coffees and sells them, along with fresh, rich-brewed coffees,
    Italian-style espresso beverages, cold blended beverages, a
    variety of complementary food items, coffee-related accessories
    and equipment, a selection of premium teas and a line of compact
    discs, primarily through Company-operated retail stores.
    Starbucks also sells coffee and tea products and licenses its
    trademark through other channels and, through certain of its
    equity investees, Starbucks produces and sells

ready-to-drink

beverages which include, among others, bottled
    Frappuccino

®

coffee drinks and Starbucks
    DoubleShot

®

espresso drinks, and a line of superpremium ice creams. All
    channels outside the Company-operated retail stores are
    collectively known as “Specialty Operations.” The
    Company’s objective is to establish Starbucks as one of the
    most recognized and respected brands in the world. To achieve
    this goal, the Company plans to continue rapid expansion of its
    retail operations, to grow its Specialty Operations and to
    selectively pursue other opportunities to leverage the Starbucks
    brand through the introduction of new products and the
    development of new channels of distribution. The Company’s
    brand portfolio includes superpremium
    Tazo

SEGMENT
    FINANCIAL INFORMATION

Beginning in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2006, the Company
    increased its reporting segments from two to three to include a
    Global Consumer Products Group (“CPG”) segment in
    addition to the United States and International segments. This
    additional operating segment reflects the culmination of
    internal management realignments in fiscal 2006, and the
    successful development and launch of certain branded products in
    the United States and internationally commencing in fiscal 2005
    and continuing throughout fiscal 2006. Additionally, with the
    100% acquisition of the Company’s operations in Hawaii in
    fiscal 2006 and the shift in internal management of this market
    to the United States, these operations have been moved from the
    International segment into the United States segment. Segment
    information for all prior periods presented has been revised to
    reflect these changes.

The United States and International segments both include
    Company-operated retail stores and certain components of
    Specialty Operations. Specialty operations within the United
    States include licensed retail stores, foodservice accounts and
    other initiatives related to the Company’s core business.
    International specialty operations primarily include retail
    store licensing operations in more than 25 countries and
    foodservice accounts in Canada and the United Kingdom. The CPG
    segment includes the Company’s grocery and warehouse club
    business as well as branded products operations worldwide.
    Information about Starbucks revenues, earnings before income
    taxes, depreciation and amortization, income from equity
    investees, equity method investments, identifiable assets, net
    impairment and disposition losses and capital expenditures by
    segment is included in Note 19 “Segment
    Reporting” to the consolidated financial statements

COMPANY-OPERATED
    RETAIL STORES

The Company’s retail goal is to become the leading retailer
    and brand of coffee in each of its target markets by selling the
    finest quality coffee and related products and by providing each
    customer a unique

Starbucks Experience.

The

Starbucks
    Experience

, or third place after home and work, is built
    upon superior customer service as well as clean and
    well-maintained Company-operated retail stores that reflect the
    personalities of the communities in which they operate, thereby
    building a high degree of customer loyalty. Starbucks strategy
    for expanding its retail business is to increase its market
    share primarily by opening additional stores in existing markets
    and to open stores in new markets where the opportunity exists
    to become the leading specialty coffee retailer. In support of
    this strategy, Starbucks opened 1,040 new Company-operated
    stores during the fiscal year ended October 1, 2006
    (“fiscal 2006”). Starbucks Company-operated retail
    stores, including 11 Seattle’s Best
    Coffee

®

(“SBC”) stores and 4 Hear Music retail stores,
    accounted for 85% of total net revenues during fiscal 2006.

International store data has been
    adjusted for the acquisitions of the Puerto Rico and Hawaii
    operations by reclassifying historical information from Licensed
    stores to Company-operated stores. United States store data was
    also adjusted to align with the Hawaii operations segment change
    by reclassifying historical information from International
    Company-operated stores to the United States.

Starbucks retail stores are typically located in high-traffic,
    high-visibility locations. Because the Company can vary the size
    and format, its stores are located in or near a variety of
    settings, including downtown and suburban retail centers, office
    buildings and university campuses. While the Company selectively
    locates stores in shopping malls, it focuses on locations that
    provide convenient access for both pedestrians and drivers. With
    the flexibility in store size and format, the Company also
    locates retail stores in select rural and off-highway locations
    to serve a broader array of customers outside major metropolitan
    markets and further expand brand awareness. To provide a greater
    degree of access and convenience for nonpedestrian customers,
    the Company has increased development of Drive-Thru retail
    stores. At the end of fiscal 2006, the Company operated
    approximately 1,600 Drive-Thru locations.

All Starbucks stores offer a choice of regular and decaffeinated
    coffee beverages, a broad selection of Italian-style espresso
    beverages, cold blended beverages, iced shaken refreshment
    beverages, a selection of teas and distinctively packaged
    roasted whole bean coffees. Starbucks stores also offer a
    selection of fresh pastries and other food items, sodas, juices,
    bottled water, coffee-making equipment and accessories, a
    selection of compact discs, games and seasonal novelty items.
    Each Starbucks store varies its product mix depending upon the
    size of the store and its location. Larger stores carry a broad
    selection of the Company’s whole bean coffees in various
    sizes and types of packaging, as well as an assortment of coffee
    and espresso-making equipment and accessories such as coffee
    grinders, coffee filters, storage containers, travel tumblers
    and mugs. Smaller Starbucks stores and kiosks typically sell a
    full line of coffee beverages, a limited selection of whole bean
    coffees and a few accessories such as travel tumblers and logo
    mugs. In the United States and in International markets,
    approximately 3,800 stores and 1,300 stores, respectively, carry
    a selection of prepared sandwiches and salads. Starbucks
    continues to expand its food warming program in select markets
    in the United States, with approximately 640 stores as of
    October 1, 2006 providing warm food items including
    breakfast sandwiches.

The Company’s retail sales mix by product type during
    fiscal 2006 was as follows: 77% beverages, 15% food, 3% whole
    bean coffees and 5% coffee-making equipment and other
    merchandise.

SPECIALTY
    OPERATIONS

Specialty Operations strive to develop the Company’s brands
    outside the Company-operated retail store environment through a
    number of channels. Starbucks strategy is to reach customers
    where they work, travel, shop and dine by


STARBUCKS
    CORPORATION, FORM 10-K


establishing relationships with prominent third parties that
    share the Company’s values and commitment to quality. These
    relationships take various forms, including licensing
    arrangements, foodservice accounts and other initiatives related
    to the Company’s core businesses. In certain situations,
    Starbucks has an equity ownership interest in licensee
    operations. During fiscal 2006, specialty revenues (which
    include royalties and fees from licensees, as well as product
    sales derived from Specialty Operations) accounted for 15% of
    total net revenues.

Licensing —
    Retail stores

In its licensed retail store operations, the Company leverages
    the expertise of its local partners and shares Starbucks
    operating and store development experience. Licensee partners
    are typically master concessionaires, which can provide improved
    access to desirable retail space, or prominent retailers with
    in-depth market knowledge and access. As part of these
    arrangements, Starbucks receives license fees and royalties and
    sells coffee, tea, compact discs and related products for resale
    in licensed locations. Employees working in licensed retail
    locations are required to follow Starbucks detailed store
    operating procedures and attend training classes similar to
    those given to employees in Company-operated stores.

During fiscal 2006, 733 new Starbucks licensed retail stores
    were opened in the United States and, as of October 1,
    2006, the Company’s licensees operated 3,168 stores. During
    fiscal 2006, 426 new International licensed stores were opened.
    At October 1, 2006, the Company’s International
    operating segment had a total of 2,170 licensed retail stores.
    Product sales to and royalty and license fee revenues from U.S.
    and International licensed retail stores accounted for 45% of
    specialty revenues in fiscal 2006.

    grocery and warehouse club stores. By the end of fiscal 2006,
    the Company’s coffees and teas were available in
    approximately 31,900 grocery and warehouse club stores, with
    30,000 in the United States and 1,900 in International markets.
    Revenues from this category comprised 24% of specialty revenues
    in fiscal 2006.

Licensing —
    Branded products

The Company has licensed the rights to produce and distribute
    Starbucks branded products to two partnerships in which the
    Company holds 50% equity interests. The North American Coffee
    Partnership with the Pepsi-Cola Company develops and distributes

ready-to-drink

beverages which include, among others, bottled
    Frappuccino

®

coffee drinks and Starbucks
    DoubleShot

®

espresso drinks. The Starbucks Ice Cream Partnership with
    Dreyer’s Grand Ice Cream, Inc., develops and distributes
    superpremium ice creams.

Starbucks and Jim Beam Brands Co., a unit of Fortune Brands,
    Inc., manufacture and market Starbucks-branded premium coffee
    liqueur products in the United States and Canada. The Company
    introduced a coffee liqueur product nationally during the fiscal
    second quarter of 2005, and launched a coffee and cream liqueur
    product in the second quarter of fiscal 2006 in restaurants,
    bars and retail outlets where premium distilled spirits are
    sold. During the fiscal fourth quarter of 2006, the Company
    launched
    Starbucks

tm

Coffee Liqueur and Cream Liqueur in Canada. The Company does not
    and will not sell the liqueur products in its Company-operated
    or licensed retail stores.

In September 2005, the Company launched Starbucks
    Discoveries

tm

,
    a

ready-to-drink

chilled cup coffee beverage in refrigerated cases of convenience
    stores in Japan, through a manufacturing and distribution
    agreement with Suntory Limited, and in Taiwan, through separate
    co-packing and distribution agreements with Uni-President
    Enterprises Corporation and the Company’s equity investee,
    President Starbucks Coffee Taiwan Ltd. In fiscal 2006, the
    Company entered the

ready-to-drink

coffee category in South Korea through a licensing agreement
    with Dong Suh Foods Corporation to import bottled Starbucks
    Frappuccino

®

coffee drinks produced in the United States.

Collectively, the revenues from these branded products accounted
    for 2% of specialty revenues in fiscal 2006.

Foodservice

The Company sells whole bean and ground coffees, including the
    Starbucks, Seattle’s Best Coffee and Torrefazione Italia
    brands, as well as a selection of premium
    Tazo

®

teas, to institutional foodservice companies that service
    business, industry, education and healthcare accounts, office
    coffee distributors, hotels, restaurants, airlines and other
    retailers. The majority of the Company’s direct
    distribution accounts are with SYSCO Corporation’s and
    U.S. Foodservice’s

tm

national broadline distribution networks and Starbucks
    foodservice sales, customer service and support resources are
    aligned with those of SYSCO Corporation and
    U.S. Foodservice. Starbucks and Seattle’s Best Coffee
    are the only superpremium national-brand coffees actively
    promoted by SYSCO Corporation. The Company’s total
    worldwide foodservice operations had approximately 16,200
    accounts at fiscal year end 2006, and revenues from these
    accounts comprised 27% of total specialty revenues.

Other
    Initiatives

Included in this category is the Company’s emerging
    entertainment business, which encompasses multiple music and
    technology based initiatives designed to appeal to new and
    existing Starbucks customers. Among these initiatives are
    strategic marketing and co-branding arrangements, such as the

24-hour

Starbucks Hear
    Music

tm

digital music channel 75 available to all XM Satellite
    Radio subscribers, and the availability of wireless broadband
    Internet service in Company-operated retail stores located in
    the United States and Canada. Additionally, the entertainment
    business includes the innovative partnerships of Starbucks Hear
    Music with other music labels for the production, marketing and
    distribution of both exclusive and nonexclusive music, music
    programming for Starbucks stores worldwide, and CD sales through
    the Company’s website at Starbucks.com/hearmusic. In the
    first quarter of fiscal 2007, Starbucks and
    Apple

announced the availability of the Starbucks Hear Music catalog
    on the
    iTunes

®

Store, giving iTunes users the ability to preview, buy and
    download a wide variety of popular Starbucks Hear

titles.

The Company has a strategic agreement with Chase Bank USA, N.A.
    and Visa to issue the Starbucks Card
    Duetto

tm

Visa

®

(the “Duetto Card”) in the United States, and a
    similar arrangement with Royal Bank of Canada and Visa Canada
    Association to issue the Duetto Card in Canada. The Duetto Card
    is a

first-of-its-kind

card, combining the functionality


STARBUCKS
    CORPORATION, FORM 10-K


of a credit card with the convenience of a reloadable Starbucks
    Card. Through these arrangements, Starbucks primarily receives
    commissions for each activated customer account and payments
    based on credit card usage.

Collectively, the operations of these other initiatives
    accounted for 2% of specialty revenues in fiscal 2006.

PRODUCT
    SUPPLY

Starbucks is committed to selling only the finest whole bean
    coffees and coffee beverages. To ensure compliance with its
    rigorous coffee standards, Starbucks controls its coffee
    purchasing, roasting and packaging, and the distribution of
    coffee used in its operations.

The Company purchases green coffee beans from coffee-producing
    regions around the world and custom roasts them to its exacting
    standards for its many blends and single origin coffees.

The supply and price of coffee are subject to significant
    volatility. Although most coffee trades in the commodity market,
    coffee of the quality sought by the Company tends to trade on a
    negotiated basis at a substantial premium above commodity coffee
    prices, depending upon the supply and demand at the time of
    purchase. Supply and price can be affected by multiple factors
    in the producing countries, including weather, political and
    economic conditions. In addition, green coffee prices have been
    affected in the past, and may be affected in the future, by the
    actions of certain organizations and associations that have
    historically attempted to influence prices of green coffee
    through agreements establishing export quotas or by restricting
    coffee supplies.

The Company depends upon its relationships with coffee
    producers, outside trading companies and exporters for its
    supply of green coffee. With green coffee commodity prices at
    relatively low levels in recent years, the Company has used
    fixed-price purchase commitments in order to secure an adequate
    supply of quality green coffee, bring greater certainty to the
    cost of sales in future periods, and promote sustainability by
    paying a fair price to coffee producers. As of October 1,
    2006, the Company had $546 million in fixed-price purchase
    commitments which, together with existing inventory, is expected
    to provide an adequate supply of green coffee through fiscal
    2007. The Company believes, based on relationships established
    with its suppliers, the risk of non-delivery on such purchase
    commitments is remote. During the first few months of fiscal
    2006, green coffee commodity prices increased moderately. Since
    then, commodity prices have stabilized but still remain above
    the historically low levels experienced in recent years. Based
    on its market experience, the Company believes that fixed-price
    purchase commitments are less likely to be available on
    favorable terms when commodity prices are high. If prices were
    to move higher during fiscal 2007, Starbucks would likely return
    to its previous practice of entering into

price-to-be-fixed

purchase contracts to meet a large part of its demand. These
    types of contracts state the quality, quantity and delivery
    periods but allow the price of green coffee over a market index
    to be established after contract signing. The Company believes
    that, through a combination of fixed-price and

price-to-be-fixed

contracts it will be able to secure an adequate supply of
    quality green coffee. However, an increased use of

price-to-be-fixed

contracts instead of fixed-price contracts would decrease the
    predictability of coffee costs in future periods.

During fiscal 2004, Starbucks established the Starbucks Coffee
    Agronomy Company S.R.L., a wholly owned subsidiary located in
    Costa Rica, to reinforce the Company’s leadership role in
    the coffee industry and to help ensure sustainability and future
    supply of high-quality green coffees from Central America.
    Staffed with agronomists and sustainability experts, this

first-of-its-kind

Farmer Support Center is designed to proactively respond to
    changes in coffee producing countries that impact farmers and
    the supply of green coffee.

In addition to coffee, the Company also purchases significant
    amounts of dairy products to support the needs of its
    Company-operated retail stores. Dairy prices in the United
    States, which closely follow the monthly Class I fluid milk
    base price as calculated by the U.S. Department of
    Agriculture, rose in both fiscal 2004 and 2005, then declined in
    2006. Should prices rise significantly in the future, Starbucks
    profitability could be adversely affected. In the United States,
    the Company purchases substantially all of its fluid milk
    requirements from two dairy suppliers. The Company believes,
    based on relationships established with these suppliers, that
    the risk of non-delivery of enough fluid milk to support its
    U.S. retail business is remote.

STARBUCKS
    CORPORATION, FORM 10-K



The Company also purchases a broad range of paper and plastic
    products, such as cups, lids, napkins, straws, shopping bags and
    corrugated paper boxes from several companies to support the
    needs of its retail stores as well as its manufacturing and
    distribution operations. The cost of these materials is
    dependent in part upon commodity paper and plastic resin costs,
    but the Company believes it mitigates the effect of short-term
    raw material price fluctuations through strategic relationships
    with key suppliers. In the United States, the Company is
    contractually required to purchase all of its cups, lids, straws
    and cutlery from a single supplier. Any material interruption in
    the supply of these products to the Company, if not offset by
    sufficient purchases from other suppliers, could materially
    adversely affect the Company’s supply chain and its ability
    to serve its U.S. retail customers. The Company believes,
    based on its relationship with this supplier, that the risk of
    non-delivery of enough of these products to support its
    U.S. retail business is remote.

Products other than whole bean coffees and coffee beverages sold
    in Starbucks retail stores are obtained through a number of
    different channels. Beverage ingredients, other than coffee and
    milk, including leaf teas and the Company’s menu of

ready-to-drink

beverages, are purchased from several specialty manufacturers,
    usually under long-term supply contracts. Food products, such as
    fresh pastries and lunch items, are generally purchased from
    both regional and local sources. Coffee-making equipment, such
    as drip and French press coffeemakers, espresso machines and
    coffee grinders, are generally purchased directly from their
    manufacturers. Coffee-related accessories, including items
    bearing the Company’s logos and trademarks, are produced
    and distributed through contracts with a number of different
    suppliers.

COMPETITION

The Company’s primary competitors for coffee beverage sales
    are restaurants, specialty coffee shops and doughnut shops. In
    almost all markets in which the Company does business, there are
    numerous competitors in the specialty coffee beverage business,
    and management expects this situation to continue. Although
    competition in the beverage market is currently fragmented,
    competition is increasing, particularly from competitors in the
    quick-service restaurant sector who are focusing on growing the
    specialty coffee part of their business. A major competitor with
    substantially greater financial, marketing and operating
    resources than the Company could enter this market at any time
    and compete directly against Starbucks.

The Company’s whole bean coffees compete directly against
    specialty coffees sold through supermarkets, specialty retailers
    and a growing number of specialty coffee stores. Both the
    Company’s whole bean coffees and its coffee beverages
    compete indirectly against all other coffees on the market. The
    Company believes that its customers choose among retailers
    primarily on the basis of product quality, service and
    convenience, and, to a lesser extent, on price.

Starbucks believes that supermarkets are the most competitive
    distribution channel for specialty whole bean coffee, in part
    because supermarkets offer customers a variety of choices
    without having to make a separate trip to a specialty coffee
    store. A number of coffee manufacturers are distributing premium
    coffee products in supermarkets. Regional specialty coffee
    companies also sell whole bean coffees in supermarkets.

In addition to the competition generated by supermarket sales of
    coffee, Starbucks competes for whole bean coffee sales with
    franchise operators and independent specialty coffee stores. In
    virtually every major metropolitan area where Starbucks operates
    and expects to expand, there are local or regional competitors
    with substantial market presence in the specialty coffee
    business. Starbucks Specialty Operations also face significant
    competition from established wholesale and mail order suppliers,
    some of whom have greater financial and marketing resources than
    the Company.

Starbucks faces intense competition from both restaurants and
    other specialty retailers for suitable sites for new stores and
    qualified personnel to operate both new and existing stores.
    There can be no assurance that Starbucks will be able to
    continue to secure adequate sites at acceptable rent levels or
    that the Company will be able to attract a sufficient number of
    qualified personnel.

    “Starbucks.com” and “Starbucks.net.”

RESEARCH
    AND DEVELOPMENT

Starbucks research and development efforts are led by food
    scientists, engineers, chemists and culinarians in the Research
    and Development department. This team is responsible for the
    technical development of food and beverage products and new
    equipment. The Company spent approximately $6.5 million,
    $6.2 million and $4.7 million during fiscal 2006, 2005
    and 2004, respectively, on technical research and development
    activities, in addition to customary product testing and product
    and process improvements in all areas of its business.

SEASONALITY
    AND QUARTERLY RESULTS

Starbucks business is subject to seasonal fluctuations.
    Significant portions of the Company’s net revenues and
    profits are realized during the first quarter of the fiscal
    year, which includes the holiday season. In addition, quarterly
    results are affected by the timing of the opening of new stores,
    and the Company’s rapid growth may conceal the impact of
    other seasonal influences. Because of the seasonality of the
    business, results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative
    of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year.

EMPLOYEES

As of October 1, 2006, the Company employed approximately
    145,800 people worldwide. In the United States, Starbucks
    employed approximately 123,600 people, with 116,100 in
    Company-operated retail stores and the remainder in the
    Company’s administrative and regional offices, and store
    development, roasting and warehousing operations. Approximately
    22,200 employees were employed in International, with 21,200 in
    Company-operated retail stores and the remainder in the
    Company’s regional support facilities and roasting and
    warehousing operations. At fiscal year end, employees at nine of
    the Company’s Canadian stores were represented by a union.
    Starbucks believes its current relations with its employees are
    good.

Starbucks demonstrates its commitment to corporate social
    responsibility (“CSR”) by conducting its business in
    ways that produce social, environmental and economic benefits to
    the communities in which Starbucks operates. The Company aligns
    its principles for social responsibility with its overall
    strategy and business operations. As a result, Starbucks
    believes it delivers benefits to the Company and its
    stakeholders — partners, customers, suppliers,
    shareholders, community members and others — while
    distinguishing Starbucks as a leader within the coffee industry.
    Providing open communication and transparency helps the Company
    be accountable to its stakeholders. To support this goal,
    Starbucks publishes a CSR Annual Report. Starbucks fiscal 2006

Item 1A. Risk
    Factors

This Annual Report on

Form 10-K

includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the
    Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These
    forward-looking statements generally are identified by words
    such as “believe”, “expect”,
    “anticipate”, “estimate”,
    “intend”, “strategy”, “may”,
    “will likely” and similar words or phrases. A
    forward-looking statement is neither a prediction nor a
    guarantee of future events or circumstances, and those future
    events or circumstances may not occur. Investors should not
    place undue reliance on the forward-looking statements, which
    speak only as of the date of this Report. Starbucks is under no
    obligation to update or alter any forward-looking statements,
    whether as a result of new information, future events or
    otherwise. These forward-looking statements are all based on
    currently available operating, financial and competitive
    information and are subject to various risks and uncertainties.
    The Company’s actual future results and trends may differ
    materially depending on a variety of factors including, but not
    limited to, the risks and uncertainties discussed below. The
    risks below are not the only ones the Company faces. Additional
    risks and risks that management currently considers immaterial
    may also have an adverse effect on the Company.

• A
    regional or global health pandemic could severely affect
    Starbucks business.

A health pandemic is a disease that spreads rapidly and widely
    by infection and affects many individuals in an area or
    population at the same time. If a regional or global health
    pandemic were to occur, depending upon its duration and
    severity, the Company’s business could be severely
    affected. Starbucks has positioned itself as a “third
    place” between home and work where people can gather
    together for human connection. Customers might avoid public
    gathering places in the event of a health pandemic, and local,
    regional or national governments might limit or ban public
    gatherings to halt or delay the spread of disease. A regional or
    global health pandemic might also adversely impact the
    Company’s business by disrupting or delaying production and
    delivery of materials and products in its supply chain and by
    causing staffing shortages in its stores. The impact of a health
    pandemic on Starbucks might be disproportionately greater than
    on other companies that depend less on the gathering of people
    together for the sale, use or license of their products and
    services.

• Market
    expectations for Starbucks financial performance are
    high.

Management believes the price of Starbucks stock reflects high
    market expectations for its future operating results. In
    particular, any failure to meet the market’s high
    expectations for Starbucks comparable store sales growth rates,
    earnings per share and new store openings could cause the market
    price of Starbucks stock to drop rapidly and sharply.

•

Starbucks
    is subject to a number of significant risks that might cause the
    Company’s actual results to vary materially from its
    forecasts, targets, or projections, including:

•

declines in actual or estimated comparable store sales growth
    rates and expectations;

•

failing to meet annual targets for store openings, as a result
    of delays in store openings or failing to identify and secure
    sufficient real estate locations;

•

negative trends in operating expenses or failing to continue to
    increase net revenues and operating income in any or all of
    Starbucks United States, International and CPG operating
    segments;

•

failing to penetrate and expand into emerging International
    markets, such as China;

•

opening less productive stores and cannibalizing existing stores
    with new stores;

•

higher costs associated with maintaining and refurbishing the
    Company’s existing base of Company-operated retail stores;


STARBUCKS
    CORPORATION, FORM 10-K


•

failing to anticipate, appropriately invest in and effectively
    manage the human, information technology and logistical
    resources necessary to support the growth of its business,
    including managing the costs associated with such resources;

•

failing to integrate, leverage and generate expected rates of
    return on investments, including expansion of existing
    businesses and expansion through domestic and foreign
    acquisitions;

•

failing to generate sufficient future positive operating cash
    flows and, if necessary, secure adequate external financing to
    fund its growth;

•

declines in general consumer demand for specialty coffee
    products;

•

failing to meet customer demand efficiently during peak periods;

•

lack of customer acceptance of new products;

•

lack of customer acceptance of Starbucks products in new markets;

•

failing to consistently provide high quality products and
    innovate new products and business processes to retain the
    Company’s existing customer base and attract new customers;

•

increases in the price of high quality

arabica

coffee,
    dairy products, fuel, energy or other consumables, and the
    Company’s inability to obtain a sufficient supply of such
    commodities and consumables as its business grows;

•

failing to manage the impact of any adverse publicity regarding
    the Company’s business practices or the health effects of
    consuming its products;

•

increased labor costs, including significant increases in health
    care benefits and worker’s compensation insurance costs;

•

litigation against Starbucks, particularly any class action
    litigation;

•

unfavorable general economic conditions in the markets in which
    Starbucks operates, including, but not limited to, changes in
    interest rates, unemployment rates, disposable income and other
    events or factors that adversely affect consumer spending;

•

unanticipated changes in executive management;

•

any material interruption in the Company’s supply chain,
    such as material interruption of roasted coffee supply due to
    the casualty loss of any of the Company’s roasting plants,
    or material interruption in the supply of fluid milk or paper
    and plastic products such as cups, lids, napkins, straws,
    shopping bags and corrugated paper boxes, in each case due to
    the inability of one or more key suppliers to fulfill the
    Company’s requirements;

•

the impact of initiatives by competitors and increased
    competition generally;

•

failing to manage the impact on Starbucks business of factors
    such as labor discord, war, terrorism, political instability in
    certain markets and natural disasters; and

•

interruptions in service by common carriers that ship goods
    within the Company’s distribution channels.

• The
    Company’s success depends substantially on the value of the
    Starbucks brand.

Starbucks believes it has built an excellent reputation globally
    for the quality of its products, for delivery of a consistently
    positive consumer experience and for its corporate social
    responsibility programs. The Starbucks brand has been highly
    rated in several global brand value studies. Management believes
    it must preserve and grow the value of the Starbucks brand to be
    successful in the future, particularly outside of North America,
    where the Starbucks brand is less well known. Brand value is
    based in part on consumer perceptions as to a variety of
    subjective qualities, and can be damaged badly even by isolated
    business incidents that degrade consumer trust, particularly if
    the incidents receive considerable publicity or result in
    litigation. Consumer demand for the Company’s products and
    its brand equity could diminish significantly if

STARBUCKS
    CORPORATION, FORM 10-K



Starbucks fails to preserve the quality of its products, is
    perceived to act in an unethical or socially irresponsible
    manner or fails to deliver a consistently positive consumer
    experience in each of its markets.

• Starbucks
    is highly dependent on the financial performance of its United
    States operating segment.

The Company’s financial performance is highly dependent on
    its United States operating segment, which comprised 79% of
    consolidated total net revenues in fiscal 2006. Any substantial
    or sustained decline in these operations, if not offset by
    increased financial performance elsewhere, could materially
    adversely affect the Company’s business and financial
    results.

• Starbucks
    is increasingly dependent on the success of its International
    operating segment in order to achieve its growth
    targets.

The Company’s future growth depends increasingly on the
    growth and operations of its International operating segment.
    Some or all of the Company’s International market business
    units (“MBUs”), which Starbucks generally defines by
    the countries or regions in which they operate, may not be
    successful in their operations or in achieving expected growth.
    Starbucks may find business partners who do not share its
    cultural, marketing or operating philosophies or who are unable
    to operate the MBU profitably. Some factors that will be
    critical to the success of International MBUs are different than
    those affecting the Company’s U.S. stores and
    licensees. Tastes naturally vary by region, and consumers in new
    international markets into which Starbucks and its licensees
    expand may not embrace Starbucks products to the same extent as
    consumers in the Company’s existing markets. Occupancy
    costs and store operating expenses are also sometimes higher
    internationally than in the United States due to higher rents
    for prime store locations or costs of compliance with
    country-specific regulatory requirements. Because many of the
    Company’s International operations are in an early phase of
    development, operating expenses as a percentage of related
    revenues are often higher, compared to U.S. operations. The
    Company’s International operations are also subject to
    additional inherent risks of conducting business abroad, such as:

•

foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations;

•

changes or uncertainties in economic, social and political
    conditions in the Company’s markets;

•

interpretation and application of laws and regulations;

•

restrictive actions of foreign or United States governmental
    authorities affecting trade and foreign investment, including
    protective measures such as export and customs duties and
    tariffs and restrictions on the level of foreign ownership;

•

import or other business licensing requirements;

•

the enforceability of intellectual property and contract rights;

•

limitations on the repatriation of funds and foreign currency
    exchange restrictions;

•

lower levels of consumer spending on a

per capita

basis
    than in the United States;

•

difficulty in staffing, developing and managing foreign
    operations due to distance, language and cultural
    differences; and

•

local laws that make it more expensive and complex to negotiate
    with, retain or terminate employees.

•

The China
    market is important to the Company’s long-term growth
    prospects — doing business there and in other
    developing countries can be challenging.

Starbucks expects the People’s Republic of China to be its
    largest market outside of the United States. Any significant or
    prolonged deterioration in

U.S.-China

relations might adversely affect the Company’s China
    business. The Company’s growing investments in its China
    operations will increase the Company’s exposure in this
    market.


STARBUCKS
    CORPORATION, FORM 10-K


Many of the risks and uncertainties of doing business in China
    are solely within the control of the Chinese government.
    China’s government regulates the business conducted by
    Starbucks through its subsidiaries, joint ventures and
    authorized licensees by restricting the scope of the
    Company’s foreign investments within China and the food and
    beverage, retail, wholesale and distribution business conducted
    within China. Although management believes it has structured the
    Company’s China operations to comply with local laws, there
    are substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation and
    application of laws and regulations and the enforceability of
    intellectual property and contract rights in China. If
    China’s governmental authorities were ultimately to
    conclude that Starbucks has not complied with one or more
    existing or future laws or regulations, or if their
    interpretations of those laws or regulations were to change over
    time, the Company’s affiliates could be subject to fines
    and other financial penalties or forced to cease operations
    entirely. Moreover, it could adversely affect the Company’s
    business if it is unable to enforce its intellectual property
    and contract rights in China’s courts.

Additionally, Starbucks plans to enter selected markets in other
    developing countries (such as Russia and India) as an important
    part of the projected growth of the International operating
    segment. Some of those markets pose legal and business
    challenges similar to the China market, such as substantial
    uncertainty regarding the interpretation and application of laws
    and regulations and the enforceability of intellectual property
    and contract rights.

• Effectively
    managing the Company’s rapid growth is
    challenging.

The Company’s long-term goal is to open approximately
    20,000 Starbucks stores in the United States and at least 20,000
    stores in International markets. Starbucks expects annual total
    net revenue growth of approximately 20% and annual earnings per
    share growth of approximately

20-25%

for
    the next three to five year period. Effectively managing growth
    on this scale is challenging, particularly as Starbucks expands
    into new markets internationally, and it becomes increasingly
    difficult to ensure a consistent supply of high quality raw
    materials, to hire sufficient numbers of key employees to meet
    the Company’s growth targets, to maintain an effective
    system of internal controls for a globally dispersed enterprise
    and to train employees worldwide to deliver a consistently high
    quality product and customer experience. Achieving the
    Company’s growth targets is also dependent on its ability
    to open more new stores in the current year as well as future
    years than it opened in prior years.

•

The loss
    of key personnel or difficulties recruiting and retaining
    qualified personnel could jeopardize the Company’s ability
    to meet its growth targets.

The success of the Company’s efforts to grow its business
    depends on the contributions and abilities of key executive and
    operating officers and other personnel. Starbucks must continue
    to recruit, retain and motivate management and operating
    personnel sufficient to maintain its current business and
    support its projected growth. A shortage or loss of these key
    employees might jeopardize the Company’s ability to meet
    its growth targets.

• Starbucks
    faces intense competition in the specialty coffee
    market.

There are numerous competitors in almost every market in which
    Starbucks operates and in which it expects to expand in both the
    specialty coffee beverage business and the specialty whole bean
    coffee business. This is especially true in the major
    metropolitan areas where Starbucks operates and expects to
    expand, in virtually all of which there are local or regional
    competitors with substantial collective market presence.
    Although competition in the specialty coffee beverage market is
    currently fragmented, competition is increasing, particularly
    from competitors in the quick-service restaurant sector who are
    focusing on growing the specialty coffee beverage part of their
    businesses. A major competitor with substantially greater
    financial, marketing and operating resources than Starbucks
    could enter this market at any time and compete directly against
    Starbucks. The Company’s whole bean coffees compete
    directly against specialty coffees sold through supermarkets,
    specialty retailers and a growing number of specialty coffee
    stores. Some of the Company’s competitors in these whole
    bean specialty coffee distribution channels have greater
    financial and marketing resources than Starbucks. Both the
    Company’s whole bean coffees and its coffee beverages
    compete indirectly against all other coffees on the market.
    Starbucks also faces well-established competitors in many
    international markets. If Starbucks fails to maintain

STARBUCKS
    CORPORATION, FORM 10-K



and build market share in the specialty coffee market and the
    coffee market generally, it could harm the Company’s
    business and financial results.

• Adverse
    public or medical opinions about the health effects of consuming
    the Company’s products could harm its business.

Some of the Company’s products contain caffeine, dairy
    products, sugar and other active compounds, the health effects
    of which are the subject of increasing public scrutiny,
    including the suggestion that excessive consumption of caffeine,
    dairy products, sugar and other active compounds can lead to a
    variety of adverse health effects. There has also been greater
    public awareness that sedentary lifestyles, combined with
    excessive consumption of high-calorie foods, have led to a
    rapidly rising rate of obesity. Particularly in the United
    States, there is increasing consumer awareness of health risks,
    including obesity, due in part to increasing publicity and
    attention from health organizations, as well as increased
    consumer litigation based on alleged adverse health impacts of
    consumption of various food products. While Starbucks has a
    variety of beverage and food items that are low in caffeine and
    calories, an unfavorable report on the health effects of
    caffeine or other compounds present in the Company’s
    products, or negative publicity or litigation arising from other
    health risks such as obesity, could significantly reduce the
    demand for the Company’s beverages and food products.

•

Significant
    increases in the market price or decreases in availability of
    high quality arabica coffee could harm the Company’s
    business and financial results.

The supply and price of coffee are subject to significant
    volatility. Although most coffee trades in the commodity market,
    high-altitude

arabica

coffee of the quality sought by
    Starbucks tends to trade on a negotiated basis at a substantial
    premium above commodity coffee prices, depending on the supply
    and demand at the time of purchase. Supply and price can be
    affected by multiple factors in the producing countries,
    including weather, political and economic conditions. In
    addition, green coffee prices have been affected in the past,
    and may be affected in the future, by the actions of certain
    organizations and associations that have historically attempted
    to influence prices of green coffee through agreements
    establishing export quotas or restricting coffee supplies. Any
    significant increase in the market price or any significant
    decrease in the availability of high quality

arabica

coffee could adversely affect the Company’s business
    and financial results. Starbucks also purchases large quantities
    of dairy products — particularly milk. Any significant
    increase in the market price or decrease in availability of
    dairy products could harm the Company’s business and
    financial results.

• Failure
    of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting
    could harm its business and financial results.

The management of Starbucks is responsible for establishing and
    maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting.
    Internal control over financial reporting is a process to
    provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
    financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
    America. Internal control over financial reporting includes
    maintaining records that in reasonable detail accurately and
    fairly reflect the Company’s transactions; providing
    reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary
    for preparation of the financial statements; providing
    reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures are made in
    accordance with management authorization; and providing
    reasonable assurance that unauthorized acquisition, use or
    disposition of the Company assets that could have a material
    effect on the financial statements would be prevented or
    detected on a timely basis. Because of its inherent limitations,
    internal control over financial reporting is not intended to
    provide absolute assurance that a misstatement of the
    Company’s financial statements would be prevented or
    detected. The Company’s rapid growth and entry into new,
    globally dispersed markets will place significant additional
    pressure on the Company’s system of internal control over
    financial reporting. Any failure to maintain an effective system
    of internal control over financial reporting could limit the
    Company’s ability to report its financial results
    accurately and timely or to detect and prevent fraud.

Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results

of Operations

GENERAL

Starbucks Corporation’s fiscal year ends on the Sunday
    closest to September 30. The fiscal years ended on
    October 1, 2006 and October 2, 2005, included
    52 weeks. The fiscal year ended October 3, 2004,
    included 53 weeks, with the 53rd week falling in the
    fiscal fourth quarter.

MANAGEMENT
    OVERVIEW

During the fiscal year ended October 1, 2006, the
    Company’s focus on execution in all areas of its business,
    from U.S. and International Company-operated retail operations
    to the Company’s specialty businesses, delivered strong
    financial performance. Management believes that its ability to
    achieve the balance between growing the core business and
    building the foundation for future growth is the key to
    increasing long-term shareholder value. Starbucks fiscal 2006
    performance reflects the Company’s continuing commitment to
    achieving this balance.

The primary driver of the Company’s revenue growth
    continues to be the opening of new retail stores, both
    Company-operated and licensed, in pursuit of the Company’s
    objective to establish Starbucks as one of the most recognized
    and respected brands in the world. Starbucks opened 2,199 new
    stores in fiscal 2006 and plans to open approximately 2,400 in
    fiscal 2007. With a presence in 37 countries, serving customers
    more than 40 million times per week, management

STARBUCKS
    CORPORATION, FORM 10-K



continues to believe that the Company’s long-term goal of
    approximately 20,000 Starbucks retail locations throughout the
    United States and at least 20,000 stores in International
    markets is achievable.

In addition to opening new retail stores, Starbucks works to
    increase revenues generated at new and existing Company-operated
    stores by attracting new customers and increasing the frequency
    of visits by current customers. The strategy is to increase
    comparable store sales by continuously improving the level of
    customer service, introducing innovative products and improving
    speed with service through training, technology and process
    improvement.

Global comparable store sales for Company-operated markets
    increased by 7%, making fiscal 2006 the 15th consecutive
    year with comparable store sales growth of 5% or greater.
    Comparable store sales growth for fiscal 2007 is expected to be
    in the range of 3% to 7%.

In licensed retail operations, Starbucks shares operating and
    store development experience to help licensees improve the
    profitability of existing stores and build new stores.
    Internationally, the Company’s strategy is to selectively
    increase its equity stake in licensed international operations
    as these markets develop. In January 2006, the Company increased
    its equity ownership from 5% to 100% in its operations in Hawaii
    and Puerto Rico, and subsequent to the end of fiscal 2006
    purchased a 90% stake in its previously-licensed operations in
    Beijing, China.

The combination of more retail stores, comparable store sales
    growth of 7% and growth in other business channels in the U.S.,
    International, and CPG operating segments resulted in a 22%
    increase in total net revenues for fiscal 2006, compared to
    fiscal 2005. The Company expects revenue growth of approximately
    20% in fiscal 2007, consistent with its three to five year
    revenue growth target.

Operating income as a percentage of total net revenues decreased
    to 11.5% in fiscal 2006 from 12.3% in fiscal 2005, due to the
    recognition of stock-based compensation. Net earnings increased
    by 14% in fiscal 2006, compared to fiscal 2005. Reported
    operating margin and net earnings include the effects of
    stock-based compensation in fiscal 2006, while stock-based
    compensation expense was not included in the Company’s
    consolidated financial results in fiscal 2005.

ACQUISITIONS

In January 2006, Starbucks increased its equity ownership to
    100% in its operations in Hawaii and Puerto Rico and applied the
    consolidation method of accounting from the acquisition date.
    Previously the Company owned 5% of both Coffee Partners Hawaii
    and Café del Caribe in Puerto Rico. Because Coffee Partners
    Hawaii was a general partnership, the equity method of
    accounting was previously applied. Retroactive application of
    the equity method of accounting for the Puerto Rico investment,
    which was previously accounted for under the cost method,
    resulted in a reduction of retained earnings of
    $0.5 million as of April 2, 2006. The cumulative
    effect of the accounting change for financial results previously
    reported under the cost method and as restated in this report
    under the equity method reduced net earnings by $97 thousand for
    the fiscal year ended October 2, 2005 and $93 thousand for
    the fiscal year ended October 2, 2004. Previously reported
    earnings per share amounts were not impacted.

On October 18, 2006, the Company acquired 90% equity
    ownership of the licensed operations of 61 Starbucks retail
    stores in Beijing and Tianjin, China (See Note 20
    “Subsequent Event”).

CONSOLIDATED
    RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Net revenues for the fiscal year ended 2006 increased 22% to
    $7.8 billion from $6.4 billion for fiscal 2005, driven
    by increases in both Company-operated retail revenues and
    specialty operations. Net revenues are expected to grow
    approximately 20% in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006.

During the fiscal year ended 2006, Starbucks derived 85% of
    total net revenues from its Company-operated retail stores.
    Company-operated retail revenues increased 22% to
    $6.6 billion for the fiscal year ended 2006, from
    $5.4 billion for fiscal 2005. This increase was primarily
    due to the opening of 1,040 new Company-operated retail stores
    in the last 12 months and comparable store sales growth of
    7% in fiscal 2006. The increase in comparable store sales was
    due to a 5% increase in the number of customer transactions and
    a 2% increase in the average value per transaction. Management
    believes increased customer traffic continues to be driven by
    sustained popularity of core products, new product innovation
    and a high level of customer satisfaction.

STARBUCKS
    CORPORATION, FORM 10-K



The Company derived the remaining 15% of total net revenues from
    channels outside the Company-operated retail stores,
    collectively known as “Specialty Operations.”
    Specialty revenues, which include licensing revenues and
    foodservice and other revenues, increased 23% to
    $1.2 billion for the fiscal year ended 2006, from
    $977 million for fiscal 2005.

Licensing revenues, which are derived from retail store
    licensing arrangements, as well as grocery, warehouse club and
    certain other branded product operations, increased 28% to
    $861 million for fiscal 2006, from $673 million for
    fiscal 2005. The increase is primarily due to higher product
    sales and royalty revenues from the opening of 1,159 new
    licensed retail stores in the last 12 months and, to a
    lesser extent, growth in the licensed grocery and warehouse club
    business.

Foodservice and other revenues increased 13% to
    $343 million for fiscal 2006, from $304 million for
    fiscal 2005. Foodservice and other revenues increased primarily
    due to growth in new and existing U.S. foodservice accounts.

Cost of sales including occupancy costs decreased slightly to
    40.8% of total net revenues for fiscal 2006, from 40.9% in
    fiscal 2005. The decrease was primarily due to fixed rent costs
    in fiscal 2006 being distributed over an expanded revenue base,
    as well as increased occupancy costs in fiscal 2005 resulting
    from intensified store maintenance activities. These favorable
    items, combined with lower dairy costs, offset higher green
    coffee costs for fiscal 2006.

Store operating expenses as a percentage of Company-operated
    retail revenues increased to 40.8% for fiscal 2006 from 40.2%
    for fiscal 2005. The increase was due to the recognition of
    stock-based compensation expense and to higher provisions for
    incentive compensation.

Other operating expenses, which are expenses associated with the
    Company’s Specialty Operations, increased to 21.6% of
    specialty revenues in fiscal 2006, compared to 20.2% in fiscal
    2005. The increase was primarily due to the recognition of
    stock-based compensation expense as well as higher
    payroll-related expenditures to support the expanding licensed
    store operations, both in the U.S. and in existing and new
    international markets.

Depreciation and amortization expenses increased to
    $387 million in fiscal 2006, from $340 million in
    fiscal 2005. The increase of $47 million was due to the
    opening of 1,040 new Company-operated retail stores in the last
    12 months. As a percentage of total net revenues,
    depreciation and amortization decreased to 5.0% for fiscal 2006,
    from 5.3% for fiscal 2005.

General and administrative expenses increased to
    $473 million in fiscal 2006, compared to $357 million
    in fiscal 2005. The increase was due to higher payroll-related
    expenditures from the recognition of stock-based compensation
    expense, additional employees to support continued global
    growth, and higher professional fees in support of global
    systems infrastructure development. As a percentage of total net
    revenues, general and administrative expenses increased to 6.1%
    for fiscal 2006, from 5.6% for fiscal 2005.

Income from equity investees increased to $94 million in
    fiscal 2006, compared to $77 million in fiscal 2005. The
    increase was primarily due to favorable volume-driven operating
    results for The North American Coffee Partnership, which
    produces

ready-to-drink

beverages which include, among others, bottled
    Frappuccino

®

coffee drinks and Starbucks
    DoubleShot

®

espresso drinks, as well as improved operating results from
    international investees, including Korea and Japan, mainly as a
    result of new store openings.

Operating income increased 15% to $894 million in fiscal
    2006, from $781 million in fiscal 2005. The operating
    margin decreased to 11.5% of total net revenues in fiscal 2006,
    compared to 12.3% in fiscal 2005, due to the recognition of
    stock-based compensation expense.

Net interest and other income, which primarily consists of
    interest income, decreased to $12 million in fiscal 2006,
    from $16 million in fiscal 2005. The decrease was primarily
    due to higher interest expense on the Company’s revolving
    credit facility, as well as lower interest income earned due to
    lower average investment balances, offset in part by the
    recognition of $4.4 million of income on unredeemed stored
    value card balances in fiscal 2006. There was no income
    recognized on unredeemed stored value card balances in fiscal
    2005.

Income taxes for fiscal 2006 resulted in an effective tax rate
    of 35.8%, compared to 37.9% in fiscal 2005. The decline in the
    effective tax rate was due to the reversal of a valuation
    allowance in fiscal 2006 that had been established in fiscal
    2005,


STARBUCKS
    CORPORATION, FORM 10-K


the settlement in the third quarter of fiscal 2006 of a
    multi-year income tax audit in a foreign jurisdiction for which
    the Company had established a contingent liability, and to
    increased effectiveness of the Company’s long-term tax
    planning strategies. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2007 is
    expected to be approximately 38%, with quarterly variations.

OPERATING
    SEGMENTS

Segment information is prepared on the same basis that the
    Company’s management reviews financial information for
    operational decision-making purposes. Beginning in the fiscal
    fourth quarter of 2006, the Company increased its reporting
    segments from two to three to include a Global CPG segment in
    addition to the United States and International segments. This
    additional operating segment reflects the culmination of
    internal management realignments in fiscal 2006, and the
    successful development and launch of certain branded products in
    the United States and internationally commencing in fiscal 2005
    and continuing throughout fiscal 2006. Additionally, with the
    100% acquisition of the Company’s operations in Hawaii in
    fiscal 2006 and the shift in internal management of this market
    to the United States, these operations have been moved from the
    International segment into the United States segment. Segment
    information for all prior periods presented has been revised to
    reflect these changes.

The Company’s United States operations (“United
    States”) represent 83% of Company-operated retail revenues,
    57% of total specialty revenues and 79% of total net revenues.
    United States operations sell coffee and other beverages, whole
    bean coffees, complementary food, coffee brewing equipment and
    merchandise primarily through Company-operated retail stores.
    Specialty Operations within the United States include licensed
    retail stores, foodservice accounts and other initiatives
    related to the Company’s core business.


STARBUCKS

United States total net revenues increased 21% to
    $6.2 billion for the fiscal year ended 2006, compared to
    $5.1 billion for fiscal 2005.

United States Company-operated retail revenues increased 21% to
    $5.5 billion for the fiscal year ended 2006, compared to
    $4.5 billion for fiscal 2005. United States
    Company-operated retail revenues increased primarily due to the
    opening of 810 new Company-operated retail stores in the last
    12 months and comparable store sales growth of 7% for
    fiscal 2006. The increase in comparable store sales was due to a
    5% increase in the average value per transaction and a 2%
    increase in the number of customer transactions. Management
    believes increased customer traffic continues to be driven by
    new product innovation, continued popularity of core products
    and a high level of customer satisfaction.

Total United States specialty revenues increased 22% to
    $683 million for the fiscal year ended 2006, compared to
    $558 million in fiscal 2005. United States licensing
    revenues increased 33% to $369 million, compared to
    $278 million for fiscal 2005. United States licensing
    revenues increased due to increased product sales and royalty
    revenues as a result of opening 733 new licensed retail stores
    in the last 12 months. Foodservice and other revenues
    increased 12% to $314 million from $280 million for
    fiscal 2005. United States foodservice and other revenues
    increased primarily due to growth in new and existing
    foodservice accounts.

United States operating income increased 17% to
    $955 million for the fiscal year ended 2006, from
    $819 million for the fiscal year ended 2005. Operating
    margin decreased to 15.5% of related revenues from 16.1% in
    fiscal 2005. The decrease was due to the recognition of
    stock-based compensation expense.

International

The Company’s International operations
    (“International”) represent the remaining 17% of
    Company-operated retail revenues and 18% of total specialty
    revenues as well as 17% of total net revenues. International
    operations sell coffee and other beverages, whole bean coffees,
    complementary food, coffee brewing equipment and merchandise
    through Company-operated retail stores in the United Kingdom,
    Canada, Thailand, Australia, Germany, China, Singapore, Puerto
    Rico, Chile and Ireland. Specialty Operations in International
    primarily include retail store licensing operations in more than
    25 countries and foodservice accounts in Canada and the United
    Kingdom. The Company’s International store base continues
    to increase rapidly and Starbucks is achieving a growing
    contribution from established areas of the business while at the
    same time investing in emerging markets and channels, such as
    China. The Company’s International operations are in
    various early stages of development that require a more
    extensive support organization, relative to the current levels
    of revenue and operating income, than in the United States. This
    continuing investment is part of the Company’s long-term,
    balanced plan for profitable growth.

International total net revenues increased 27% to
    $1.3 billion for the fiscal year ended 2006, compared to
    $1.0 billion for fiscal 2005. International
    Company-operated retail revenues increased 28% to
    $1.1 billion for the fiscal year ended 2006, compared to
    $852 million for fiscal 2005. International
    Company-operated revenues increased due to the opening of 230
    new Company-operated retail stores in the last 12 months,
    comparable store sales growth of 8% for fiscal 2006, and the
    weakening of the U.S. dollar against the Canadian dollar.
    The increase in comparable store sales resulted from a 5%
    increase in the number of customer transactions and a 3%
    increase in the average value per transaction.

Total International specialty revenues increased 26% to
    $215 million for the fiscal year ended 2006, compared to
    $170 million for fiscal 2005. International licensing
    revenues increased 28% to $186 million for the fiscal year
    ended 2006, compared to $146 million in fiscal 2005.
    International licensing revenues increased due to higher product
    sales and royalty revenues from opening 426 new licensed retail
    stores in the last 12 months. International foodservice and
    other revenues increased 19% to $29 million for the fiscal
    year ended 2006, compared to $24 million in fiscal 2005.
    International foodservice and other revenues increased primarily
    due to growth in the total number of foodservice accounts.

International operating income increased to $108 million
    for the fiscal year ended 2006, compared to $82 million in
    fiscal 2005. Operating margin increased to 8.3% of related
    revenues from 8.0% in fiscal 2005, primarily due to lower cost
    of sales including occupancy costs due to leverage gained from
    fixed costs distributed over an expanded revenue base, as

STARBUCKS
    CORPORATION, FORM 10-K



well as lower dairy costs. These improvements were partially
    offset by higher store operating expenses and other operating
    expenses due to higher payroll-related expenditures primarily to
    support global expansion as well as the recognition of
    stock-based compensation expense.

Global
    Consumer Products Group

The Company’s CPG segment represents 25% of total specialty
    revenues and 4% of total net revenues. CPG operations sell a
    selection of whole bean and ground coffees as well as a
    selection of premium
    Tazo

®

teas through licensing arrangements with Kraft and other grocery
    and warehouse club stores in United States and international
    markets. CPG operations also produce and sell

ready-to-drink

beverages which include, among others, bottled
    Frappuccino

®

coffee drinks and Starbucks
    DoubleShot

®

espresso drinks, and
    Starbucks

®

superpremium ice creams, through its joint venture partnerships,
    and
    Starbucks

tm

Coffee and Cream Liqueurs through a marketing and distribution
    agreement. Through other manufacturing, distribution and
    co-packing agreements, the Company produces and sells

ready-to-drink

products in international locations.

CPG total net revenues increased 23% to $305 million for
    the fiscal year ended 2006, compared to $249 million for
    fiscal 2005, primarily due to volume growth in the licensed
    grocery and warehouse club business as well as sales of

ready-to-drink

coffee beverages introduced in Japan, Taiwan and Korea in the
    fall of 2005.

CPG operating income increased to $167 million for the
    fiscal year ended 2006, compared to $131 million for fiscal
    2005. Operating margin increased to 54.6% of related revenues,
    from 52.7% in fiscal 2005, primarily due to higher income from
    the Company’s equity investees and lower cost of sales as a
    percentage of revenues. The increase in equity investee income
    was primarily due to volume-driven results for The North
    American Coffee Partnership, which produces

ready-to-drink

beverages which include, among others, bottled
    Frappuccino

®

coffee drinks and Starbucks
    Doubleshot

®

espresso drinks. Lower cost of sales was due to a sales mix
    shift to products with higher gross margins.

Unallocated
    Corporate

Unallocated corporate expenses pertain to corporate
    administrative functions that support but are not specifically
    attributable to the Company’s operating segments, and
    include related depreciation and amortization expenses.
    Unallocated corporate expenses increased to $337 million
    for the fiscal year ended 2006, from $252 million in fiscal
    2005. The increase was due to higher payroll-related
    expenditures from the recognition of stock-based compensation
    expense and to additional employees, as well as higher
    professional fees primarily in support of global systems
    infrastructure development. Total unallocated corporate expenses
    as a percentage of total net revenues were 4.3% for the fiscal
    year ended 2006, compared to 3.9% for fiscal 2005.

RESULTS
    OF OPERATIONS — FISCAL 2005 COMPARED TO FISCAL

CONSOLIDATED
    RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Net revenues for the fiscal year ended 2005 increased 20% to
    $6.4 billion from $5.3 billion for the

53-week

period of fiscal 2004, driven by increases in both
    Company-operated retail revenues and specialty operations. Net
    revenues increased 23% when calculated on a comparative

52-week

basis for both fiscal 2005 and 2004.

During the fiscal year ended 2005, Starbucks derived 85% of
    total net revenues from its Company-operated retail stores.
    Company-operated retail revenues increased 21% to
    $5.4 billion for the fiscal year ended 2005, from
    $4.5 billion for the

53-week

period of fiscal 2004. Company-operated retail revenues
    increased 23% when calculated on a comparative

52-week

basis for both fiscal 2005 and 2004. This increase was primarily
    due to the opening of 746 new Company-operated retail stores in
    the last 12 months and comparable store sales growth of 8%
    for the 52 weeks ended October 2, 2005. The increase
    in comparable store sales was due to a 4% increase in the number
    of customer transactions and a 4% increase in the average value
    per transaction. Comparable store sales growth percentages were
    calculated excluding the extra week of fiscal 2004. The increase
    in the average value per transaction was primarily due to a
    beverage price increase in October 2004 in the Company’s
    U.S. and Canadian markets.


STARBUCKS
    CORPORATION, FORM 10-K


The Company derived the remaining 15% of total net revenues from
    channels outside the Company-operated retail stores. Specialty
    revenues, which include licensing revenues and foodservice and
    other revenues, increased 17% to $977 million for the
    fiscal year ended 2005, from $837 million for the

53-week

period of fiscal 2004. Excluding the impact of the extra week in
    fiscal 2004, total specialty revenues increased 19%.

Licensing revenues, which are derived from retail store
    licensing arrangements, as well as grocery, warehouse club and
    certain other branded-product licensed operations, increased 19%
    to $673 million for the

52-week

period of 2005, from $566 million for the

53-week

period of fiscal 2004. Excluding the impact of the extra week in
    fiscal 2004, total licensing revenues increased 21%, primarily
    due to higher product sales and royalty revenues from the
    opening of 926 new licensed retail stores in the last
    12 months.

Foodservice and other revenues increased 12% to
    $304 million for the

52-week

period of fiscal 2005, from $271 million for the

53-week

period of fiscal 2004. Excluding the impact of the extra week in
    fiscal 2004, foodservice and other revenues increased 15%,
    primarily attributable to growth in new and existing U.S. and
    International foodservice accounts and, to a lesser extent,
    growth in the Company’s emerging entertainment business.

Cost of sales including occupancy costs decreased to 40.9% of
    total net revenues in the

52-week

period of fiscal 2005, from 41.4% in the

53-week

period of 2004. The decrease was primarily due to higher average
    revenue per retail transaction, offset in part by higher initial
    costs associated with the continued expansion of a lunch program
    in Company-operated retail stores. Approximately 3,800
    Company-operated stores had the lunch program at the end of
    fiscal 2005, compared to approximately 2,600 at the end of
    fiscal 2004.

Store operating expenses as a percentage of Company-operated
    retail revenues were 40.2% for both the

52-week

period of fiscal 2005 and the

53-week

period of fiscal 2004, primarily due to higher average revenue
    per retail transaction in fiscal 2005, offset by higher
    payroll-related expenditures, as well as higher maintenance and
    repair expenditures to ensure a consistent

Starbucks
    Experience

in existing stores. In order to facilitate
    ongoing retail store revenue growth, the Company opened a higher
    number of Drive Thru locations over the past year and extended
    store operating hours, which contributed to the higher
    payroll-related expenditures.

Other operating expenses, which are expenses associated with the
    Company’s Specialty Operations, decreased to 20.2% of
    specialty revenues in the

52-week

period of fiscal 2005, compared to 20.5% in the

53-week

period of fiscal 2004. The decrease was primarily due to lower
    expenditures within the grocery, warehouse club and foodservice
    businesses, partially offset by higher payroll-related
    expenditures to support the Company’s emerging
    entertainment business and to support the growth of
    Seattle’s Best Coffee licensed café operations.

Depreciation and amortization expenses increased to
    $340 million in the

52-week

period of fiscal 2005, from $289 million in the

53-week

period of fiscal 2004. The increase was primarily from the
    opening of 746 new Company-operated retail stores in the last
    12 months. As a percentage of total net revenues,
    depreciation and amortization decreased to 5.3% for the
    52 weeks ended October 2, 2005, from 5.5% for the
    corresponding

53-week

fiscal 2004 period.

General and administrative expenses increased to
    $357 million in the

52-week

period of fiscal 2005, compared to $304 million in the

53-week

period of fiscal 2004. The increase was primarily due to higher
    payroll-related expenditures in support of both domestic and
    international business growth and increased charitable donations
    to support multi-year corporate commitments. As a percentage of
    total net revenues, general and administrative expenses
    decreased to 5.6% for the 52 weeks ended October 2,
    2005, from 5.7% for the 53 weeks ended October 3, 2004.

Income from equity investees increased to $77 million in
    the

52-week

period of fiscal 2005, compared to $59 million in the

53-week

period of fiscal 2004. The increase was primarily due to
    volume-driven operating results for The North American Coffee
    Partnership, which produces

ready-to-drink

beverages which include, among others, bottled
    Frappuccino

®

coffee drinks and Starbucks
    DoubleShot

®

espresso drinks, and improved operating results from
    international investees, particularly in Japan and Korea, mainly
    as a result of new store openings.

Operating income increased 29% to $781 million in the

52-week

period of fiscal 2005, from $606 million in the

53-week

period of fiscal 2004. The operating margin increased to 12.3%
    of total net revenues in the

52-week

period of fiscal 2005, compared to 11.5% in the

53-week

period of fiscal 2004, primarily due to strong revenue growth.

Net interest and other income, which primarily consists of
    interest income, increased to $16 million in the

52-week

period of fiscal 2005, from $14 million in the

53-week

period of fiscal 2004. The increase was primarily due to higher
    interest income earned due to higher interest rates in fiscal
    2005 compared to fiscal 2004 and to foreign exchange gains in
    fiscal 2005 compared to losses in fiscal 2004. Partially
    offsetting these increases were higher realized losses on sales
    of

available-for-sale

securities. Starbucks funded the majority of its share
    repurchases during fiscal 2005 through sales of its

available-for-sale

securities.

Income taxes for the 52 weeks ended October 2, 2005,
    resulted in an effective tax rate of 37.9%, compared to 37.3% in
    fiscal 2004. The effective tax rate differs from the statutory
    rate of 35% due to a variety of factors, including state income
    taxes, the impact from foreign operations, tax credits and other
    provision adjustments.

United
    States

United States total net revenues increased 20% to
    $5.1 billion for the fiscal year ended 2005, compared to
    $4.3 billion for the

53-week

period of fiscal 2004. Excluding the impact of the extra week in
    fiscal 2004, United States total net revenues increased 22%.
    United States Company-operated retail revenues increased 19% to
    $4.5 billion for the fiscal year ended 2005, compared to
    $3.8 billion for the

53-week

period of fiscal 2004. Excluding the impact of the extra week in
    fiscal 2004, United States Company-operated retail revenues
    increased 22%, primarily due to the opening of 580 new
    Company-operated retail stores in the last 12 months and
    comparable store sales growth of 9% for the

52-week

period of fiscal 2005. The increase in comparable store sales
    was due to a 5% increase in the average value per transaction,
    including 3% attributable to a beverage price increase in
    October 2004, and a 4% increase in the number of customer
    transactions.

Total United States specialty revenues increased 20% to
    $558 million for the fiscal year ended 2005, compared to

53-week

period of fiscal 2004. Excluding the impact of the extra week in
    fiscal 2004, United States licensing revenues increased 35%, due
    to increased product sales and royalty revenues as a result of
    opening 596 new licensed retail stores in the last
    12 months. Foodservice and other revenues increased 10% to
    $280 million from $254 million for the

53-week

period of fiscal 2004. Excluding the impact of the extra week in
    fiscal 2004, United States foodservice and other revenues
    increased 13%, primarily due to growth in new and existing
    foodservice accounts, as well as growth in the emerging
    entertainment business.

United States operating income increased by 23% to
    $819 million for the fiscal year ended 2005, from

    margin increased to 16.1% of related revenues from 15.6% in the

53-week

period of fiscal 2004. Excluding the impact of the extra week in
    fiscal 2004, International Company-operated revenues increased
    32%, primarily due to the opening of 166 new Company-operated
    retail stores in the last 12 months, comparable store sales
    growth of 6% for the

52-week

period of fiscal 2005, and the weakening of the U.S. dollar
    against both the Canadian dollar and British pound sterling. The
    increase in comparable store sales resulted from a 4% increase
    in the number of customer transactions and a 2% increase in the
    average value per transaction.

Total International specialty revenues increased 24% to
    $170 million for the fiscal year ended 2005, compared to

    for the fiscal year ended 2005, compared to $18 million in

The Company manages its cash, cash equivalents and liquid
    investments in order to internally fund operating needs and pay
    down short-term borrowings. The $92 million increase in
    total cash and cash equivalents and liquid investments from
    October 2, 2005 to October 1, 2006, was primarily due
    to strong operating cash flows.

The Company intends to use its cash and liquid investments,
    including any borrowings under its $1 billion revolving
    credit facility, to invest in its core businesses and other new
    business opportunities related to its core businesses. The
    Company may use its available cash resources to make
    proportionate capital contributions to its equity method and
    cost method investees, as well as purchase larger ownership
    interests in selected equity method investees and licensed
    operations, particularly in international markets. Depending on
    market conditions, Starbucks may repurchase shares of its common
    stock under its authorized share repurchase program. Management
    believes that strong cash flow generated from operations,
    existing cash and liquid investments, as well as borrowing
    capacity under the revolving credit facility, should be
    sufficient to finance capital requirements for its core
    businesses for the foreseeable future. Significant new joint
    ventures, acquisitions, share repurchases

and/or

other
    new business opportunities may require additional outside
    funding.

Other than normal operating expenses, cash requirements for
    fiscal 2007 are expected to consist primarily of capital
    expenditures for new Company-operated retail stores and the
    remodeling and refurbishment of existing Company-operated retail
    stores, as well as potential increased investments in
    International licensees and for additional share repurchases, if
    any. Management expects capital expenditures to be in the range
    of $950 million to $1.0 billion in fiscal 2007,
    primarily driven by new store development and existing store
    renovations.

STARBUCKS
    CORPORATION, FORM 10-K



Cash provided by operating activities totaled $1.1 billion
    for fiscal 2006. Net earnings provided $564 million and
    noncash depreciation and amortization expenses further increased
    cash provided by operating activities by $413 million. In
    addition, an increase in accrued taxes payable due to the timing
    of payments provided $133 million.

Cash used by investing activities for fiscal 2006 totaled
    $841 million. Net capital additions to property, plant and
    equipment used $771 million, primarily from opening 1,040
    new Company-operated retail stores and remodeling certain
    existing stores. During fiscal 2006, the Company used
    $92 million for acquisitions, net of cash acquired. In
    addition, the net activity in the Company’s portfolio of

available-for-sale

securities provided $61 million.

Cash used by financing activities for fiscal 2006 totaled
    $155 million. Cash used to repurchase shares of the
    Company’s common stock totaled $854 million. This
    amount includes the effect of the net change in unsettled trades
    from October 2, 2005. Share repurchases, up to the limit
    authorized by the Board of Directors, are at the discretion of
    management and depend on market conditions, capital requirements
    and other factors. Approximately 21.5 million shares
    remained available for repurchase as of October 1, 2006.

The Company had net borrowings under its credit facility of
    $423 million during fiscal 2006, which consisted of
    additional gross borrowings of $1.4 billion offset by gross
    principal repayments of $993 million. Management increased
    the Company’s borrowing capacity under its credit facility
    during the fiscal fourth quarter of 2006, from $500 million
    to $1.0 billion, as provided in the original credit
    facility. As of October 1, 2006, a total of
    $700 million was outstanding under the facility.

Partially offsetting cash used for share repurchases were
    proceeds of $159 million from the exercise of employee
    stock options and the sale of the Company’s common stock
    from employee stock purchase plans. As options granted are
    exercised, the Company will continue to receive proceeds and a
    tax deduction; however, the amounts and the timing cannot be
    predicted.

The following table summarizes the Company’s contractual
    obligations and borrowings as of October 1, 2006, and the
    timing and effect that such commitments are expected to have on
    the Company’s liquidity and capital requirements in future

OFF-BALANCE
    SHEET ARRANGEMENT

The Company has unconditionally guaranteed the repayment of
    certain Japanese yen-denominated bank loans and related interest
    and fees of an unconsolidated equity investee, Starbucks Coffee
    Japan, Ltd. (“Starbucks Japan”). The guarantees
    continue until the loans, including accrued interest and fees,
    have been paid in full, with the final loan amount


STARBUCKS
    CORPORATION, FORM 10-K


due in 2014. The maximum amount is limited to the sum of unpaid
    principal and interest amounts, as well as other related
    expenses. These amounts will vary based on fluctuations in the
    yen foreign exchange rate. As of October 1, 2006, the
    maximum amount of the guarantees was approximately
    $6.0 million. Since there has been no modification of these
    loan guarantees subsequent to the Company’s adoption of
    Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”)
    Interpretation No. 45, “Guarantor’s Accounting
    and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including
    Indebtedness of Others,” Starbucks has applied the
    disclosure provisions only and has not recorded the guarantees
    on its balance sheet.

PRODUCT
    WARRANTIES

Coffee brewing and espresso equipment sold to customers through
    Company-operated and licensed retail stores, as well as
    equipment sold to the Company’s licensees for use in retail
    licensing operations, are under warranty for defects in
    materials and workmanship for a period ranging from 12 to
    24 months. Effective fiscal 2006, the Company elected to
    discontinue repairing brewing machines and instead offer an
    exchange to customers as a general right of return for any of
    its products. As a result, Starbucks maintains a sales return
    allowance based on historical patterns to reduce related
    revenues for estimated future product returns. Prior to fiscal
    2006, the Company established an accrual for estimated warranty
    costs at the time of sale, also based on historical experience.
    Product warranty costs and changes to the related accrual were
    not significant for the periods ended October 1, 2006 and
    October 2, 2005.

COMMODITY
    PRICES, AVAILABILITY AND GENERAL RISK CONDITIONS

The Company manages its exposure to various risks within the
    consolidated financial statements according to an umbrella risk
    management policy. Under this policy, market-based risks,
    including commodity costs and foreign currency exchange rates,
    are quantified and evaluated for potential mitigation
    strategies, such as entering into hedging transactions.
    Additionally, this policy restricts, among other things, the
    amount of market-based risk the Company will tolerate before
    implementing approved hedging strategies and prohibits
    speculative trading activity.

The Company purchases significant amounts of coffee and dairy
    products to support the needs of its Company-operated retail
    stores. The price and availability of these commodities directly
    impacts the Company’s results of operations and can be
    expected to impact its future results of operations. For
    additional details see “Product Supply” in
    Item 1, as well as “Risk Factors” in Item 1A
    of this

Form 10-K.

FINANCIAL
    RISK MANAGEMENT

The Company is exposed to market risk related to foreign
    currency exchange rates, equity security prices and changes in
    interest rates.

FOREIGN
    CURRENCY EXCHANGE RISK

The majority of the Company’s revenue, expense and capital
    purchasing activities are transacted in U.S. dollars.
    However, because a portion of the Company’s operations
    consists of activities outside of the United States, the Company
    has transactions in other currencies, primarily the Canadian
    dollar, British pound sterling, euro and Japanese yen. Under the
    Company’s umbrella risk management policy, the Company
    frequently evaluates its foreign currency exchange risk by
    monitoring market data and external factors that may influence
    exchange rate fluctuations. As a result, Starbucks may engage in
    transactions involving various derivative instruments, with
    maturities generally not exceeding five years, to hedge assets,
    liabilities, revenues and purchases denominated in foreign
    currencies.

As of October 1, 2006, the Company had forward foreign
    exchange contracts that qualify as cash flow hedges under
    Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (“SFAS”)
    No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and
    Hedging Activities,” to hedge a portion of anticipated
    international revenue and product purchases. In addition,
    Starbucks had forward foreign exchange contracts that qualify as
    hedges of its net investment in Starbucks Japan, an equity
    method investment, as well as the Company’s net investments
    in its Canadian and U.K. subsidiaries. These contracts expire
    within 33 months.

STARBUCKS
    CORPORATION, FORM 10-K



Based on the foreign exchange contracts outstanding as of
    October 1, 2006, a 10% devaluation of the U.S. dollar
    as compared to the level of foreign exchange rates for
    currencies under contract as of October 1, 2006, would
    result in a reduced fair value of these derivative financial
    instruments of approximately $44 million, of which
    $22 million may reduce the Company’s future earnings.
    Conversely, a 10% appreciation of the U.S. dollar would
    result in an increase in the fair value of these instruments of
    approximately $38 million, of which $20 million may
    increase the Company’s future earnings. Consistent with the
    nature of the economic hedges provided by these foreign exchange
    contracts, increases or decreases in their fair value would be
    mostly offset by corresponding decreases or increases in the
    dollar value of the Company’s foreign investment, future
    foreign currency royalty fee payments and product purchases that
    would occur within the hedging period.

EQUITY
    SECURITY PRICE RISK

The Company has minimal exposure to price fluctuations on equity
    mutual funds within its trading portfolio. The trading
    securities approximate a portion of the Company’s liability
    under the Management Deferred Compensation Plan
    (“MDCP”). A corresponding liability is included in
    “Accrued compensation and related costs” on the
    consolidated balance sheets. These investments are recorded at
    fair value with unrealized gains and losses recognized in
    “Interest and other income, net” in the consolidated
    statements of earnings. The offsetting changes in the MDCP
    liability are recorded in “General and administrative
    expenses.”

INTEREST
    RATE RISK

The Company’s

available-for-sale

securities comprise a diversified portfolio consisting mainly of
    fixed income instruments. The primary objectives of these
    investments are to preserve capital and liquidity.

Available-for-sale

securities are investment grade and are recorded on the balance
    sheet at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as
    a separate component of “Accumulated other comprehensive
    income.” The Company does not hedge the interest rate
    exposure on its

available-for-sale

securities. The Company performed a sensitivity analysis based
    on a 10% change in the underlying interest rate of its interest
    bearing financial instruments, including its short-term
    borrowings and long-term debt, as of the end of fiscal 2006, and
    determined that such a change would not have a significant
    effect on the fair value of these instruments.

SEASONALITY
    AND QUARTERLY RESULTS

The Company’s business is subject to seasonal fluctuations.
    Significant portions of the Company’s net revenues and
    profits are realized during the first quarter of the
    Company’s fiscal year, which includes the holiday season.
    In addition, quarterly results are affected by the timing of the
    opening of new stores, and the Company’s rapid growth may
    conceal the impact of other seasonal influences. Because of the
    seasonality of the Company’s business, results for any
    quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may
    be achieved for the full fiscal year.

APPLICATION
    OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Critical accounting policies are those that management believes
    are both most important to the portrayal of the Company’s
    financial condition and results, and require management’s
    most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a
    result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters
    that are inherently uncertain. Judgments and uncertainties
    affecting the application of those policies may result in
    materially different amounts being reported under different
    conditions or using different assumptions.

Starbucks considers its policies on impairment of long-lived
    assets, accounting for self insurance reserves, stock-based
    compensation and accounting for operating leases to be the most
    critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in
    preparing its consolidated financial statements.


STARBUCKS
    CORPORATION, FORM 10-K


IMPAIRMENT
    OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS

When facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying values
    of long-lived assets may be impaired, an evaluation of
    recoverability is performed by comparing the carrying values of
    the assets to projected future cash flows, in addition to other
    quantitative and qualitative analyses. For goodwill and other
    intangible assets, impairment tests are performed annually and
    more frequently if facts and circumstances indicate goodwill
    carrying values exceed estimated reporting unit fair values and
    if indefinite useful lives are no longer appropriate for the
    Company’s trademarks. Upon indication that the carrying
    values of such assets may not be recoverable, the Company
    recognizes an impairment loss as a charge against current
    operations. Property, plant and equipment assets are grouped at
    the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows
    when assessing impairment. Cash flows for retail assets are
    identified at the individual store level. Long-lived assets to
    be disposed of are reported at the lower of their carrying
    amount or fair value, less estimated costs to sell. Judgments
    made by the Company related to the expected useful lives of
    long-lived assets and the ability of the Company to realize
    undiscounted cash flows in excess of the carrying amounts of
    such assets are affected by factors such as the ongoing
    maintenance and improvements of the assets, changes in economic
    conditions and changes in operating performance. As the Company
    assesses the ongoing expected cash flows and carrying amounts of
    its long-lived assets, these factors could cause the Company to
    realize material impairment charges.

STOCK-BASED
    COMPENSATION

Starbucks accounts for stock-based compensation in accordance
    with the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123R.
    The Company uses the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model
    which requires the input of highly subjective assumptions. These
    assumptions include estimating the length of time employees will
    retain their stock options before exercising them
    (“expected term”), the estimated volatility of the
    Company’s common stock price over the expected term and the
    number of options that will ultimately not complete their
    vesting requirements (“forfeitures”). Changes in the
    subjective assumptions can materially affect the estimate of
    fair value of stock-based compensation and consequently, the
    related amount recognized on the consolidated statements of
    earnings.

OPERATING
    LEASES

Starbucks leases retail stores, roasting and distribution
    facilities and office space under operating leases. The Company
    provides for an estimate of asset retirement obligation
    (“ARO”) expense at the lease inception date for
    operating leases with requirements to remove leasehold
    improvements at the end of the lease term. Estimating AROs
    involves subjective assumptions regarding both the amount and
    timing of actual future retirement costs. Future actual costs
    could differ significantly from amounts initially estimated. In
    addition, the large number of operating leases, and the
    significant number of international markets in which the Company
    has operating leases, adds administrative complexity to the
    calculation of ARO expense as well as to the other technical
    accounting requirements of operating leases such as contingent
    rent.

SELF
    INSURANCE RESERVES

The Company uses a combination of insurance and self-insurance
    mechanisms, including a wholly owned captive insurance entity
    and participation in a reinsurance pool, to provide for the
    potential liabilities for workers’ compensation, healthcare
    benefits, general liability, property insurance, director and
    officers’ liability insurance and vehicle liability.
    Liabilities associated with the risks that are retained by the
    Company are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by
    considering historical claims experience, demographic factors,
    severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated
    accruals for these liabilities, portions of which are calculated
    by third party actuarial firms, could be significantly affected
    if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions
    and historical trends.

RECENT
    ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

In July 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48
    (“FIN 48”), “Accounting for Uncertainty in
    Income Taxes, an interpretation of FASB Statement
    No. 109,” which seeks to reduce the diversity in
    practice associated with the accounting

STARBUCKS
    CORPORATION, FORM 10-K



and reporting for uncertainty in income tax positions. This
    Interpretation prescribes a comprehensive model for the
    financial statement recognition, measurement, presentation and
    disclosure of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be
    taken in income tax returns. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal
    years beginning after December 15, 2006 and the Company
    will adopt the new requirements in its fiscal first quarter of
    2008. The cumulative effects, if any, of adopting FIN 48
    will be recorded as an adjustment to retained earnings as of the
    beginning of the period of adoption. The Company has not yet
    determined the impact, if any, of adopting FIN 48 on its
    consolidated financial statements.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS 157, “Fair
    Value Measurements” (“SFAS 157”), which
    defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair
    value in GAAP, and expands disclosures about fair value
    measurements. SFAS 157 is effective for financial
    statements issued for fiscal years beginning after
    November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal
    years. Early adoption is permitted. Starbucks must adopt these
    new requirements no later than its first fiscal quarter of 2009.
    Starbucks has not yet determined the effect on the
    Company’s consolidated financial statements, if any, upon
    adoption of SFAS 157, or if it will adopt the requirements
    prior to the first fiscal quarter of 2009.

In September 2006, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting
    Bulletin No. 108, “Considering the Effects of
    Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in
    Current Year Financial Statements”
    (“SAB 108”). The intent of SAB 108 is to
    reduce diversity in practice for the method companies use to
    quantify financial statement misstatements, including the effect
    of prior year uncorrected errors. SAB 108 establishes an
    approach that requires quantification of financial statement
    errors using both an income statement and a cumulative balance
    sheet approach. SAB 108 is effective for fiscal years
    beginning after November 15, 2006, and the Company will
    adopt the new requirements in fiscal 2008. The adoption of
    SAB 108 is not currently expected to have a significant
    impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Fiscal
    years ended October 1, 2006, October 2, 2005, and
    October 3, 2004

Note 1:
    Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Description
    of Business

Starbucks Corporation (together with its subsidiaries,
    “Starbucks” or the “Company”) purchases and
    roasts high-quality whole bean coffees and sells them, along
    with fresh, rich-brewed coffees, Italian-style espresso
    beverages, cold blended beverages, a variety of complementary
    food items, coffee-related accessories and equipment, a
    selection of premium teas and a line of compact discs, primarily
    through its Company-operated retail stores. Starbucks also sells
    coffee and tea products and licenses its trademark through other
    channels and, through certain of its equity investees, Starbucks
    produces and sells

ready-to-drink

beverages which include, among others, bottled
    Frappuccino

®

coffee drinks and Starbucks
    DoubleShot

®

espresso drinks, and a line of superpremium ice creams. All
    channels outside the Company-operated retail stores are
    collectively known as “Specialty Operations.” The
    Company’s objective is to establish Starbucks as one of the
    most recognized and respected brands in the world. To achieve
    this goal, the Company plans to continue rapid expansion of its
    retail operations, to grow its Specialty Operations and to
    selectively pursue other opportunities to leverage the Starbucks
    brand through the introduction of new products and the
    development of new channels of distribution. The Company’s
    brand portfolio includes superpremium
    Tazo

®

teas, Starbucks Hear
    Music

coffee.

Principles
    of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements reflect the financial
    position and operating results of Starbucks, which include
    wholly owned subsidiaries and investees controlled by the
    Company.

Investments in entities that the Company does not control, but
    has the ability to exercise significant influence over operating
    and financial policies, are accounted for under the equity
    method. Investments in entities in which Starbucks does not have
    the ability to exercise significant influence are accounted for
    under the cost method.

All significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated.

Fiscal
    Year End

Starbucks Corporation’s fiscal year ends on the Sunday
    closest to September 30. The fiscal years ended on
    October 1, 2006 and October 2, 2005, included
    52 weeks. The fiscal year ended October 3, 2004,
    included 53 weeks, with the 53rd week falling in the
    fiscal fourth quarter.

Reclassifications

Certain reclassifications of prior year’s balances have
    been made to conform to the current format.

Estimates
    and Assumptions

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
    America (“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates
    and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets,
    liabilities, revenues and expenses. Actual results may differ
    from these estimates.

Cash and
    Cash Equivalents

The Company considers all highly liquid instruments with a
    maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase to be
    cash equivalents. The Company maintains cash and cash equivalent
    balances with financial institutions that exceed federally
    insured limits. The Company has not experienced any losses
    related to these balances, and management believes its credit
    risk to be minimal.

STARBUCKS
    CORPORATION, FORM 10-K



Cash
    Management

The Company’s cash management system provides for the
    reimbursement of all major bank disbursement accounts on a daily
    basis. Checks issued but not presented for payment to the bank
    are reflected as a reduction of cash and cash equivalents on the
    consolidated financial statements.

Short-term
    and Long-term Investments

The Company’s short-term and long-term investments consist
    primarily of investment-grade marketable debt securities as well
    as bond and equity mutual funds, all of which are classified as
    trading or

available-for-sale.

Trading securities are recorded at fair value with unrealized
    holding gains and losses included in net earnings.

Available-for-sale

securities are recorded at fair value, and unrealized holding
    gains and losses are recorded, net of tax, as a separate
    component of accumulated other comprehensive income.

Available-for-sale

securities with remaining maturities of less than one year and
    those identified by management at time of purchase for funding
    operations in less than one year are classified as short-term,
    and all other

available-for-sale

securities are classified as long-term. Unrealized losses are
    charged against net earnings when a decline in fair value is
    determined to be other than temporary. Management reviews
    several factors to determine whether a loss is other than
    temporary, such as the length of time a security is in an
    unrealized loss position, the extent to which fair value is less
    than amortized cost, the impact of changing interest rates in
    the short and long term, the financial condition and near term
    prospects of the issuer and the Company’s intent and
    ability to hold the security for a period of time sufficient to
    allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value. Realized gains
    and losses are accounted for on the specific identification
    method. Purchases and sales are recorded on a trade date basis.

Fair
    Value of Financial Instruments

The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents approximates
    fair value because of the short-term maturity of those
    instruments. The fair value of the Company’s investments in
    marketable debt and equity securities, as well as bond and
    equity mutual funds, is based upon the quoted market price on
    the last business day of the fiscal year. For equity securities
    of companies that are privately held, or where an observable
    quoted market price does not exist, the Company estimates fair
    value using a variety of valuation methodologies. Such
    methodologies include comparing the security with securities of
    publicly traded companies in similar lines of business, applying
    revenue multiples to estimated future operating results for the
    private company and estimating discounted cash flows for that
    company. Declines in fair value below the Company’s
    carrying value deemed to be other than temporary are charged
    against net earnings. For further information on investments,
    see Notes 4 and 7. The carrying value of short-term and
    long-term debt approximates fair value.

Derivative
    Instruments

The Company manages its exposure to various risks within the
    consolidated financial statements according to an umbrella risk
    management policy. Under this policy, Starbucks may engage in
    transactions involving various derivative instruments, with
    maturities generally not longer than five years, to hedge
    assets, liabilities, revenues and purchases.

The Company follows SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for
    Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,” as amended
    and interpreted, which requires that all derivatives be recorded
    on the balance sheet at fair value. For a cash flow hedge, the
    effective portion of the derivative’s gain or loss is
    initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income
    (“OCI”) and subsequently reclassified into net
    earnings when the hedged exposure affects net earnings. For a
    net investment hedge, the effective portion of the
    derivative’s gain or loss is reported as a component of OCI.

Cash flow hedges related to anticipated transactions are
    designated and documented at the inception of each hedge by
    matching the terms of the contract to the underlying
    transaction. The Company classifies the cash flows from hedging
    transactions in the same categories as the cash flows from the
    respective hedged items. Once established, cash flow hedges are
    generally not removed until maturity unless an anticipated
    transaction is no longer likely to occur. Discontinued or
    derecognized cash flow hedges are immediately settled with
    counterparties, and the related accumulated derivative gains or
    losses are recognized into net earnings in “Interest and
    other income, net” on the consolidated statements of
    earnings.


STARBUCKS
    CORPORATION, FORM 10-K


Forward contract effectiveness for cash flow hedges is
    calculated by comparing the fair value of the contract to the
    change in value of the anticipated transaction using forward
    rates on a monthly basis. For net investment hedges, the

spot-to-spot

method is used to calculate effectiveness. Under this method,
    the change in fair value of the forward contract attributable to
    the changes in spot exchange rates (the effective portion) is
    reported as a component of OCI. The remaining change in fair
    value of the forward contract (the ineffective portion) is
    reclassified into net earnings. Any ineffectiveness is
    recognized immediately in “Interest and other income,
    net” on the consolidated statements of earnings.

Allowance
    for doubtful accounts

Allowance for doubtful accounts is calculated based on
    historical experience, customer credit risk and application of
    the specific identification method.

Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (primarily moving
    average cost) or market. The Company records inventory reserves
    for obsolete and slow-moving items and for estimated shrinkage
    between physical inventory counts. Inventory reserves are based
    on inventory turnover trends, historical experience and
    application of the specific identification method. As of
    October 1, 2006 and October 2, 2005, inventory
    reserves were $10.5 million and $8.3 million,
    respectively.

Property,
    Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment are carried at cost less
    accumulated depreciation. Depreciation of property, plant and
    equipment, which includes assets under capital leases, is
    provided on the straight-line method over estimated useful
    lives, generally ranging from two to seven years for equipment
    and 30 to 40 years for buildings. Leasehold improvements
    are amortized over the shorter of their estimated useful lives
    or the related lease life, generally 10 years. For leases
    with renewal periods at the Company’s option, Starbucks
    generally uses the original lease term, excluding renewal option
    periods to determine estimated useful lives. If failure to
    exercise a renewal option imposes an economic penalty to
    Starbucks, management may determine at the inception of the
    lease that renewal is reasonably assured and include the renewal
    option period in the determination of appropriate estimated
    useful lives. The portion of depreciation expense related to
    production and distribution facilities is included in “Cost
    of sales including occupancy costs” on the consolidated
    statements of earnings. The costs of repairs and maintenance are
    expensed when incurred, while expenditures for refurbishments
    and improvements that significantly add to the productive
    capacity or extend the useful life of an asset are capitalized.
    When assets are retired or sold, the asset cost and related
    accumulated depreciation are eliminated with any remaining gain
    or loss reflected in net earnings.

Goodwill
    and Other Intangible Assets

Goodwill and other intangible assets are tested for impairment
    annually in June and more frequently if facts and circumstances
    indicate goodwill carrying values exceed estimated reporting
    unit fair values and if indefinite useful lives are no longer
    appropriate for the Company’s trademarks. Based on the
    impairment tests performed, there was no impairment of goodwill
    in fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004. Definite-lived intangibles, which
    mainly consist of contract-based patents and copyrights, are
    amortized over their estimated useful lives. For further
    information on goodwill and other intangible assets, see
    Note 9.

Long-lived
    Assets

When facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying values
    of long-lived assets may be impaired, an evaluation of
    recoverability is performed by comparing the carrying values of
    the assets to projected future cash flows in addition to other
    quantitative and qualitative analyses. Upon indication that the
    carrying values of such assets may not be recoverable, the
    Company recognizes an impairment loss by a charge against
    current operations. Property, plant and equipment assets

STARBUCKS
    CORPORATION, FORM 10-K



are grouped at the lowest level for which there are identifiable
    cash flows when assessing impairment. Cash flows for retail
    assets are identified at the individual store level.

The Company recognized net impairment and disposition losses of
    $19.6 million, $19.5 million and $17.9 million in
    fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, primarily from
    renovation and remodeling activity and, to a lesser extent, from
    underperforming Company-operated retail stores, in the normal
    course of business. Depending on the underlying asset that is
    impaired, these losses may be recorded in any one of the
    operating expense lines on the consolidated statements of
    earnings: for retail operations, these losses are recorded in
    “Store operating expenses”; for Specialty Operations,
    these losses are recorded in “Other operating
    expenses”; and for all other operations, these losses are
    recorded in either “Cost of sales including occupancy
    costs” or “General and administrative expenses.”

Insurance
    Reserves

The Company uses a combination of insurance and self-insurance
    mechanisms, including a wholly owned captive insurance entity
    and participation in a reinsurance pool, to provide for the
    potential liabilities for workers’ compensation, healthcare
    benefits, general liability, property insurance, director and
    officers’ liability insurance and vehicle liability.
    Liabilities associated with the risks that are retained by the
    Company are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by
    considering historical claims experience, demographic factors,
    severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated
    accruals for these liabilities, portions of which are calculated
    by third party actuarial firms, could be significantly affected
    if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions
    and historical trends. As of October 1, 2006, and
    October 2, 2005, these reserves were $113.2 million
    and $91.6 million, respectively, and were included in
    “Accrued compensation and related costs” and
    “Other accrued expenses” on the consolidated balance
    sheets.

Revenue
    Recognition

Consolidated revenues are presented net of intercompany
    eliminations for wholly owned subsidiaries and investees
    controlled by the Company and for licensees accounted for under
    the equity method, based on the Company’s percentage
    ownership. Additionally, consolidated revenues are recognized
    net of any discounts, returns, allowances and sales incentives,
    including coupon redemptions and rebates.

Stored
    Value Cards

Revenues from the Company’s stored value cards, such as the
    Starbucks Card, are recognized when tendered for payment, or
    upon redemption. Outstanding customer balances are included in
    “Deferred revenue” on the consolidated balance sheets.
    There are no expiration dates on the Company’s stored value
    cards, and Starbucks does not charge any service fees that cause
    a decrement to customer balances.

While the Company will continue to honor all stored value cards
    presented for payment, management may determine the likelihood
    of redemption to be remote for certain card balances due to,
    among other things, long periods of inactivity. In these
    circumstances, to the extent management determines there is no
    requirement for remitting card balances to government agencies
    under unclaimed property laws, card balances may be recognized
    in the consolidated statements of earnings in “Income and
    other income, net.” For the fiscal year ended
    October 1, 2006, income recognized on unredeemed stored
    value card balances was $4.4 million. There was no income
    recognized on unredeemed stored value card balances during the
    fiscal years ended October 2, 2005 or October 3, 2004.

Retail
    Revenues

Company-operated retail store revenues are recognized when
    payment is tendered at the point of sale. Starbucks maintains a
    sales return allowance, based on historical patterns, to reduce
    retail revenues for estimated future product returns, including
    defective brewing equipment, related to sales in the normal
    course of business. Retail store revenues are reported net of
    sales, use or other transaction taxes that are collected from
    customers and remitted to taxing authorities.


STARBUCKS
    CORPORATION, FORM 10-K


Specialty
    Revenues

Specialty revenues consist primarily of product sales to
    customers other than through Company-operated retail stores, as
    well as royalties and other fees generated from licensing
    operations. Sales of coffee, tea and related products are
    generally recognized upon shipment to customers, depending on
    contract terms. Shipping charges billed to customers are also
    recognized as revenue, and the related shipping costs are
    included in “Cost of sales including occupancy costs”
    on the consolidated statements of earnings.

Specific to retail store licensing arrangements, initial
    nonrefundable development fees are recognized upon substantial
    performance of services for new market business development
    activities, such as initial business, real estate and store
    development planning, as well as providing operational materials
    and functional training courses for opening new licensed retail
    markets. Additional store licensing fees are recognized when new
    licensed stores are opened. Royalty revenues based upon a
    percentage of reported sales and other continuing fees, such as
    marketing and service fees, are recognized on a monthly basis
    when earned. For certain licensing arrangements, where the
    Company intends to acquire an ownership interest, the initial
    nonrefundable development fees are deferred to “Other
    long-term liabilities” until acquisition, at which point
    the fees are reflected as a reduction of the Company’s
    investment.

Other arrangements involving multiple elements and deliverables
    as well as upfront fees are individually evaluated for revenue
    recognition. Cash payments received in advance of product or
    service delivery are recorded as deferred revenue.

Advertising

The Company expenses most advertising costs as they are
    incurred, except for certain production costs that are expensed
    the first time the advertising campaign takes place and
    direct-response advertising, which is capitalized and amortized
    over its expected period of future benefits. Direct-response
    advertising consists primarily of customer acquisition expenses
    including applications for customers to apply for the Starbucks
    Card
    Duetto

tm

Visa

®

.
    These capitalized costs are amortized over the life of the
    credit card which is estimated to be three years.

Total advertising expenses, recorded in “Store operating
    expenses,” “Other operating expenses” and
    “General and administrative expenses” on the
    consolidated statements of earnings, totaled $95.4 million,
    $87.7 million and $67.2 million in fiscal 2006, 2005
    and 2004, respectively. As of October 1, 2006, and
    October 2, 2005, $19.2 million and $11.8 million,
    respectively, of capitalized advertising costs were recorded in
    “Prepaid expenses and other current assets” on the
    consolidated balance sheets.

Store
    Preopening Expenses

Costs incurred in connection with the

start-up

and
    promotion of new store openings are expensed as incurred.

Operating
    Leases

Starbucks leases retail stores, roasting and distribution
    facilities and office space under operating leases. Most lease
    agreements contain tenant improvement allowances, rent holidays,
    lease premiums, rent escalation clauses

and/or

contingent rent provisions. For purposes of recognizing
    incentives, premiums and minimum rental expenses on a
    straight-line basis over the terms of the leases, the Company
    uses the date of initial possession to begin amortization, which
    is generally when the Company enters the space and begins to
    make improvements in preparation of intended use.

For tenant improvement allowances and rent holidays, the Company
    records a deferred rent liability in “Accrued occupancy
    costs” and “Other long-term liabilities” on the
    consolidated balance sheets and amortizes the deferred rent over
    the terms of the leases as reductions to rent expense on the
    consolidated statements of earnings.

For premiums paid upfront to enter a lease agreement, the
    Company records a deferred rent asset in “Prepaid expenses
    and other current assets” and “Other assets” on
    the consolidated balance sheets and then amortizes the deferred
    rent over the terms of the leases as additional rent expense on
    the consolidated statements of earnings.

STARBUCKS
    CORPORATION, FORM 10-K



For scheduled rent escalation clauses during the lease terms or
    for rental payments commencing at a date other than the date of
    initial occupancy, the Company records minimum rental expenses
    on a straight-line basis over the terms of the leases on the
    consolidated statements of earnings.

Certain leases provide for contingent rents, which are
    determined as a percentage of gross sales in excess of specified
    levels. The Company records a contingent rent liability in
    “Accrued occupancy costs” on the consolidated balance
    sheets and the corresponding rent expense when specified levels
    have been achieved or when management determines that achieving
    the specified levels during the fiscal year is probable.

Asset
    Retirement Obligations — Change in Accounting
    Principle

On October 1, 2006, Starbucks adopted FASB Interpretation
    No. 47 (“FIN 47”), “Accounting for
    Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations — an
    interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143,” which
    requires the recognition of a liability for the fair value of a
    legally required conditional asset retirement obligation when
    incurred, if the liability’s fair value can be reasonably
    estimated. The Company’s asset retirement obligation
    (“ARO”) liabilities are primarily associated with the
    disposal of leasehold improvements which, at the end of a lease,
    the Company may be contractually obligated to remove in order to
    restore the facility back to a condition specified in the lease
    agreement. The Company estimates the fair value of these
    liabilities based on current store closing costs, accretes that
    current cost forward to the date of estimated ARO removal, and
    discounts the future cost back as if it were performed at the
    inception of the lease. At the inception of such a lease, the
    Company records the ARO liability and also records a related
    capital asset in an amount equal to the estimated fair value of
    the liability. The ARO liability is accreted to its future
    value, with the accretion expense recognized as operating
    expense. The capitalized asset is depreciated on a straight-line
    basis over the useful life of the asset, which generally mirrors
    the life of the leasehold improvement. Upon ARO removal, any
    difference between the actual retirement costs incurred and the
    recorded estimated ARO liability is recognized as an operating
    gain or loss in the consolidated statement of earnings. In
    future periods, the Company may make adjustments to the ARO
    liability as a result of the availability of new information,
    changes in labor costs and other factors. The estimate of the
    ARO liability is based on a number of assumptions requiring
    management’s judgment, including store closing costs, cost
    inflation rates and discount rates.

The initial impact of adopting FIN 47 resulted in a charge
    of $27.1 million, with a related tax benefit of
    $9.9 million, for a net expense of $17.2 million, or
    $0.02 per diluted share. The net amount was recorded as a
    cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle on the
    consolidated statement of earnings. FIN 47 requires that
    the cumulative approach to adoption be used rather than
    retrospectively revising prior year financial statements. The
    adoption increased “Property, plant and equipment,
    net,” by $15.5 million, increased “Other
    long-term liabilities” for AROs by $34.2 million,
    increased “Other assets” for deferred tax assets by
    $6.8 million, and decreased “Equity and other
    investments” by $5.3 million. The following table
    presents, on a pro forma basis, what the ARO liability would
    have been had FIN 47 been in effect during fiscal 2005 and
    2004. These pro forma amounts are estimated based upon the
    information, assumptions and interest rates used to measure the
    ARO liability recognized upon adoption of FIN 47 as of
    October 1, 2006 (

Stock-based
    Compensation — Change in Accounting
    Principle

The Company maintains several equity incentive plans under which
    it may grant non-qualified stock options, incentive stock
    options, restricted stock or stock appreciation rights to
    employees, non-employee directors and consultants. The Company
    also has employee stock purchase plans (“ESPP”).

Prior to the October 3, 2005 adoption of the
    SFAS No. 123(R), “Share-Based Payment”
    (“SFAS 123R”), Starbucks accounted for
    stock-based compensation using the intrinsic value method
    prescribed in Accounting Principles Board


STARBUCKS
    CORPORATION, FORM 10-K


(“APB”) Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for
    Stock Issued to Employees,” and related interpretations.
    Accordingly, because the stock option grant price equaled the
    market price on the date of grant, and any purchase discounts
    under the Company’s stock purchase plans were within
    statutory limits, no compensation expense was recognized by the
    Company for stock-based compensation. As permitted by
    SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based
    Compensation” (“SFAS 123”), stock-based
    compensation was included as a pro forma disclosure in the notes
    to the consolidated financial statements.

Effective October 3, 2005, the beginning of Starbucks first
    fiscal quarter of 2006, the Company adopted the fair value
    recognition provisions of SFAS 123R, using the
    modified-prospective transition method. Under this transition
    method, stock-based compensation expense was recognized in the
    consolidated financial statements for granted, modified, or
    settled stock options and for expense related to the ESPP, since
    the related purchase discounts exceeded the amount allowed under
    SFAS 123R for non-compensatory treatment. Compensation
    expense recognized included the estimated expense for stock
    options granted on and subsequent to October 3, 2005, based
    on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the
    provisions of SFAS 123R, and the estimated expense for the
    portion vesting in the period for options granted prior to, but
    not vested as of October 3, 2005, based on the grant date
    fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions
    of SFAS 123. Results for prior periods have not been
    restated, as provided for under the modified-prospective method.

Total stock-based compensation expense recognized in the
    consolidated statement of earnings for fiscal 2006 was
    $105.0 million before income taxes and consisted of stock
    option and ESPP expense of $94.8 million and
    $10.2 million, respectively. The related total tax benefit
    was $36.1 million for fiscal 2006. Capitalized stock-based
    compensation at October 1, 2006 was $2.1 million, and
    was included in “Property, plant and equipment, net”
    and “Inventories” on the consolidated balance sheet.

Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R, Starbucks presented all
    tax benefits resulting from the exercise of stock options as
    operating cash inflows in the consolidated statements of cash
    flows, in accordance with the provisions of the Emerging Issues
    Task Force (“EITF”) Issue No

00-15,

“Classification in the Statement of Cash Flows of the
    Income Tax Benefit Received by a Company upon Exercise of a
    Nonqualified Employee Stock Option.” SFAS 123R
    requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of the tax
    effect of the compensation cost recognized for those options to
    be classified as financing cash inflows rather than operating
    cash inflows, on a prospective basis. This amount is shown as
    “Excess tax benefit from exercise of stock options” on
    the consolidated statement of cash flows.

In November 2005, the FASB issued Staff Position

No. FAS 123(R)-3,

“Transition Election Related to Accounting for the Tax
    Effects of Share-Based Payment Awards”

(“FSP 123R-3”).

The Company has elected to adopt the alternative transition
    method provided in FSP 123R-3 for calculating the tax effects of
    stock-based compensation under SFAS 123R. The alternative
    transition method includes simplified methods to establish the
    beginning balance of the additional

paid-in-capital

pool (“APIC pool”) related to the tax effects of
    stock-based compensation, and for determining the subsequent
    impact on the APIC pool and consolidated statements of cash
    flows of the tax effects of stock-based compensation awards that
    are outstanding upon adoption of SFAS 123R.

For option grants made in November 2003 and thereafter, the
    Company may provide for immediate vesting upon retirement for
    optionees who have attained at least 10 years of service
    and are age 55 or older. Prior to adoption of
    SFAS 123R, the Company amortized the expense over the
    related vesting period with acceleration of expense upon
    retirement. With the adoption of SFAS 123R, the accounting
    treatment for retirement features changed. Expense for awards
    made prior to adoption of SFAS 123R is still amortized over
    the vesting period until retirement, at which point any
    remaining unrecognized expense is immediately recognized. For
    awards made on or after October 3, 2005, the related
    expense is recognized either from grant date through the date
    the employee reaches the years of service and age requirements,
    or from grant date through the stated vesting period, whichever
    is shorter.

The expected term of the options represents the estimated period
    of time until exercise and is based on historical experience of
    similar awards, giving consideration to the contractual terms,
    vesting schedules and expectations of future employee behavior.
    For 2006, expected stock price volatility is based on a
    combination of historical volatility of the Company’s stock
    and the one-year implied volatility of its traded options, for
    the related vesting periods. Prior to the adoption of
    SFAS 123R, expected stock price volatility was estimated
    using only historical volatility. The risk-free interest rate is
    based on the implied yield available on U.S. Treasury
    zero-coupon issues with an equivalent remaining term. The
    Company has not paid dividends in the past and does not plan to
    pay any dividends in the near future.

The BSM option valuation model was developed for use in
    estimating the fair value of traded options, which have no
    vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. In addition,
    option valuation models require the input of highly subjective
    assumptions, particularly for the expected term and expected
    stock price volatility. The Company’s employee stock
    options have characteristics significantly different from those
    of traded options, and changes in the subjective input
    assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate.
    Because Company stock options do not trade on a secondary
    exchange, employees do not derive a benefit from holding stock
    options unless there is an increase, above the grant price, in
    the market price of the Company’s stock. Such an increase
    in stock price would benefit all shareholders commensurately.
    See Note 14 for additional details.


STARBUCKS
    CORPORATION, FORM 10-K


Foreign
    Currency Translation

The Company’s international operations generally use their
    local currency as their functional currency. Assets and
    liabilities are translated at exchange rates in effect at the
    balance sheet date. Income and expense accounts are translated
    at the average monthly exchange rates during the year. Resulting
    translation adjustments are recorded as a separate component of
    “Accumulated other comprehensive income.”

Income
    Taxes

The Company computes income taxes using the asset and liability
    method, under which deferred income taxes are provided for the
    temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and
    the tax basis of the Company’s assets and liabilities. The
    Company establishes, and periodically reviews and re-evaluates,
    an estimated contingent tax liability to provide for the
    possibility of unfavorable outcomes in tax matters in accordance
    with the requirements of SFAS No. 5, “Accounting
    for Contingencies” (“SFAS 5”).

Earnings
    per Share

The computation of basic earnings per share is based on the
    weighted average number of shares and common stock units that
    were outstanding during the period. The computation of diluted
    earnings per share includes the dilutive effect of common stock
    equivalents consisting of certain shares subject to stock
    options.

Common
    Stock Share Repurchases

The Company is allowed to repurchase shares of its common stock
    under a program authorized by its Board of Directors including
    pursuant to a contract, instruction or written plan meeting the
    requirements of

Rule 10b5-1(c)(1)

of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Share repurchases are
    not displayed separately as treasury stock on the consolidated
    balance sheets or consolidated statements of shareholders’
    equity in accordance with the Washington Business Corporation
    Act. Instead, the par value of repurchased shares is deducted
    from “Common stock” and the remaining excess
    repurchase price over par value is deducted from
    “Additional paid-in capital” and from “Retained
    earnings,” once additional paid-in capital is depleted. See
    Note 13 for additional information.

Recent
    Accounting Pronouncements

In July 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48
    (“FIN 48”), “Accounting for Uncertainty in
    Income Taxes, an interpretation of FASB Statement
    No. 109,” which seeks to reduce the diversity in
    practice associated with the accounting and reporting for
    uncertainty in income tax positions. This Interpretation
    prescribes a comprehensive model for the financial statement
    recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of
    uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in income
    tax returns. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning
    after December 15, 2006, and the Company will adopt the new
    requirements in its fiscal first quarter of 2008. The cumulative
    effects, if any, of adopting FIN 48 will be recorded as an
    adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the
    period of adoption. The Company has not yet determined the
    impact, if any, of adopting FIN 48 on its consolidated
    financial statements.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS 157, “Fair Value
    Measurements” (“SFAS 157”), which defines fair
    value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in GAAP,
    and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS 157
    is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years
    beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods
    within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted.
    Starbucks must adopt these new requirements no later than its
    first fiscal quarter of 2009. Starbucks has not yet determined
    the effect on the Company’s consolidated financial
    statements, if any, upon adoption of SFAS 157, or if it will
    adopt the requirements prior to the first fiscal quarter of 2009.

In September 2006, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting
    Bulletin No. 108, “Considering the Effects of
    Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in
    Current Year Financial Statements”
    (“SAB 108”). The intent of SAB 108 is to
    reduce diversity in practice for the method companies use to
    quantify financial statement misstatements, including the effect
    of prior year uncorrected errors. SAB 108 establishes an
    approach that requires quantification of

STARBUCKS
    CORPORATION, FORM 10-K



financial statement errors using both an income statement and
    cumulative balance sheet approach. SAB 108 is effective for
    fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2006, and the
    Company will adopt the new requirements in fiscal 2008. The
    adoption of SAB 108 is not currently expected to have a
    significant impact on the Company’s consolidated financial
    statements.

Note 2: Business
    Acquisitions

In January 2006, Starbucks increased its equity ownership to
    100% in its operations in Hawaii and Puerto Rico and applied the
    consolidation method of accounting from the acquisition date.
    Previously the Company owned 5% of both Coffee Partners Hawaii
    and Café del Caribe in Puerto Rico. Because Coffee Partners
    Hawaii was a general partnership, the equity method of
    accounting was previously applied. Retroactive application of
    the equity method of accounting for the Puerto Rico investment,
    which was previously accounted for under the cost method,
    resulted in a reduction of retained earnings of
    $0.5 million as of April 2, 2006. Previously reported
    earnings per share amounts were not impacted as a result of this
    acquisition.

As shown in the tables below, the cumulative effect of the
    accounting change for financial results previously reported
    under the cost method and as restated in this report under the
    equity method reduced net earnings by $97 thousand for the
    fiscal year ended October 2, 2005 and $93 thousand for the
    fiscal year ended October 2, 2004 (

Gross unrealized holding losses of $2 thousand for less than
    twelve months and $0.4 million for greater than or equal to
    twelve months as of October 1, 2006, pertain to 3 and 23
    fixed income securities, respectively, and were primarily caused
    by interest rate increases. Since Starbucks has the ability and
    intent to hold these securities until a recovery of fair value,
    which may be at maturity, and because the unrealized losses were
    primarily due to higher interest rates, the Company does not
    consider these securities to be

other-than-temporarily

impaired.

STARBUCKS
    CORPORATION, FORM 10-K



Additional factors related to

other-than-temporary

impairment considered by management as of October 1, 2006,
    included the following, by category:

State and
    local government obligations

The contractual terms of these securities do not permit the
    issuer to settle at a price less than the par value of the
    investment, which is the equivalent of the amount due at
    maturity. These securities had a minimum credit rating of
    “A,” and an average credit rating above “AA.”

Corporate
    debt obligations

The contractual terms of these securities do not permit the
    issuer to settle at a price less than the par value of the
    investment, which is the equivalent of the amount due at
    maturity. These securities had a minimum and average credit
    rating of “A.”

There were no realized losses recorded for other than temporary
    impairments during fiscal years 2006, 2005 or 2004.

Trading securities are comprised mainly of marketable equity
    mutual funds that approximate a portion of the Company’s
    liability under the Management Deferred Compensation Plan, a
    defined contribution plan. The corresponding deferred
    compensation liability of $64.6 million in fiscal 2006 and
    $47.3 million in fiscal 2005 is included in “Accrued
    compensation and related costs” on the consolidated balance
    sheets. In fiscal years 2006 and 2005, the changes in net
    unrealized holding gains/losses in the trading portfolio
    included in earnings were a net loss of $4.2 million and a
    net gain of $2.4 million, respectively.

Long-term investments generally mature in less than three years.

Note 5: Derivative
    Financial Instruments

Cash Flow
    Hedges

Starbucks, which includes subsidiaries that use their local
    currency as their functional currency, enters into cash flow
    derivative instruments to hedge portions of anticipated revenue
    streams and inventory purchases. Current forward contracts,
    which comprise the majority of the Company’s derivative
    instruments, hedge monthly forecasted revenue transactions
    denominated in Japanese yen and Canadian dollars, as well as
    forecasted inventory purchases denominated primarily in
    U.S. dollars for foreign operations. The Company also has
    swap contracts to hedge a small portion of its forecasted
    U.S. fluid milk purchases and futures contracts to hedge
    the variable price component for certain of its

price-to-be-fixed

green coffee purchase contracts.

The Company had accumulated net derivative losses of
    $3.2 million, net of taxes, in other comprehensive income
    as of October 1, 2006, related to cash flow hedges. Of this
    amount, $1.8 million of net derivative losses pertain to
    hedging instruments that will be dedesignated within
    12 months and will also continue to experience fair value
    changes before affecting earnings. For the

52-week

period ended October 1, 2006, net fair value losses of
    $0.1 million were recognized into net earnings for
    derecognized cash flow hedges. No cash flow hedges were
    discontinued and no ineffectiveness was recognized during the

52-week

period ended October 2, 2005. Current contracts will expire
    within 24 months.

Net
    Investment Hedges

Net investment derivative instruments are used to hedge the
    Company’s equity method investment in Starbucks Coffee
    Japan, Ltd. as well as the Company’s net investments in its
    Canadian and United Kingdom subsidiaries, to minimize foreign
    currency exposure. The Company applies the

spot-to-spot

method for these forward foreign exchange contracts, and under
    this method the change in fair value of the forward contracts
    attributable to the changes in spot exchange rates (the
    effective portion) is reported in other comprehensive income.
    The remaining change in fair value of the forward contract (the
    ineffective portion) is reclassified into earnings in
    “Interest and other income, net.” The Company had


STARBUCKS
    CORPORATION, FORM 10-K


accumulated net derivative losses of $3.2 million, net of
    taxes, in other comprehensive income as of October 1, 2006,
    related to net investment derivative hedges. Current contracts
    expire within 33 months.

In January 2006, Starbucks acquired
    all of the equity interests in this entity. Previously the
    Company owned 5% of Coffee Partners Hawaii and accounted for it
    under the equity method of accounting because it was a general
    partnership. From the date of acquisition, the consolidation
    method of accounting was applied.

The Company has licensed the rights to produce and distribute
    Starbucks branded products to two partnerships in which the
    Company holds 50% equity interests. The North American Coffee
    Partnership with the Pepsi-Cola Company develops and distributes
    Frappuccino

®

bottled beverages and Starbucks
    DoubleShot

®

espresso drinks. The Starbucks Ice Cream Partnership with
    Dreyer’s Grand Ice Cream, Inc., develops and distributes
    superpremium ice creams. The remaining entities operate licensed
    Starbucks retail stores.

During fiscal 2004, Starbucks acquired an equity interest in its
    licensed operations of Malaysia. During fiscal 2003, Starbucks
    increased its ownership of its licensed operations in Austria,
    Shanghai, Spain, Switzerland and Taiwan. The carrying amount of
    these investments was $24.3 million more than the
    underlying equity in net assets due to acquired goodwill, which
    is not subject to amortization in accordance with
    SFAS No. 142 “Goodwill and Other Intangible
    Assets.” Goodwill is evaluated for impairment in accordance
    with APB Opinion No. 18, “The Equity Method of
    Accounting for Investments in Common Stock.” No impairment
    was recorded during fiscal years 2006, 2005 or 2004.

The Company’s share of income and losses is included in
    “Income from equity investees” on the consolidated
    statements of earnings. Also included is the Company’s
    proportionate share of gross margin resulting from coffee and
    other product sales to, and royalty and license fee revenues
    generated from equity investees. Revenues generated from these
    related parties, net of eliminations, were $94.2 million,
    $86.1 million and $80.7 million in fiscal years 2006,
    2005 and 2004, respectively. Related costs of sales, net of
    eliminations, were $47.5 million, $43.3 million and
    $41.2 million in fiscal years 2006, 2005 and 2004,
    respectively. As of October 1, 2006 and October 2,
    2005, there were $17.7 million and $16.7 million of
    accounts receivable, respectively, on the consolidated balance
    sheets from equity investees related to product sales and store
    license fees.

As of October 1, 2006, the aggregate market value of the
    Company’s investment in Starbucks Coffee Japan, Ltd., was
    approximately $234.1 million based on its available quoted
    market price.

Cost
    Method

The Company has equity interests in entities to develop
    Starbucks licensed retail stores in Hong Kong, Mexico, Cyprus
    and Greece. As of October 1, 2006, and October 2,
    2005, management determined that the estimated fair values of
    each cost method investment exceeded the related carrying values
    (no unrealized fair value losses). There were no realized losses
    recorded for

other-than-temporary

impairments during fiscal years 2006, 2005 or 2004.


STARBUCKS
    CORPORATION, FORM 10-K


Starbucks has the ability to acquire additional interests in
    some of its cost method investees at certain intervals.
    Depending on the Company’s total percentage of ownership
    interest and its ability to exercise significant influence over
    financial and operating policies, additional investments may
    require the retroactive application of the equity method of
    accounting.

Other
    Investments

Starbucks has investments in privately held equity securities,
    that are also accounted for under the cost method, whose
    carrying values approximate fair value. There were no realized
    losses generated from

other-than-temporary

impairment during fiscal 2006, 2005 or 2004.

Note 9: Other
    Intangible Assets and Goodwill

As of October 1, 2006, indefinite-lived intangibles were
    $34.1 million and definite-lived intangibles, which
    collectively had a remaining weighted average useful life of
    approximately eight years, were $3.9 million, net of
    accumulated amortization of $3.4 million. As of
    October 2, 2005, indefinite-lived intangibles were
    $31.6 million and definite-lived intangibles, which
    collectively had a remaining weighted average useful life of
    approximately six years, were $3.8 million, net of
    accumulated amortization of $2.1 million. The increase in
    indefinite-lived intangibles was primarily due to ongoing
    trademark activity. Amortization expense for definite-lived
    intangibles was $1.2 million, $0.8 million and
    $0.5 million during fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004,
    respectively.

During fiscal 2006, the United States operating segment
    increased its equity ownership in its licensed operations in
    Hawaii. During fiscal 2006, the International operating segment
    increased its equity ownership in its licensed operations in
    Puerto Rico and made adjustments reducing goodwill upon the
    finalization of the purchase price of its Southern China
    operations, for which it acquired majority ownership in the
    fiscal fourth quarter of 2005. The goodwill associated with the
    Global CPG segment consists of portions allocated from the
    Company’s fiscal 1999 acquisition of Tazo Tea Company and
    fiscal 2003 acquisition of Seattle Coffee Company, the parent
    company of Seattle’s Best Coffee LLC and Torrefazione
    Italia LLC.

Note 10: Long-term
    Debt and Short-term Borrowings

In August 2005, the Company entered into a $500 million
    unsecured five-year revolving credit facility (the
    “facility”) with various banks, of which
    $100 million may be used for issuances of letters of
    credit. The facility is available for working capital, capital
    expenditures and other corporate purposes, which may include
    acquisitions and share repurchases. In August 2006, the Company
    increased its borrowing capacity under the facility to
    $1 billion, as provided in the original credit facility.
    The interest rate for borrowings under the facility ranges from
    0.150% to 0.275% over LIBOR or an alternate base rate, which is
    the greater of the bank prime rate or the Federal Funds Rate
    plus 0.50%. The specific spread over LIBOR will depend upon the
    Company’s performance under specified financial criteria.

As of October 1, 2006, the Company had $700 million
    outstanding, as well as a letter of credit of $11.9 million
    which reduces the borrowing capacity under the credit facility.
    For the fiscal year ended October 1, 2006, the Company had
    additional borrowings of $1.4 billion under the facility
    and made principal repayments of $993 million. As of
    October 2, 2005, the Company had $277 million
    outstanding, with no letters of credit. The weighted average
    contractual interest rates at October 1, 2006 and
    October 2, 2005 were 5.5% and 4.0% respectively. The
    facility contains provisions that require the Company to
    maintain compliance with certain covenants, including the
    maintenance of certain financial ratios. As of October 1,
    2006 and October 2, 2005, the Company was in compliance
    with each of these covenants.

In September 1999, Starbucks purchased the land and building
    comprising its York County, Pennsylvania roasting plant and
    distribution facility for a total purchase price of
    $12.9 million. At the time of purchase, the Company assumed
    related loans totaling $7.7 million from the York County
    Industrial Development Corporation. As of October 1, 2006,
    the Company had $2.7 million outstanding. The remaining
    maturities of these loans range from four to five years, with
    interest rates from 0.0% to 2.0%.

Interest expense, net of interest capitalized, was
    $8.4 million, $1.3 million and $0.4 million in
    fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. In fiscal 2006,
    $2.7 million of interest expense was capitalized for new
    store construction and included in “Property, plant and
    equipment, net,” on the consolidated balance sheet. No
    interest was capitalized in fiscal 2005 or 2004.

The deferred rent liabilities as of October 1, 2006 and
    October 2, 2005, represent amounts for tenant improvement
    allowances, rent escalation clauses and rent holidays related to
    certain operating leases. The Company amortizes deferred rent
    over the terms of the leases as reductions to rent expense on
    the consolidated statements of earnings.

Asset retirement liabilities represent the estimated fair value
    of the Company’s future costs of removing leasehold
    improvements at the termination of leases related to certain of
    its leased stores and administrative facilities. The Company
    adopted this new accounting requirement on the last day of
    fiscal 2006, as discussed in more detail in Note 1.

For operations accounted for under the consolidation method, but
    in which Starbucks owns less than 100% of the equity interests,
    long-term liabilities are maintained for the collective
    ownership interests of minority shareholders. As of
    October 1, 2006 and October 2, 2005, Starbucks had
    less than 100% ownership in Coffee Concepts (Southern China)
    Ltd. as well as in Chengdu Starbucks Coffee Company Limited and
    Urban Coffee Opportunities, LLC.

The other remaining long-term liabilities generally include
    obligations to be settled or paid for one year beyond each
    respective fiscal year end, for items such as hedging
    instruments, guarantees (see Note 18), donation commitments
    and the long-term portion of capital lease obligations.

The Company has subleases related to certain of its operating
    lease agreements. During fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, the Company
    recognized sublease income of $5.7 million,
    $4.3 million and $4.0 million, respectively.

The Company had capital lease obligations of $4.1 million
    and $2.6 million as of October 1, 2006 and
    October 2, 2005, respectively. As of October 1, 2006,
    the current portion of the total obligation was
    $1.7 million and was included in “Other accrued
    expenses” and the remaining long-term portion of
    $2.4 million was included in “Other long-term
    liabilities” on the consolidated balance sheet. Capital
    lease obligations expire at various dates, with the latest
    maturity in 2020. Assets held under capital leases are included
    in “Property, plant and equipment, net,” on the
    consolidated balance sheets.

Note 13: Shareholders’
    Equity

In addition to 1.2 billion shares of authorized common
    stock with $0.001 par value per share, the Company has
    authorized 7.5 million shares of preferred stock, none of
    which was outstanding at October 1, 2006.

Under the Company’s authorized share repurchase program,
    Starbucks acquired 25.6 million shares at an average price
    of $32.34 for a total accrual-based cost of $828 million in
    fiscal 2006. The related cash amount used to repurchase shares
    in fiscal 2006 totaled $854 million. The difference between
    the two amounts represents the effect of the net change in
    unsettled trades totaling $26 million from October 2,
    2005. Starbucks acquired 45.1 million shares at an average
    price of $25.26 for a total cost of $1.1 billion during
    fiscal 2005. During fiscal 2006, the Starbucks Board of
    Directors authorized additional repurchases of 25 million
    shares of the Company’s common stock, and as of
    October 1, 2006, there were 21.5 million remaining
    shares authorized for repurchase. Share repurchases were funded
    through cash, cash equivalents,

available-for-sale

securities and borrowings under the revolving credit facility
    and were part of the Company’s active capital management
    program.

Comprehensive
    Income

Comprehensive income includes all changes in equity during the
    period, except those resulting from transactions with
    shareholders and subsidiaries of the Company. It has two
    components: net earnings and other comprehensive income.
    Accumulated other comprehensive income reported on the
    Company’s consolidated balance sheets consists of foreign
    currency translation adjustments and the unrealized gains and
    losses, net of applicable taxes, on

available-for-sale

securities and on derivative instruments designated and
    qualifying as cash flow and net investment hedges.

    during fiscal 2005 of $8.7 million was primarily due to the
    strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the euro, British
    pound sterling and Japanese yen. The favorable translation
    adjustment change during fiscal 2004 of $19.9 million was
    primarily due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar against
    several currencies, such as the British pound sterling, euro,

Note 14: Employee
    Stock and Benefit Plans

Stock
    Option Plans

Stock options to purchase the Company’s common stock are
    granted at prices at or above the fair market value on the date
    of grant. Options generally become exercisable in three or four
    equal installments beginning a year from the date of grant and
    generally expire 10 years from the date of grant. Options
    granted to non-employee directors generally vest over one year.
    Nearly all outstanding stock options are non-qualified stock
    options.

The fair value of each stock option granted is estimated on the
    date of grant using the BSM option valuation model. The
    assumptions used to calculate the fair value of options granted
    are evaluated and revised, as necessary, to reflect market
    conditions and the Company’s experience. Options granted
    are valued using the multiple option valuation approach, and the
    resulting expense is recognized using the graded, or
    accelerated, attribution method, consistent with the multiple
    option valuation approach. Compensation expense is recognized
    only for those options expected to vest, with forfeitures

STARBUCKS
    CORPORATION, FORM 10-K



estimated at the date of grant based on the Company’s
    historical experience and future expectations. Prior to the
    adoption of SFAS 123R, the effect of forfeitures on the pro
    forma expense amounts was recognized as the forfeitures occurred.

The following summarizes all stock option transactions from

    nonvested stock options was approximately $72 million,
    before income taxes, and is expected to be recognized over a
    weighted average period of approximately 22 months. During
    the fiscal year ended October 1, 2006, the total intrinsic
    value of stock options exercised was $327 million. During
    the fiscal year ended October 1, 2006, the total fair value
    of options vested was $95 million.

The Company issues new shares of common stock upon exercise of
    stock options.

As of October 1, 2006, there were 62.3 million shares

    common stock. The employee’s purchase price is 85% of the
    lesser of the fair market value of the stock on the first
    business day or the last business day of the quarterly offering
    period.


STARBUCKS
    CORPORATION, FORM 10-K


Employees may purchase shares having a fair market value of up
    to $25,000 (measured as of the first day of each quarterly
    offering period for each calendar year). The total number of
    shares issuable under the plan is 32.0 million. There were
    1.5 million shares issued under the plan during the fiscal
    year ended October 1, 2006 at an average price of $26.81.
    There were 1.5 million shares issued under the plan during
    the fiscal year ended October 2, 2005 at an average price
    of $21.27. There were 2.0 million shares issued under the
    plan during the fiscal year ended October 3, 2004 at an
    average price of $14.23. Since inception of the plan,
    16.3 million shares have been purchased, leaving
    15.7 million shares available for future issuance. Of the
    approximately 73,000 employees eligible to participate,
    approximately 23,000 were participants in the plan as of
    October 1, 2006.

Starbucks has an additional employee stock purchase plan in the
    United Kingdom that allows eligible U.K. employees to save
    toward the purchase of the Company’s common stock. Under
    the Save-As-You-Earn (“SAYE”) plan the employee’s
    purchase price is 85% of the fair value of the stock on the
    first business day of a three-year offering period. The total
    number of shares issuable under the plan is 1.2 million.
    There were 36,348 shares issued under the plan during the
    fiscal year ended October 1, 2006 at an average price of
    $8.84, and 1.1 million shares remain available for future
    issuance. There were 25,382 shares issued under the plan
    during the fiscal year ended October 2, 2005 at an average
    price of $7.93. There were 8,960 shares issued under the
    plan during the fiscal year ended October 3, 2004 at an
    average price of $9.47. During fiscal 2004, the Company
    suspended future offerings under this plan. The last offering
    was made in December 2002 and matured in February 2006.

A new employee stock purchase plan, the U.K. Share Incentive
    Plan, was introduced during fiscal 2004 to replace the SAYE
    plan. The plan allows eligible U.K. employees to purchase shares
    of common stock through payroll deductions during six-month
    offering periods at the lesser of the fair market value of the
    stock at the beginning or at the end of the offering period. The
    Company will award one matching share for each six shares
    purchased under the plan. The total number of shares issuable
    under the plan is 1.4 million. There were
    11,138 shares issued under the plan during the fiscal year
    ended October 1, 2006 at an average price of $26.42. There
    were 10,732 shares issued under the plan during the fiscal
    year ended October 2, 2005 at an average price of $22.08.
    As of October 1, 2006, 1.38 million shares were
    available for future issuance.

Deferred
    Stock Plan

Starbucks has a deferred stock plan for certain key employees
    that enables participants in the plan to defer receipt of
    ownership of common shares from the exercise of nonqualified
    stock options. The minimum deferral period is five years. As of
    October 1, 2006, receipt of 3,394,200 shares was
    deferred under the terms of this plan. The rights to receive
    these shares, represented by common stock units, are included in
    the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share as
    common stock equivalents.

Defined
    Contribution Plans

Starbucks maintains voluntary defined contribution plans
    covering eligible employees as defined in the plan documents.
    Participating employees may elect to defer and contribute a
    portion of their compensation to the plans up to limits stated
    in the plan documents, not to exceed the dollar amounts set by
    applicable laws. For employees in the United States and Canada,
    the Company matched 25% to 150% of each employee’s eligible
    contribution based on years of service, up to a maximum of the
    first 4% of each employee’s compensation. The
    Company’s matching contributions to all plans were
    approximately $19.3 million, $12.4 million and
    $9.8 million in fiscal years 2006, 2005 and 2004,
    respectively.

U.S. income and foreign withholding taxes have not been
    provided on approximately $178.5 million of cumulative
    undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries and equity
    investees. The Company intends to reinvest these earnings for
    the foreseeable future. If these amounts were distributed to the
    United States, in the form of dividends or otherwise, the
    Company would be subject to additional U.S. income taxes.
    Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred income tax
    liabilities on these earnings is not practicable because such
    liability, if any, is dependent on circumstances existing if and
    when remittance occurs.

In December 2004, the FASB issued Staff Position

No. FAS 109-2,

“Accounting and Disclosure Guidance for the Foreign
    Earnings Repatriation Provision within the American Jobs
    Creation Act of 2004”

(“FSP 109-2”).

The American Jobs Creation Act allowed a special one-time
    dividends received deduction on the repatriation of certain
    foreign earnings to a U.S. taxpayer (repatriation
    provision), provided certain criteria are met. The law allowed
    the Company to make an election to repatriate earnings through
    2006. During the Company’s fiscal third quarter of 2006,
    Starbucks completed its evaluation and elected to waive
    repatriation of earnings under this provision.

The Company will establish a valuation allowance if it is more
    likely than not that these items will either expire before the
    Company is able to realize their benefits, or that future
    deductibility is uncertain. Periodically, the valuation
    allowance is reviewed and adjusted based on management’s
    assessments of realizable deferred tax assets. The valuation
    allowance as of October 1, 2006 was related to net
    operating losses of consolidated foreign subsidiaries. The
    valuation allowance as of October 2, 2005 was related to
    capital loss carryforwards and net operating losses of
    consolidated foreign subsidiaries. The net change in the total
    valuation allowance for the years ended October 1, 2006,
    and October 2, 2005, was an increase of $0.7 million
    and $7.1 million, respectively.

As of October 1, 2006, the Company has foreign tax credit
    carryforwards of $20.9 million with expiration dates
    between fiscal years 2010 and 2016. As of the end of fiscal
    2006, the Company also has capital loss carryforwards of
    $1.2 million, expiring in fiscal year 2010.

Taxes currently payable of $50.6 million and
    $41.5 million are included in “Accrued taxes” on
    the consolidated balance sheets as of October 1, 2006, and
    October 2, 2005, respectively.

The Company has established, and periodically reviews and
    re-evaluates, an estimated contingent tax liability to provide
    for the possibility of unfavorable outcomes in tax matters.
    Contingent tax liabilities totaled $27.6 million and
    $33.1 million as of October 1, 2006, and
    October 2, 2005, respectively, and are included in
    “Accrued taxes” on the consolidated balance sheets.
    These liabilities are provided for in accordance with the
    requirements of SFAS 5. The Company believes its contingent
    tax liabilities are adequate in the event the tax positions are
    not ultimately upheld.

In July 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48
    (“FIN 48”), “Accounting for Uncertainty in
    Income Taxes, an interpretation of FASB Statement
    No. 109,” which seeks to reduce the diversity in
    practice associated with the accounting and reporting for
    uncertainty in income tax provisions. This interpretation
    prescribes a comprehensive model for the financial statement
    recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of
    uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in income
    tax returns. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning
    after December 15, 2006 and the Company will adopt the new
    requirements in its fiscal first quarter of 2008. The cumulative
    effects, if any, of adopting FIN 48 will be recorded as an
    adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the
    period of adoption. The Company has not determined the impact,
    if any, of adopting FIN 48 on its consolidated financial
    statements.

Note 17: Related
    Party Transactions

In April 2001, certain members of the Board of Directors and
    other investors, organized as The Basketball Club of Seattle,
    LLC (“The Basketball Club”), purchased the franchises
    for The Seattle Supersonics and The Seattle Storm basketball
    teams. An executive officer of the Company and member of the
    Board of Directors, Howard Schultz, owned a controlling interest
    in The Basketball Club, until the franchises were sold to an
    unrelated third party in October 2006. Starbucks paid
    approximately $0.6 million, $0.8 million and
    $0.8 million during fiscal years 2006, 2005 and 2004,
    respectively, for team sponsorships and ticket purchases. Terms
    of the team sponsorship agreements did not change as a result of
    the related party relationship.

In June 2005, a then-member of the Company’s Board of
    Directors was appointed president and chief financial officer of
    Oracle Corporation. Starbucks had a pre-existing business
    relationship with Oracle related to financial systems and
    systems consulting at the time of the appointment and Starbucks
    continued to make payments for supplies and services subsequent
    to June 2005 in the ordinary course of business. These payments
    totaled approximately $2.7 million from the inception of
    the related party relationship in fiscal 2005 through
    November 15, 2005 when the former Board member’s
    employment relationship with Oracle ended.

Note 18: Commitments
    and Contingencies

The Company has unconditionally guaranteed the repayment of
    certain Japanese yen-denominated bank loans and related interest
    and fees of an unconsolidated equity investee, Starbucks Coffee
    Japan, Ltd. The guarantees continue until the loans, including
    accrued interest and fees, have been paid in full, with the
    final loan amount due in 2014. The maximum amount is limited to
    the sum of unpaid principal and interest amounts, as well as
    other related expenses. These amounts will vary based on
    fluctuations in the yen foreign exchange rate. As of
    October 1, 2006, the maximum amount of the guarantees was
    approximately $6.0 million. Since there has been no
    modification of these loan guarantees subsequent to the
    Company’s adoption of FASB Interpretation No. 45,
    “Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements
    for Guarantees, Including Indebtedness of Others,”
    Starbucks has applied the disclosure provisions only and has not
    recorded the guarantee on its consolidated balance sheet.

Starbucks has commitments under which it unconditionally
    guarantees its proportionate share, or 50%, of certain
    borrowings of unconsolidated equity investees. The
    Company’s maximum exposure under these commitments is
    approximately $7.2 million, excluding interest and other
    related costs, and the majority of these commitments expire in


STARBUCKS
    CORPORATION, FORM 10-K


2007 and 2011. As of October 1, 2006, the Company recorded
    $3.0 million to “Equity and other investments”
    and “Other long-term liabilities” on the consolidated
    balance sheet for the fair value of the guarantee arrangements.

Coffee brewing and espresso equipment sold to customers through
    Company-operated and licensed retail stores, as well as
    equipment sold to the Company’s licensees for use in retail
    licensing operations, are under warranty for defects in
    materials and workmanship for a period ranging from 12 to
    24 months. Effective fiscal 2006, the Company elected to
    discontinue repairing brewing machines and instead offer an
    exchange to customers as a general right of return for any of
    its products. As a result, Starbucks maintains a sales return
    allowance based on historical patterns to reduce related
    revenues for estimated future product returns. Prior to fiscal
    2006, the Company established an accrual for estimated warranty
    costs at the time of sale, also based on historical experience.
    Product warranty costs and changes to the related accrual were
    not significant for the fiscal years ended October 1, 2006
    and October 2, 2005.

Legal
    Proceedings

On June 3, 2004, two then-current employees of the Company
    filed a lawsuit, entitled

Sean Pendlebury and Laurel
    Overton v. Starbucks Coffee Company,

in the
    U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida
    claiming the Company violated requirements of the Fair Labor
    Standards Act (“FLSA”). The suit alleges that the
    Company misclassified its retail store managers as exempt from
    the overtime provisions of the FLSA, and that each manager
    therefore is entitled to overtime compensation for any week in
    which he or she worked more than 40 hours during the three
    years before joining the suit as a plaintiff, and for as long as
    they remain a manager thereafter. Plaintiffs seek to represent
    themselves and all similarly situated U.S. current and
    former store managers of the Company. Plaintiffs seek
    reimbursement for an unspecified amount of unpaid overtime
    compensation, liquidated damages, attorney’s fees and
    costs. Plaintiffs also filed on June 3, 2004 a motion for
    conditional collective action treatment and court-supervised
    notice to additional putative class members under the opt-in
    procedures in section 16(b) of the FLSA. On January 3,
    2005, the district court entered an order authorizing nationwide
    notice of the lawsuit to all current and former store managers
    employed by the Company during the three years before the suit
    was filed. The Company filed a motion for summary judgment as to
    the claims of the named plaintiffs on September 24, 2004.
    The court denied that motion because this case was in the early
    stages of discovery, but the court noted that the Company may
    resubmit this motion at a later date. Starbucks believes that
    the plaintiffs are properly classified as exempt under the
    federal wage laws. The Company cannot estimate the possible loss
    to the Company, if any and believes that a loss in this case is
    unlikely. Trial is currently set for August 2007. The Company
    intends to vigorously defend the lawsuit.

On October 8, 2004, a former hourly employee of the Company
    filed a lawsuit in San Diego County Superior Court entitled

Jou Chau v. Starbucks Coffee Company.

The lawsuit
    alleges that the Company violated the California Labor Code by
    allowing shift supervisors to receive tips. More specifically,
    the lawsuit alleges that since shift supervisors direct the work
    of baristas, they qualify as “agents” of the Company
    and are therefore excluded from receiving tips under California
    Labor Code Section 351, which prohibits employers and their
    agents from collecting or receiving tips left by patrons for
    other employees. The lawsuit further alleges that because the
    tipping practices violate the Labor Code, they also are unfair
    practices under the California Unfair Competition Law. In
    addition to recovery of an unspecified amount of tips
    distributed to shift supervisors, the lawsuit seeks penalties
    under California Labor Code Section 203 for willful failure
    to pay wages due. Plaintiff also seeks attorneys’ fees and
    costs. On March 30, 2006, the Court issued an order
    certifying the case as a class action, with the plaintiff
    representing a class of all persons employed as baristas in the
    state of California since October 8, 2000. The size of the
    class has yet to be determined. The Company cannot estimate the
    possible loss to the Company, if any. The Company believes its
    practices comply with California law, and the Company intends to
    vigorously defend the lawsuit. Trial is currently set for May
    2007.

On March 11, 2005, a former employee of the Company filed a
    lawsuit, entitled

James Falcon v. Starbucks Corporation
    and Does 1 through 100

, in the U.S. District Court for
    the Southern District of Texas claiming that the Company
    violated requirements of the FLSA. Specifically, the plaintiff
    claims that the Company misclassified its retail assistant store
    managers as exempt from the overtime provisions of the FLSA and
    that each assistant manager therefore is entitled to overtime
    compensation for any week in which he or she worked more than
    40 hours during the three years before joining the suit as
    a plaintiff, and for as long as they remain an assistant manager
    thereafter. On August 18, 2005, the plaintiff

STARBUCKS
    CORPORATION, FORM 10-K



amended his complaint to include allegations that he and other
    retail assistant store managers were not paid overtime
    compensation for all hours worked in excess of 40 hours in
    a work week after they were re-classified as non-exempt
    employees in September 2002. In both claims, Plaintiff seeks to
    represent himself and a putative class of all current and former
    assistant store managers employed by the Company in the United
    States from March 11, 2002 until the present. He also
    seeks, on behalf of himself and the class, reimbursement for an
    unspecified amount of unpaid overtime compensation, liquidated
    damages, injunctive relief, and attorney’s fees and costs.
    On September 13, 2005, the plaintiff filed a motion for
    conditional collective action treatment and court-supervised
    notice to all putative class members under the opt-in procedures
    in section 16(b) of the FLSA. On November 29, 2005,
    the court entered an order authorizing notice to the class of
    the existence of the lawsuit and their opportunity to join as
    plaintiffs. The Company has a policy requiring that all
    non-exempt partners, including assistant store managers, be paid
    for all hours worked, including any hours worked in excess of
    40 per week. The Company also believes that this policy is,
    and at all relevant times has been, communicated and followed
    consistently. Further, the Company believes that the plaintiff
    and other assistant store managers were properly classified as
    exempt under the FLSA prior to September 2002. The Company
    cannot estimate the possible loss to the Company, if any, and
    believes that a loss in this case is unlikely. No trial date has
    been set. The Company intends to vigorously defend the lawsuit.

The Company is party to various other legal proceedings arising
    in the ordinary course of its business, but it is not currently
    a party to any legal proceeding that management believes would
    have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial
    position or results of operations of the Company.

Note 19: Segment
    Reporting

Segment information is prepared on the same basis that the
    Company’s management reviews financial information for
    operational decision making purposes. Beginning in the fiscal
    fourth quarter of 2006, the Company increased its reporting
    segments from two to three to include a Global CPG segment in
    addition to the United States and International segments. This
    additional operating segment reflects the culmination of
    internal management realignments in fiscal 2006, and the
    successful development and launch of certain branded products in
    the United States and internationally, commencing in fiscal 2005
    and continuing throughout fiscal 2006. Additionally, with the
    100% acquisition of the Company’s operations in Hawaii in
    fiscal 2006 and the shift in internal management of this market
    to the United States, these operations have been moved from the
    International segment into the United States segment. Segment
    information for all prior periods presented has been revised to
    reflect these changes.

United
    States

The Company’s United States operations (“United
    States”) represent 83% of total Company-operated retail
    revenues, 57% of total specialty revenues and 79% of total net
    revenues. United States operations sell coffee and other
    beverages, whole bean coffees, complementary food, coffee
    brewing equipment and merchandise primarily through
    Company-operated retail stores. Specialty Operations within the
    United States include licensed retail stores, foodservice
    accounts and other initiatives related to the Company’s
    core business.

International

The Company’s International operations
    (“International”) represent the remaining 17% of
    Company-operated retail revenues and 18% of total specialty
    revenues as well as 17% of total net revenues. International
    operations sell coffee and other beverages, whole bean coffees,
    complementary food, coffee brewing equipment and merchandise
    through Company-operated retail stores in the United Kingdom,
    Canada, Thailand, Australia, Germany, China, Singapore, Puerto
    Rico, Chile and Ireland. Specialty Operations in International
    primarily include retail store licensing operations in more than
    25 countries and foodservice accounts in Canada and the United
    Kingdom. The Company’s International operations are in
    various early stages of development that require a more
    extensive support organization, relative to the current levels
    of revenue and operating income, than in the United States.


STARBUCKS
    CORPORATION, FORM 10-K


Global
    Consumer Products Group

The Company’s CPG segment represents 25% of total specialty
    revenues and 4% of total net revenues. CPG operations sell a
    selection of whole bean and ground coffees as well as a
    selection of premium
    Tazo

®

teas through licensing arrangements with Kraft and other grocery
    and warehouse club stores in United States and international
    markets. CPG operations also produce and sell

ready-to-drink

beverages which include, among others, bottled
    Frappuccino

®

coffee drinks and Starbucks
    DoubleShot

®

espresso drinks, and
    Starbucks

®

superpremium ice creams, through its joint venture partnerships
    and
    Starbucks

tm

Coffee and Cream Liqueurs through a marketing and distribution
    agreement. Through other manufacturing, distribution and
    co-packing agreements, the Company produces and sells

ready-to-drink

products in international locations.

The accounting policies of the operating segments are the same
    as those described in the summary of significant accounting
    policies in Note 1. Operating income represents earnings
    before “Interest and other income, net” and
    “Income taxes.” Allocations of portions of corporate
    overhead, interest or income taxes to the segments are not
    significant. Identifiable assets by segment are those assets

AUDITORS’
    REPORT ON CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Starbucks
    Corporation

Seattle, Washington

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    Starbucks Corporation and subsidiaries (the “Company”)
    as of October 1, 2006 and October 2, 2005, and the
    related consolidated statements of earnings, shareholders’
    equity, and cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the
    period ended October 1, 2006. These financial statements
    are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
    responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
    statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present
    fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
    Starbucks Corporation and subsidiaries as of October 1,
    2006 and October 2, 2005, and the results of their
    operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
    the period ended October 1, 2006, in conformity with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
    America.

As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial
    statements, the Company changed its method of accounting for
    stock-based compensation upon adoption of Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards No. 123(R), “Share-Based
    Payment” and the Company changed its method of accounting
    for conditional asset retirement obligations upon adoption of
    Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 47,
    “Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations -
    an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143.”

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting as of October 1, 2006, based on
    criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
    the Treadway Commission and our report dated December 14,
    2006 expressed an unqualified opinion on management’s
    assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal
    control over financial reporting and an unqualified opinion on
    the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting.

AUDITORS’
    REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Starbucks
    Corporation

Seattle, Washington

We have audited management’s assessment, included in the
    accompanying Report of Management on Internal Control over
    Financial Reporting, that Starbucks Corporation and subsidiaries
    (the “Company”) maintained effective internal control
    over financial reporting as of October 1, 2006, based on
    criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
    the Treadway Commission. The Company’s management is
    responsible for maintaining effective internal control over
    financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness
    of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility
    is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an
    opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal
    control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
    management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design
    and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
    such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
    circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
    basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed by, or under the supervision of, the
    company’s principal executive and principal financial
    officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected
    by the company’s board of directors, management, and other
    personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over
    financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or
    improper management override of controls, material misstatements
    due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a
    timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the
    effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting
    to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may
    become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the
    degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
    deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that the Company
    maintained effective internal control over financial reporting
    as of October 1, 2006, is fairly stated, in all material
    respects, based on the criteria established in Internal
    Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee
    of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Also in
    our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects,
    effective internal control over financial reporting as of
    October 1, 2006, based on the criteria established in
    Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated financial statements as of and for the fiscal year
    ended October 1, 2006 of the Company and our report dated
    December 14, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion on those
    financial statements and included an explanatory paragraph
    regarding the change in accounting for stock-based compensation
    upon adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    No. 123(R), “Share-Based Payment” and the change
    in accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations upon
    adoption of Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation
    No. 47, “Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement
    Obligations — an interpretation of FASB
    Statement 143.”

Item 9A. Controls
    and Procedures

DISCLOSURE
    CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures that
    are designed to ensure that material information required to be
    disclosed in the Company’s periodic reports filed or
    submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended
    (the “Exchange Act”), is recorded, processed,
    summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
    SEC’s rules and forms.

During the quarter the Company carried out an evaluation, under
    the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s
    management, including the chief executive officer and the chief
    financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and
    operation of the disclosure controls and procedures, as defined
    in

Rules 13a-15(e)

and

15d-15(e)

under the Exchange Act. Based upon that evaluation, the
    Company’s chief executive officer and chief financial
    officer concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls
    and procedures were effective, as of the end of the period
    covered by this report (October 1, 2006).

During the quarter ended October 1, 2006, there were no
    changes in the Company’s internal control over financial
    reporting (as defined in

Rules 13a-15(f)

and

15d-15(f)

of
    the Exchange Act) that materially affected or are reasonably
    likely to materially affect internal control over financial
    reporting.

REPORT OF
    MANAGEMENT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL
    REPORTING

The management of Starbucks is responsible for establishing and
    maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.
    Internal control over financial reporting is a process to
    provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our
    financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
    America. Internal control over financial reporting includes
    maintaining records that in reasonable detail accurately and
    fairly reflect our transactions; providing reasonable assurance
    that transactions are recorded as necessary for preparation of
    our financial statements; providing reasonable assurance that
    receipts and expenditures are made in accordance with management
    authorization; and providing reasonable assurance that
    unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of company assets
    that could have a material effect on our financial statements
    would be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Because of its
    inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting
    is not intended to provide absolute assurance that a
    misstatement of our financial statements would be prevented or
    detected.

Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our
    internal control over financial reporting based on the framework
    and criteria established in

Internal Control —
    Integrated Framework

, issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission. This evaluation
    included review of the documentation of controls, evaluation of
    the design effectiveness of controls, testing of the operating
    effectiveness of controls and a conclusion on this evaluation.
    Based on this evaluation, management concluded that the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting was
    effective as of October 1, 2006. Management’s
    assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over
    financial reporting as of October 1, 2006 has been audited
    by Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered
    public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is
    included in Item 8 of this Report.
