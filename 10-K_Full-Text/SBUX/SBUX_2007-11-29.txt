TABLE OF
    CONTENTS


PART I

Item 1.

Business

General

Starbucks Corporation (together with its subsidiaries,
    “Starbucks” or the “Company”) was formed in
    1985. Starbucks purchases and roasts high-quality whole bean
    coffees and sells them, along with fresh, rich-brewed coffees,
    Italian-style espresso beverages, cold blended beverages, a
    variety of complementary food items, coffee-related accessories
    and equipment, a selection of premium teas and a line of compact
    discs, primarily through Company-operated retail stores.
    Starbucks also sells coffee and tea products and licenses its
    trademark through other channels and, through certain of its
    equity investees, Starbucks produces and sells ready-to-drink
    beverages which include, among others, bottled
    Frappuccino

®

beverages and Starbucks
    DoubleShot

®

espresso drinks, and a line of superpremium ice creams. All
    channels outside the Company-operated retail stores are
    collectively known as “Specialty Operations.” The
    Company’s objective is to establish Starbucks as one of the
    most recognized and respected brands in the world. To achieve
    this goal, the Company plans to continue expansion of its retail
    operations, to grow its Specialty Operations and to selectively
    pursue other opportunities to leverage the Starbucks brand by
    introducing new products and developing new channels of
    distribution. The Company’s brand portfolio includes
    superpremium
    Tazo

Segment
    Financial Information

Starbucks has three reportable operating segments: United
    States, International and Global Consumer Products Group
    (“CPG”). The United States and International segments
    both include Company-operated retail stores and certain
    components of Specialty Operations. Specialty Operations within
    the United States include licensed retail stores, foodservice
    accounts and other initiatives related to the Company’s
    core business. International specialty operations primarily
    include retail store licensing operations in more than 30
    countries and foodservice accounts in Canada and the United
    Kingdom (“UK”). The CPG segment includes the
    Company’s grocery and warehouse club business as well as
    branded products operations worldwide. Financial information
    about Starbucks segments is included in Note 18 to the
    consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of
    this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

(“Form 10-K”

or “Report”).

Company-operated
    Retail Stores

The Company’s retail goal is to become the leading retailer
    and brand of coffee in each of its target markets by selling the
    finest quality coffee and related products and by providing each
    customer a unique

Starbucks Experience

. The

Starbucks
    Experience

, or third place after home and work, is built
    upon superior customer service as well as clean and
    well-maintained Company-operated retail stores that reflect the
    personalities of the communities in which they operate, thereby
    building a high degree of customer loyalty. Starbucks strategy
    for expanding its retail business is to increase its market
    share primarily by opening additional stores in existing markets
    and opening stores in new markets where the opportunity exists
    to become the leading specialty coffee retailer. In support of
    this strategy, Starbucks opened 1,342 new Company-operated
    stores during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2007
    (“fiscal 2007”). Starbucks Company-operated retail
    stores, including 11 Seattle’s Best
    Coffee

®

stores and 4 Hear Music retail stores, accounted for 85% of
    total net revenues during fiscal 2007.

The following table summarizes total Company-operated retail
    store data for the periods indicated:

Store data has been adjusted for the acquisition of the Beijing
    operations by reclassifying historical information from Licensed
    stores to Company-operated stores.

Starbucks retail stores are typically located in high-traffic,
    high-visibility locations. Because the Company can vary the size
    and format, its stores are located in or near a variety of
    settings, including downtown and suburban retail centers, office
    buildings and university campuses. While the Company selectively
    locates stores in shopping malls, it focuses on locations that
    provide convenient access for both pedestrians and drivers. With
    the flexibility in store size and format, the Company also
    locates retail stores in select rural and off-highway locations
    to serve a broader array of customers outside major metropolitan
    markets and further expand brand awareness. To provide a greater
    degree of access and convenience for nonpedestrian customers,
    the Company continues to expand development of Drive Thru retail
    stores. At the end of fiscal 2007, the Company operated
    approximately 2,300 Drive Thru locations, compared to
    approximately 1,600 at the end of fiscal 2006.

All Starbucks stores offer a choice of regular and decaffeinated
    coffee beverages, a broad selection of Italian-style espresso
    beverages, cold blended beverages, iced shaken refreshment
    beverages, a selection of teas and distinctively packaged
    roasted whole bean coffees. Starbucks stores also offer a
    selection of fresh pastries and other food items, sodas, juices,
    bottled water, coffee-making equipment and accessories, a
    selection of compact discs and seasonal novelty items. Each
    Starbucks store varies its product mix depending upon the size
    of the store and its location. Larger stores carry a broad
    selection of the Company’s whole bean coffees in various
    sizes and types of packaging, as well as an assortment of coffee
    and espresso-making equipment and accessories such as coffee
    grinders, coffee filters, storage containers, travel tumblers
    and mugs. Smaller Starbucks stores and kiosks typically sell a
    full line of



coffee beverages, a limited selection of whole bean coffees and
    a few accessories such as travel tumblers and logo mugs. A
    selection of prepared sandwiches and salads were carried in
    approximately 4,800 United States and 1,600 International
    stores, at the end of fiscal 2007. Starbucks continues to expand
    its food warming program in the United States, with over 3,000
    stores as of September 30, 2007 providing warm food items,
    primarily breakfast sandwiches.

The Company’s retail sales mix by product type was as

Specialty
    Operations

Specialty Operations strive to develop the Company’s brands
    outside the Company-operated retail store environment through a
    number of channels. Starbucks strategy is to reach customers
    where they work, travel, shop and dine by establishing
    relationships with prominent third parties that share the
    Company’s values and commitment to quality. These
    relationships take various forms, including licensing
    arrangements, foodservice accounts and other initiatives related
    to the Company’s core businesses. In certain situations,
    Starbucks has an equity ownership interest in licensee
    operations. During fiscal 2007, specialty revenues (which
    include royalties and fees from licensees, as well as product
    sales derived from Specialty Operations) accounted for 15% of
    total net revenues.

Licensing —
    Retail stores

In its licensed retail store operations, the Company leverages
    the expertise of its local partners and shares Starbucks
    operating and store development experience. Licensee partners
    provide improved and, at times, the only access to desirable
    retail space. Most licensees are prominent retailers with
    in-depth market knowledge and access. As part of these
    arrangements, Starbucks receives license fees and royalties and
    sells coffee, tea, compact discs and related products for resale
    in licensed locations. Employees working in licensed retail
    locations are required to follow Starbucks detailed store
    operating procedures and attend training classes similar to
    those given to employees in Company-operated stores.

During fiscal 2007, 723 Starbucks licensed retail stores were
    opened in the United States and, as of September 30, 2007,
    the Company’s U.S. licensees operated 3,891 stores.
    During fiscal 2007, 506 International licensed stores were
    opened. At September 30, 2007, the Company’s
    International operating segment had a total of 2,615 licensed
    retail stores. Product sales to and royalty and license fee
    revenues from U.S. and International licensed retail stores
    accounted for 47% of specialty revenues in fiscal 2007.

At fiscal year end 2007, Starbucks total licensed retail stores
    by region and specific location were as follows:

Licensing —
    Grocery and warehouse club

The Company, through a licensing relationship with Kraft Foods,
    Inc. (“Kraft”), sells a selection of Starbucks,
    Seattle’s Best Coffee and Torrefazione Italia branded
    packaged coffees and
    Tazo

®

teas in grocery and warehouse club stores throughout the United
    States. Kraft manages all distribution, marketing, advertising
    and promotion of these products.

The Company sells packaged coffee and tea internationally both
    directly to warehouse club customers such as Costco and through
    an expanded licensing relationship with Kraft. In February 2007,
    the licensing relationship with Kraft was expanded globally and
    now also includes distribution of packaged coffee in Canada and
    the UK.

By the end of fiscal 2007, the Company’s coffees and teas
    were available in approximately 34,000 grocery and warehouse
    club stores, with 30,000 in the United States and 4,000 in
    International markets. Revenues from this category comprised 23%
    of specialty revenues in fiscal 2007.

Licensing —
    Branded products

The Company licenses the rights to produce and market Starbucks
    branded products through several partnerships both domestically
    and internationally. The North American Coffee Partnership, a
    joint venture with the Pepsi-Cola Company in which Starbucks is
    a 50% equity investor, manufactures and markets ready-to-drink
    beverages, including bottled
    Frappuccino

®

beverages and Starbucks
    DoubleShot

®

espresso drinks. Other partnerships produce and market branded
    products in these categories: superpremium ice cream (joint
    venture with Dreyer’s Grand Ice Cream, Inc.), premium
    coffee liqueur (license agreement with Beam Global
    Spirits & Wine) and chocolate (license agreement with
    The Hershey Company). Internationally, the Company licenses
    Starbucks
    Discoveries

®

,
    a ready-to-drink chilled cup coffee beverage, in Japan, Taiwan
    and South Korea.

Collectively, the revenues from these branded products accounted
    for 3% of specialty revenues in fiscal 2007.

Foodservice

The Company sells whole bean and ground coffees, including the
    Starbucks, Seattle’s Best Coffee and Torrefazione Italia
    brands, as well as a selection of premium
    Tazo

®

teas and other related products, to institutional foodservice
    companies that service business & industry, education,
    healthcare, office coffee distributors, hotels, restaurants,
    airlines and other retailers. The majority of the Company’s
    direct distribution accounts are through national broadline
    distribution networks with SYSCO Corporation and
    U.S. Foodservice

tm

.
    Starbucks foodservice sales, customer service and support
    resources are aligned with those of SYSCO Corporation and
    U.S. Foodservice. Starbucks and Seattle’s Best Coffee
    are the only superpremium national-brand coffees actively
    promoted by SYSCO Corporation.

The Company’s total foodservice operations had
    approximately 18,000 accounts, primarily in the U.S., at fiscal
    year end 2007, compared to approximately 16,200 accounts at
    fiscal year end 2006. Revenues from foodservice accounts
    comprised 26% of total specialty revenues in fiscal 2007.

Other
    Initiatives

Included in this category is the Company’s entertainment
    business, which encompasses multiple music, book, film and
    technology based initiatives designed to appeal to new and
    existing Starbucks customers. Among these initiatives are
    strategic marketing and co-branding arrangements, such as the
    Starbucks XM Café Channel 45 available to all XM Satellite
    Radio subscribers and the availability of wireless broadband
    Internet service in United States and Canadian Company-operated
    retail stores. The entertainment business also includes the Hear
    Music label, an innovative record label and partnership between
    Starbucks Entertainment and Concord Music Group. In fiscal 2007,
    Starbucks and
    Apple

®

announced an exclusive partnership that lets customers
    wirelessly browse, preview, buy and download music from the
    iTunes

®

Wi-Fi Music Store onto their wireless devices while at
    participating Starbucks locations.

The Company has a strategic agreement with Chase Bank USA, N.A.
    and Visa to issue the Starbucks Card
    Duetto

tm

Visa

®

(the “Duetto Card”) in the United States, and a
    similar arrangement with Royal Bank of Canada and Visa



Canada Association to issue the Duetto Card in Canada. The
    Duetto Card combines the functionality of a credit card with the
    convenience of a reloadable Starbucks Card. Through these
    arrangements, Starbucks primarily receives commissions for each
    activated customer account and payments based on credit card
    usage.

Collectively, the operations of these other initiatives
    accounted for 1% of specialty revenues in fiscal 2007.

Product
    Supply

Starbucks is committed to selling only the finest whole bean
    coffees and coffee beverages. To ensure compliance with its
    rigorous coffee standards, Starbucks controls its coffee
    purchasing, roasting and packaging, and the distribution of
    coffee used in its operations. The Company purchases green
    coffee beans from coffee-producing regions around the world and
    custom roasts them to its exacting standards for its many blends
    and single origin coffees.

The supply and price of coffee are subject to significant
    volatility. Although most coffee trades in the commodity market,
    high-altitude

arabica

coffee of the quality sought by the
    Company tends to trade on a negotiated basis at a substantial
    premium above commodity coffee prices, depending upon the supply
    and demand at the time of purchase. Supply and price can be
    affected by multiple factors in the producing countries,
    including weather, political and economic conditions. In
    addition, green coffee prices have been affected in the past,
    and may be affected in the future, by the actions of certain
    organizations and associations that have historically attempted
    to influence prices of green coffee through agreements
    establishing export quotas or by restricting coffee supplies.

The Company depends upon its relationships with coffee
    producers, outside trading companies and exporters for its
    supply of green coffee. Due to volatility in green coffee
    commodity prices, the Company has predominantly used fixed-price
    purchase commitments in order to secure an adequate supply of
    quality green coffee, bring greater certainty to its cost of
    sales in future periods, and promote sustainability by paying an
    equitable price to coffee producers. As of September 30,
    2007, the Company had $324 million in fixed-price purchase
    commitments which, together with existing inventory, is expected
    to provide an adequate supply of green coffee through fiscal
    2008. The Company believes, based on relationships established
    with its suppliers, the risk of non-delivery on such purchase
    commitments is remote. During fiscal 2007, “C” coffee
    commodity prices traded on the New York Board of Trade within a
    price range of $1.00 to $1.35 per pound and prices were, on
    average, approximately 10% higher than in fiscal 2006. In
    September 2007, prices moved sharply higher as poor weather led
    to decreased expectations for the next harvest in the
    world’s largest

arabica

coffee producer, Brazil.
    Based on its market experience, the Company believes that
    fixed-price purchase commitments are less likely to be available
    on favorable terms when commodity prices are high. If prices
    were to continue to move higher during fiscal 2008, Starbucks
    likely would increase the use of price-to-be-fixed purchase
    contracts to meet its demand for coffee. These types of
    contracts state the quality, quantity and delivery periods but
    allow the price of green coffee over a market index to be
    established after contract signing. The Company believes that,
    through a combination of fixed-price and price-to-be-fixed
    contracts it will be able to secure an adequate supply of
    quality green coffee. However, an increased use of
    price-to-be-fixed contracts instead of fixed-price contracts
    would decrease the predictability of coffee costs in future
    periods. By volume, approximately 20% of the Company’s
    coffee purchase agreements entered during fiscal 2007 were
    price-to-be-fixed contracts.

During fiscal 2004, Starbucks established the Starbucks Coffee
    Agronomy Company S.R.L., a wholly owned subsidiary located in
    Costa Rica, to reinforce the Company’s leadership role in
    the coffee industry and to help ensure sustainability and future
    supply of high-quality green coffees from Central America.
    Staffed with agronomists and sustainability experts, this
    first-of-its-kind Farmer Support Center is designed to
    proactively respond to changes in coffee producing countries
    that impact farmers and the supply of green coffee. During
    fiscal 2007, the Company announced plans to conduct similar
    activities in East Africa.

In addition to coffee, the Company also purchases significant
    amounts of dairy products, particularly fluid milk, to support
    the needs of its Company-operated retail stores. Dairy expense
    for the U.S. segment represents approximately 75% of the
    Company’s total dairy expense; therefore significant
    changes in U.S. dairy prices can have a material impact on
    total dairy expense. The U.S. segment’s dairy costs,
    which closely follow the monthly Class I fluid milk base
    price as calculated by the U.S. Department of Agriculture,
    can change significantly in the short term. The Company’s
    U.S. dairy costs rose materially in fiscal 2007 compared to
    fiscal 2006 and costs accelerated in the



fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 and have remained high, adversely
    affecting the U.S. segment’s and the Company’s
    profitability. In the United States, the Company purchases
    substantially all of its fluid milk requirements from two dairy
    suppliers. The Company believes, based on relationships
    established with these suppliers, that the risk of non-delivery
    of enough fluid milk to support its U.S. retail business is
    remote.

The Company also purchases a broad range of paper and plastic
    products, such as cups, lids, cutlery, napkins, straws, shopping
    bags and corrugated paper boxes from several companies to
    support the needs of its retail stores as well as its
    manufacturing and distribution operations. The cost of these
    materials is dependent in part upon commodity paper and plastic
    resin costs, but the Company believes it mitigates the effect of
    short-term raw material price fluctuations through strategic
    relationships with key suppliers.

Products other than whole bean coffees and coffee beverages sold
    in Starbucks retail stores are obtained through a number of
    different channels. Beverage ingredients, other than coffee and
    milk, including leaf teas and the Company’s selection of
    ready-to-drink beverages, are purchased from several specialty
    manufacturers, usually under long-term supply contracts. Food
    products, such as fresh pastries, breakfast sandwiches and lunch
    items, are generally purchased from both regional and local
    sources. Coffee-making equipment, such as drip and coffee press
    coffeemakers, espresso machines and coffee grinders, are
    generally purchased directly from their manufacturers.
    Coffee-related accessories, including items bearing the
    Company’s logos and trademarks, are produced and
    distributed through contracts with a number of different
    suppliers.

Competition

The Company’s primary competitors for coffee beverage sales
    are quick-service restaurants and specialty coffee shops. In
    almost all markets in which the Company does business, there are
    numerous competitors in the specialty coffee beverage business,
    and management expects this situation to continue. The Company
    believes that its customers choose among retailers primarily on
    the basis of product quality, service and convenience, and, to a
    lesser extent, on price. Starbucks has recently experienced
    significantly greater direct competition from large competitors
    in the United States quick-service restaurant sector, some of
    whom have substantially greater financial, marketing and
    operating resources than the Company. Starbucks also faces
    well-established competitors in many International markets and
    increased competition in the U.S. ready-to-drink coffee
    beverage market.

The Company’s whole bean coffees compete directly against
    specialty coffees sold through supermarkets, specialty retailers
    and a growing number of specialty coffee stores. Both the
    Company’s whole bean coffees and its coffee beverages
    compete indirectly against all other coffees on the market.
    Starbucks Specialty Operations face significant competition from
    established wholesale and mail order suppliers, some of whom
    have greater financial and marketing resources than the Company.

Starbucks faces intense competition from both restaurants and
    other specialty retailers for prime retail locations and
    qualified personnel to operate both new and existing stores.

Patents,
    Trademarks, Copyrights and Domain Names

The Company owns

and/or

has
    applied to register numerous trademarks and service marks in the
    United States and in many additional countries throughout the
    world. Rights to the trademarks and service marks in the
    United States are generally held by a wholly owned
    affiliate of the Company and are used by the Company under
    license. Some of the Company’s trademarks, including
    Starbucks, the Starbucks logo, Frappuccino, Seattle’s Best
    Coffee and Tazo are of material importance to the Company. The
    duration of trademark registrations varies from country to
    country. However, trademarks are generally valid and may be
    renewed indefinitely as long as they are in use

and/or

their
    registrations are properly maintained.

The Company owns numerous copyrights for items such as product
    packaging, promotional materials, in-store graphics and training
    materials. The Company also holds patents on certain products,
    systems and designs. In addition, the Company has registered and
    maintains numerous Internet domain names, including
    “Starbucks.com” and “Starbucks.net.”



Research
    and Development

Starbucks research and development efforts are led by food
    scientists, engineers, chemists and culinarians in the Research
    and Development department. This team is responsible for the
    technical development of food and beverage products and new
    equipment. The Company spent approximately $7.0 million,
    $6.5 million and $6.2 million during fiscal 2007, 2006
    and 2005, respectively, on technical research and development
    activities, in addition to customary product testing and product
    and process improvements in all areas of its business.

Seasonality
    and Quarterly Results

Starbucks business is subject to seasonal fluctuations,
    including fluctuations resulting from the holiday season. The
    Company’s cash flows from operations are considerably
    higher in the fiscal first quarter than the remainder of the
    year. This is largely driven by cash received as Starbucks Cards
    are purchased and loaded during the holiday season. Since
    revenues from the Starbucks Card are recognized upon redemption
    and not when purchased, seasonal fluctuations on the
    consolidated statements of earnings are much less pronounced.
    Quarterly results are affected by the timing of the opening of
    new stores, and the Company’s growth may conceal the impact
    of other seasonal influences. For these reasons, results for any
    quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may
    be achieved for the full fiscal year.

Employees

The Company employed approximately 172,000 people worldwide
    as of September 30, 2007. In the United States, Starbucks
    employed approximately 144,000 people, with 136,000 in
    Company-operated retail stores and the remainder in the
    Company’s administrative and regional offices, and store
    development, roasting and warehousing operations. Approximately
    28,000 employees were employed outside of the United
    States, with 27,000 in Company-operated retail stores and the
    remainder in the Company’s regional support facilities and
    roasting and warehousing operations. The number of the
    Company’s employees represented by unions is immaterial.
    Starbucks believes its current relations with its employees are
    good.

includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the
    Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
    Forward-looking statements can be identified by the fact that
    they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. They
    often include words such as “believes,”
    “expects,” “anticipates,”
    “estimates,” “intends,” “plans,”
    “seeks” or words of similar meaning, or future or
    conditional verbs, such as “will,” “should,”
    “could” or “may.” A forward-looking
    statement is neither a prediction nor a guarantee of future
    events or circumstances, and those future events or
    circumstances may not occur. Investors should not place undue
    reliance on the forward-looking statements, which speak only as
    of the date of this Report. Starbucks is under no obligation



to update or alter any forward-looking statements, whether as a
    result of new information, future events or otherwise. These
    forward-looking statements are all based on currently available
    operating, financial and competitive information and are subject
    to various risks and uncertainties. The Company’s actual
    future results and trends may differ materially depending on a
    variety of factors, including, but not limited to, the risks and
    uncertainties discussed below. The risks below are not the only
    ones the Company faces. Additional risks and risks that
    management currently considers immaterial may also have an
    adverse effect on the Company.

•

Failing
    to meet market expectations for Starbucks financial performance
    could cause the market price of Starbucks stock to drop rapidly
    and sharply.

Management believes the price of Starbucks stock reflects high
    market expectations for the Company’s future operating
    results. Any failure to meet those expectations, particularly
    for the growth rates for (i) comparable store sales
    attributable to number of transactions, average value per
    transaction, or both, (ii) net revenues,
    (iii) earnings per share or (iv) net new store
    openings could cause the market price of Starbucks stock to drop
    rapidly and sharply.

•

Starbucks
    is subject to a number of significant risks that might cause the
    Company’s actual results to vary materially from its
    forecasts, targets, or projections, including:

•

lower customer traffic or average value per transaction, which
    negatively impacts comparable store sales, net revenues,
    operating income and earnings per share, due to:

•

the impact of initiatives by competitors and increased
    competition generally;

•

lack of customer acceptance of price increases necessary to
    cover costs or new products;

•

unfavorable general economic conditions in the markets in which
    Starbucks operates, including, but not limited to, downturns in
    the housing market, higher interest rates, higher unemployment
    rates, lower disposable income due to higher energy or other
    consumer costs, lower consumer confidence, and other events or
    factors that adversely affect consumer spending;

•

declines in general consumer demand for specialty coffee
    products; or

•

adverse impacts due to negative publicity regarding the
    Company’s business practices or the health effects of
    consuming its products;

•

cost increases that are either wholly or partially beyond the
    Company’s control, such as:

•

commodity costs for commodities that cannot be effectively
    hedged, such as fluid milk, and to a lesser extent, high quality

arabica

coffee;

•

labor costs such as increased health care costs, general market
    wage levels and worker’s compensation insurance costs;

•

construction costs associated with new store openings;

•

information technology costs and other logistical resources
    necessary to maintain and support the global growth of the
    Company’s business; and

•

litigation against Starbucks, particularly class action
    litigation;

•

delays in store openings for reasons beyond the Company’s
    control, or a lack of desirable real estate locations available
    for lease at reasonable rates, either of which could keep the
    Company from meeting annual store opening targets and, in turn,
    negatively impact net revenues, operating income and earnings
    per share;

•

any material interruption in the Company’s supply chain
    beyond its control, such as (i) material interruption of
    roasted coffee supply due to the casualty loss of any of the
    Company’s roasting plants or the failures of third-party
    suppliers, or (ii) interruptions in service by common
    carriers that ship goods within the Company’s distribution
    channels; and



•

the impact on Starbucks business of factors such as labor
    discord, war, terrorism (including incidents targeting
    Starbucks), political instability in certain markets and natural
    disasters.

•

Starbucks
    is highly dependent on the financial performance of its United
    States operating segment.

The Company’s financial performance is highly dependent on
    its United States operating segment, which comprised 78% of
    consolidated total net revenues in fiscal 2007. Any substantial
    or sustained decline in these operations, if not offset by
    increased financial performance elsewhere, could materially
    adversely affect the Company’s business and financial
    results.

•

Starbucks
    faces intense competition in the specialty coffee
    market.

A description of the general competitive conditions in which
    Starbucks operates appears on page 6 under
    “Competition.” In the United States, the continued
    focus by one or more large competitors in the quick-service
    restaurant sector on selling high-quality specialty coffee
    beverages at a low cost could attract Starbucks customers and
    adversely affect the Company’s sales and results of
    operations. Similarly, continued competition from
    well-established competitors in international markets could
    hinder growth and adversely affect the Company’s sales and
    results of operations in those markets. Increased competition
    from large competitors with significant resources in the United
    States ready-to-drink coffee beverage market could adversely
    affect the profitability of the CPG segment and the
    Company’s results of operations.

•

The
    Company’s success depends substantially on the value of the
    Starbucks brand.

Starbucks believes it has built an excellent reputation globally
    for the quality of its products, for delivery of a consistently
    positive consumer experience and for its corporate social
    responsibility programs. The Starbucks brand has been highly
    rated in several global brand value studies. Management believes
    it must preserve and grow the value of the Starbucks brand to be
    successful in the future, particularly outside of North America,
    where the Starbucks brand is less well-known. Brand value is
    based in part on consumer perceptions as to a variety of
    subjective qualities. Even isolated business incidents that
    erode consumer trust, particularly if the incidents receive
    considerable publicity or result in litigation, can
    significantly reduce brand value. Consumer demand for the
    Company’s products and its brand equity could diminish
    significantly if Starbucks fails to preserve the quality of its
    products, is perceived to act in an unethical or socially
    irresponsible manner or fails to deliver a consistently positive
    consumer experience in each of its markets.

•

Starbucks
    is increasingly dependent on the success of its International
    operating segment in order to achieve its growth
    targets.

The Company’s future growth will increasingly depend on the
    growth and sustained profitability of its International
    operating segment. Some or all of the Company’s
    International market business units (“MBUs”), which
    Starbucks generally defines by the countries or regions in which
    they operate, may not be successful in their operations or in
    achieving expected growth, which ultimately requires achieving
    consistent, stable net revenues and earnings. Some factors that
    will be critical to the success of International MBUs are
    different than those affecting the Company’s
    U.S. stores and licensees. Tastes naturally vary by region,
    and consumers in new international markets into which Starbucks
    and its licensees expand may not embrace Starbucks products to
    the same extent as consumers in the Company’s existing
    markets. Occupancy costs and store operating expenses are also
    sometimes higher internationally than in the United States due
    to higher rents for prime store locations or costs of compliance
    with country-specific regulatory requirements. Because many of
    the Company’s International operations are in an early
    phase of development, operating expenses as a percentage of
    related revenues are often higher compared to
    U.S. operations. The Company’s International
    operations are also subject to additional inherent risks of
    conducting business abroad, such as:

•

foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations;

•

changes or uncertainties in economic, social and political
    conditions in the Company’s markets;

•

interpretation and application of laws and regulations;



•

restrictive actions of foreign or United States governmental
    authorities affecting trade and foreign investment, including
    protective measures such as export and customs duties and
    tariffs and restrictions on the level of foreign ownership;

•

import or other business licensing requirements;

•

the enforceability of intellectual property and contract rights;

•

limitations on the repatriation of funds and foreign currency
    exchange restrictions;

•

lower levels of consumer spending on a

per capita

basis
    than in the United States;

•

difficulty in staffing, developing and managing foreign
    operations, including ensuring the consistency of product
    quality and service, due to distance, language and cultural
    differences; and

•

local laws that make it more expensive and complex to negotiate
    with, retain or terminate employees.

•

The
    China market is important to the Company’s long-term growth
    prospects - doing business there and in other developing
    countries can be challenging.

Starbucks expects the People’s Republic of China to be its
    largest market outside of the United States. The Company’s
    growing investments in its China operations will increase the
    Company’s exposure in this market. Any significant or
    prolonged deterioration in

U.S.-China

relations might adversely affect the Company’s China
    business.

Many of the risks and uncertainties of doing business in China
    are solely within the control of the Chinese government.
    China’s government regulates the business conducted by
    Starbucks by restricting the scope of the Company’s foreign
    investments within China and the food and beverage, retail,
    wholesale and distribution business conducted within China.
    Although management believes it has structured the
    Company’s China operations to comply with local laws, there
    are substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation and
    application of laws and regulations and the enforceability of
    intellectual property and contract rights in China. If
    China’s governmental authorities were ultimately to
    conclude that Starbucks has not complied with one or more
    existing or future laws or regulations, or if their
    interpretations of those laws or regulations were to change over
    time, the Company’s affiliates could be subject to fines
    and other financial penalties, prohibited from opening new
    stores or forced to cease operations entirely. Moreover, any
    inability of the Company to enforce its intellectual property
    and contract rights in China’s courts could adversely
    affect the Company’s business.

Additionally, Starbucks plans to continue entering selected
    markets in other developing countries, and has recently entered
    Russia as an important part of the projected growth of the
    International operating segment. Some of those markets pose
    legal and business challenges similar to the China market, such
    as substantial uncertainty regarding the interpretation and
    application of laws and regulations and the enforceability of
    intellectual property and contract rights.

•

The
    Company’s earnings and business growth strategy depends in
    large part on the success of its business partners and
    suppliers, and the Company’s reputation may be harmed by
    actions taken by third parties that are outside of the
    Company’s control.

The Company’s growth strategy, including its plans for new
    stores, foodservice, branded products and other initiatives,
    relies significantly on a variety of licensee and partnership
    relationships, particularly in its International markets.
    Licensees are often authorized to use the Starbucks logo and
    provide Starbucks-branded beverages, food and other products
    directly to customers. The Company provides training and support
    to, and monitors the operations of, these business partners, but
    the product quality and service they deliver to Starbucks
    customers may be diminished by any number of factors beyond the
    Company’s control. Management believes customers expect the
    same quality of products and service from the Company’s
    licensees as they do from Starbucks and the Company strives to
    ensure customers have the same experience whether they visit a
    Company-operated or licensed store. Any shortcoming of a
    Starbucks business partner, particularly an issue affecting the
    quality of the service experience or the safety of beverages or
    food, may be attributed by customers to Starbucks, thus damaging
    the Company’s reputation and brand value and potentially
    affecting the results of operations.



•

Effectively
    managing the Company’s rapid growth is
    challenging.

The Company’s long-term goal is to open approximately
    20,000 Starbucks stores in the United States and at least 20,000
    stores in International markets. Starbucks expects to double the
    size of its business over the next four to five years and
    achieve higher annual growth in net earnings than revenue.
    Effectively managing growth on this scale is challenging,
    particularly as Starbucks expands into new markets
    internationally, where it must balance the need for flexibility
    and a degree of autonomy for local management with consistency
    with the Company’s goals, philosophy and standards. Growth
    on this scale makes it increasingly difficult to ensure a
    consistent supply of high quality raw materials, to locate and
    hire sufficient numbers of key employees to meet the
    Company’s growth targets, to maintain an effective system
    of internal controls for a globally dispersed enterprise and to
    train employees worldwide to deliver a consistently high quality
    product and customer experience.

•

The
    loss of key personnel or difficulties recruiting and retaining
    qualified personnel could jeopardize the Company’s ability
    to meet its growth targets.

The Company’s future growth depends substantially on the
    contributions and abilities of key executives and other
    employees. Starbucks future growth also depends substantially on
    its ability to recruit and retain high quality employees to work
    in and manage Starbucks stores. Starbucks must continue to
    recruit, retain and motivate management and other employees
    sufficient to maintain its current business and support its
    projected growth. A loss of key employees or a significant
    shortage of high quality store employees could jeopardize the
    Company’s ability to meet its growth targets.

•

Adverse
    public or medical opinions about the health effects of consuming
    the Company’s products, as well as reports of incidents
    involving food-borne illnesses or food tampering, whether or not
    accurate, could harm its business.

Some Starbucks products contain caffeine, dairy products, sugar
    and other active compounds, the health effects of which are the
    subject of increasing public scrutiny, including the suggestion
    that excessive consumption of caffeine, dairy products, sugar
    and other active compounds can lead to a variety of adverse
    health effects. There has also been greater public awareness
    that sedentary lifestyles, combined with excessive consumption
    of high-calorie foods, have led to a rapidly rising rate of
    obesity. Particularly in the United States, there is increasing
    consumer awareness of health risks, including obesity, due in
    part to increasing publicity and attention from health
    organizations, as well as increased consumer litigation based on
    alleged adverse health impacts of consumption of various food
    products. While Starbucks has a variety of beverage and food
    items that are low in caffeine and calories, an unfavorable
    report on the health effects of caffeine or other compounds
    present in the Company’s products, or negative publicity or
    litigation arising from other health risks such as obesity,
    could significantly reduce the demand for the Company’s
    beverages and food products.

Similarly, reports, whether true or not, of unclean water
    supply, food-borne illnesses and food tampering have in the past
    severely injured the reputations of companies in the food
    processing, grocery and quick-service restaurant sectors and
    could in the future affect the Company as well. Any report
    linking Starbucks to the use of unclean water, food-borne
    illnesses or food tampering could damage its brand value,
    immediately and severely hurt sales of its beverages and food
    products, and possibly lead to product liability claims. Clean
    water is critical to the preparation of specialty coffee
    beverages. The Company’s ability to ensure a clean water
    supply to its stores is limited, particularly in some
    International locations. If customers become ill from food-borne
    illnesses, the Company could also be forced to temporarily close
    some stores. In addition, instances of food-borne illnesses or
    food tampering, even those occurring solely at the restaurants
    or stores of competitors, could, by resulting in negative
    publicity about the foodservice industry, adversely affect
    Starbucks sales on a regional or global basis. A decrease in
    customer traffic as a result of these health concerns or
    negative publicity, or as a result of a temporary closure of any
    of the Company’s stores, could materially harm the
    Company’s business and results of operations.



•

Significant
    increases in the market price or decreases in availability of
    high quality arabica coffee or fluid milk could harm the
    Company’s business and financial results.

A discussion of the sources and availability of coffee of the
    quality sought by Starbucks and fluid milk appears on
    page 5 under “Product Supply.” Any significant
    increase in the market price or any significant decrease in the
    availability of high-quality

arabica

coffee or fluid milk
    could adversely affect the Company’s business and financial
    results.

•

A
    regional or global health pandemic could severely affect
    Starbucks business.

A health pandemic is a disease that spreads rapidly and widely
    by infection and affects many individuals in an area or
    population at the same time. If a regional or global health
    pandemic were to occur, depending upon its duration and
    severity, the Company’s business could be severely
    affected. Starbucks has positioned itself as a third place
    between home and work where people can gather together for human
    connection. Customers might avoid public gathering places in the
    event of a health pandemic, and local, regional or national
    governments might limit or ban public gatherings to halt or
    delay the spread of disease. A regional or global health
    pandemic might also adversely impact the Company’s business
    by disrupting or delaying production and delivery of materials
    and products in its supply chain and by causing staffing
    shortages in its stores. The impact of a health pandemic on
    Starbucks might be disproportionately greater than on other
    companies that depend less on the gathering of people together
    for the sale, use or license of their products and services.

•

Starbucks
    relies heavily on information technology in its operations, and
    any material failure, inadequacy, interruption or security
    failure of that technology could harm the Company’s ability
    to effectively operate its business.

Starbucks relies heavily on information technology systems
    across its operations, including for management of its supply
    chain, point-of-sale processing in its stores, and various other
    processes and transactions. The Company’s ability to
    effectively manage its business and coordinate the production,
    distribution and sale of its products depends significantly on
    the reliability and capacity of these systems. The failure of
    these systems to operate effectively, problems with
    transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems, or a breach in
    security of these systems could cause delays in product sales
    and reduced efficiency of the Company’s operations, and
    significant capital investments could be required to remediate
    the problem.

•

Failure
    of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting
    could harm its business and financial results.

Starbucks management is responsible for establishing and
    maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting.
    Internal control over financial reporting is a process to
    provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
    financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
    America. Internal control over financial reporting includes:
    (i) maintaining reasonably detailed records that accurately
    and fairly reflect the Company’s transactions; and
    (ii) providing reasonable assurance that the Company
    (a) records transactions as necessary to prepare the
    financial statements, (b) makes receipts and expenditures
    in accordance with management authorizations, and (c) would
    timely prevent or detect any unauthorized acquisition, use or
    disposition of Company assets that could have a material effect
    on the financial statements. Because of its inherent
    limitations, internal control over financial reporting is not
    intended to provide absolute assurance that the Company would
    prevent or detect a misstatement of the Company’s financial
    statements or fraud. The Company’s rapid growth and entry
    into new, globally dispersed markets will place significant
    additional pressure on the Company’s system of internal
    control over financial reporting. Any failure to maintain an
    effective system of internal control over financial reporting
    could limit the Company’s ability to report its financial
    results accurately and timely or to detect and prevent fraud. A
    significant financial reporting failure could cause an immediate
    loss of investor confidence in Starbucks and a sharp decline in
    the market price of its common stock.



•

Increased
    leverage may harm the Company’s financial condition and
    results of operations.

As of September 30, 2007, Starbucks had approximately
    $5.0 billion in minimum future rental payments under
    non-cancelable operating leases and $3.1 billion of total
    liabilities on a consolidated basis. Included in total
    liabilities are aggregate principal indebtedness of
    $710 million under outstanding commercial paper and
    $550 million under ten-year notes issued in an August 2007
    underwritten registered public offering. The Company will incur
    additional operating lease obligations, largely driven by new
    store openings, and may incur additional indebtedness, subject
    to the limitations contained in its financing agreements. The
    recent increase in the Company’s level of financial
    obligations has had, and any future increase (which may or may
    not occur) will have, several important effects on the
    Company’s future operations, such as:

•

additional cash requirements to support the payment of rents and
    interest on outstanding indebtedness;

•

possible increased vulnerability to adverse changes in general
    economic and industry conditions, as well as to competitive
    pressure;

•

possible limitations on the Company’s ability to obtain
    additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures,
    general corporate and other purposes; and

•

possible limitations on the Company’s flexibility in
    planning for, or reacting to, changes in its business and its
    industry.

The Company’s ability to satisfy its lease obligations and
    make payments of principal and interest on its indebtedness
    depends on its future performance, which will be subject to
    general economic conditions, industry cycles and financial,
    business and other factors affecting its consolidated
    operations, many of which are beyond the Company’s control.
    If Starbucks is unable to generate sufficient cash flow from
    operations in the future to satisfy its financial obligations,
    it may be required, among other things:

•

to seek additional financing in the debt or equity markets;

•

to refinance or restructure all or a portion of its indebtedness;

•

to sell selected assets; or

•

to reduce or delay planned capital or operating expenditures.

Such measures might not be sufficient to enable Starbucks to
    satisfy its financial obligations. In addition, any such
    financing, refinancing or sale of assets might not be available
    on economically favorable terms.

The Company’s existing strong cash flow and capital
    structure mitigate the current risk associated with leverage.
    Management expects future cash flows to be sufficient to meet
    operating expenses, debt service costs, and capital expenditures
    required to support projected new store openings and investments
    in existing and new markets. In addition, management does not
    expect to increase leverage to levels that would inhibit the
    Company’s access to capital markets in the event of
    short-falls in anticipated operating cash flow.

Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations

General

Starbucks Corporation’s fiscal year ends on the Sunday
    closest to September 30. Some fiscal years include
    53 weeks. The fiscal years ended on September 30,
    2007, October 1, 2006 and October 2, 2005, all
    included 52 weeks. All references to store counts,
    including data for new store openings, are reported net of
    related store closures.

Management
    Overview

Fiscal
    2007 — The Year in Review

Starbucks achieved solid performance in fiscal 2007 —
    meeting its targets for store openings, revenue growth,
    comparable store sales growth, and earnings per
    share — despite a challenging economic and operating
    environment, and significant cost increases from dairy. The
    Company completed the fiscal year with encouraging trends and
    momentum in its International business but faced increasing
    challenges in its U.S. business. While U.S. comparable
    store sales were within the Company’s stated target range,
    it was accomplished through two price increases which offset
    flat-to-negative transaction count trends in the
    U.S. business. The pressure on traffic is consistent with
    similar trends reported across both the retail and restaurant
    industry. Management believes that the combination of the
    economic slowdown and the price increases implemented in fiscal
    2007 to help mitigate significant cost pressures have impacted
    the frequency of customer visits to Starbucks stores.

Consolidated net revenues for fiscal year 2007 increased 21% to
    $9.4 billion. Company-operated retail revenues in fiscal
    2007 rose 21% to $8.0 billion, predominantly due to the
    opening of 1,342 stores and comparable store sales growth of 5%.
    The increase in comparable store sales was due to a 4% increase
    in the average value per transaction and 1% growth in the number
    of customer transactions. The Company opened a total of 2,571
    new company-operated and licensed stores during the year, with
    70% in the U.S. and 30% in International markets, to end
    the year with over 15,000 stores.

For fiscal 2007, operating income increased to
    $1.1 billion, while operating margin contracted
    30 basis points to 11.2% of total net revenues. Margin
    compression was due to higher costs of sales including occupancy
    costs as a percentage of total net revenues due to a shift in
    sales to higher cost products and higher distribution costs,
    rent expense and dairy costs. These cost pressures were offset
    in part by leveraging general and administrative expenses, store
    operating expenses, and other operating expenses as a percentage
    of total net revenues.

Net earnings rose to $673 million in fiscal 2007 from
    $564 million for the previous year. Diluted earnings per
    share for fiscal 2007 increased to $0.87 compared to $0.71 a
    year ago. Excluding the cumulative effect of adopting
    FIN 47 in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2006, earnings grew
    16% and diluted earnings per share increased 19%.

Fiscal
    2008 — The View Ahead

Throughout fiscal 2007, Starbucks experienced a consistent
    weakening in its U.S. business, exiting the year with a
    negative trend in transactions. Management recognizes that it
    faces a more challenging environment from an economic,
    operational and competitive standpoint entering fiscal 2008. In
    response to those challenges, management intends to focus in the
    following key areas:

•

Better operational excellence at the store level;

•

More meaningful innovation to continue to differentiate the
    store experience; and

•

Increased efficiencies and effectiveness in the general and
    administrative infrastructure, to become more capable of
    navigating through the fluctuations in the external environment.



In setting targets for fiscal 2008, management’s goal was
    to balance the long-term opportunity for store growth with the
    near-term realities of the challenging economic and operating
    environment. For fiscal 2008 the Company is targeting:

•

Opening approximately 2,500 new stores;

•

Comparable store sales growth in the range of 3% to 5%;

•

Total net revenue growth in the range of approximately 17% to
    18%, to over $11 billion; and

•

Earnings per share in the range of $1.02 to $1.05, representing
    17% to 21% growth, with earnings per share expansion expected to
    be greater in the second half of fiscal 2008.

In summary, management believes these targets are balanced for
    fiscal 2008. The Company intends to continue to build out stores
    to take advantage of its global opportunity, to better execute
    in its U.S. business, to grow and deliver significant
    margin expansion in its International business, and to deliver
    margin improvement for the Company on a consolidated basis.

Operating
    Segment Overview

Starbucks has three reportable operating segments: United
    States, International and CPG.

The United States and International segments both include
    Company-operated retail stores, licensed retail stores and
    foodservice operations. The United States segment has been
    operating significantly longer than the International segment
    and has developed deeper awareness of, and attachment to, the
    Starbucks brand and stores among its customer base. As a result,
    the United States segment has significantly more stores, and
    higher total revenues than the International segment. Average
    sales per store are also higher in the United States due to
    various factors including length of time in market and local
    income levels. Further, certain market costs, particularly
    occupancy costs, are lower in the United States segment compared
    to the average for the International segment, which comprises a
    more diverse group of operations. As a result of the relative
    strength of the brand in the United States segment, the number
    of stores, the higher unit volumes, and the lower market costs,
    the United States segment has a higher operating margin than the
    less-developed International segment.

The Company’s International store base continues to
    increase rapidly and Starbucks is achieving a growing
    contribution from established international markets while at the
    same time investing in emerging markets, such as China, Brazil
    and Russia. The Company’s newer international markets
    require a more extensive support organization, relative to the
    current levels of revenue and operating income.

The CPG segment includes the Company’s grocery and
    warehouse club business as well as branded products operations
    worldwide. The CPG segment operates primarily through joint
    ventures and licensing arrangements with large consumer products
    business partners, most significantly The North American Coffee
    Partnership with the Pepsi-Cola Company for distribution of
    ready-to-drink beverages, and with Kraft Foods Inc. for
    distribution of packaged coffees and teas. This operating model
    allows the CPG segment to leverage the business partners’
    existing infrastructures and to extend the Starbucks brand in an
    efficient way. Most of the customer revenues from the
    ready-to-drink and packaged coffee channels are recognized as
    revenues by the joint venture or licensed business partner, not
    by the CPG segment, and the proportionate share of the results
    of the Company’s joint ventures are included on a net basis
    in “Income from equity investees” on the consolidated
    statements of earnings. As a result, the CPG segment reflects
    relatively lower revenues, a modest cost structure, and a
    resulting higher operating margin, compared to the
    Company’s other two reporting segments, which consist
    primarily of retail stores.

Expenses pertaining to corporate administrative functions that
    support the operating segments but are not specifically
    attributable to or managed by any segment are not included in
    the reported financial results of the operating segments. These
    unallocated corporate expenses include certain general and
    administrative expenses, related depreciation and amortization
    expenses and amounts included in “Net interest and other
    income” on the consolidated statements of earnings.



Acquisitions

In the first quarter of fiscal 2007, the Company purchased a 90%
    stake in its previously-licensed operations in Beijing, China.
    Due to its majority ownership of these operations, Starbucks
    applied the consolidation method of accounting subsequent to the
    date of acquisition.

Consolidated
    Results of Operations

Net revenues for the fiscal year ended 2007, increased 21% to
    $9.4 billion from $7.8 billion for fiscal 2006, driven
    by increases in both Company-operated retail revenues and
    specialty operations.

During the fiscal year ended 2007, Starbucks derived 85% of
    total net revenues from its Company-operated retail stores.
    Company-operated retail revenues increased 21% to
    $8.0 billion for the fiscal year ended 2007, from
    $6.6 billion for fiscal 2006. The increase was primarily
    attributable to the opening of 1,342 new Company-operated retail
    stores in the last 12 months and comparable store sales
    growth of 5% for the fiscal year ended 2007. The increase in
    comparable store sales was due to a 4% increase in the average
    value per transaction and a 1% increase in the number of
    customer transactions.

The Company derived the remaining 15% of total net revenues from
    channels outside the Company-operated retail stores,
    collectively known as specialty operations. Specialty revenues,
    which include licensing revenues and foodservice and other
    revenues, increased 17% to $1.4 billion for the fiscal year
    ended 2007, from $1.2 billion for fiscal 2006.

Licensing revenues, which are derived from retail store
    licensing arrangements as well as grocery, warehouse club and
    certain other branded-product operations, increased 19% to
    $1.0 billion for the fiscal year ended 2007, from
    $861 million for fiscal 2006. The increase was primarily
    due to higher product sales and royalty revenues from the
    opening of 1,229 new licensed retail stores in the last
    12 months and a 20% increase in licensing revenues from the
    Company’s CPG business.

Foodservice and other revenues increased 13% to
    $387 million for the fiscal year ended 2007, from
    $343 million for fiscal 2006. The increase was primarily
    attributable to growth in new and existing accounts in the
    U.S. foodservice business.

Cost of sales including occupancy costs increased to 42.5% of
    total net revenues for the fiscal year ended 2007, compared to
    40.8% for fiscal 2006. The increase was primarily due to a shift
    in sales mix to higher cost products, the rise in distribution
    costs, higher rent expense and higher dairy costs. Dairy expense
    for the U.S. segment represents approximately 75% of the
    total Company’s dairy expense. For the U.S. segment
    the average dairy costs per gallon rose 10% in fiscal 2007
    compared to fiscal 2006, resulting in approximately
    $20 million of additional expense.

Store operating expenses as a percentage of Company-operated
    retail revenues decreased to 40.2% for the fiscal year ended
    2007, from 40.8% for fiscal 2006, primarily due to higher
    provisions for incentive compensation in the prior year due to
    exceptionally strong performance as well as leverage on regional
    overhead costs in fiscal 2007.

Other operating expenses (expenses associated with the
    Company’s Specialty Operations) decreased to 20.8% of total
    specialty revenues for the fiscal year ended 2007, compared to
    21.1% in fiscal 2006. The decline resulted primarily from
    controlled discretionary spending in fiscal 2007.

Depreciation and amortization expenses increased to
    $467 million for the fiscal year ended 2007, compared to
    $387 million for the corresponding period of fiscal 2006.
    The increase was primarily due to the opening of 1,342 new
    Company-operated retail stores in the last 12 months. As a
    percentage of total net revenues, depreciation and amortization
    expenses decreased to 4.9% for the fiscal 2007, compared to 5.0%
    for fiscal 2006.

General and administrative expenses increased to
    $489 million for the fiscal year ended 2007, compared to
    $479 million for fiscal 2006. The increase was primarily
    due to higher payroll-related expenditures in support of
    continued global growth, offset in part by unusually high
    charitable contributions in fiscal 2006. As a percentage of
    total net revenues, general and administrative expenses
    decreased to 5.2% for the fiscal year ended 2007, from 6.1% for
    fiscal 2006.

Income from equity investees increased 15% to $108 million
    for the fiscal year ended 2007, compared to $94 million for
    fiscal 2006, primarily due to higher equity income from
    international investees.

Operating income increased 18% to $1.1 billion for the
    fiscal year ended 2007, compared to $894 million for fiscal
    2006. Operating margin decreased to 11.2% of total net revenues
    for the fiscal year ended 2007, from 11.5% for fiscal 2006.
    Margin compression was due to higher costs of sales and
    occupancy costs as a percentage of total net revenues due to a
    shift in sales to higher cost products and higher distribution
    costs, rent expense and dairy costs.



These cost pressures were offset in part by leveraging general
    and administrative expenses, store operating expenses, and other
    operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues.

Net interest and other income was $2 million for the fiscal
    year ended 2007, compared to $12 million for fiscal 2006.
    The decrease was primarily due to increased interest expense
    resulting from a higher level of borrowings outstanding, which
    include the $550 million of senior notes issued in August
    2007, offset in part by a higher amount of income recognized on
    unredeemed stored value card and gift certificate balances in
    fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006.

Income taxes for the fiscal year ended 2007 resulted in an
    effective tax rate of 36.3%, compared to 35.8% for fiscal 2006.
    The effective tax rate for fiscal 2008 is expected to be
    approximately in line with fiscal 2007, with quarterly
    variations.

Net earnings for the fiscal year ended 2007, increased 19% to
    $673 million from $564 million for fiscal 2006.
    Diluted earnings per share increased to $0.87 for the fiscal
    year ended 2007, compared to $0.71 per share for fiscal 2006.
    Excluding the cumulative effect of adopting FIN 47 in
    fourth quarter 2006, earnings before cumulative effect of change
    in accounting principle grew 16% and diluted earnings per share
    increased 19%.

Operating
    Segments

Segment information is prepared on the same basis that the
    Company’s management reviews financial information for
    operational decision-making purposes. Starbucks has three
    reportable operating segments: United States, International and
    CPG. “Unallocated Corporate” includes expenses
    pertaining to corporate administrative functions that support
    the operating segments but are not specifically attributable to
    or managed by any segment and are not included in the reported
    financial results of the operating segments. Operating income
    represents earnings before “Net interest and other
    income” and “Income taxes.” The following tables
    summarize the Company’s results of operations by segment
    for fiscal 2007 and 2006 (

The United States operating segment (“United States”)
    sells coffee and other beverages, complementary food, whole bean
    coffees, and coffee brewing equipment and merchandise primarily
    through Company-operated retail stores. Specialty operations
    within the United States include licensed retail stores,
    foodservice accounts and other initiatives related to the
    Company’s core business.

United States total net revenues increased 19% to
    $7.3 billion for the fiscal year ended 2007, compared to
    $6.2 billion for fiscal 2006.

United States Company-operated retail revenues increased 19% to
    $6.6 billion for the fiscal year ended 2007, compared to
    $5.5 billion for fiscal 2006, primarily due to the opening
    of 1,065 new Company-operated retail stores in the last
    12 months and comparable store sales growth of 4% for
    fiscal 2007, nearly all resulting from an increase in the
    average value per transaction. The U.S. Company-operated
    retail business experienced deteriorating trends in transactions
    late in the year, driven by, management believes, the
    U.S. economic slowdown combined with two price increases in
    U.S. retail stores implemented in fiscal 2007. Management
    believes that several initiatives underway in the
    U.S. business, namely an enhanced focus on operational
    excellence in the stores, a more robust marketing strategy,
    meaningful product innovation and a renewed focus on the core
    beverage and coffeehouse experience, will help address those
    challenges in the U.S. retail business. In addition, in
    fiscal 2008 the Company plans to slightly reduce the pace of new
    store openings in the U.S. from the previous year in order
    to ensure the selection of store location and store format are
    the best fit for its customers and the business.

Total United States specialty revenues increased 15% to
    $788 million for the fiscal year ended 2007, compared to
    $683 million in fiscal 2006. United States licensing
    revenues increased 19% to $439 million, compared to
    $369 million for fiscal 2006 primarily due to higher
    product sales and royalty revenues as a result of opening 723
    new licensed retail stores in the last 12 months. United
    States foodservice and other revenues increased 11% to
    $349 million, from $314 million in fiscal 2006,
    primarily due to growth in new and existing foodservice accounts.

United States operating income increased 12% to
    $1.1 billion for the fiscal year ended 2007, compared to
    $955 million for fiscal 2006. Operating margin decreased to
    14.6% of related revenues from 15.5% in fiscal 2006. The
    decrease was due to higher cost of sales including occupancy
    costs, primarily due to a shift in sales mix to higher cost
    products such as food and merchandise, higher distribution
    costs, higher rent expense and higher dairy costs. Partially
    offsetting these were lower store operating expenses, lower
    general and administrative expenses, and lower other operating
    expenses as a percentage of total net revenues. The decline in
    store operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues
    was primarily due to higher provisions for incentive
    compensation in the prior year as well as leverage on regional
    overhead costs in fiscal 2007. General and administrative
    expenses were lower primarily due to decreased salary and
    related benefits expense as well as lower professional fees. The
    decline in other operating expenses as a percentage of total net
    revenues was primarily due to controlled discretionary spending
    in the current year.

The International operating segment (“International”)
    sells coffee and other beverages, complementary food, whole bean
    coffees, and coffee brewing equipment and merchandise through
    Company-operated retail stores in Canada, the UK and eight other
    markets. Specialty operations in International primarily include
    retail store licensing operations in more than 30 other
    countries and foodservice accounts, primarily in Canada and the
    UK. The Company’s International store base continues to
    increase rapidly and Starbucks is achieving a growing
    contribution from established areas of the business while at the
    same time investing in emerging markets and channels. Many of
    the Company’s International operations are in early stages
    of development that require a more extensive support
    organization, relative to the current levels of revenue and
    operating income, than in the United States. This continuing
    investment is part of the Company’s long-term, balanced
    plan for profitable growth.

International total net revenues increased 30% to
    $1.7 billion for the fiscal year ended 2007, compared to
    $1.3 billion for fiscal 2006.

International Company-operated retail revenues increased 32% to
    $1.4 billion for the fiscal year ended 2007, compared to
    $1.1 billion for fiscal 2006. The increase was primarily
    due to the opening of 277 new Company-operated retail stores in
    the last 12 months, comparable store sales growth of 7% for
    fiscal 2007 and favorable foreign currency exchange for the
    British pound sterling. The increase in comparable store sales
    resulted from a 5% increase in the number of customer
    transactions coupled with a 2% increase in the average value per
    transaction.

Total International specialty revenues increased 20% to
    $259 million for the fiscal year ended 2007, compared to
    $215 million in fiscal 2006. The increase was primarily due
    to higher product sales and royalty revenues from opening 506
    new licensed retail stores in the last 12 months.



International operating income increased 27% to
    $138 million for the fiscal year ended 2007, compared to
    $108 million in fiscal 2006. Operating margin decreased to
    8.1% of related revenues from 8.3% in fiscal 2006, primarily due
    to higher cost of sales including occupancy costs due in part to
    a shift in sales mix to higher cost products such as food and
    merchandise and higher distribution costs. Partially offsetting
    this increase was lower general and administrative expenses as a
    percentage of total net revenues.

    ready-to-drink beverages through its joint ventures and
    marketing and distribution agreements. CPG “General and
    administrative expenses,” previously included in
    “Other operating expenses,” are now presented
    separately.

CPG total net revenues increased 20% to $366 million for
    the fiscal year ended 2007, compared to $305 million for
    fiscal 2006. The increase was primarily due to increased sales
    of U.S. packaged coffee and tea as well as increased
    product sales and royalties in the international ready-to-drink
    business.

CPG operating income increased by 10% to $184 million for

    fiscal 2006. Operating margin decreased to 50.1% of related
    revenues, from 54.6% in fiscal 2006. Contraction of operating
    margin was primarily due to slower growth in income from the
    North American Coffee Partnership, an equity investee, which
    produces ready-to-drink beverages.

Unallocated corporate expenses pertain to corporate
    administrative functions that support but are not specifically
    attributable to the Company’s operating segments.



Total unallocated corporate expenses remained relatively flat at
    $338 million for the fiscal year ended 2007, compared to
    $337 million in fiscal 2006. Unallocated corporate expenses
    as a percentage of total net revenues decreased to 3.6% for the
    fiscal year ended 2007, from 4.3% for fiscal 2006, primarily as
    a result of leveraging of the Company’s scale and
    infrastructure against global growth.

RESULTS
    OF OPERATIONS — FISCAL 2006 COMPARED TO FISCAL

Consolidated
    Results of Operations

Net revenues for the fiscal year ended 2006 increased 22% to
    $7.8 billion from $6.4 billion for fiscal 2005, driven
    by increases in both Company-operated retail revenues and
    specialty operations.

During the fiscal year ended 2006, Starbucks derived 85% of
    total net revenues from its Company-operated retail stores.
    Company-operated retail revenues increased 22% to
    $6.6 billion for the fiscal year ended 2006, from
    $5.4 billion for fiscal 2005. This increase was primarily
    due to the opening of 1,043 new Company-operated retail stores
    in the last 12 months and comparable store sales growth of
    7% in fiscal 2006. The increase in comparable store sales was
    due to a 5% increase in the number of customer transactions and
    a 2% increase in the average value per transaction.

The Company derived the remaining 15% of total net revenues from
    channels outside the Company-operated retail stores. Specialty
    revenues, which include licensing revenues and foodservice and
    other revenues, increased 23% to $1.2 billion for the
    fiscal year ended 2006, from $977 million for fiscal 2005.

Licensing revenues, which are derived from retail store
    licensing arrangements, as well as grocery, warehouse club and
    certain other branded product operations, increased 28% to
    $861 million for fiscal 2006, from $673 million for
    fiscal 2005. The increase is primarily due to higher product
    sales and royalty revenues from the opening of 1,156 new
    licensed retail stores in the last 12 months and, to a
    lesser extent, growth in the licensed grocery and warehouse club
    business.

Foodservice and other revenues increased 13% to
    $343 million for fiscal 2006, from $304 million for
    fiscal 2005. Foodservice and other revenues increased primarily
    due to growth in new and existing U.S. foodservice accounts.

Cost of sales including occupancy costs decreased slightly to
    40.8% of total net revenues for fiscal 2006, from 40.9% in
    fiscal 2005. The decrease was primarily due to fixed rent costs
    in fiscal 2006 being distributed over an expanded revenue base,
    as well as increased occupancy costs in fiscal 2005 resulting
    from intensified store maintenance activities. These favorable
    items, combined with lower dairy costs, offset higher green
    coffee costs for fiscal 2006.

Store operating expenses as a percentage of Company-operated
    retail revenues increased to 40.8% for fiscal 2006 from 40.2%
    for fiscal 2005. The increase was due to the recognition of
    stock-based compensation expense and to higher provisions for
    incentive compensation. The Company adopted the fair value
    recognition provisions of new accounting requirements to expense
    stock-based compensation at the beginning of its fiscal first
    quarter of 2006. Under the transition provisions allowed, it
    adopted the new requirements on a prospective basis and the
    financial statements for fiscal 2005 and prior years do not
    include stock-based compensation expense.

Other operating expenses, which are expenses associated with the
    Company’s Specialty Operations, increased to 21.1% of
    specialty revenues in fiscal 2006, compared to 19.7% in fiscal
    2005. The increase was primarily due to the recognition of
    stock-based compensation expense as well as higher
    payroll-related expenditures to support the expanding licensed
    store operations, both in the U.S. and in existing and new
    international markets.

Depreciation and amortization expenses increased to
    $387 million in fiscal 2006, from $340 million in
    fiscal 2005. The increase of $47 million was due to the
    opening of 1,043 new Company-operated retail stores in the last
    12 months. As a percentage of total net revenues,
    depreciation and amortization decreased to 5.0% for fiscal 2006,
    from 5.3% for fiscal 2005.

General and administrative expenses increased to
    $479 million in fiscal 2006, compared to $362 million
    in fiscal 2005. The increase was due to higher payroll-related
    expenditures from the recognition of stock-based compensation
    expense, additional employees to support continued global
    growth, and higher professional fees in support of global
    systems infrastructure development. As a percentage of total net
    revenues, general and administrative expenses increased to 6.1%
    for fiscal 2006, from 5.7% for fiscal 2005.



Income from equity investees increased to $94 million in
    fiscal 2006, compared to $77 million in fiscal 2005. The
    increase was primarily due to favorable volume-driven operating
    results for The North American Coffee Partnership, which
    produces ready-to-drink beverages which include, among others,
    bottled
    Frappuccino

®

coffee drinks and Starbucks
    DoubleShot

®

espresso drinks, as well as improved operating results from
    international investees, including Korea and Japan, mainly as a
    result of new store openings.

Operating income increased 15% to $894 million in fiscal
    2006, from $781 million in fiscal 2005. The operating
    margin decreased to 11.5% of total net revenues in fiscal 2006,
    compared to 12.3% in fiscal 2005, due to the recognition of
    stock-based compensation expense.

Net interest and other income, which primarily consists of
    interest income, decreased to $12 million in fiscal 2006,
    from $16 million in fiscal 2005. The decrease was primarily
    due to higher interest expense on the Company’s revolving
    credit facility, as well as lower interest income earned due to
    lower average investment balances, offset in part by the
    recognition of $4.4 million of income on unredeemed stored
    value card balances in fiscal 2006. There was no income
    recognized on unredeemed stored value card balances in fiscal
    2005.

Income taxes for fiscal 2006 resulted in an effective tax rate
    of 35.8%, compared to 37.9% in fiscal 2005. The decline in the
    effective tax rate was due to the reversal of a valuation
    allowance in fiscal 2006 that had been established in fiscal
    2005, the settlement in the third quarter of fiscal 2006 of a
    multi-year income tax audit in a foreign jurisdiction for which
    the Company had established a contingent liability, and to
    increased effectiveness of the Company’s long-term tax
    planning strategies.

CPG total net revenues increased 23% to $305 million for
    the fiscal year ended 2006, compared to $249 million for
    fiscal 2005, primarily due to volume growth in the licensed

    the Company’s equity investees and lower cost of sales as a
    percentage of revenues. The increase in equity investee income
    was primarily due to volume-driven results for The North
    American Coffee Partnership, which produces ready-to-drink
    beverages which include, among others, bottled

beverages and

Unallocated corporate expenses increased to $337 million
    for the fiscal year ended 2006, from $252 million in fiscal
    2005. The increase was due to higher payroll-related
    expenditures from the recognition of stock-based compensation
    expense and to additional employees, as well as higher
    professional fees primarily in support of global systems
    infrastructure development. Total unallocated corporate expenses
    as a percentage of total net revenues were 4.3% for the fiscal

LIQUIDITY
    AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

The primary sources of the Company’s liquidity are cash
    flows generated from retail store operations and other business
    channels, borrowings under available commercial paper programs
    and credit agreements, proceeds from the issuance of long-term
    debt securities and the Company’s existing cash and liquid
    investments, which were $460 million and $459 million
    as of September 30, 2007 and October 1, 2006,
    respectively.

In order to hedge its liability under its Management Deferred
    Compensation Plan (“MDCP”), the Company maintains a
    portfolio of unrestricted trading securities, the value of which
    was $74 million as of September 30, 2007. In addition,
    unrestricted cash and liquid securities held within the
    Company’s wholly owned captive insurance company to fund
    claim payouts totaled approximately $98 million as of
    September 30, 2007. The Company manages the balance of its
    cash and liquid investments in order to internally fund
    operating needs and make scheduled payments on short-term
    borrowings.

In determining the appropriate capital structure for the
    Company, management considers, among other things, how debt may
    reduce its total cost of capital when used to fund increased
    distributions to shareholders in the form of stock repurchases.
    The Company also evaluates its degree of cash flow risk and how
    much financial flexibility should be retained for future
    investment opportunities given its high growth rate. The
    Company’s key metrics for monitoring its capital structure
    are leverage, measured as the ratio of debt to EBITDA, and
    coverage, measured as the ratio of EBITDA to interest expense
    including rent expense. Both ratios are adjusted to capitalize
    operating leases. The credit rating agencies, Moody’s and
    Standard & Poor’s, currently rate the
    Company’s commercial paper

P-2

and

A-2,

respectively, and its long-term debt Baa1 and BBB+, respectively.

The Company intends to use its cash and liquid investments,
    including any borrowings under its revolving credit facility,
    commercial paper program and proceeds from the issuance of long
    term debt securities, to invest in its core businesses and other
    new business opportunities related to its core businesses. The
    Company may use its available



cash resources to make proportionate capital contributions to
    its equity method and cost method investees, as well as purchase
    larger ownership interests in selected equity method investees
    and licensed operations, particularly in international markets.
    Depending on market conditions, Starbucks may repurchase shares
    of its common stock under its authorized share repurchase
    program. Management believes that strong cash flow generated
    from operations, existing cash and liquid investments, as well
    as borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility and
    commercial paper program, should be sufficient to finance
    capital requirements for its core businesses for the foreseeable
    future. Significant new joint ventures, acquisitions, share
    repurchases

and/or

other
    new business opportunities may require additional outside
    funding.

Other than normal operating expenses, cash requirements for
    fiscal 2008 are expected to consist primarily of capital
    expenditures for new Company-operated retail stores and the
    remodeling and refurbishment of existing Company-operated retail
    stores, as well as potential increased investments in
    International licensees and for additional share repurchases, if
    any. Management expects capital expenditures for fiscal 2008 to
    be consistent with the $1.1 billion invested in fiscal
    2007, primarily driven by new store development and existing
    store renovations.

Cash provided by operating activities totaled $1.3 billion
    for fiscal 2007. Of this amount, net earnings provided
    $673 million and noncash depreciation and amortization
    expenses further increased cash provided by operating activities
    by $491 million. In addition, an increase in accrued taxes
    payable due to the timing of payments provided $86 million.

Cash used by investing activities for fiscal 2007 totaled
    $1.2 billion. Net capital additions to property, plant and
    equipment used $1.1 billion, primarily from opening 1,342
    new Company-operated retail stores and remodeling certain
    existing stores. During fiscal 2007, the Company used
    $53 million for acquisitions, net of cash acquired. In
    addition, the net activity in the Company’s portfolio of
    available-for-sale securities used $12 million.

Cash used by financing activities for fiscal 2007 totaled
    $172 million. Cash used to repurchase shares of the
    Company’s common stock totaled $997 million. This
    amount includes the effect of the net change in unsettled trades
    from October 1, 2006. Share repurchases, up to the limit
    authorized by the Board of Directors, are at the discretion of
    management and depend on market conditions, capital requirements
    and other factors. As of September 30, 2007, a total of up
    to 13.5 million shares remained available for repurchase,
    under existing authorizations.

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, the Company issued
    $550 million of 6.25% Senior Notes due in August 2017,
    in an underwritten registered public offering. The proceeds of
    $549 million, before expenses, were primarily used to repay
    short-term borrowings and fund additional share repurchases. Net
    new borrowings under the Company’s credit facility and
    commercial paper program were $10 million for fiscal 2007.
    As of September 30, 2007, a total of $710 million in
    borrowings were outstanding under the commercial paper program
    and $13 million in letters of credit were outstanding under
    the credit facility, leaving $275 million of capacity
    available under the $1 billion combined commercial paper
    program and revolving credit facility.

Partially offsetting cash used for share repurchases were
    proceeds of $177 million from the exercise of employee
    stock options and the sale of the Company’s common stock
    from employee stock purchase plans. As options granted are
    exercised, the Company will continue to receive proceeds and a
    tax deduction; however, the amounts and the timing cannot be
    predicted.



The following table summarizes the Company’s contractual
    obligations and borrowings as of September 30, 2007, and
    the timing and effect that such commitments are expected to have
    on the Company’s liquidity and capital requirements in

Off-Balance
    Sheet Arrangement

The Company has unconditionally guaranteed the repayment of
    certain Japanese yen-denominated bank loans and related interest
    and fees of an unconsolidated equity investee, Starbucks Coffee
    Japan, Ltd. (“Starbucks Japan”). The guarantees
    continue until the loans, including accrued interest and fees,
    have been paid in full, with the final loan amount due in 2014.
    The maximum amount is limited to the sum of unpaid principal and
    interest amounts, as well as other related expenses. These
    amounts will vary based on fluctuations in the yen foreign
    exchange rate. As of September 30, 2007, the maximum amount
    of the guarantees was approximately $4.9 million. Since
    there has been no modification of these loan guarantees
    subsequent to the Company’s adoption of Financial
    Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Interpretation
    No. 45, “Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure
    Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of
    Indebtedness of Others,” Starbucks has applied the
    disclosure provisions only and has not recorded the guarantees
    on its consolidated balance sheet.

COMMODITY
    PRICES, AVAILABILITY AND GENERAL RISK CONDITIONS

Commodity price risk represents the Company’s primary
    market risk, generated by its purchases of green coffee and
    dairy products. The Company purchases, roasts and sells high
    quality whole bean coffee and related products and risk arises
    from the price volatility of green coffee. In addition to
    coffee, the Company also purchases significant amounts of dairy
    products to support the needs of its Company-operated retail
    stores. The price and availability of these commodities directly
    impacts the Company’s results of operations and can be
    expected to impact its future results of operations. For
    additional details see “Product Supply” in
    Item 1, as well as “Risk Factors” in Item 1A
    of this

Form 10-K.

FINANCIAL
    RISK MANAGEMENT

Market risk is defined as the risk of losses due to changes in
    commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates, equity
    prices, and interest rates. The Company manages its exposure to
    various market-based risks according to an umbrella risk
    management policy. Under this policy, market-based risks are
    quantified and evaluated for potential mitigation strategies,
    such as entering into hedging transactions. The umbrella risk
    management policy governs the



hedging instruments the business may use and limits the dollar
    risk to net earnings. The Company also monitors and limits the
    amount of associated counterparty credit risk. Additionally,
    this policy restricts, among other things, the amount of
    market-based risk the Company will tolerate before implementing
    approved hedging strategies and prohibits speculative trading
    activity. In general, hedge instruments do not have maturities
    in excess of five years.

The sensitivity analyses performed below provide only a limited,

point-in-time

view of the market risk of the financial instruments discussed.
    The actual impact of the respective underlying rates and price
    changes on the financial instruments may differ significantly
    from those shown in the sensitivity analyses.

Commodity
    Price Risk

The Company purchases commodity inputs, including coffee and
    dairy products that are used in its operations and are subject
    to price fluctuations that impact its financial results. In
    addition to fixed-priced contracts and price-to-be-fixed
    contracts for coffee purchases, the Company may enter into
    commodity hedges to manage commodity price risk using financial
    derivative instruments. The Company performed a sensitivity
    analysis based on a 10% change in the underlying commodity
    prices of its commodity hedges, as of the end of fiscal 2007,
    and determined that such a change would not have a significant
    effect on the fair value of these instruments.

Foreign
    Currency Exchange Risk

The majority of the Company’s revenue, expense and capital
    purchasing activities are transacted in U.S. dollars.
    However, because a portion of the Company’s operations
    consists of activities outside of the United States, the Company
    has transactions in other currencies, primarily the Canadian
    dollar, British pound sterling, euro, and Japanese yen. As a
    result, Starbucks may engage in transactions involving various
    derivative instruments to hedge revenues, inventory purchases,
    assets, and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies.

As of September 30, 2007, the Company had forward foreign
    exchange contracts that qualify as cash flow hedges under
    Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (“SFAS”)
    No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and
    Hedging Activities,” as amended and interpreted, to hedge
    portions of anticipated international revenue streams and
    inventory purchases. In addition, Starbucks had forward foreign
    exchange contracts that qualify as accounting hedges of its net
    investment in Starbucks Japan, as well as the Company’s net
    investments in its Canadian, UK, and Chinese subsidiaries, to
    minimize foreign currency exposure. These contracts expire
    within 30 months.

The Company also had forward foreign exchange contracts that are
    not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes
    (free standing derivatives), but which largely offset the
    financial impact of translating certain foreign currency
    denominated payables and receivables. Increases or decreases in
    the fair value of these hedges are generally offset by
    corresponding decreases or increases in the U.S. dollar
    value of the Company’s foreign currency denominated
    payables and receivables (i.e. “hedged items”) that
    would occur within the hedging period.

The following table summarizes the potential impact to the
    Company’s future net earnings and other comprehensive
    income (“OCI”) from changes in the fair value of these
    derivative financial instruments due in turn to a change in the
    value of the U.S. dollar as compared to the level of
    foreign exchange rates. The information provided below relates
    only to the hedging instruments and does not represent the
    corresponding changes in the underlying hedged items (

Equity
    Security Price Risk

The Company has minimal exposure to price fluctuations on equity
    mutual funds within its trading portfolio. The trading
    securities approximate a portion of the Company’s liability
    under the MDCP. A corresponding liability is included in
    “Accrued compensation and related costs” on the
    consolidated balance sheets. These investments are



recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses
    recognized in “Net interest and other income” in the
    consolidated statements of earnings. The offsetting changes in
    the MDCP liability are recorded in “General and
    administrative expenses.” The Company performed a
    sensitivity analysis based on a 10% change in the underlying
    equity prices of its investments, as of the end of fiscal 2007,
    and determined that such a change would not have a significant
    effect on the fair value of these instruments.

Interest
    Rate Risk

The Company utilizes short and long term financing and may use
    interest rate hedges to manage the effect of interest rate
    changes on its existing debt as well as the anticipated issuance
    of new debt. At the end of fiscal years 2007 and 2006, the
    Company did not have any interest rate hedge agreements
    outstanding. During the fiscal fourth quarter of 2007, the
    Company had Treasury interest rate contracts in place to
    mitigate a portion of the interest rate risk associated with the
    $550 million Senior Notes issued in August 2007. These
    contracts were dedesignated and settled at closing of the debt
    offering.

    interest rates on the fair value of the Company’s debt

The Company’s available-for-sale securities comprise a
    diversified portfolio consisting mainly of fixed income
    instruments. The primary objectives of these investments are to
    preserve capital and liquidity. Available-for-sale securities
    are investment grade and are recorded on the balance sheet at
    fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a
    separate component of “Accumulated other comprehensive
    income.” The Company does not hedge the interest rate
    exposure on its available-for-sale securities. The Company
    performed a sensitivity analysis based on a 100 basis point
    change in the underlying interest rate of its available-for-sale
    securities, as of the end of fiscal 2007, and determined that
    such a change would not have a significant effect on the fair
    value of these instruments.

SEASONALITY
    AND QUARTERLY RESULTS

The Company’s business is subject to seasonal fluctuations,
    including fluctuations resulting from the holiday season. The
    Company’s cash flows from operations are considerably
    higher in the fiscal first quarter than the remainder of the
    year. This is largely driven by cash received as Starbucks Cards
    are purchased and loaded during the holiday season. Since
    revenues from the Starbucks Card are recognized upon redemption
    and not when purchased, seasonal fluctuations on the
    consolidated statements of earnings are much less pronounced.
    Quarterly results are affected by the timing of the opening of
    new stores, and the Company’s growth may conceal the impact
    of other seasonal influences. For these reasons, results for any
    quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may
    be achieved for the full fiscal year.

APPLICATION
    OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Critical accounting policies are those that management believes
    are both most important to the portrayal of the Company’s
    financial condition and results, and require management’s
    most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a
    result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters
    that are inherently uncertain. Judgments and uncertainties
    affecting the application of those policies may result in
    materially different amounts being reported under different
    conditions or using different assumptions.

Starbucks considers its policies on impairment of long-lived
    assets, stock-based compensation, operating leases, self
    insurance reserves and income taxes to be the most critical in
    understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing its
    consolidated financial statements.



Impairment
    of Long-Lived Assets

When facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying values
    of long-lived assets may be impaired, an evaluation of
    recoverability is performed by comparing the carrying values of
    the assets to projected future cash flows, in addition to other
    quantitative and qualitative analyses. For goodwill and other
    intangible assets, impairment tests are performed annually and
    more frequently if facts and circumstances indicate goodwill
    carrying values exceed estimated reporting unit fair values and
    if indefinite useful lives are no longer appropriate for the
    Company’s trademarks. Upon indication that the carrying
    values of such assets may not be recoverable, the Company
    recognizes an impairment loss as a charge against current
    operations. Property, plant and equipment assets are grouped at
    the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows
    when assessing impairment. Cash flows for retail assets are
    identified at the individual store level. Long-lived assets to
    be disposed of are reported at the lower of their carrying
    amount or fair value, less estimated costs to sell. Judgments
    made by the Company related to the expected useful lives of
    long-lived assets and the ability of the Company to realize
    undiscounted cash flows in excess of the carrying amounts of
    such assets are affected by factors such as the ongoing
    maintenance and improvements of the assets, changes in economic
    conditions and changes in operating performance. As the Company
    assesses the ongoing expected cash flows and carrying amounts of
    its long-lived assets, these factors could cause the Company to
    realize material impairment charges.

Stock-based
    Compensation

Starbucks accounts for stock-based compensation in accordance
    with the fair value recognition provisions of
    SFAS No. 123(R), “Share-Based Payment.” The
    Company uses the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model which
    requires the input of subjective assumptions. These assumptions
    include estimating the length of time employees will retain
    their stock options before exercising them (“expected
    term”), the estimated volatility of the Company’s
    common stock price over the expected term and the number of
    options that will ultimately not complete their vesting
    requirements (“forfeitures”). Changes in the
    subjective assumptions could materially affect the estimate of
    fair value of stock-based compensation; however based on an
    analysis using changes in certain assumptions that could be
    reasonably possible in the near term, management believes the
    effect on the expense recognized for fiscal 2007 would not have
    been material.

Operating
    Leases

Starbucks leases retail stores, roasting and distribution
    facilities and office space under operating leases. The Company
    provides for an estimate of asset retirement obligation
    (“ARO”) expense at the lease inception date for
    operating leases with requirements to remove leasehold
    improvements at the end of the lease term. Estimating AROs
    involves subjective assumptions regarding both the amount and
    timing of actual future retirement costs. Future actual costs
    could differ significantly from amounts initially estimated. In
    addition, the large number of operating leases and the
    significant number of international markets in which the Company
    has operating leases adds administrative complexity to the
    calculation of ARO expense, as well as to the other technical
    accounting requirements of operating leases such as contingent
    rent.

Self
    Insurance Reserves

The Company uses a combination of insurance and self-insurance
    mechanisms, including a wholly owned captive insurance entity
    and participation in a reinsurance pool, to provide for the
    potential liabilities for workers’ compensation, healthcare
    benefits, general liability, property insurance, director and
    officers’ liability insurance and vehicle liability.
    Liabilities associated with the risks that are retained by the
    Company are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by
    considering historical claims experience, demographic factors,
    severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated
    accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected
    if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions
    and historical trends.

Income
    Taxes

Starbucks accounts for income taxes in accordance with Statement
    of SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income
    Taxes,” which recognizes deferred tax assets and
    liabilities based on the differences between the financial
    statement



carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities.
    Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using current
    enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which those
    temporary differences are expected to reverse. Judgment is
    required in determining the provision for income taxes and
    related accruals, deferred tax assets and liabilities. These
    include establishing a valuation allowance related to the
    realizability of certain deferred tax assets, and contingent tax
    liabilities provided for the possibility of unfavorable outcomes
    in certain tax positions. Although the Company believes that its
    estimates are reasonable, actual results could differ from these
    estimates.

RECENT
    ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

In June 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48,
    “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an
    interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109”
    (“FIN 48”), which seeks to reduce the diversity
    in practice associated with the accounting and reporting for
    uncertainty in income tax positions. This Interpretation
    prescribes a comprehensive model for the financial statement
    recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of
    uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in income
    tax returns. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning
    after December 15, 2006, and the Company will adopt the new
    requirements in its first fiscal quarter of 2008. The cumulative
    effect of adopting FIN 48 will be recorded as an adjustment
    to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of
    adoption. The Company expects that the effect of adopting
    FIN 48 will result in an immaterial adjustment to fiscal
    year 2008 opening retained earnings.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157,
    “Fair Value Measurements” (“SFAS 157”),
    which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring
    fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and
    expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS 157
    is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years
    beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods
    within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted.
    Starbucks must adopt these new requirements no later than its
    first fiscal quarter of 2009. Starbucks has not yet determined
    the effect on the Company’s consolidated financial
    statements, if any, upon adoption of SFAS 157, or if it
    will adopt the requirements prior to the first fiscal quarter of
    2009.

In September 2006, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting
    Bulletin No. 108, “Considering the Effects of
    Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in
    Current Year Financial Statements”
    (“SAB 108”). The intent of SAB 108 is to
    reduce diversity in practice for the method companies use to
    quantify financial statement misstatements, including the effect
    of prior year uncorrected errors. SAB 108 establishes an
    approach that requires quantification of financial statement
    errors using both an income statement and cumulative balance
    sheet approach. SAB 108 was effective for annual financial
    statements for fiscal years ending after November 15, 2006,
    and the Company adopted the new requirements in fiscal 2007 with
    no impact to its consolidated financial statements.

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159,
    “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
    Liabilities” (“SFAS 159”). SFAS 159
    permits companies to choose to measure many financial
    instruments and certain other items at fair value. SFAS 159
    is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years
    beginning after November 15, 2007, or Starbucks first
    fiscal quarter of 2009. Early adoption is permitted. Starbucks
    has not yet determined if it will elect to apply any of the
    provisions of SFAS 159 or what the effect of adoption of
    the statement would have, if any, on its consolidated financial
    statements.

STARBUCKS
    CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Fiscal Years ended September 30, 2007, October 1,
    2006, and October 2, 2005

Note 1:

Summary
    of Significant Accounting Policies

Description
    of Business

Starbucks Corporation (together with its subsidiaries,
    “Starbucks” or the “Company”) purchases and
    roasts high-quality whole bean coffees and sells them, along
    with fresh, rich-brewed coffees, Italian-style espresso
    beverages, cold blended beverages, a variety of complementary
    food items, coffee-related accessories and equipment, a
    selection of premium teas and a line of compact discs, primarily
    through its Company-operated retail stores. Starbucks also sells
    coffee and tea products and licenses its trademark through other
    channels and, through certain of its equity investees, Starbucks
    produces and sells ready-to-drink beverages which include, among
    others, bottled
    Frappuccino

®

beverages and Starbucks
    DoubleShot

®

espresso drinks, and a line of superpremium ice creams. All
    channels outside the Company-operated retail stores are
    collectively known as “Specialty Operations.” The
    Company’s objective is to establish Starbucks as one of the
    most recognized and respected brands in the world. To achieve
    this goal, the Company plans to continue expansion of its retail
    operations, to grow its Specialty Operations and to selectively
    pursue other opportunities to leverage the Starbucks brand by
    introducing new products and developing new channels of
    distribution. The Company’s brand portfolio includes
    superpremium
    Tazo

teas, Starbucks Hear
    Music

®

coffee.

Principles
    of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements reflect the financial
    position and operating results of Starbucks, including wholly
    owned subsidiaries and investees controlled by the Company.
    Investments in entities that the Company does not control, but
    has the ability to exercise significant influence over operating
    and financial policies, are accounted for under the equity
    method. Investments in entities in which Starbucks does not have
    the ability to exercise significant influence are accounted for
    under the cost method. Intercompany transactions and balances
    have been eliminated.

Fiscal
    Year End

Starbucks Corporation’s fiscal year ends on the Sunday
    closest to September 30. Some fiscal years include
    53 weeks. The fiscal years ended on September 30,
    2007, October 1, 2006 and October 2, 2005 included
    52 weeks.

Reclassifications

Certain reclassifications of prior year’s balances have
    been made to conform to the current format, including
    reclassifications from “Other operating expenses” to
    “General and administrative expenses” on the
    consolidated statements of earnings.

Estimates
    and Assumptions

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
    America (“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates
    and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets,
    liabilities, revenues and expenses. Actual results may differ
    from these estimates.

Cash
    and Cash Equivalents

The Company considers all highly liquid instruments with a
    maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase to be
    cash equivalents. The Company maintains cash and cash equivalent
    balances with financial institutions that exceed federally
    insured limits. The Company has not experienced any losses
    related to these balances, and management believes its credit
    risk to be minimal.



Cash
    Management

The Company’s cash management system provides for the
    funding of all major bank disbursement accounts on a daily basis
    as checks are presented for payment. Under this system,
    outstanding checks are in excess of the cash balances at certain
    banks, which creates book overdrafts. Book overdrafts are
    presented as a current liability in “Accounts payable”
    on the consolidated balance sheets.

Short-term
    and Long-term Investments

The Company’s short-term and long-term investments consist
    primarily of investment-grade marketable debt securities as well
    as bond and equity mutual funds, all of which are classified as
    available-for-sale or trading. Trading securities are recorded
    at fair value with unrealized holding gains and losses included
    in net earnings. Available-for-sale securities are recorded at
    fair value, and unrealized holding gains and losses are
    recorded, net of tax, as a separate component of accumulated
    other comprehensive income. Available-for-sale securities with
    remaining maturities of less than one year and those identified
    by management at time of purchase for funding operations in less
    than one year are classified as short-term, and all other
    available-for-sale securities are classified as long-term.
    Unrealized losses are charged against net earnings when a
    decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary.
    Management reviews several factors to determine whether a loss
    is other than temporary, such as the length of time a security
    is in an unrealized loss position, the extent to which fair
    value is less than amortized cost, the impact of changing
    interest rates in the short and long term, the financial
    condition and near term prospects of the issuer and the
    Company’s intent and ability to hold the security for a
    period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery
    in fair value. Realized gains and losses are accounted for on
    the specific identification method. Purchases and sales are
    recorded on a trade date basis.

Fair
    Value of Financial Instruments

The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents approximates
    fair value because of the short-term maturity of those
    instruments. The fair value of the Company’s investments in
    marketable debt and equity securities, as well as bond and
    equity mutual funds, is based upon the quoted market price on
    the last business day of the fiscal year. For equity securities
    of companies that are privately held, or where an observable
    quoted market price does not exist, the Company estimates fair
    value using a variety of valuation methodologies. Such
    methodologies include comparing the security with securities of
    publicly traded companies in similar lines of business, applying
    revenue multiples to estimated future operating results for the
    private company and estimating discounted cash flows for that
    company. Declines in fair value below the Company’s
    carrying value deemed to be other than temporary are charged
    against net earnings. For further information on investments,
    see Notes 3 and 6. The carrying value of short-term and
    long-term debt approximates fair value.

Derivative
    Instruments

The Company manages its exposure to various risks within the
    consolidated financial statements according to an umbrella risk
    management policy. Under this policy, Starbucks may engage in
    transactions involving various derivative instruments, with
    maturities generally not longer than five years, to hedge
    interest rates, commodity prices, and foreign currency
    denominated revenues, purchases, assets and liabilities.

The Company follows Statement of Financial Accounting Standard
    (“SFAS”) No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative
    Instruments and Hedging Activities,” as amended and
    interpreted, which requires that all derivatives be recorded on
    the balance sheet at fair value. For a cash flow hedge, the
    effective portion of the derivative’s gain or loss is
    initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income
    (“OCI”) and subsequently reclassified into net
    earnings when the hedged exposure affects net earnings. For a
    net investment hedge, the effective portion of the
    derivative’s gain or loss is reported as a component of OCI.

Cash flow hedges related to anticipated transactions are
    designated and documented at the inception of each hedge by
    matching the terms of the contract to the underlying
    transaction. The Company classifies the cash flows from hedging
    transactions in the same categories as the cash flows from the
    respective hedged items. Once established, cash flow hedges are
    generally not removed until maturity unless an anticipated
    transaction is no longer likely to occur. Discontinued or
    dedesignated cash flow hedges are immediately settled with
    counterparties, and the related



accumulated derivative gains or losses are recognized into net
    earnings in “Net interest and other income” on the
    consolidated statements of earnings.

Forward contract effectiveness for cash flow hedges is
    calculated by comparing the fair value of the contract to the
    change in value of the anticipated transaction using forward
    rates on a monthly basis. For net investment hedges, the
    spot-to-spot method is used to calculate effectiveness. Under
    this method, the change in fair value of the forward contract
    attributable to the changes in spot exchange rates (the
    effective portion) is reported as a component of OCI. The
    remaining change in fair value of the forward contract (the
    ineffective portion) is reclassified into net earnings. Any
    ineffectiveness is recognized immediately in “Net interest
    and other income” on the consolidated statements of
    earnings.

The Company also entered into foreign currency forward contracts
    that are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting
    purposes. These contracts are recorded at fair value, with the
    changes in fair value recognized in “Net interest and other
    income” on the consolidated statements of earnings.

Allowance
    for Doubtful Accounts

Allowance for doubtful accounts is calculated based on
    historical experience, customer credit risk and application of
    the specific identification method. As of September 30,
    2007 and October 1, 2006, the allowance for doubtful
    accounts was $3.2 million and $3.8 million,
    respectively.

Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (primarily moving
    average cost) or market. The Company records inventory reserves
    for obsolete and slow-moving items and for estimated shrinkage
    between physical inventory counts. Inventory reserves are based
    on inventory turnover trends, historical experience and
    application of the specific identification method. As of
    September 30, 2007 and October 1, 2006, inventory
    reserves were $14.9 million and $10.5 million,
    respectively.

Property,
    Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment are carried at cost less
    accumulated depreciation. Depreciation of property, plant and
    equipment, which includes assets under capital leases, is
    provided on the straight-line method over estimated useful
    lives, generally ranging from two to seven years for equipment
    and 30 to 40 years for buildings. Leasehold improvements
    are amortized over the shorter of their estimated useful lives
    or the related lease life, generally 10 years. For leases
    with renewal periods at the Company’s option, Starbucks
    generally uses the original lease term, excluding renewal option
    periods to determine estimated useful lives. If failure to
    exercise a renewal option imposes an economic penalty to
    Starbucks, management may determine at the inception of the
    lease that renewal is reasonably assured and include the renewal
    option period in the determination of appropriate estimated
    useful lives. The portion of depreciation expense related to
    production and distribution facilities is included in “Cost
    of sales including occupancy costs” on the consolidated
    statements of earnings. The costs of repairs and maintenance are
    expensed when incurred, while expenditures for refurbishments
    and improvements that significantly add to the productive
    capacity or extend the useful life of an asset are capitalized.
    When assets are retired or sold, the asset cost and related
    accumulated depreciation are eliminated with any remaining gain
    or loss reflected in net earnings.

Goodwill
    and Other Intangible Assets

Goodwill and other intangible assets are tested for impairment
    annually and more frequently if facts and circumstances indicate
    goodwill carrying values exceed estimated reporting unit fair
    values and if indefinite useful lives are no longer appropriate
    for the Company’s trademarks. Based on the impairment tests
    performed, there was no impairment of goodwill or other
    intangible assets in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005. Definite-lived
    intangibles, which mainly consist of contract-based patents and
    copyrights, are amortized over their estimated useful lives. For
    further information on goodwill and other intangible assets, see
    Note 8.



Long-lived
    Assets

When facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying values
    of long-lived assets may be impaired, an evaluation of
    recoverability is performed by comparing the carrying values of
    the assets to projected future cash flows in addition to other
    quantitative and qualitative analyses. Upon indication that the
    carrying values of such assets may not be recoverable, the
    Company recognizes an impairment loss by a charge to net
    earnings. Property, plant and equipment assets are grouped at
    the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows
    when assessing impairment. Cash flows for retail assets are
    identified at the individual store level.

The Company recognized net impairment and disposition losses of
    $26.0 million, $19.6 million and $19.5 million in
    fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, due to renovation and
    remodeling activity and from underperforming Company-operated
    retail stores, in the normal course of business. Depending on
    the underlying asset that is impaired, these losses may be
    recorded in any one of the operating expense lines on the
    consolidated statements of earnings: for retail operations,
    these losses are recorded in “Store operating
    expenses”; for Specialty Operations, these losses are
    recorded in “Other operating expenses”; and for all
    other operations, these losses are recorded in either “Cost
    of sales including occupancy costs” or “General and
    administrative expenses.”

Insurance
    Reserves

The Company uses a combination of insurance and self-insurance
    mechanisms, including a wholly owned captive insurance entity
    and participation in a reinsurance pool, to provide for the
    potential liabilities for workers’ compensation, healthcare
    benefits, general liability, property insurance, director and
    officers’ liability insurance and vehicle liability.
    Liabilities associated with the risks that are retained by the
    Company are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by
    considering historical claims experience, demographic factors,
    severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated
    accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected
    if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions
    and historical trends. As of September 30, 2007, and
    October 1, 2006, these reserves were $137.0 million
    and $113.2 million, respectively, and were included in
    “Accrued compensation and related costs” and
    “Other accrued expenses” on the consolidated balance
    sheets.

Revenue
    Recognition

Consolidated revenues are presented net of intercompany
    eliminations for wholly owned subsidiaries and investees
    controlled by the Company and for licensees accounted for under
    the equity method, based on the Company’s percentage
    ownership. Additionally, consolidated revenues are recognized
    net of any discounts, returns, allowances and sales incentives,
    including coupon redemptions and rebates.

Stored
    Value Cards

Revenues from the Company’s stored value cards, such as the
    Starbucks Card, and gift certificates are recognized when
    tendered for payment, or upon redemption. Outstanding customer
    balances are included in “Deferred revenue” on the
    consolidated balance sheets. There are no expiration dates on
    the Company’s stored value cards or gift certificates, and
    Starbucks does not charge any service fees that cause a
    decrement to customer balances.

While the Company will continue to honor all stored value cards
    and gift certificates presented for payment, management may
    determine the likelihood of redemption to be remote for certain
    card and certificate balances due to, among other things, long
    periods of inactivity. In these circumstances, to the extent
    management determines there is no requirement for remitting
    balances to government agencies under unclaimed property laws,
    card and certificate balances may be recognized in the
    consolidated statements of earnings in “Net interest and
    other income.” For the fiscal years ended
    September 30, 2007 and October 1, 2006, income
    recognized on unredeemed stored value card balances and gift
    certificates was $12.9 million and $4.4 million,
    respectively. There was no income recognized on unredeemed
    stored value card balances during the fiscal year ended
    October 2, 2005. There was no income recognized on gift
    certificate balances during fiscal 2006 or 2005.



Retail
    Revenues

Company-operated retail store revenues are recognized when
    payment is tendered at the point of sale. Starbucks maintains a
    sales return allowance, to reduce retail revenues for estimated
    future product returns, including brewing equipment, based on
    historical patterns. Retail store revenues are reported net of
    sales, use or other transaction taxes that are collected from
    customers and remitted to taxing authorities.

Specialty
    Revenues

Specialty revenues consist primarily of product sales to
    customers other than through Company-operated retail stores, as
    well as royalties and other fees generated from licensing
    operations. Sales of coffee, tea and related products are
    generally recognized upon shipment to customers, depending on
    contract terms. Shipping charges billed to customers are also
    recognized as revenue, and the related shipping costs are
    included in “Cost of sales including occupancy costs”
    on the consolidated statements of earnings.

Specific to retail store licensing arrangements, initial
    nonrefundable development fees are recognized upon substantial
    performance of services for new market business development
    activities, such as initial business, real estate and store
    development planning, as well as providing operational materials
    and functional training courses for opening new licensed retail
    markets. Additional store licensing fees are recognized when new
    licensed stores are opened. Royalty revenues based upon a
    percentage of reported sales and other continuing fees, such as
    marketing and service fees, are recognized on a monthly basis
    when earned. For certain licensing arrangements, where the
    Company intends to acquire an ownership interest, the initial
    nonrefundable development fees are deferred to “Other
    long-term liabilities” on the consolidated balance sheets
    until acquisition, at which point the fees are reflected as a
    reduction of the Company’s investment.

Other arrangements involving multiple elements and deliverables
    as well as upfront fees are individually evaluated for revenue
    recognition. Cash payments received in advance of product or
    service delivery are recorded in “Deferred revenue”
    until earned.

Advertising

The Company expenses most advertising costs as they are
    incurred, except for certain production costs that are expensed
    the first time the advertising campaign takes place and
    direct-response advertising, which is capitalized and amortized
    over its expected period of future benefits. Direct-response
    advertising consists primarily of customer acquisition expenses
    including applications for customers to apply for the Starbucks
    Card
    Duetto

tm

Visa

®

.
    These capitalized costs are amortized over the life of the
    credit card which is estimated to be three years.

Total advertising expenses, recorded in “Store operating
    expenses,” “Other operating expenses” and
    “General and administrative expenses” on the
    consolidated statements of earnings, totaled
    $103.5 million, $107.5 million and $87.7 million
    in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. As of
    September 30, 2007 and October 1, 2006,
    $12.0 million and $19.2 million, respectively, of
    capitalized advertising costs were recorded in “Prepaid
    expenses and other current assets” and “Other
    assets” on the consolidated balance sheets.

Research
    and Development

Starbucks expenses research and development costs as they are
    incurred. The Company spent approximately $7.0 million,
    $6.5 million and $6.2 million during fiscal 2007, 2006
    and 2005, respectively, on technical research and development
    activities, in addition to customary product testing and product
    and process improvements in all areas of its business.

Store
    Preopening Expenses

Costs incurred in connection with the

start-up

and
    promotion of new store openings are expensed as incurred.



Operating
    Leases

Starbucks leases retail stores, roasting and distribution
    facilities and office space under operating leases. Most lease
    agreements contain tenant improvement allowances, rent holidays,
    lease premiums, rent escalation clauses

and/or

contingent rent provisions. For purposes of recognizing
    incentives, premiums and minimum rental expenses on a
    straight-line basis over the terms of the leases, the Company
    uses the date of initial possession to begin amortization, which
    is generally when the Company enters the space and begins to
    make improvements in preparation of intended use.

For tenant improvement allowances and rent holidays, the Company
    records a deferred rent liability in “Accrued occupancy
    costs” and “Other long-term liabilities” on the
    consolidated balance sheets and amortizes the deferred rent over
    the terms of the leases as reductions to rent expense on the
    consolidated statements of earnings.

For premiums paid upfront to enter a lease agreement, the
    Company records a deferred rent asset in “Prepaid expenses
    and other current assets” and “Other assets” on
    the consolidated balance sheets and then amortizes the deferred
    rent over the terms of the leases as additional rent expense on
    the consolidated statements of earnings.

For scheduled rent escalation clauses during the lease terms or
    for rental payments commencing at a date other than the date of
    initial occupancy, the Company records minimum rental expenses
    on a straight-line basis over the terms of the leases on the
    consolidated statements of earnings.

Certain leases provide for contingent rents, which are
    determined as a percentage of gross sales in excess of specified
    levels. The Company records a contingent rent liability in
    “Accrued occupancy costs” on the consolidated balance
    sheets and the corresponding rent expense when specified levels
    have been achieved or when management determines that achieving
    the specified levels during the fiscal year is probable.

Asset
    Retirement Obligations

Starbucks accounts for asset retirement obligations under
    Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”)
    Interpretation No. 47 (“FIN 47”),
    “Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement
    Obligations — an interpretation of FASB Statement
    No. 143,” which it adopted at the end of fiscal 2006.
    FIN 47 requires recognition of a liability for the fair
    value of a required asset retirement obligation
    (“ARO”) when such obligation is incurred. The
    Company’s AROs are primarily associated with leasehold
    improvements which, at the end of a lease, the Company is
    contractually obligated to remove in order to comply with the
    lease agreement. At the inception of a lease with such
    conditions, the Company records an ARO liability and a
    corresponding capital asset in an amount equal to the estimated
    fair value of the obligation. The liability is estimated based
    on a number of assumptions requiring management’s judgment,
    including store closing costs, cost inflation rates and discount
    rates, and is accreted to its projected future value over time.
    The capitalized asset is depreciated using the convention for
    depreciation of leasehold improvement assets. Upon satisfaction
    of the ARO conditions, any difference between the recorded ARO
    liability and the actual retirement costs incurred is recognized
    as an operating gain or loss in the consolidated statement of
    earnings.

Total ARO expense in fiscal 2007 was $4.2 million with
    components included in “Costs of sales including occupancy
    costs,” “Depreciation and amortization expenses”
    and “Income from equity investees.” The initial impact
    of adopting FIN 47 at the end of fiscal year 2006 was a
    charge of $27.1 million, with a related tax benefit of
    $9.9 million, for a net expense of $17.2 million; as
    required by FIN 47, the net amount was recorded as a
    cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle on the
    consolidated statement of earnings for fiscal year 2006. As of
    September 30, 2007 and October 1, 2006, the
    Company’s net ARO asset included in “Property,
    plant and equipment, net” was $20.2 million and
    $15.5 million, respectively, while the Company’s
    net ARO liability included in “Other long-term
    liabilities” was $43.7 million and $34.3 million,
    on the same respective dates.

Stock-based
    Compensation

The Company maintains several equity incentive plans under which
    it may grant non-qualified stock options, incentive stock
    options, restricted stock, restricted stock units
    (“RSUs”) or stock appreciation rights to employees,
    non-employee directors and consultants. The Company also has
    employee stock purchase plans (“ESPP”). RSUs



issued by the Company are equivalent to nonvested shares, as
    defined by SFAS 123(R), “Share-Based Payment”
    (“SFAS 123R”). See Note 13 for additional
    details.

Foreign
    Currency Translation

The Company’s international operations generally use their
    local currency as their functional currency. Assets and
    liabilities are translated at exchange rates in effect at the
    balance sheet date. Income and expense accounts are translated
    at the average monthly exchange rates during the year. Resulting
    translation adjustments are recorded as a separate component of
    “Accumulated other comprehensive income.”

Income
    Taxes

The Company computes income taxes using the asset and liability
    method, under which deferred income taxes are provided for the
    temporary differences between the financial statement carrying
    amounts and the tax basis of the Company’s assets and
    liabilities. The Company will establish a valuation allowance
    for deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that these
    items will either expire before the Company is able to realize
    their benefits, or that future deductibility is uncertain.
    Periodically, the valuation allowance is reviewed and adjusted
    based on management’s assessments of realizable deferred
    tax assets. The Company establishes, and periodically reviews
    and re-evaluates, an estimated contingent tax liability to
    provide for the possibility of unfavorable outcomes in tax
    matters in accordance with the requirements of
    SFAS No. 5, “Accounting for Contingencies”
    (“SFAS 5”). See the

Recent Accounting
    Pronouncements

at the end of this Note for a discussion of
    the new accounting and disclosure requirements for uncertain tax
    positions, which the Company will adopt in its first fiscal
    quarter of 2008.

Earnings
    per Share

The computation of basic earnings per share is based on the
    weighted average number of shares and common stock units that
    were outstanding during the period. The computation of diluted
    earnings per share includes the dilutive effect of common stock
    equivalents consisting of certain shares subject to stock
    options and RSUs.

Common
    Stock Share Repurchases

The Company may repurchase shares of its common stock under a
    program authorized by its Board of Directors including pursuant
    to a contract, instruction or written plan meeting the
    requirements of

Rule 10b5-1(c)(1)

of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. In accordance with the
    Washington Business Corporation Act, share repurchases are not
    displayed separately as treasury stock on the consolidated
    balance sheets or consolidated statements of shareholders’
    equity. Instead, the par value of repurchased shares is deducted
    from “Common stock” and the remaining excess
    repurchase price over par value is deducted from
    “Additional paid-in capital” and from “Retained
    earnings,” once additional paid-in capital is depleted. See
    Note 12 for additional information.

Recent
    Accounting Pronouncements

In June 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48,
    “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an
    interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109”
    (“FIN 48”), which seeks to reduce the diversity
    in practice associated with the accounting and reporting for
    uncertainty in income tax positions. This Interpretation
    prescribes a comprehensive model for the financial statement
    recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of
    uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in income
    tax returns. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning
    after December 15, 2006, and the Company will adopt the new
    requirements in its first fiscal quarter of 2008. The cumulative
    effect of adopting FIN 48 will be recorded as an adjustment
    to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of
    adoption. The Company expects that the effect of adopting
    FIN 48 will result in an immaterial adjustment to fiscal
    year 2008 opening retained earnings.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157,
    “Fair Value Measurements” (“SFAS 157”),
    which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring
    fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and
    expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS 157
    is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years
    beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods
    within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted.
    Starbucks must adopt these new requirements no later than its
    first fiscal quarter of 2009. Starbucks has not yet



determined the effect on the Company’s consolidated
    financial statements, if any, upon adoption of SFAS 157, or
    if it will adopt the requirements prior to the first fiscal
    quarter of 2009.

In September 2006, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting
    Bulletin No. 108, “Considering the Effects of
    Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in
    Current Year Financial Statements”
    (“SAB 108”). The intent of SAB 108 is to
    reduce diversity in practice for the method companies use to
    quantify financial statement misstatements, including the effect
    of prior year uncorrected errors. SAB 108 establishes an
    approach that requires quantification of financial statement
    errors using both an income statement and cumulative balance
    sheet approach. SAB 108 was effective for annual financial
    statements for fiscal years ending after November 15, 2006,
    and the Company adopted the new requirements in fiscal 2007 with
    no impact to its consolidated financial statements.

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159,
    “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
    Liabilities” (“SFAS 159”). SFAS 159
    permits companies to choose to measure many financial
    instruments and certain other items at fair value. SFAS 159
    is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years
    beginning after November 15, 2007, or Starbucks first
    fiscal quarter of 2009. Early adoption is permitted. Starbucks
    has not yet determined if it will elect to apply any of the
    provisions of SFAS 159 or what the effect of adoption of
    the statement would have, if any, on its consolidated financial
    statements.

Note 2:

Business
    Acquisitions

In the first quarter of fiscal 2007, the Company purchased a 90%
    stake in its previously-licensed operations in Beijing, China.
    Due to its majority ownership of these operations, Starbucks
    applied the consolidation method of accounting subsequent to the
    date of acquisition.

Gross unrealized holding losses of $21 thousand for greater than
    or equal to twelve months as of September 30, 2007,
    pertained to two fixed income securities, specifically state and
    local government obligations, and were primarily caused by
    interest rate increases subsequent to the date of purchase. The
    contractual terms of these securities do not permit the issuer
    to settle at a price less than the par value of the investment,
    which is the equivalent of the amount due at maturity. These
    securities had a minimum credit rating of “A+.” Since
    Starbucks has the ability and intent to hold these securities
    until a recovery of fair value, which may be at maturity, and
    because the unrealized losses were primarily due to higher
    interest rates subsequent to the date of purchase, the Company
    does not consider these securities to be other-than-temporarily
    impaired.

There were no realized losses recorded for other than temporary
    impairments during fiscal years 2007, 2006 or 2005.

Trading securities are comprised mainly of marketable equity
    mutual funds that approximate a portion of the Company’s
    liability under the Management Deferred Compensation Plan
    (“MDCP”), a defined contribution plan. The
    corresponding deferred compensation liability of
    $86.4 million in fiscal 2007 and $64.6 million in
    fiscal 2006 is included in “Accrued compensation and
    related costs” on the consolidated balance sheets. In
    fiscal years 2007 and 2006, the changes in net unrealized
    holding gains/losses in the trading portfolio included in
    earnings were a net gain of $7.5 million and a net loss of
    $4.2 million, respectively.

Long-term investments generally mature in less than two years.

Note 4:

Derivative
    Financial Instruments

The Company may engage in transactions involving various
    derivative instruments, with maturities generally not longer
    than five years, to hedge interest rates, commodity prices, and
    foreign currency denominated revenues, purchases, assets and
    liabilities.

Cash
    Flow Hedges

The Company and certain subsidiaries enter into cash flow
    derivative instruments to hedge portions of anticipated revenue
    streams and inventory purchases in currencies other than the
    entity’s functional currency. Outstanding forward
    contracts, which comprise the majority of the Company’s
    derivative instruments, hedge monthly forecasted revenue
    transactions denominated in Japanese yen and Canadian dollars,
    as well as forecasted inventory purchases denominated primarily
    in U.S. dollars for foreign operations. The Company also
    has futures contracts to hedge the variable price component for
    a small portion of its price-to-be-fixed green coffee purchase
    contracts.



In addition, the Company entered into, dedesignated and settled
    forward interest rate contracts during the fiscal fourth quarter
    of 2007 in conjunction with a new debt issuance. These contracts
    hedged movements in interest rates prior to issuance of the
    Company’s $550 million of 6.25% Senior Notes. See
    Note 9 for additional information on Senior Notes.

The Company had accumulated net derivative losses of
    $15.0 million, net of taxes, in other comprehensive income
    as of September 30, 2007, related to cash flow hedges. Of
    this amount, $6.6 million of net derivative losses pertain
    to hedging instruments that will be dedesignated within
    12 months and will also continue to experience fair value
    changes before affecting earnings. Ineffectiveness from hedges
    that were discontinued during the 52-week period ended
    September 30, 2007 was insignificant. No cash flow hedges
    were discontinued and no significant ineffectiveness was
    recognized during the 52-week periods ended October 1, 2006
    and October 2, 2005. Outstanding contracts will expire
    within 24 months.

Net
    Investment Hedges

Net investment derivative instruments are used to hedge the
    Company’s equity method investment in Starbucks Coffee
    Japan, Ltd. (“Starbucks Japan”) as well as the
    Company’s net investments in its Canadian, UK, and Chinese
    subsidiaries, to minimize foreign currency exposure. The Company
    had accumulated net derivative losses of $12.0 million, net
    of taxes, in other comprehensive income as of September 30,
    2007, related to net investment derivative hedges. Outstanding
    contracts expire within 30 months.

Starbucks entered into foreign currency forward contracts that
    are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting
    purposes to mitigate the translation risk of certain balance
    sheet items. For the 52-week period ended September 30,
    2007, these forward contracts resulted in net losses of
    $9.7 million. These losses were largely offset by the
    financial impact of translating foreign currency denominated
    payables and receivables, which are also recognized in “Net
    interest and other income.” No similar contracts were held
    as of October 1, 2006.

    fixed-price contracts and an estimated $49 million under
    price-to-be-fixed contracts. The Company believes, based on
    relationships established with its suppliers in the past, the
    risk of non-delivery on such purchase commitments is remote.

StarCon, LLC is a joint venture formed in March 2007 with
    Concord Music Group, Inc. that is engaged in the recorded music
    business. The International entities operate licensed Starbucks
    retail stores. The Company also has licensed the rights to
    produce and distribute Starbucks branded products to two
    partnerships in which the Company holds 50% equity interests.
    The North American Coffee Partnership with the Pepsi-Cola
    Company develops and



distributes bottled
    Frappuccino

®

beverages and Starbucks
    DoubleShot

®

espresso drinks. The Starbucks Ice Cream Partnership with
    Dreyer’s Grand Ice Cream, Inc. develops and distributes
    superpremium ice creams.

During fiscal 2004, Starbucks acquired an equity interest in its
    licensed operations of Malaysia. During fiscal 2003, Starbucks
    increased its ownership of its licensed operations in Austria,
    Shanghai, Spain, Switzerland and Taiwan. The carrying amount of
    these investments was $24.3 million more than the
    underlying equity in net assets due to acquired goodwill, which
    is evaluated for impairment annually. No impairment was recorded
    during fiscal years 2007, 2006 or 2005.

The Company’s share of income and losses is included in
    “Income from equity investees” on the consolidated
    statements of earnings. Also included is the Company’s
    proportionate share of gross margin resulting from coffee and
    other product sales to, and royalty and license fee revenues
    generated from, equity investees. Revenues generated from these
    related parties, net of eliminations, were $107.9 million,
    $94.2 million and $86.1 million in fiscal years 2007,
    2006 and 2005, respectively. Related costs of sales, net of
    eliminations, were $57.1 million, $47.5 million and
    $43.3 million in fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005,
    respectively. As of September 30, 2007 and October 1,
    2006, there were $30.6 million and $17.7 million of
    accounts receivable, respectively, on the consolidated balance
    sheets from equity investees primarily related to product sales
    and store license fees. As of September 30, 2007, there was
    $1.6 million of accounts payable on the consolidated
    balance sheet to equity investees related to product purchases.
    There was no accounts payable balance as of October 1, 2006.

As of September 30, 2007, the aggregate market value of the
    Company’s investment in Starbucks Japan was approximately
    $272 million, based on its available quoted market price.

Cost
    Method

The Company has equity interests in entities to develop
    Starbucks licensed retail stores in Hong Kong, Mexico, Cyprus,
    Greece, Romania and Russia. Additionally, Starbucks has
    investments in privately held equity securities unrelated to
    Starbucks licensed retail stores of $3 million at both
    September 30, 2007 and October 1, 2006. As of
    September 30, 2007, and October 1, 2006, management
    determined that the estimated fair values of each cost method
    investment exceeded the related carrying values. There were no
    realized losses recorded for other-than-temporary impairment of
    the Company’s cost method investments during fiscal years
    2007, 2006 or 2005.

Starbucks has the ability to acquire additional interests in
    some of these cost method investees at certain intervals.
    Depending on the Company’s total percentage of ownership
    interest and its ability to exercise significant influence over
    financial and operating policies, additional investments may
    require the retroactive application of the equity method of
    accounting.

Other
    Intangible Assets and Goodwill

As of September 30, 2007, indefinite-lived intangibles were
    $36.9 million and definite-lived intangibles, which
    collectively had a remaining weighted average useful life of
    approximately eight years, were $5.1 million, net of
    accumulated amortization of $4.3 million. As of
    October 1, 2006, indefinite-lived intangibles were
    $34.1 million and definite-lived intangibles, which
    collectively had a remaining weighted average useful life of
    approximately eight years, were $3.9 million, net of
    accumulated amortization of $3.4 million. The increase in
    indefinite-lived intangibles was primarily due to ongoing
    trademark activity. Amortization expense for definite-lived
    intangibles was $1.0 million, $1.2 million and
    $0.8 million during fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005,
    respectively.

The $1.7 million increase in goodwill was primarily due to
    a contingent payment for the Company’s fiscal 2006
    acquisition of its licensed operations in Hawaii.

International

During fiscal 2007, the International segment completed a
    majority stake acquisition of its licensed Beijing operations
    (See Note 2) and acquired an additional equity
    interest in its South China operations, which increased goodwill
    by $46.2 million and $5.1 million, respectively. The
    increase related to “Other” was due to foreign
    currency fluctuations.

Note 9:

Debt

Revolving
    Credit Facility and Commercial Paper Program

The Company has a $1 billion unsecured credit facility (the
    “facility”) with various banks, of which
    $100 million may be used for issuances of letters of
    credit. The facility is available for working capital, capital
    expenditures and other corporate purposes, which may include
    acquisitions and share repurchases. The facility is currently
    set to terminate in August 2011. The interest rate for
    borrowings under the facility ranges from 0.11% to 0.27% over
    LIBOR or an alternate base rate, which is the greater of the
    bank prime rate or the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.50%. The
    specific spread over LIBOR will depend upon the Company’s
    long-term credit ratings assigned by Moody’s and Standard
    and Poor’s rating agencies and the Company’s coverage
    ratio. The facility contains provisions requiring the Company to
    maintain compliance with certain covenants, including a minimum
    fixed charge coverage ratio which measures the Company’s
    ability to cover financing expenses. As of September 30,
    2007 and October 1, 2006, the Company was in compliance
    with each of these covenants.

As of September 30, 2007, the Company had no borrowings
    under this credit facility. As of October 1, 2006, the
    Company had $700 million outstanding under the facility
    with a weighted average interest rate of 5.5%.

In March 2007, the Company established a commercial paper
    program (the “program”). Under the program the Company
    may issue unsecured commercial paper notes, up to a maximum
    aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $1 billion,
    with individual maturities that may vary, but not exceed
    397 days from the date of issue. The program is backstopped
    by the Company’s revolving credit facility, and the
    combined borrowing limit is $1 billion for the program and
    the facility. The Company may issue commercial paper from time
    to time, and the proceeds of the commercial paper financing will
    be used for working capital, capital expenditures and other
    corporate purposes, which may include acquisitions and share
    repurchases.

As of September 30, 2007, the Company had $710 million
    in borrowings outstanding under the program with a weighted
    average interest rate of 5.4%.

As of September 30, 2007, the Company also had
    $12.9 million in letters of credit outstanding under the
    revolving credit facility, leaving a total of $275 million
    in remaining borrowing capacity under the combined revolving
    credit facility and commercial paper program. As of
    October 1, 2006, a letter of credit of $11.9 million
    was outstanding.

Long-term
    Debt

In August 2007, the Company issued $550 million of
    6.25% Senior Notes (the “notes”) due in August
    2017, in an underwritten registered public offering. Interest is
    payable semi-annually on February 15 and August 15 of each year,
    commencing February 15, 2008. The notes require the Company
    to maintain compliance with certain covenants, which limit
    future liens and sale and leaseback transactions on certain
    material properties. As of September 30, 2007, the Company
    was in compliance with each of these covenants. The notes were
    priced at a discount, resulting in proceeds to the Company of
    $549 million, before expenses.

In 1999, Starbucks purchased the land and building comprising
    its York County, Pennsylvania roasting plant and distribution
    facility and assumed certain related loans from the York County
    Industrial Development Corporation. As of September 30,
    2007, $2.0 million remained outstanding on these loans. The
    remaining maturities of these loans range from three to four
    years, with interest rates from 0.0% to 2.0%.

    amortizes deferred rent over the terms of the leases as
    reductions to rent expense on the consolidated statements of
    earnings.

Asset retirement obligations represent the estimated fair value
    of the Company’s future costs of removing leasehold
    improvements at the termination of leases for certain stores and
    administrative facilities.

Minority interest represents the collective ownership interests
    of minority shareholders for operations accounted for under the
    consolidation method, in which Starbucks owns less than 100% of
    the equity interest.

The other remaining long-term liabilities generally include
    obligations to be settled or paid for one year beyond each

Note 12:

Shareholders’
    Equity

In addition to 1.2 billion shares of authorized common
    stock with $0.001 par value per share, the Company has
    authorized 7.5 million shares of preferred stock, none of
    which was outstanding at September 30, 2007.

Under the Company’s authorized share repurchase program,
    Starbucks acquired 33.0 million shares at an average price
    of $30.72 for a total accrual-based cost of $1.0 billion in
    fiscal 2007. The related cash amount used to repurchase shares
    in fiscal 2007 totaled $997 million. The difference between
    the two amounts represents the effect of the net change in
    unsettled trades totaling $16 million from October 1,
    2006. Starbucks acquired 25.6 million shares at an average
    price of $32.34 for a total accrual-based cost of
    $828 million during fiscal 2006. The related cash amount
    used to repurchase shares in fiscal 2006 totaled
    $854 million. The difference between the two amounts
    represents the effect of the net change in unsettled trades
    totaling $26 million from October 2, 2005. Share
    repurchases were funded through cash, cash equivalents,
    available-for-sale securities, borrowings under the revolving
    credit facility and commercial paper program and proceeds from
    sale of the notes, and were part of the Company’s active
    capital management program. On May 1, 2007, the Starbucks
    Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to
    25 million additional shares of the Company’s common
    stock. As of September 30, 2007, a total of up to
    13.5 million shares remained available for repurchase,
    under the current authorization.

Comprehensive
    Income

Comprehensive income includes all changes in equity during the
    period, except those resulting from transactions with
    shareholders and subsidiaries of the Company. It has two
    components: net earnings and other comprehensive income.
    Accumulated other comprehensive income reported on the
    Company’s consolidated balance sheets consists of foreign
    currency translation adjustments and the unrealized gains and
    losses, net of applicable taxes, on available-for-sale
    securities and on derivative instruments designated and
    qualifying as cash flow and net investment hedges.

Note 13:

Employee
    Stock and Benefit Plans

The Company maintains several equity incentive plans under which
    it may grant non-qualified stock options, incentive stock
    options, restricted stock, RSUs, or stock appreciation rights to
    employees, non-employee directors and consultants. The Company
    issues new shares of common stock upon exercise of stock options
    and the vesting of RSUs. As of September 30, 2007, there
    were 59.1 million shares of common stock available for
    issuance pursuant to future equity-based compensation awards.



The Company also has employee stock purchase plans
    (“ESPP”).

Stock
    Option Plans

Stock options to purchase the Company’s common stock are
    granted at the fair market value of the stock on the date of
    grant. The majority of options become exercisable in four equal
    installments beginning a year from the date of grant and
    generally expire 10 years from the date of grant. Certain
    options granted prior to October 1, 2006 become exercisable
    in three equal installments beginning a year from the date of
    grant. Options granted to non-employee directors generally vest
    over one to three years. Nearly all outstanding stock options
    are non-qualified stock options.

Prior to the October 3, 2005 adoption of the
    SFAS 123R, Starbucks accounted for stock-based compensation
    using the intrinsic value method prescribed in Accounting
    Principles Board (“APB”) Opinion No. 25,
    “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,” and
    related interpretations. Accordingly, because the stock option
    grant price equaled the market price on the date of grant, and
    any purchase discounts under the Company’s stock purchase
    plans were within statutory limits, no compensation expense was
    recognized by the Company for stock-based compensation. As
    permitted by SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for
    Stock-Based Compensation” (“SFAS 123”),
    stock-based compensation was included as a pro forma disclosure
    in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.

Effective October 3, 2005, the beginning of Starbucks first
    fiscal quarter of 2006, the Company adopted the fair value
    recognition provisions of SFAS 123R, using the
    modified-prospective transition method. Under this transition
    method, stock-based compensation expense was recognized in the
    consolidated financial statements for granted, modified, or
    settled stock options and RSUs and for expense related to the
    ESPP, since the related purchase discounts exceeded the amount
    allowed under SFAS 123R for non-compensatory treatment.
    Compensation expense recognized included the estimated expense
    for stock options granted on and subsequent to October 3,
    2005, based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance
    with the provisions of SFAS 123R, and the estimated expense
    for the portion vesting in the period for options granted prior
    to, but not vested as of October 3, 2005, based on the
    grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original
    provisions of SFAS 123. Results for prior periods were not
    restated, as provided for under the modified-prospective method.

The following table shows the effect on net earnings and
    earnings per share had compensation cost been recognized based
    upon the estimated fair value on the grant date of stock
    options, and ESPP, in accordance with SFAS 123, as amended
    by SFAS No. 148 “Accounting for Stock-Based
    Compensation — Transition and Disclosure” (

Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R, Starbucks presented all
    tax benefits resulting from the exercise of stock options as
    operating cash inflows on the consolidated statements of cash
    flows, in accordance with the provisions of the Emerging Issues
    Task Force (“EITF”) Issue No

00-15,

“Classification in the Statement of Cash Flows of the
    Income Tax Benefit Received by a Company upon Exercise of a
    Nonqualified Employee Stock Option.” SFAS 123R
    requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of the tax
    effect of the compensation cost recognized for those options to
    be classified as financing cash inflows rather than operating
    cash inflows, on a prospective basis. This amount is shown as
    “Excess tax benefit from exercise of stock options” on
    the consolidated statements of cash flows.

For option grants made in November 2003 and thereafter, the
    Company may provide for immediate vesting upon retirement for
    optionees who have attained at least 10 years of service
    and are age 55 or older. Prior to adoption of
    SFAS 123R, the Company amortized the expense over the
    related vesting period with acceleration of expense upon
    retirement. With the adoption of SFAS 123R, the accounting
    treatment for retirement features changed. Expense for awards
    made prior to adoption of SFAS 123R is still amortized over
    the vesting period until retirement, at which point any
    remaining unrecognized expense is immediately recognized. For
    awards made on or after October 3, 2005, the related
    expense is recognized either from grant date through the date
    the employee reaches the years of service and age requirements,
    or from grant date through the stated vesting period, whichever
    is shorter.

The fair value of each stock option granted is estimated on the
    grant date using the Black-Scholes-Merton (“BSM”)
    option valuation model. The assumptions used to calculate the
    fair value of options granted are evaluated and revised, as
    necessary, to reflect market conditions and the Company’s
    experience. Options granted are valued using the multiple option
    valuation approach, and the resulting expense is recognized
    using the graded, or accelerated, attribution method, consistent
    with the multiple option valuation approach. Compensation
    expense is recognized only for those options expected to vest,
    with forfeitures estimated at the date of grant based on the
    Company’s historical experience and future expectations.
    Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R, the effect of
    forfeitures on the pro forma expense amounts was recognized as
    the forfeitures occurred.

The expected term of the options represents the estimated period
    of time until exercise and is based on historical experience of
    similar awards, giving consideration to the contractual terms,
    vesting schedules and expectations of future employee behavior.
    For fiscal years 2007 and 2006, expected stock price volatility
    is based on a combination of historical volatility of the
    Company’s stock and the one-year implied volatility of its
    traded options, for the related vesting periods. Prior to the
    adoption of SFAS 123R, expected stock price volatility was
    estimated using only historical volatility. The risk-free
    interest rate is based on the implied yield available on
    U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with an equivalent
    remaining term. The Company has not paid dividends in the past
    and does not plan to pay any dividends in the near future.

The BSM option valuation model was developed for use in
    estimating the fair value of traded options, which have no
    vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. In addition,
    option valuation models require the input of subjective
    assumptions, particularly for the expected term and expected
    stock price volatility. The Company’s employee stock
    options have characteristics significantly different from those
    of traded options, and changes in the subjective input
    assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate.
    Because Company stock options do not trade on a secondary
    exchange, employees do not derive a benefit from holding stock
    options unless there is an increase, above the grant price, in
    the market price of the Company’s stock. Such an increase
    in stock price would benefit all shareholders commensurately.

The aggregate intrinsic value in the table above is the amount
    by which the market value of the underlying stock exceeded the
    exercise price of outstanding options, is before applicable
    income taxes and represents the amount optionees would have
    realized if all in-the-money options had been exercised on the
    last business day of the period indicated. As of
    September 30, 2007, total unrecognized stock-based
    compensation expense related to nonvested stock options was
    approximately $103 million, before income taxes, and is
    expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of
    approximately 24 months. The total intrinsic value of stock
    options exercised was $274 million and $327 million
    during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2007 and
    October 1, 2006 respectively. The total fair value of
    options vested was $28 million and $95 million during
    fiscal years 2007 and 2006, respectively.



Restricted
    Stock Units

In fiscal 2007 the Company granted service-based RSUs to certain
    of its senior executives. The fair values of the RSUs are based
    on the fair value of common stock. RSUs entitle the grantee to
    receive shares of common stock at the end of a vesting period,
    subject to the executive’s continuing employment. As of
    September 30, 2007, there were 0.2 million RSUs
    outstanding and total unrecognized stock-based compensation
    expense related to nonvested RSUs of approximately
    $5 million, before income taxes, which is expected to be
    recognized over a weighted average period of approximately
    36 months.

Employee
    Stock Purchase Plans

The Company has an ESPP allowing eligible employees to
    contribute up to 10% of their base earnings toward the quarterly
    purchase of the Company’s common stock. The employees’
    purchase price is 85% of the lesser of the fair market value of
    the stock on the first business day or the last business day of
    the quarterly offering period. Employees may purchase shares
    having a fair market value of up to $25,000 (measured as of the
    first day of each quarterly offering period for each calendar
    year). The total number of shares issuable under the plan is
    32.0 million. There were 1.9 million shares issued
    under the plan during the fiscal year ended September 30,
    2007 at an average price of $24.59. There were 1.5 million
    shares issued under the plan during the fiscal year ended
    October 1, 2006 at an average price of $26.81. There were
    1.5 million shares issued under the plan during the fiscal
    year ended October 2, 2005 at an average price of $21.27.
    Since inception of the plan, 18.2 million shares have been
    purchased, leaving 13.8 million shares available for future
    issuance.

Starbucks had an additional employee stock purchase plan in the
    United Kingdom (“SAYE” plan) that allowed eligible UK
    employees to save toward the purchase of the Company’s
    common stock. The final offering under the plan was made in
    fiscal 2003 and final purchase in fiscal 2006. In fiscal 2004,
    the UK Share Incentive Plan was introduced to replace the SAYE
    plan. This plan allows eligible UK employees to purchase shares
    of common stock through payroll deductions during six-month
    offering periods at the lesser of the fair market value of the
    stock at the beginning or at the end of the offering period. The
    Company will award one matching share for each six shares
    purchased under the plan. The total number of shares issuable
    under the plan is 1.4 million. There were
    13,814 shares issued under the plan during the fiscal year
    ended September 30, 2007 at an average price of $33.56.
    There were 11,138 shares issued under the plan during the
    fiscal year ended October 1, 2006 at an average price of
    $26.42. There were 10,732 shares issued under the plan
    during the fiscal year ended October 2, 2005 at an average
    price of $22.08. As of September 30, 2007,
    1.36 million shares were available for future issuance.

Deferred
    Stock Plan

Starbucks has a deferred stock plan for certain key employees
    that enables participants in the plan to defer receipt of
    ownership of common shares from the exercise of nonqualified
    stock options. The minimum deferral period is five years. As of
    September 30, 2007, receipt of 3.4 million shares was
    deferred under the terms of this plan. The rights to receive
    these shares, represented by common stock units, are included in
    the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share as
    common stock equivalents. No new initial deferrals are permitted
    under this plan; the plan permits re-deferrals of previously
    deferred shares.

Defined
    Contribution Plans

Starbucks maintains voluntary defined contribution plans, both
    qualified and non-qualified, covering eligible employees as
    defined in the plan documents. Participating employees may elect
    to defer and contribute a portion of their compensation to the
    plans up to limits stated in the plan documents, not to exceed
    the dollar amounts set by applicable laws. For employees in the
    United States, the Company matched 25% to 150% of each
    employee’s eligible contribution based on years of service,
    up to a maximum of the first 4% of each employee’s
    compensation. The Company’s matching contributions to all
    U.S. and

non-U.S. plans

were approximately $20.1 million, $19.3 million and
    $12.4 million in fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005,
    respectively.

U.S. income and foreign withholding taxes have not been
    provided on approximately $284.2 million of cumulative
    undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries and equity
    investees. The Company intends to reinvest these earnings for
    the foreseeable future. If these amounts were distributed to the
    United States, in the form of dividends or otherwise, the
    Company would be subject to additional U.S. income taxes.
    Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred income tax
    liabilities on these earnings is not practicable because such
    liability, if any, is dependent on circumstances existing if and
    when remittance occurs.

The Company will establish a valuation allowance if it is more
    likely than not that these items will either expire before the
    Company is able to realize their benefits, or that future
    deductibility is uncertain. Periodically, the valuation
    allowance is reviewed and adjusted based on management’s
    assessments of realizable deferred tax assets. The valuation
    allowance as of September 30, 2007 and October 1, 2006
    was related to net operating losses of



consolidated foreign subsidiaries. The net change in the total
    valuation allowance for the years ended September 30, 2007,
    and October 1, 2006, was an increase of $4.9 million
    and $0.7 million, respectively.

As of September 30, 2007, the Company has foreign tax
    credit carryforwards of $11.1 million with expiration dates
    between fiscal years 2012 and 2014. As of the end of fiscal
    2007, the Company also has capital loss carryforwards of
    $0.7 million, expiring in fiscal year 2010.

Taxes currently payable of $38.5 million and
    $50.6 million are included in “Accrued taxes” on
    the consolidated balance sheets as of September 30, 2007
    and October 1, 2006, respectively.

The Company has established, and periodically reviews and
    re-evaluates, estimated contingent tax liabilities to provide
    for the possibility of unfavorable outcomes in tax matters.
    Contingent tax liabilities totaled $25.9 million and
    $27.6 million as of September 30, 2007 and
    October 1, 2006, respectively, and are included in
    “Accrued taxes” on the consolidated balance sheets.
    These liabilities are provided for in accordance with the
    requirements of SFAS 5. The Company believes its contingent
    tax liabilities are adequate in the event the tax positions are
    not ultimately upheld.

The Company will adopt FIN 48 in its first fiscal quarter
    of 2008. See Note 1 for additional information.

Related
    Party Transactions

In April 2001, certain members of the Board of Directors and
    other investors, organized as The Basketball Club of Seattle,
    LLC (“The Basketball Club”), purchased the franchises
    for The Seattle Supersonics and The Seattle Storm basketball
    teams. An executive officer of the Company and member of the
    Board of Directors, Howard Schultz, owned a controlling interest
    in The Basketball Club, until the franchises were sold to an
    unrelated third party in October 2006. Starbucks paid no amounts
    in fiscal 2007 and approximately $0.6 million and
    $0.8 million during fiscal years 2006 and 2005,
    respectively, for team sponsorships and ticket purchases during
    the time when Mr. Schultz owned a controlling interest in
    The Basketball Club. Terms of the team sponsorship agreements
    did not change as a result of the related party relationship.

In June 2005, a then-member of the Company’s Board of
    Directors was appointed president and chief financial officer of
    Oracle Corporation. Starbucks had a pre-existing business
    relationship with Oracle related to financial systems and
    systems consulting at the time of the appointment and Starbucks
    continued to make payments for supplies and services subsequent
    to June 2005 in the ordinary course of business. These payments
    totaled



approximately $2.7 million from the inception of the
    related party relationship in fiscal 2005 through
    November 15, 2005 when the former Board member’s
    employment relationship with Oracle ended.

Note 17:

Commitments
    and Contingencies

Guarantees

The Company has unconditionally guaranteed the repayment of
    certain Japanese yen-denominated bank loans and related interest
    and fees of an unconsolidated equity investee, Starbucks Japan.
    The guarantees continue until the loans, including accrued
    interest and fees, have been paid in full, with the final loan
    amount due in 2014. The maximum amount is limited to the sum of
    unpaid principal and interest amounts, as well as other related
    expenses. These amounts will vary based on fluctuations in the
    yen foreign exchange rate. As of September 30, 2007, the
    maximum amount of the guarantees was approximately
    $4.9 million. Since there has been no modification of these
    loan guarantees subsequent to the Company’s adoption of
    FASB Interpretation No. 45, “Guarantor’s
    Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including
    Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others,” Starbucks
    has applied the disclosure provisions only and has not recorded
    the guarantee on its consolidated balance sheet.

Starbucks has commitments under which it unconditionally
    guarantees its proportionate share of certain borrowings of
    unconsolidated equity investees. The Company’s maximum
    exposure under these commitments is approximately
    $12.9 million, excluding interest and other related costs,
    and these commitments expire between 2008 and 2012. As of
    September 30, 2007, the Company had a total of
    $3.1 million in “Equity and other investments”
    and “Other long-term liabilities” on the consolidated
    balance sheet for the fair value of the guarantee arrangements.

Legal
    Proceedings

On June 3, 2004, two then-current employees of the Company
    filed a lawsuit, entitled

Sean Pendlebury and Laurel
    Overton v. Starbucks Coffee Company,

in the
    U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida
    claiming the Company violated requirements of the Fair Labor
    Standards Act (“FLSA”). The suit alleges that the
    Company misclassified its retail store managers as exempt from
    the overtime provisions of the FLSA, and that each manager
    therefore is entitled to overtime compensation for any week in
    which he or she worked more than 40 hours during the three
    years before joining the suit as a plaintiff, and for as long as
    they remain a manager thereafter. Plaintiffs seek to represent
    themselves and all similarly situated U.S. current and
    former store managers of the Company. Plaintiffs seek
    reimbursement for an unspecified amount of unpaid overtime
    compensation, liquidated damages, attorneys’ fees and
    costs. Plaintiffs also filed on June 3, 2004 a motion for
    conditional collective action treatment and court-supervised
    notice to additional putative class members under the opt-in
    procedures in section 16(b) of the FLSA. On January 3,
    2005, the district court entered an order authorizing nationwide
    notice of the lawsuit to all current and former store managers
    employed by the Company during the three years before the suit
    was filed. The Company’s motion for summary judgment is
    pending before the court. Starbucks believes that the plaintiffs
    are properly classified as exempt under the federal wage laws.
    The Company cannot estimate the possible loss to the Company, if
    any, and believes that a loss in this case is unlikely. There is
    currently no trial date. The Company intends to vigorously
    defend the lawsuit.

On October 8, 2004, a former hourly employee of the Company
    filed a lawsuit in San Diego County Superior Court entitled

Jou Chau v. Starbucks Coffee Company

. The lawsuit
    alleges that the Company violated the California Labor Code by
    allowing shift supervisors to receive tips. More specifically,
    the lawsuit alleges that since shift supervisors direct the work
    of baristas, they qualify as “agents” of the Company
    and are therefore excluded from receiving tips under California
    Labor Code Section 351, which prohibits employers and their
    agents from collecting or receiving tips left by patrons for
    other employees. The lawsuit further alleges that because the
    tipping practices violate the Labor Code, they also are unfair
    practices under the California Unfair Competition Law. In
    addition to recovery of an unspecified amount of tips
    distributed to shift supervisors, the lawsuit seeks penalties
    under California Labor Code Section 203 for willful failure
    to pay wages due. Plaintiff also seeks attorneys’ fees and
    costs. On March 30, 2006, the Court issued an order
    certifying the case as a class action, with the plaintiff
    representing a class of all persons employed as baristas in the
    state of California since October 8, 2000. In March 2007,
    notice of action was sent to approximately 120,000 potential
    members of the class. The Company cannot estimate the possible
    loss to the



Company, if any. Trial is currently set for February 2008. The
    Company believes its practices comply with California law, and
    the Company intends to vigorously defend the lawsuit.

On March 11, 2005, a former employee of the Company filed a
    lawsuit, entitled

James Falcon v. Starbucks Corporation
    and Does 1 through 100

, in the U.S. District Court for
    the Southern District of Texas claiming that the Company
    violated requirements of the FLSA. Specifically, the plaintiff
    claims that the Company misclassified its retail assistant store
    managers as exempt from the overtime provisions of the FLSA and
    that each assistant manager therefore is entitled to overtime
    compensation for any week in which he or she worked more than
    40 hours during the three years before joining the suit as
    a plaintiff, and for as long as they remain an assistant manager
    thereafter. On August 18, 2005, the plaintiff amended his
    complaint to include allegations that he and other retail
    assistant store managers were not paid overtime compensation for
    all hours worked in excess of 40 hours in a work week after
    they were re-classified as non-exempt employees in September
    2002. In both claims, Plaintiff seeks to represent himself and a
    putative class of all current and former assistant store
    managers employed by the Company in the United States from
    March 11, 2002 until the present. He also seeks, on behalf
    of himself and the class, reimbursement for an unspecified
    amount of unpaid overtime compensation, liquidated damages,
    injunctive relief, and attorneys’ fees and costs. On
    September 13, 2005, the plaintiff filed a motion for
    conditional collective action treatment and court-supervised
    notice to all putative class members under the opt-in procedures
    in section 16(b) of the FLSA. On November 29, 2005,
    the court entered an order authorizing notice to the class of
    the existence of the lawsuit and their opportunity to join as
    plaintiffs. The Company has a policy requiring that all
    non-exempt partners, including assistant store managers, be paid
    for all hours worked, including any hours worked in excess of 40
    per week. The Company also believes that this policy is, and at
    all relevant times has been, communicated and followed
    consistently. Further, the Company believes that the plaintiff
    and other assistant store managers were properly classified as
    exempt under the FLSA prior to September 2002. The Company
    cannot estimate the possible loss to the Company, if any, and
    believes that a loss in this case is unlikely. Trial is
    currently set for February 2008. The Company intends to
    vigorously defend the lawsuit.

On June 30, 2005, three individuals, Erik Lords, Hon Yeung,
    and Donald Brown filed a lawsuit in Orange County Superior
    Court, California. The lawsuit alleges that the Company violated
    the California Labor Code section 432.8 by asking job
    applicants to disclose at the time of application convictions
    for marijuana related offenses more than two years old.
    Plaintiffs also seek attorneys’ fees and costs. On
    November 1, 2007, the Court issued an order certifying the
    case as a class action, with the plaintiffs representing a class
    of all persons who have applied for employment with Starbucks
    Coffee Company in California since June 23, 2004 who cannot
    claim damages in excess of $200. The Company cannot estimate the
    possible loss to the Company, if any. No trial date has been
    set. The Company believes its employment application complies
    with California law, and the Company intends to vigorously
    defend the lawsuit.

The Company is party to various other legal proceedings arising
    in the ordinary course of its business, but it is not currently
    a party to any legal proceeding that management believes would
    have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial
    position or results of operations of the Company.

Note 18:

Segment
    Reporting

Segment information is prepared on the same basis that the
    Company’s management reviews financial information for
    operational decision making purposes. Starbucks has three
    reportable operating segments: United States, International and
    CPG.

United
    States

The Company’s United States operations represent 82% of
    total Company-operated retail revenues, 56% of total specialty
    revenues and 78% of total net revenues for fiscal year 2007.
    United States operations sell coffee and other beverages,
    complementary food, whole bean coffees, and coffee brewing
    equipment and merchandise primarily through Company-operated
    retail stores. Specialty Operations within the United States
    include licensed retail stores, foodservice accounts and other
    initiatives related to the Company’s core business.



International

The Company’s International operations represent the
    remaining 18% of Company-operated retail revenues and 18% of
    total specialty revenues as well as 18% of total net revenues
    for fiscal year 2007. International operations sell coffee and
    other beverages, complementary food, whole bean coffees, and
    coffee brewing equipment and merchandise through
    Company-operated retail stores in the UK, Canada and eight other
    markets. Specialty Operations in International primarily include
    retail store licensing operations in more than 30 countries and
    foodservice accounts, primarily in Canada and the UK. Many of
    the Company’s International operations are in early stages
    of development that require a more extensive support
    organization, relative to the current levels of revenue and
    operating income, than in the United States.

Global
    Consumer Products Group

The Company’s CPG segment represents 26% of total specialty
    revenues and 4% of total net revenues for fiscal year 2007. CPG
    operations sell a selection of whole bean and ground coffees as
    well as a selection of premium
    Tazo

®

teas through licensing arrangements in United States and
    international markets. CPG operations also produce and sell
    ready-to-drink beverages which include, among others, bottled
    Frappuccino

®

beverages, Starbucks
    DoubleShot

®

espresso drinks, and
    Discoveries

®

chilled cup coffee, as well as
    Starbucks

®

superpremium ice creams and
    Starbucks

tm

Coffee and Cream Liqueurs, through its joint ventures and
    marketing and distribution agreements.

Unallocated Corporate includes expenses pertaining to corporate
    administrative functions that support the operating segments but
    are not specifically attributable to or managed by any segment
    and are not included in the reported financial results of the
    operating segments. These unallocated corporate expenses include
    certain general and administrative expenses, related
    depreciation and amortization expenses and amounts included in
    “Net interest and other income” on the consolidated
    statements of earnings.

Management evaluates the performance of its operating segments
    based on net revenues and operating income. The accounting
    policies of the operating segments are the same as those
    described in the summary of significant accounting policies in
    Note 1. Operating income represents earnings before
    “Net interest and other income” and “Income
    taxes.” Allocations of portions of corporate overhead,
    interest or income taxes to the segments are not significant.
    Identifiable assets by segment are those assets used in the
    Company’s operations in each segment. Unallocated corporate
    assets include cash and investments, unallocated assets of the
    corporate headquarters and roasting facilities, deferred taxes
    and certain other intangibles.

AUDITORS’
    REPORT ON CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING
    FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Starbucks
    Corporation

Seattle, Washington

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    Starbucks Corporation and subsidiaries (the “Company”)
    as of September 30, 2007 and October 1, 2006, and the
    related consolidated statements of earnings, shareholders’
    equity, and cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the
    period ended September 30, 2007. These financial statements
    are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
    responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
    statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present
    fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
    Starbucks Corporation and subsidiaries as of September 30,
    2007 and October 1, 2006, and the results of their
    operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
    the period ended September 30, 2007, in conformity with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
    America.

As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial
    statements, on October 1, 2006, the Company changed its
    method of accounting for conditional asset retirement
    obligations upon adoption of Financial Accounting Standards
    Board Interpretation No. 47, “Accounting for
    Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations - an interpretation of
    FASB Statement No. 143”. As discussed in Note 13,
    on October 3, 2005, the Company changed its method of
    accounting for stock-based compensation upon adoption of
    Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123(R),
    “Share-Based Payment”.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
    September 30, 2007, based on criteria established in
    Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
    and our report dated November 29, 2007 expressed an
    unqualified opinion on the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting.

Controls
    and Procedures

Disclosure
    Controls and Procedures

The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures that
    are designed to ensure that material information required to be
    disclosed in the Company’s periodic reports filed or
    submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended
    (the “Exchange Act”), is recorded, processed,
    summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
    SEC’s rules and forms. Starbucks disclosure controls and
    procedures are also designed to ensure that information required
    to be disclosed in the reports the Company files or submits
    under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the
    Company’s management, including its principal executive
    officer and principal financial officer as appropriate, to allow
    timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

During the quarter the Company carried out an evaluation, under
    the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s
    management, including the chief executive officer and the chief
    financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and
    operation of the disclosure controls and procedures, as defined
    in

Rules 13a-15(e)

and

15d-15(e)

under the Exchange Act. Based upon that evaluation, the
    Company’s chief executive officer and chief financial
    officer concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls
    and procedures were effective, as of the end of the period
    covered by this report (September 30, 2007).

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, there were no changes
    in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting
    (as defined in

Rules 13a-15(f)

and

15d-15(f)

of
    the Exchange Act) that materially affected or are reasonably
    likely to materially affect internal control over financial
    reporting.

The certifications required by Section 302 of the
    Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 are filed as exhibits 31.1 and
    31.2, respectively, to this

Form 10-K.

Report of
    Management on Internal Control over Financial
    Reporting

The management of Starbucks is responsible for establishing and
    maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.
    Internal control over financial reporting is a process to
    provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our
    financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
    America. Internal control over financial reporting includes
    maintaining records that in reasonable detail accurately and
    fairly reflect our transactions; providing reasonable assurance
    that transactions are recorded as necessary for preparation of
    our financial statements; providing reasonable assurance that
    receipts and expenditures are made in accordance with management
    authorization; and providing reasonable assurance that
    unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of company assets
    that could have a material effect on our financial statements
    would be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Because of its
    inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting
    is not intended to provide absolute assurance that a
    misstatement of our financial statements would be prevented or
    detected.

Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our
    internal control over financial reporting based on the framework
    and criteria established in

Internal Control —
    Integrated Framework

, issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission. This evaluation
    included review of the documentation of controls, evaluation of
    the design effectiveness of controls, testing of the operating
    effectiveness of controls and a conclusion on this evaluation.
    Based on this evaluation, management concluded that the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting was
    effective as of September 30, 2007.



Auditors’
    Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Report of
    Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Starbucks
    Corporation

Seattle, Washington

We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of
    Starbucks Corporation and subsidiaries (the “Company”)
    as of September 30, 2007, based on criteria established in
    Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission. The Company’s management is responsible for
    maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting
    and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control
    over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Report of
    Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our
    responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s
    internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
    that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the
    design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
    the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we
    considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
    audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed by, or under the supervision of, the
    company’s principal executive and principal financial
    officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected
    by the company’s board of directors, management, and other
    personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over
    financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or
    improper management override of controls, material misstatements
    due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a
    timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the
    effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting
    to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may
    become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the
    degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
    deteriorate.

In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material
    respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as
    of September 30, 2007, based on the criteria established in
    Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated financial statements as of and for the fiscal year
    ended September 30, 2007, of the Company and our report
    dated November 29, 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion on
    those financial statements.
