PART I

Item 1.

Business

Starbucks Corporation, which was formed in 1985
as a Washington corporation, (together with its subsidiaries,
“Starbucks” or the “Company”) purchases and
roasts high-quality whole bean coffees and sells them, along
with fresh, rich-brewed coffees, Italian-style espresso
beverages, cold blended beverages, a variety of complementary
food items, coffee-related accessories and equipment, a
selection of premium teas and a line of compact discs, primarily
through Company-operated retail stores. Starbucks sells coffee
and tea products through other channels, and, through certain of
its equity investees, Starbucks also produces and sells bottled
Frappuccino® and Starbucks DoubleShot

TM

coffee
drinks and a line of premium ice creams. These non-retail
channels are collectively known as “Specialty
Operations.” The Company’s objective is to establish
Starbucks as the most recognized and respected brand in the
world. To achieve this goal, the Company plans to continue rapid
expansion of its retail operations, to grow its Specialty
Operations and to selectively pursue other opportunities to
leverage the Starbucks brand through the introduction of new
products and the development of new channels of distribution.

The Company has two operating segments, United
States and International, each of which include Company-operated
retail stores and Specialty Operations.

Company-operated Retail Stores

The Company’s retail goal is to become the
leading retailer and brand of coffee in each of its target
markets by selling the finest quality coffee and related
products and by providing superior customer service, thereby
building a high degree of customer loyalty. Starbucks strategy
for expanding its retail business is to increase its market
share in existing markets primarily by opening additional stores
and to open stores in new markets where the opportunity exists
to become the leading specialty coffee retailer. In support of
this strategy, Starbucks opened 602 new Company-operated stores
during the fiscal year ended September 28, 2003
(“fiscal 2003”). In July 2003, through its acquisition
of Seattle Coffee Company (“SCC”) from
AFC Enterprises, Inc., Starbucks acquired
70 Company-operated Seattle’s Best Coffee
(“SBC”) and Torrefazione Italia (“TI”)
stores. At fiscal year end, Starbucks had
3,779 Company-operated stores in the United States,
373 in the United Kingdom, 316 in Canada, 40 in
Australia and 38 in Thailand. Company-operated retail
stores accounted for approximately 85% of total net revenues
during fiscal 2003.



Starbucks retail stores are typically located in
high-traffic, high-visibility locations. Because the Company can
vary the size and format, its stores are located in a variety of
settings, including downtown and suburban retail centers, office
buildings and university campuses. While the Company selectively
locates stores in suburban malls, it focuses on stores that have
convenient access for pedestrians and drivers.

All Starbucks stores offer a choice of regular
and decaffeinated coffee beverages, a broad selection of
Italian-style espresso beverages, cold blended beverages, iced
shaken refreshment beverages and a selection of teas and
distinctively packaged roasted whole bean coffees. Starbucks
stores also offer a selection of fresh pastries and other food
items, sodas, juices, coffee-making equipment and accessories, a
selection of compact discs, games and seasonal novelty items.
Each Starbucks store varies its product mix depending upon the
size of the store and its location. Larger stores carry a broad
selection of the Company’s whole bean coffees in various
sizes and types of packaging, as well as an assortment of coffee
and espresso-making equipment and accessories such as coffee
grinders, coffeemakers, coffee filters, storage containers,
travel tumblers and mugs. Smaller Starbucks stores and kiosks
typically sell a full line of coffee beverages, a limited
selection of whole bean coffees and a few accessories such as
travel tumblers and logo mugs. Approximately 1,200 stores carry
a selection of “grab and go” sandwiches and salads.
During fiscal 2003, the Company’s retail sales mix by
product type was comprised of approximately 78% beverages, 12%
food items, 5% whole bean coffees and 5% coffee-making equipment
and accessories.

Specialty Operations

Starbucks Specialty Operations strive to develop
the Starbucks brand outside the Company-operated retail store
environment through a number of channels. Starbucks strategy is
to reach customers where they work, travel, shop and dine by
establishing relationships with prominent third parties that
share the Company’s values and commitment to quality. These
relationships take various forms including licensing
arrangements, foodservice accounts and other initiatives related
to the Company’s core businesses. In certain situations,
Starbucks has an equity ownership interest in licensee
operations. During fiscal 2003, specialty revenues (which
include royalties and fees from licensees as well as product
sales derived from Specialty Operations) accounted for
approximately 15% of total net revenues.

Licensing

Although the Company does not generally
relinquish operational control of its retail stores in the
United States, in situations in which a master concessionaire or
another company controls or can provide improved access to
desirable retail space, the Company licenses its operations. As
part of these arrangements, Starbucks receives license fees and
royalties and sells coffee and related products for resale in
licensed locations. Employees working in licensed locations must
follow Starbucks detailed store operating procedures and attend
training classes similar to those given to Starbucks
Company-operated store managers and employees.

During fiscal 2003, Starbucks opened
315 licensed retail stores in the United States. In
addition, Starbucks obtained 76 franchised SBC retail
stores through the acquisition of SCC in July 2003. As of
September 28, 2003, the Company had 1,422 licensed or
franchised stores in the United States. Product sales to and
royalty and license fees from these stores accounted for
approximately 22% of specialty revenues in fiscal 2003.

The Company’s international licensed retail
stores are operated through a number of licensing arrangements
with prominent retailers. During fiscal 2003, Starbucks expanded
its international presence by opening 284 new international
licensed stores, including the first stores in Chile, Peru and
Turkey. At fiscal year end



2003, the Company had a total of 1,257 licensed
retail stores managed by the Company’s international
divisions and located as follows:

Product sales to and royalty and license fee
revenues from international licensed retail stores accounted for
approximately 17% of specialty revenues in fiscal 2003. In
total, worldwide retail store licensing accounted for
approximately 39% of specialty revenues in fiscal 2003.

Starbucks has a licensing agreement with Kraft
Foods, Inc. (“Kraft”) to market and distribute
Starbucks whole bean and ground coffees to grocery stores as
well as in warehouse club stores. Pursuant to that agreement,
Kraft manages all distribution, marketing, advertising and
promotions for Starbucks whole bean and ground coffee in grocery
and mass merchandise stores and pays a royalty to Starbucks
based on a percentage of total net sales. Additionally, Kraft
distributes Starbucks products to warehouse club stores, for
which the Company pays a distribution fee. By the end of fiscal
2003, the Company’s whole bean and ground coffees were
available throughout the United States in approximately 19,500
grocery and warehouse club accounts. Revenues from grocery and
warehouse club accounts comprised approximately 25% of specialty
revenues in fiscal 2003.

The Company has licensed the rights to produce
and distribute Starbucks branded products to two partnerships in
which the Company holds a 50% equity interest: The North
American Coffee Partnership with the Pepsi-Cola Company develops
and distributes bottled Frappuccino® and Starbucks
DoubleShot

TM

coffee drinks; and the Starbucks Ice
Cream Partnership with Dreyer’s Grand Ice Cream, Inc.
develops and distributes premium ice creams. The associated
revenues from these equity investees accounted for approximately
1% of specialty revenues in fiscal 2003.

Foodservice Accounts

The Company sells whole bean and ground coffees,
including the Starbucks®, Seattle’s Best Coffee®
and Torrefazione Italia® brands, to institutional
foodservice companies that service business, industry, education
and healthcare accounts, office coffee distributors, hotels,
restaurants, airlines and other retailers. In fiscal 2003,
Starbucks became the only premium national brand coffee actively
promoted by SYSCO Corporation’s national broadline
distribution network. The Company is currently in the process of
transitioning the majority of its foodservice accounts to the
broadline distribution network as well as aligning its current
foodservice sales, service and support resources with SYSCO
Corporation. This alliance is expected to improve service levels
to current customers and generate new foodservice accounts over
the next several years. In fiscal 2003, the Company had
approximately 12,800 foodservice accounts, and revenues from
these accounts comprised approximately 27% of specialty revenues.



Other Initiatives

The Company has several other initiatives
designed to enhance its core business. For example, the Company
has marketed a selection of premium tea products since the
acquisition of Tazo, L.L.C. in 1999. The Company maintains a
website at Starbucks.com through which customers may purchase,
register or reload a Starbucks stored value card, as well as
apply for the Starbucks Card Duetto

TM

Visa® (the
“Duetto Card”), issued through the Company’s
agreement with BankOne Corporation and Visa. The Duetto card is
a first-of-its-kind card combining the functionality of a credit
card with the convenience of a reloadable Starbucks card.
Additionally, the website contains information about the
Company’s coffee products, brewing equipment and store
locations. The Company also maintains an e-commerce site at
SeattlesBest.com, from which customers may purchase coffee,
coffee flavorings and gift items online. Collectively, these
operations accounted for approximately 8% of specialty revenues
in fiscal 2003.

Segment Financial Information

Information about the Company’s total net
revenues, earnings before income taxes, depreciation and
amortization, income from equity investees and identifiable
assets by segment is included in Note 18 of the
Company’s consolidated financial statements included in
Exhibit 13 to this report.

Product Supply

Starbucks is committed to selling only the finest
whole bean coffees and coffee beverages. To ensure compliance
with its rigorous coffee standards, Starbucks controls its
coffee purchasing, roasting and packaging, and the distribution
of coffee to its retail stores. The Company purchases green
coffee beans from coffee-producing regions around the world and
custom roasts them to its exacting standards for its many blends
and single origin coffees.

The supply and price of coffee are subject to
significant volatility. Although most coffee trades in the
commodity market, coffee of the quality sought by the Company
tends to trade on a negotiated basis at a substantial premium
above commodity coffee prices, depending upon the supply and
demand at the time of purchase. Supply and price can be affected
by multiple factors in the producing countries, including
weather, political and economic conditions. In addition, green
coffee prices have been affected in the past, and may be
affected in the future, by the actions of certain organizations
and associations that have historically attempted to influence
prices of green coffee through agreements establishing export
quotas or restricting coffee supplies.

The Company depends upon its relationships with
coffee producers, outside trading companies and exporters for
its supply of green coffee. Prices for green coffee of the
quality purchased by Starbucks reached historic lows for the
Company in 2002 and have gradually increased since then. In an
effort to encourage the continuing supply of high quality
coffee, the Company negotiates contracts directly with its
suppliers and has been successful in securing long-term
contracts for the majority of its coffee requirements on this
basis. The Company routinely enters into fixed-price purchase
commitments for future deliveries of coffee. As of
September 28, 2003, the Company had $287.2 million in
fixed-price purchase commitments which, together with existing
inventory, are expected to provide an adequate supply of green
coffee for calendar 2004. The Company believes, based on
relationships established with its suppliers in the past, that
the risk of non-delivery on such purchase commitments is low.
There can be no assurance that these activities will
successfully protect the Company against the risks of higher
coffee prices or that such activities will not result in the
Company having to pay substantially more for its coffee supply
than it would have been required to pay absent such activities.

In addition to coffee, the Company also purchases
significant amounts of dairy products to support the needs of
its Company-operated retail stores. Fluid milk is purchased from
multiple suppliers who have processing facilities near
concentrations of Company-operated retail stores. Dairy prices
vary throughout the year as supply and demand fluctuate and are
subject to additional changes due to government regulations.

The Company also purchases a broad range of paper
and plastic products, such as cups, lids, napkins, straws,
shopping bags and corrugated paper boxes from several companies
to support the needs of its retail



stores as well as its manufacturing and
distribution operations. The cost of these materials is somewhat
dependent upon commodity paper and plastic resin costs, but the
Company believes it mitigates the effect of short-term raw
material price fluctuations through strategic relationships with
key suppliers.

Products other than whole bean coffees and coffee
beverages sold in Starbucks retail stores are obtained through a
number of different channels. Beverage ingredients other than
coffee and milk are purchased from several specialty
manufacturers, usually pursuant to long-term supply contracts.
Food products, such as fresh pastries and lunch items, are
generally purchased from both regional and local sources.
Coffee-making equipment, such as drip and French press
coffeemakers, espresso machines and coffee grinders, are
generally purchased directly from their manufacturers.
Coffee-related accessories, including items bearing the
Company’s logos and trademarks, are produced and
distributed through contracts with a number of different
suppliers.

Competition

The Company’s primary competitors for coffee
beverage sales are restaurants, specialty coffee shops and
doughnut shops. In almost all markets in which the Company does
business, there are numerous competitors in the specialty coffee
beverage business, and management expects this situation to
continue. Although competition in the beverage market is
currently fragmented, a major competitor with substantially
greater financial, marketing and operating resources than the
Company could enter this market at any time and compete directly
against the Company.

The Company’s whole bean coffees compete
directly against specialty coffees sold through supermarkets,
specialty retailers and a growing number of specialty coffee
stores. Both the Company’s whole bean coffees and its
coffee beverages compete indirectly against all other coffees on
the market. The Company believes that its customers choose among
retailers primarily on the basis of product quality, service and
convenience, and, to a lesser extent, on price.

The Company believes that supermarkets are the
most competitive distribution channel for specialty whole bean
coffee, in part because supermarkets offer customers a variety
of choices without having to make a separate trip to a specialty
coffee store. A number of nationwide coffee manufacturers are
distributing premium coffee products in supermarkets that may
serve as substitutes for the Company’s coffees. Regional
specialty coffee companies also sell whole bean coffees in
supermarkets.

In addition to the competition generated by
supermarket sales of coffee, Starbucks competes for whole bean
coffee sales with franchise operators and independent specialty
coffee stores. In virtually every major metropolitan area where
Starbucks operates and expects to expand, there are local or
regional competitors with substantial market presence in the
specialty coffee business. Starbucks Specialty Operations also
face significant competition from established wholesale and mail
order suppliers, some of whom have greater financial and
marketing resources than the Company.

The Company faces intense competition from both
restaurants and other specialty retailers for suitable sites for
new stores and qualified personnel to operate both new and
existing stores. There can be no assurance that Starbucks will
be able to continue to secure adequate sites at acceptable rent
levels or that the Company will be able to attract a sufficient
number of qualified personnel.

Patents, Trademarks, Copyrights and Domain
Names

The Company owns and/or has applied to register
numerous trademarks and service marks in the United States and
in more than 140 additional countries throughout the world.
Rights to the trademarks and service marks in the United States
are generally held by a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company
and are used by the Company under license. Some of the
Company’s trademarks, including Starbucks®, the
Starbucks logo and Frappuccino®, as well as other acquired
trademarks and trade names such as Seattle’s Best
Coffee® and Torrefazione Italia® are of material
importance to the Company. The duration of trademark
registrations varies from country to country. However,
trademarks are generally valid and may be renewed indefinitely as



long as they are in use and/or their
registrations are properly maintained, and they have not been
found to have become generic.

The Company owns numerous copyrights for items
such as product packaging, promotional materials, in-store
graphics and training materials. The Company also holds patents
on certain products, systems and designs. In addition, the
Company has registered and maintains numerous Internet domain
names, including “Starbucks.com” and
“Starbucks.net.” While valuable, the Company does not
view its current copyrights, patents and domain names as
material to its business.

Research and Development

The Company’s research and development
efforts are led by food scientists, engineers, chemists and
culinarians in the Research and Development department. This
team is responsible for the technical development of food and
beverage products and new equipment. Recent development efforts
have resulted in successful flavor line extensions for
espresso-based beverages, coffee and non-coffee based
Frappuccino® blended beverages; new items for the
Company’s morning pastry and lunch lines; and the launch of
iced shaken refreshment beverages made with Starbucks®
brewed coffee or Tazo® tea. The Company spent approximately
$5.4 million during fiscal 2003 on technical research and
development activities, in addition to customary product testing
and product and process improvements in all areas of its
business.

Seasonality and Quarterly Results

The Company’s business is subject to
seasonal fluctuations. Significant portions of the
Company’s net revenues and profits are realized during the
first quarter of the fiscal year, which includes the December
holiday season. In addition, quarterly results are affected by
the timing of the opening of new stores, and the Company’s
rapid growth may conceal the impact of other seasonal
influences. Because of the seasonality of the business, results
for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results
that may be achieved for the full fiscal year.

Employees

As of September 28, 2003, the Company
employed approximately 74,000 people, approximately 68,000
in retail stores and the remainder in the Company’s
administrative and regional offices, and store development,
roasting and warehousing operations. At fiscal year end,
employees at 10 of the Company’s Canadian stores and a
group of nine maintenance mechanics and technicians at one
United States roasting plant were represented by unions. The
Company believes that its current relations with its employees
are good.

Certain Additional Risks and
Uncertainties

In fiscal 2004, the Company expects to open
approximately 1,300 new stores worldwide and expects
Company-operated comparable store sales growth to be in the
range of 3%-7%, with monthly anomalies. Management expects total
net revenue growth of approximately 20% and earnings per share
growth of approximately 20-25% per year for the next
3-5 years. Managing rapid growth can be challenging, and
any failure to execute that growth effectively could adversely
impact the Company’s business, financial condition and
results of operations.

The Company’s financial performance is
highly dependent upon the retail operations of the United States
operating segment. Any substantial, sustained decline in these
operations would have a material adverse effect on the
Company’s business, financial condition and results of
operations. Declines in financial performance could arise from,
among other things:

•

failure to identify and secure real estate
    locations sufficient to meet annual targets for store openings;

•

shortfalls in comparable store sales growth
    expectations; and

•

negative trends in operating expenses.



The Company’s International operating
segment (excluding Canada) is not currently profitable, and its
international stores and licensees may not be successful in
their operations or in achieving expected growth. Some factors
critical to the success of the Company’s international
stores and licensees are different than those affecting the
United States stores and licensees. The economies of a number of
the international markets in which Starbucks and its licensees
operate have been weak in recent years. Tastes naturally vary by
region, and consumers in the new international markets into
which Starbucks and its licensees expand may not embrace
products and services to the same extent as consumers in the
Company’s existing United States markets. Occupancy costs
and store operating expenses are sometimes higher
internationally than in the United States due to higher rents
for prime, inner-city store locations or due to local laws that
make it more expensive to retain or terminate employees. The
Company’s International operations are also subject to the
inherent risks of foreign currency fluctuations and changes in
economic, social and political conditions. Because the
Company’s International operations are in an early phase of
development and have country-specific regulatory requirements,
they require a more comprehensive field organization, compared
to the United States, to provide resources and respond to the
business needs in each region.

Future operating results for the Company may
fluctuate, perhaps significantly, depending upon a number of
factors which include, but are not limited to, the following:

Market expectations for the Company’s
financial performance are high, and Starbucks stock often trades
at a significant multiple to expected earnings per share.
Failure to meet these market expectations could cause the price
of the Company’s common stock to drop rapidly and sharply.
Investing in Starbucks common stock entails assuming the risk
that the Company may not meet the market’s high
expectations.

Controls and Procedures

The Company carried out an evaluation, under the
supervision and with the participation of the Company’s
management, including the chief executive officer and the chief
financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and
operation of the disclosure controls and procedures, as defined
in Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). Based
upon that evaluation, the Company’s chief executive officer
and chief financial officer concluded that the Company’s
disclosure controls and procedures are effective, as of the end
of the period covered by this Report (September 28, 2003),
in ensuring that material information relating to Starbucks
Corporation, including its consolidated subsidiaries, required
to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or
submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms,
including ensuring that such material information is accumulated
and communicated to the Company’s management, including the
Company’s chief executive officer and chief financial
officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure.

There were no significant changes in the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting (as
required by the Exchange Act) that occurred during our last
fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably
likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal
controls over financial reporting.
