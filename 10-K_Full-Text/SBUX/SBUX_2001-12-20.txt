PART I

Item 1.

Business

General.

Starbucks
Corporation (together with its subsidiaries,
“Starbucks” or the “Company”) purchases and
roasts high-quality whole bean coffees and sells them, along
with fresh, rich-brewed coffees, Italian-style espresso
beverages, cold blended beverages, a variety of pastries and
confections, coffee-related accessories and equipment, a
selection of premium teas and a line of compact discs primarily
through Company-operated retail stores. In addition to sales
through its Company-operated retail stores, Starbucks sells
coffee and tea products through other channels of distribution
including the Business Alliances business unit and other
specialty operations (collectively, “Specialty
Operations”). Starbucks, through its joint venture
partnerships, also produces and sells bottled Frappuccino®
coffee drink and a line of premium ice creams. The
Company’s objective is to establish Starbucks as the most
recognized and respected brand in the world. To achieve this
goal, the Company plans to continue to rapidly expand its retail
operations, grow its Specialty Operations and selectively pursue
other opportunities to leverage the Starbucks brand through the
introduction of new products and the development of new
distribution channels.

Company-Operated Retail
Stores.

The Company’s retail goal
is to become the leading retailer and brand of coffee in each of
its target markets by selling the finest quality coffee and
related products and by providing superior customer service,
thereby building a high degree of customer loyalty. Starbucks
strategy for expanding its retail business is to increase its
market share in existing markets and to open stores in new
markets where the opportunity exists to become the leading
specialty coffee retailer. In support of this strategy, the
Company opened 647 new stores during the fiscal year ended
September 30, 2001 (“fiscal 2001”). At fiscal
year end, Starbucks had 2,971 Company-operated stores in 38
states, the District of Columbia and five Canadian provinces
(which comprise the Company-operated North American retail
operations), as well as 252 stores in the United Kingdom,
25 stores in Thailand and 18 stores in Australia (which
comprise the Company-operated international retail operations).
Company-operated retail stores accounted for approximately 84%
of net revenues during fiscal 2001.

Starbucks retail stores are typically located in
high-traffic, high-visibility locations. Because the Company can
vary the size and format of its stores, they are located in a
variety of settings, including downtown and suburban retail
centers, office buildings and university campuses. While the
Company selectively locates stores in suburban malls, it focuses
on stores that have convenient access for pedestrians and
drivers.

All Starbucks stores offer a choice of regular
and decaffeinated coffee beverages, including at least one
“coffee of the day,” a broad selection of
Italian-style espresso beverages, cold blended beverages, a
selection of teas and distinctively packaged roasted whole bean
coffees. Starbucks stores also offer a selection of fresh
pastries and other food items, sodas, juices, coffee-making
equipment and accessories and a selection of compact discs. Each
Starbucks store varies its product mix depending upon the size
of the store and its location. Larger stores carry a broad
selection of the Company’s whole bean coffees in various
sizes and types of packaging, as well as an assortment of coffee
and espresso-making equipment and accessories such as coffee



grinders, coffee makers, espresso machines,
coffee filters, storage containers, travel tumblers and mugs.
Smaller Starbucks stores and kiosks typically sell a full line
of coffee beverages, a more limited selection of whole bean
coffees and a few accessories such as travel tumblers and logo
mugs. Approximately 700 Starbucks stores carry a selection of
“grab and go” sandwiches and salads. During fiscal
2001, the Company’s retail sales mix by product type was
approximately 75% handcrafted beverages, 14% food items, 7%
whole bean coffees, and 4% coffee-making equipment and
accessories.

Specialty
Operations.

Starbucks Specialty
Operations strive to develop the Starbucks brand outside the
Company-operated retail store environment through a number of
channels. Starbucks strategy is to reach customers where they
work, travel, shop and dine by establishing relationships with
prominent third parties who share Starbucks values and
commitment to quality. These relationships take various forms,
including arrangements with foodservice companies and retail
store licensing agreements for North American locations (which
together comprise the Business Alliances business unit), grocery
channel licensing agreements, warehouse club accounts,
international retail store licensing agreements,
direct-to-consumer market channels, joint ventures and other
initiatives related to the Company’s core businesses. In
certain licensing situations, the licensee is a joint venture in
which Starbucks has an equity ownership interest. During fiscal
2001, specialty revenues (which include royalties and fees from
licensees as well as product sales) accounted for approximately
16% of the Company’s net revenues.

Foodservice Accounts.

The Company sells whole bean and
ground coffees to office coffee distributors, institutional
foodservice companies that service business, industry, education
and healthcare accounts, and to hotels, airlines, retailers and
restaurants. As of September 30, 2001, the Company had
approximately 5,500 foodservice accounts, and revenues from
these accounts comprised approximately 31% of specialty revenues
in fiscal 2001.

North American Retail Store Licensing.

Although the Company does not
generally relinquish operational control of its retail stores in
North America, in situations in which a master concessionaire or
another company controls or can provide improved access to
desirable retail space, the Company licenses its operations. As
part of these arrangements, Starbucks receives license fees and
royalties and sells coffee and related products for resale in
the licensed locations. Employees working in the licensed
locations must follow Starbucks detailed store-operating
procedures and attend training classes similar to those given to
Starbucks store managers and employees. As of September 30,
2001, the Company had 809 licensed stores in continental North
America, and revenues from these stores accounted for
approximately 15% of specialty revenues in fiscal 2001.

Grocery Channel Licensing.

Starbucks has a long-term
licensing agreement with Kraft Foods, Inc. (“Kraft”)
to market and distribute Starbucks whole bean and ground coffees
in the grocery channel in the United States. Pursuant to that
agreement, Kraft manages all distribution, marketing,
advertising and promotions for Starbucks whole bean and ground
coffee in grocery and mass merchandise stores. By the end of
fiscal 2001, the Company’s whole bean and ground coffees
were available throughout the United States in approximately
18,000 supermarkets, and revenues from the grocery channel
accounted for approximately 14% of specialty revenues in fiscal
2001.

Warehouse Club Accounts.

The Company sells whole bean and
ground coffees to warehouse club chains. As part of its
agreement with Starbucks to market and distribute to the grocery
channel, Kraft also distributes Starbucks products to warehouse
club stores. Revenues from warehouse club accounts accounted for
approximately 13% of specialty revenues in fiscal 2001.

International Retail Store Licensing.

Starbucks retail stores located
outside of North America, the United Kingdom, Thailand and
Australia are operated through a number of joint venture and
licensing arrangements with prominent retailers. During fiscal
2001, the Company expanded its international presence by opening
282 new international licensed stores, including the first
stores in Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Switzerland and Israel. At
fiscal year end, the Company had a total of 634 licensed
international stores, including 289 stores in Japan, 74 in
Taiwan, 62 in China, 33 in the Philippines, 30 in Singapore, 26
in Hawaii, 26 in New Zealand, 24 in South Korea, 21 in
Malaysia, 12 in the United Arab Emirates, 11 in Saudi Arabia,
nine in Kuwait, six in Switzerland, five in Lebanon, three in
Qatar, two in Bahrain and one in Israel. Product



sales to and royalty and license fee revenues
from licensed international retail stores accounted for
approximately 13% of specialty revenues in fiscal 2001.

Direct-to-Consumer
Marketing.

The Company makes fresh
Starbucks coffee and coffee-related products conveniently
available via mail order and on-line. Starbucks publishes and
distributes a mail order catalog and a catalog of business gifts
that offer coffees, certain food items and select coffee-making
equipment and accessories, and the Company maintains a web site
at www.starbucks.com with an on-line store that allows customers
to purchase coffee, gifts and other items via the Internet.
Management believes that the Company’s direct-to-consumer
operations support its retail store expansion into new markets
and reinforce brand recognition in existing markets. Starbucks
direct-to-consumer channel accounted for approximately 5% of
specialty revenues in fiscal 2001.

Other Initiatives.

The Company has several other
initiatives related to its core businesses that are intended to
enhance the customers’ experience at Starbucks retail
stores. For example, the Company is currently in the process of
implementing wireless internet access in its retail stores and
has marketed a selection of premium tea products since the
acquisition of Tazo, L.L.C. in 1999. Collectively, these
initiatives accounted for approximately 7% of specialty revenues
in fiscal 2001.

Joint Ventures.

The Company has two non-retail
domestic 50-50 joint ventures. The North American Coffee
Partnership, a joint venture with the Pepsi-Cola Company, a
division of PepsiCo, Inc., develops and distributes
ready-to-drink coffee-based products. By the end of fiscal 2001,
the joint venture was distributing bottled Frappuccino coffee
drink to approximately 200,000 supermarkets, convenience and
drug stores and other locations throughout the United States and
Canada. The Company has a joint venture with Dreyer’s Grand
Ice Cream, Inc. to develop and distribute Starbucks premium
coffee ice creams. By the end of fiscal 2001, the joint venture
was distributing a variety of ice cream and novelty products to
over 20,000 supermarkets throughout the United States.
Starbucks sells roasted coffee and coffee extract to these joint
ventures, and revenues from these joint ventures accounted for
approximately 2% of specialty revenues in fiscal 2001. (See
Note 7 to the Company’s consolidated financial
statements, “Joint Ventures,” incorporated by
reference to the Company’s 2001 Annual Report to
Shareholders in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.)

Product Supply.

Starbucks is committed to selling only the finest whole bean
coffees and coffee beverages. To ensure compliance with its
rigorous coffee standards, Starbucks controls its coffee
purchasing, roasting and packaging, and the distribution of
coffee to its retail stores. The Company purchases green coffee
beans for its many blends and single origin coffees from
coffee-producing regions around the world and custom roasts them
to its exacting standards.

The supply and price of coffee are subject to
significant volatility. Although most coffee trades in the
commodity market, coffee of the quality sought by the Company
tends to trade on a negotiated basis at a substantial premium
above commodity coffee prices, depending upon the supply and
demand at the time of purchase. Supply and price can be affected
by multiple factors in the producing countries, including
weather, political and economic conditions. In addition, green
coffee prices have been affected in the past, and may be
affected in the future, by the actions of certain organizations
and associations that have historically attempted to influence
prices of green coffee through agreements establishing export
quotas or restricting coffee supplies worldwide.

The Company depends upon its relationships with
outside trading companies and exporters for its supply of green
coffee. Because world coffee prices reached 30-year lows during
fiscal 2001, the Company is negotiating contracts with its
suppliers at levels equal to prior years in order to encourage
the continuing supply of high quality coffee in the future, and
has been successful in securing long-term contracts on this
basis. The Company routinely enters into fixed-price purchase
commitments for future deliveries of coffee. As of
September 30, 2001, the Company had approximately
$284 million in fixed-price purchase commitments which,
together with existing inventory, are expected to provide an
adequate supply of green coffee for 2002. The Company believes,
based on relationships established with its suppliers in the
past, that the risk of non-delivery on such purchase commitments
is low. There can be no assurance that these activities will
successfully protect the Company against the risks of higher
coffee prices or that such activities will not result



in the Company having to pay substantially more
for its coffee supply than it would have been required to pay
absent such activities.

In addition to coffee, the Company also purchases
significant amounts of dairy products to support the needs of
its retail stores. Fluid milk is purchased from several
suppliers who have processing facilities near concentrations of
Starbucks retail stores. Dairy prices vary throughout the year
as supply and demand fluctuate and are subject to additional
changes due to government regulations.

The Company also purchases a broad range of paper
and plastic products, such as paper cups, plastic cold cups, hot
cup lids, napkins, straws, shopping bags and corrugated paper
boxes from several companies to support the needs of its retail
stores as well as its manufacturing and distribution operations.
The cost of these materials are somewhat dependent upon
commodity paper and plastic resin costs, but the Company
believes it mitigates the effect of short-term raw material
price increases through strategic relationships with key
suppliers.

Products other than whole bean coffees and coffee
beverages sold in Starbucks retail stores are obtained through a
number of different channels. Beverage ingredients other than
coffee and milk are purchased from several specialty
manufacturers, usually pursuant to long-term supply contracts.
Specialty foods, such as fresh pastries and lunch items, are
generally purchased from both regional and local sources based
on quality and price. Coffee-making equipment, such as drip,
vacuum and french press coffee makers, espresso machines and
coffee grinders, are generally purchased directly from their
manufacturers for resale. Coffee-related accessories, including
items bearing the Company’s logos and trademarks, are
produced and distributed through contracts with a number of
different vendors.

Competition.

The
Company’s primary competitors for coffee beverage sales are
restaurants, coffee shops, and street carts. In almost all
markets in which the Company does business, there are numerous
competitors in the specialty coffee beverage business, and
management expects this situation to continue. Although
competition in the beverage market is currently fragmented, a
major competitor with substantially greater financial, marketing
and operating resources than the Company could enter this market
at any time and compete directly against the Company.

The Company’s whole bean coffees compete
directly against specialty coffees sold at retail through
supermarkets, specialty retailers, and a growing number of
specialty coffee stores. Both the Company’s whole bean
coffees and its coffee beverages compete indirectly against all
other coffees on the market. The Company believes that its
customers choose among retailers primarily on the basis of
product quality, service and convenience, and, to a lesser
extent, on price.

Management believes that supermarkets are the
most competitive distribution channel for specialty whole bean
coffee, in part because supermarkets offer customers a variety
of choices without having to make a separate trip to a specialty
coffee store. A number of nationwide coffee manufacturers are
distributing premium coffee products in supermarkets that may
serve as substitutes for the Company’s coffees. Regional
specialty coffee companies also sell whole bean coffees in
supermarkets.

In addition to the competition generated by
supermarket sales of coffee, Starbucks competes for whole bean
coffee sales with franchise operators and independent specialty
coffee stores. In virtually every major metropolitan area where
Starbucks operates and expects to expand, there are local or
regional competitors with substantial market presence in the
specialty coffee business. Starbucks Specialty Operations also
face significant competition from established wholesale and mail
order suppliers, some of whom have greater financial and
marketing resources than the Company.

In addition, the Company faces intense
competition from both restaurants and other specialty retailers
for suitable sites for new stores and qualified personnel to
operate both new and existing stores. There can be no assurance
that Starbucks will be able to continue to secure adequate sites
at acceptable rent levels or that the Company will be able to
attract a sufficient number of qualified workers.

Patents, Trademarks, Copyrights and Domain
Names.

The Company owns and/or has
applied to register numerous trademarks and service marks in the
United States, Canada and in more than 125 additional



countries throughout the world. Rights to the
trademarks and service marks in the United States are generally
held by Starbucks U.S. Brands Corporation, a wholly-owned
subsidiary of the Company, and are used by the Company under
license. Some of the Company’s trademarks, including
“Starbucks,” the Starbucks logo and
“Frappuccino,” are of material importance to the
Company. The duration of trademark registrations varies from
country to country. However, trademarks are generally valid and
may be renewed indefinitely as long as they are in use and/or
their registrations are properly maintained, and they have not
been found to have become generic.

The Company also owns numerous copyrights for its
product packaging, promotional materials, in-store graphics and
training materials, among other things. The Company also holds
patents on certain products, systems and designs. In addition,
the Company has registered and maintains numerous Internet
domain names, including “Starbucks.com” and
“Starbucks.net.” While valuable, individual
copyrights, patents and domain names currently held by the
Company are not viewed as material to the Company’s
business.

Research and
Development.

The Company’s
research and development efforts are led by food scientists,
engineers, chemists and culinarians in the Research and
Development department. This team is responsible for the
technical development of food and beverage products and new
equipment. Recent development efforts have resulted in
successful flavor line extensions for latte beverages,
Frappuccino blended beverages and new items for the
Company’s morning pastry and lunch lines. The department
also introduced improvements in base ingredients and approved a
new supplier to aid in the distribution of products to
international markets and formulation changes to tea-based
beverages. The Company spent approximately $4.0 million
during fiscal 2001 on technical research and development
activities, in addition to customary product testing and product
and process improvements in all areas of the Company’s
business.

Seasonality and Quarterly
Results.

The Company’s business
is subject to seasonal fluctuations. Significant portions of the
Company’s net revenues and profits are realized during the
first quarter of the Company’s fiscal year that includes
the December holiday season. In addition, quarterly results are
affected by the timing of the opening of new stores, and the
Company’s rapid growth may conceal the impact of other
seasonal influences. Because of the seasonality of the
Company’s business, results for any quarter are not
necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for
the full fiscal year.

Employees.

As of
September 30, 2001, the Company employed approximately
54,000 individuals, approximately 50,000 in retail stores and
the remainder in the Company’s regional offices and
administrative, specialty, store development, roasting, and
warehousing operations. At fiscal year end, employees at 12 of
the Company’s stores and a group of 17 maintenance
mechanics and technicians at one roasting plant were represented
by unions. Starbucks entered into a labor agreement governing
the terms and conditions of employment for employees in the
12 stores that expired in July 2001 and is currently
negotiating with the Union for a renewal of the agreement.
Starbucks and the Union representing the roasting plant
employees recently reached an agreement governing the terms and
conditions of employment for those employees at the roasting
plant. The Company believes that its current relations with its
employees are good.

Item 2.

Properties

Starbucks currently operates three roasting and
distribution facilities. In the Seattle area, the Company owns a
roasting plant and distribution facility of approximately
305,000 square feet and leases two warehouse facilities totaling
approximately 200,000 square feet in Kent, Washington. The
Company also owns a 365,000 square foot roasting and
distribution facility and a 297,000 square foot green coffee
bean storage warehouse in York County, Pennsylvania. In
addition, the Company leases a small roasting and storage
facility in London, England that supports its operations in
Europe and the Middle East. The lease for this facility expires
in December 2002 unless extended by the parties. To support its
growth, the Company recently acquired 100 acres of land in
Minden, Nevada and has begun construction on a 330,000 square
foot roasting and distribution facility. The Company is also in
negotiations to build a 70,000 square foot roasting plant in The
Netherlands.

The Company leases approximately 620,000 square
feet of a building located in Seattle, Washington for
administrative offices and has options to lease approximately
380,000 additional square feet in the same



building. The Company owns 2.36 acres of
undeveloped land near its administrative offices that is used
for parking.

As of September 30, 2001, Starbucks operated
a total of 3,266 retail stores. All Starbucks stores are located
in leased premises. The Company also leases space in
approximately 75 additional locations for regional,
district and other administrative offices, training facilities
and storage, not including certain seasonal retail storage
locations.

Item 3.

Legal
Proceedings

On June 20, 2001 and July 2, 2001, two
purported class action lawsuits against the company entitled

James Carr, et al. v. Starbucks Corporation

and

Olivia
Shields, et al. v. Starbucks Corporation

were filed in the
Superior Courts of California, Alameda and Los Angeles
Counties, respectively. Each lawsuit subsequently was removed to
United States District Court, Northern District of California
and Central District of California, respectively. Each of the
lawsuits was filed by two plaintiffs who are current or former
store managers and assistant store managers on behalf of
themselves and other similarly situated store managers,
assistant store managers and retail management trainees. The
lawsuits allege that the Company improperly classified such
employees as exempt under California’s wage and hour laws
and seek damages, restitution, reclassification and attorneys
fees and costs. Starbucks is vigorously investigating and
defending this litigation and is also pursuing alternative
dispute resolution possibilities with the plaintiffs. Because
the cases are in the very early stages, the financial impact to
the Company, if any, cannot be predicted.

In addition to the California lawsuits described
above, the Company is party to various legal proceedings arising
in the ordinary course of its business, but it is not currently
a party to any legal proceeding that management believes would
have a material adverse effect on the financial position or
results of operations of the Company.
