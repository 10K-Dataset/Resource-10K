2017 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND 10-K

FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS

Below are our key financial results from continuing operations for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017:

•

Net sales were

$14.8 billion

, up 3% from the prior year, driven primarily by higher sales volumes and acquisition-related sales.

•

Cost of sales, exclusive of depreciation and amortization increased 7% to

$8.2 billion

, driven primarily by raw material cost inflation, higher sales volumes and higher cost of sales from acquired businesses.

•

Selling, general and administrative expenses of

$3.6 billion

were slightly lower compared to the prior year.

•

Income before income taxes was

$2,008 million

up $1.2 billion year-over-year, due to the absence of pension settlement charges related to the purchase of group annuity contracts and a business restructuring charge.

•

Net income from continuing operations was

$1,371 million

and earnings per diluted share was

$5.32

.

•

Adjusted net income from continuing operations was

$1,513 million

and adjusted earnings per diluted share was

$5.87

.

•

Cash and short-term investments were approximately

$1.5 billion

at year-end.

•

Cash from operating activities - continuing operations was

$1,556 million

.

•

Capital expenditures for modernization, productivity and regulatory improvements was

$360 million

.

•

Cash used for business acquisitions (net of cash acquired), was $325 million.

•

The Company raised the per-share dividend by 13%, paid approximately

$434 million

in dividends and also repurchased

$813 million

of its outstanding common stock.

•

The Company expects to deploy at least $3.5 billion for acquisitions and share repurchases during 2017 and 2018 combined, with $1.1 billion deployed in 2017.

•

The 2017 effective tax rate was

30.7%

, which includes a $134 million net charge related to the enactment of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. This net charge is $37 million higher than the net charge included in PPG’s fourth quarter earnings release and Form 8-K furnished on January 18, 2018, primarily due to new IRS regulations issued and refinements of the Company’s estimates. While the Company has made a preliminary assessment of the new legislation’s impact on PPG, U.S. regulatory agencies will be issuing further regulations and clarifying interpretations over 2018 which could alter the Company’s conclusions regarding the impact of the new law. Further, PPG may continue to refine its estimates to incorporate new or better information as it comes available. The Company’s adjusted effective tax rate was

24.4%

.

Part I

Item 1. Business

PPG Industries, Inc., manufactures and distributes a broad range of paints, coatings and specialty materials. PPG was incorporated in Pennsylvania in 1883. PPG’s vision is to be the world’s leading coatings company by consistently delivering high-quality, innovative and sustainable solutions that customers trust to protect and beautify their products and surroundings.  PPG’s business is comprised of two reportable business segments: Performance Coatings and Industrial Coatings.

In September 2017, PPG completed the sale of its North American fiber glass business, which represents the culmination of a multi-year strategic shift in the Company's business portfolio, resulting in the exit of all glass operations. Accordingly, all historical information has been recast to present the Glass segment as discontinued operations and assets held for sale. Refer to Note 2, “Acquisitions and Divestitures” under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information relating to this transaction.

Performance Coatings and Industrial Coatings

PPG is a major global supplier of coatings. The Performance Coatings and Industrial Coatings reportable business segments supply coatings and specialty materials to customers in a wide array of end-use markets, including industrial equipment and components, packaging material; aircraft and marine equipment; automotive original equipment (“automotive OEM”); automotive refinish; as well as for other industrial and consumer products. PPG also serves commercial and residential new build and maintenance markets by supplying coatings to painting and maintenance contractors and directly to consumers for decoration and maintenance. The coatings industry is highly competitive and consists of several large firms with global presence and many smaller firms serving local or regional markets. PPG competes in its primary markets with the world’s largest coatings companies, most of which have global operations, and many smaller regional coatings companies.

2017 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K


Research and Development

Technology innovation has been a hallmark of PPG’s success throughout its history. The Company seeks to optimize its investment in research and development to create new products to drive profitable growth. We align our product development with the macro trends in the end-use markets we serve and leverage core technology platforms to develop products for unmet market needs. Our history of successful technology introductions is based on a commitment to an efficient and effective innovation process and disciplined portfolio management. We have obtained government funding for a small portion of the Company’s research efforts, and we will continue to pursue government funding where appropriate.

PPG owns and operates several facilities to conduct research and development for new and improved products and processes. In addition to the Company’s centralized principal research and development centers (See Item 2. “Properties” of this Form 10-K), operating segments manage their development through centers of excellence. As part of our ongoing efforts to manage our formulations and raw material costs effectively, we operate a global competitive sourcing laboratory in China. Because of the Company’s broad array of products and customers, PPG is not materially dependent upon any single technology platform.

Raw Materials and Energy

The effective management of raw materials and energy is important to PPG’s continued success. The Company’s most significant raw materials are epoxy and other resins, titanium dioxide and other pigments, and solvents in the coatings businesses and sand and soda ash for the specialty coatings and materials business. Coatings raw materials, which include both organic, primarily petroleum based, materials and inorganic materials, including titanium dioxide, comprise between 70% and 80% of the Company’s cost of sales, excluding depreciation and amortization, in most coatings formulations and represent PPG’s single largest production cost component.

Most of the raw materials and energy used in production are purchased from outside sources, and the Company has made, and plans to continue to make, supply arrangements to meet the planned operating requirements for the future. Supply of critical raw materials and energy is managed by establishing contracts, multiple sources, and identifying alternative materials or technology whenever possible. Our products use both petroleum-derived and bio-based materials as part of a product renewal strategy. While prices for these raw materials typically fluctuate with energy prices, such fluctuations are impacted by the fact that the manufacture of our raw materials is several steps downstream from crude oil and natural gas.

The Company is continuing its aggressive sourcing initiatives to broaden our supply of high quality raw materials. These initiatives include qualifying multiple and local sources of supply, including suppliers from Asia and other lower cost regions of the world, adding on-site resin production at certain manufacturing locations and a reduction in the amount of titanium dioxide used in our product formulations.

Our global efforts to reduce titanium dioxide consumption have been successful to date and are expected to continue. Titanium dioxide is a raw material widely used in the paint and coatings industry as a pigment to provide hiding, durability and whiteness characteristics. PPG purchases both sulfate-grade and chloride-grade titanium dioxide from suppliers for use in coatings formulations. The Company has undertaken a strategic initiative to secure and enhance PPG’s supply of titanium dioxide, as well as to minimize PPG’s use of this raw material. PPG possesses intellectual property and expertise in the production and finishing of titanium dioxide pigment. PPG intends to continue to leverage this technology and intends to develop innovative supply solutions through technical collaborations, joint ventures and licensing arrangements with other interested parties.

We are subject to existing and evolving standards relating to the registration of chemicals which could potentially impact the availability and viability of some of the raw materials we use in our production processes. Our ongoing global product stewardship efforts are directed at maintaining our compliance with these standards.

Changes to chemical registration regulations have been proposed or implemented in the EU and many other countries, including China, Canada, the United States (U.S.), and Korea. Because implementation of many of these programs has not been finalized, the financial impact cannot be estimated at this time. We anticipate that the number of chemical registration regulations will continue to increase globally, and we have implemented programs to track and comply with these regulations.

Given the recent volatility in certain energy-based input costs and foreign currencies, the Company is not able to predict with certainty the 2018 full year impact of related changes in raw material pricing; however, PPG currently expects overall coatings raw material costs to increase a mid-single-digit percentage in the first half of 2018, with impacts varied by region and commodity. Further, given the distribution nature of many of our businesses, logistics and distribution costs are sizable, as are wages and benefits but to a lesser degree. PPG typically experiences fluctuating prices for energy and raw materials


2017 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND 10-K

driven by various factors, including changes in supplier feedstock costs and inventories, global industry activity levels, foreign currency exchange rates, government regulation, and global supply and demand factors. In aggregate, average raw material cost inflation rose by a mid-single-digit percentage in 2017 versus 2016, driven mostly by supply related factors including an unusually high number of supplier force majeure events in Europe, Chinese environmental regulation enforcement and severe hurricanes in the U.S. In addition, oil prices moved much higher in the second half of 2017 also contributing to raw material inflation.

Patents

PPG considers patent protection to be important; however, the Company’s operating segments are not materially dependent upon any single patent or group of related patents.

Backlog

In general, PPG does not manufacture its products against a backlog of orders. Production and inventory levels are geared primarily to projections of future demand and the level of incoming orders.

Global Operations

PPG has a significant investment in non-U.S. operations. This broad geographic footprint serves to lessen the significance of economic impacts occurring in any one region on PPG’s total net sales and income from continuing operations. As a result of our expansion outside the U.S., we are subject to certain inherent risks, including economic and political conditions in international markets and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. During 2017, favorable foreign currency translation increased net sales by approximately $55 million and decreased income from continuing operations by $7 million.

Our net sales in the developed and emerging regions of the world for the years ended December 31

st

are summarized below:

Refer to Note 19, “Reportable Business Segment Information” under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for geographic information related to PPG’s property, plant and equipment, and for additional geographic information pertaining to sales.

Seasonality

PPG’s income from continuing operations has typically been greater in the second and third quarters and cash from operating activities has been greatest in the fourth quarter due to end-use market seasonality, primarily in PPG’s architectural coatings businesses. Demand for PPG’s architectural coatings products is typically the strongest in the second and third quarters due to higher home improvement, maintenance and construction activity during the spring and summer months in the U.S., Canada and Europe. The Latin America paint season is the strongest in the fourth quarter. These cyclical activity levels result in the collection of outstanding receivables and lower inventory on hand in the fourth quarter generating higher cash from operating activities.

Employee Relations

The average number of people employed worldwide by PPG during 2017 was about 47,200. The Company has numerous collective bargaining agreements throughout the world. We observe local customs, laws and practices in labor relations when negotiating collective bargaining agreements. There were no significant work stoppages in 2017. While we have experienced occasional work stoppages as a result of the collective bargaining process and may experience some work stoppages in the future, we believe that we will be able to negotiate all labor agreements on satisfactory terms. To date, these work stoppages have not had a significant impact on PPG’s results of operations. Overall, the Company believes it has good relationships with its employees.

Environmental Matters

PPG is committed to operating in a sustainable manner and to helping our customers meet their sustainability goals. Our sustainability efforts are led by the Technology and Environment Committee of our Board of Directors and our Sustainability Committee, which is comprised of members of PPG’s senior management team. The Sustainability Committee establishes

2017 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K


policies, programs, procedures and goals to address sustainability in our business practices, including resource management, climate change, innovation, communications, purchasing, manufacturing and employee wellness.

Our dedication to innovation is intertwined with sustainability. Once again in 2017, we increased the percent of our sales from sustainable products. We are marketing an ever-growing variety of products and services that provide environmental, safety and other benefits to our customers. Our products contribute to lighter, more fuel-efficient vehicles, airplanes and ships, and they help our customers reduce their energy consumption, conserve water and reduce waste. These products include a compact automotive paint process that saves energy and reduces water usage; sustainable, waterborne coatings formulations; lightweight sealants and coatings for aircraft; coatings that cool surfaces; and solutions for autonomous and battery-powered vehicles.

Public and governmental concerns related to climate change continue to grow, leading to efforts to limit the greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions believed to be responsible. While PPG has operations in many countries, a substantial portion of PPG’s GHG emissions are generated by locations in the U.S. where considerable legislative and regulatory activity has been taking place. PPG has, and will continue to, annually report our global GHG emissions to the voluntary Carbon Disclosure project.

PPG participates in both the U.S. Department of Energy, BETTER BUILDINGS®, BETTER PLANTS® program, formerly the SAVE ENERGY NOW® Leadership program, and the Environmental Protection Agency ENERGY STAR® Industrial Partnership program, both reinforcing the company’s voluntary efforts to significantly reduce its industrial energy intensity. These programs include developing and implementing energy management processes and setting energy savings targets while providing a suite of educational, training, and technical resources to help meet those targets. Recognizing the continuing importance of this matter, PPG has a senior management group with a mandate to guide the Company’s progress in this area.

Our commitment to sustainability continues to yield tangible results. In 2017, we again made significant progress reducing our energy intensity, greenhouse gas emissions intensity, water usage intensity and waste intensity. More information about PPG’s sustainability values, efforts, goals and data and our community and employee engagement programs can be found in our Sustainability Report and on our sustainability website at http://sustainability.ppg.com and on the Carbon Disclosure Project’s website at www.cdp.net.

PPG is subject to existing and evolving standards relating to protection of the environment. In management’s opinion, the Company operates in an environmentally sound manner and is well positioned, relative to environmental matters, within the industries in which it operates. PPG is negotiating with various government agencies concerning 126 current and former manufacturing sites and offsite waste disposal locations, including 24 sites on the National Priority List. While PPG is not generally a major contributor of wastes to these offsite waste disposal locations, each potentially responsible party may face governmental agency assertions of joint and several liability. Generally, however, a final allocation of costs is made based on relative contributions of wastes to the site. There is a wide range of cost estimates for cleanup of these sites, due largely to uncertainties as to the nature and extent of their condition and the methods that may have to be employed for their remediation. The Company has established reserves for onsite and offsite remediation of those sites where it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated.

The Company’s experience to date regarding environmental matters leads it to believe that it will have continuing expenditures for compliance with provisions regulating the protection of the environment and for present and future remediation efforts at waste and plant sites. Management anticipates that such expenditures will occur over an extended period of time.

In addition to the $258 million currently reserved for environmental remediation efforts, we may be subject to loss contingencies related to environmental matters estimated to be approximately $100 million to $200 million. These reasonably possible unreserved losses relate to environmental matters at a number of sites, none of which are individually significant. The loss contingencies related to these sites include significant unresolved issues such as the nature and extent of contamination at these sites and the methods that may have to be employed to remediate them.

It is expected that expenditures for such projects in 2018 will be in the range of $10 million to $20 million. Although future capital expenditures are difficult to estimate accurately because of constantly changing regulatory standards and policies, it can be anticipated that environmental control standards will become increasingly stringent and the cost of compliance will increase.

Management believes that the outcome of these environmental contingencies will not have a material adverse effect on PPG’s financial position or liquidity; however, any such outcome may be material to the results of operations of any particular period in which costs, if any, are recognized. See Note 13, “Commitments and Contingent Liabilities,” under Item 8 of this

Item 1A. Risk Factors

As a global manufacturer of paints, coatings and specialty materials, we operate in a business environment that includes risks. These risks are not unlike the risks we have faced in the recent past nor are they unlike risks faced by our competitors. Each of the risks described in this section could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and liquidity. While the factors listed here are considered to be the more significant factors, no such list should be considered to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties. Unlisted factors may present significant additional obstacles which may adversely affect our businesses and our results of operations.

Increases in prices and declines in the availability of raw materials could negatively impact our financial results.

Our financial results are significantly affected by the cost of raw materials. Coatings raw materials, which include both organic, primarily petroleum based, materials and inorganic materials, including titanium dioxide, comprise between 70% and 80% of the Company’s cost of sales, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, sold in most coatings formulations and represent PPG’s single largest production cost component.

While not our customary practice, we also import raw materials and intermediates, particularly for use at our manufacturing facilities in the emerging regions of the world. In most cases, those imports are priced in the currency of the supplier and, therefore, if that currency strengthens against the currency of our manufacturing facility, our margins may be lower.

Most of our raw materials are purchased from outside sources, and the Company has made, and plans to continue to make, supply arrangements to meet the planned operating requirements for the future. Adequate supply of critical raw materials is managed by establishing contracts, procuring from multiple sources, and identifying alternative materials or technology whenever possible. The Company is continuing its aggressive sourcing initiatives to effectively broaden our supply of high quality raw materials. These initiatives include qualifying multiple and local sources of supply, including suppliers from Asia and other lower cost regions of the world, adding on-site resin production at certain manufacturing locations, and a reduction in the amount of titanium dioxide and other raw materials used in our product formulations. Our products use both petroleum-derived and bio-based materials as part of a product renewal strategy.

An inability to obtain critical raw materials would adversely impact our ability to produce products. Increases in the cost of raw materials may have an adverse effect on our income from continuing operations or cash from operating activities in the event we are unable to offset these higher costs in a timely manner.

Refer to Item 1. “Raw Materials and Energy” of this Form 10-K for a discussion of the current year trends and outlook in raw material and energy costs.

The pace of economic growth and level of uncertainty could have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows.

During 2017, economic conditions improved in all of our major geographical regions while remaining mixed by end-use market. PPG provides products and services to a variety of end-use markets in many geographies. This broad end-use market exposure and expanded geographic presence lessens the significance of any individual decrease in activity levels; nonetheless, lower demand levels may result in lower sales, which would result in reduced income from continuing operations and cash from operating activities.

Refer to Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of this Form 10-K for discussion of the economic conditions in 2017 and our outlook on certain economic conditions in 2018.

We are subject to existing and evolving standards relating to the protection of the environment.

Environmental laws and regulations control, among other things, the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, the handling, use, treatment, storage and clean-up of hazardous and non-hazardous waste, the investigation and remediation

2017 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K


of soil and groundwater affected by hazardous substances, and regulate various health and safety matters. The environmental laws and regulations we are subject to impose liability for the costs of, and damages resulting from, cleaning up current sites, past spills, disposals and other releases of hazardous substances. Violations of these laws and regulations can also result in fines and penalties. Future environmental laws and regulations may require substantial capital expenditures or may require or cause us to modify or curtail our operations, which may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

As described in Note 13, “Commitments and Contingent Liabilities,” under Item 8 of this Form 10-K, we are currently undertaking environmental remediation activities at a number of our current and former facilities and properties, the cost of which is substantial. In addition to the amounts currently reserved, we may be subject to loss contingencies related to environmental matters estimated to be as much as $100 million to $200 million. Such unreserved losses are reasonably possible but are not currently considered to be probable of occurrence.

We are involved in a number of lawsuits and claims, and we may be involved in future lawsuits and claims, in which substantial monetary damages are sought.

PPG is involved in a number of lawsuits and claims, both actual and potential, in which substantial monetary damages are sought. Those lawsuits and claims relate to contract, patent, environmental, product liability, asbestos exposure, antitrust, employment and other matters arising out of the conduct of PPG’s current and past business activities. Any such claims, whether with or without merit, could be time consuming, expensive to defend and could divert management’s attention and resources. We maintain insurance against some, but not all, of these potential claims, and the levels of insurance we do maintain may not be adequate to fully cover any and all losses. We believe that, in the aggregate, the outcome of all current lawsuits and claims involving PPG, including those described in Note 13, “Commitments and Contingent Liabilities” under Item 8 of this Form 10-K, will not have a material effect on PPG’s consolidated financial position or liquidity; however, such outcome may be material to the results of operations of any particular period in which costs, if any, are recognized. Nonetheless, the results of any future litigation or claims are inherently unpredictable, and such outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash from operating activities or financial condition.

Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could affect our financial results.

We earn revenues, pay expenses, own assets and incur liabilities in countries using currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Because our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, we must translate revenues and expenses into U.S. dollars at the average exchange rate during each reporting period, as well as assets and liabilities into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect at the end of each reporting period. Therefore, increases or decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar against other currencies will affect our net sales, net income and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies. We may use derivative financial instruments to reduce our net exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations related to foreign currency transactions. However, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly the strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar against major currencies, could adversely or positively affect our financial condition and results of operations expressed in U.S. dollars. In 2017, changes in the U.S. dollar versus our mix of currencies had a favorable impact on full year net sales and an unfavorable impact on income before income taxes from the translation of foreign earnings into U.S. dollars of approximately $55 million and $7 million, respectively.

We are subject to a variety of complex U.S. and non-U.S. laws and regulations which could increase our compliance costs.

We are subject to a wide variety of complex U.S. and non-U.S. laws and regulations, and legal compliance risks, including securities laws, tax laws, environmental laws, employment and pension-related laws, competition laws, U.S. and foreign export and trading laws, and laws governing improper business practices, including bribery. We are affected by new laws and regulations and changes to existing laws and regulations, as well as interpretations by courts and regulators. These laws and regulations effectively expand our compliance obligations and potential enforcement actions by governmental authorities or litigation related to them.

New laws and regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations or their interpretation could increase our compliance costs. For example, regulations concerning the composition, use and transport of chemical products continue to evolve. Developments concerning these regulations could potentially impact the availability or viability of some of the raw materials we use in our product formulations and/or our ability to supply certain products to some customers or markets. Import/export regulations also continue to evolve and could result in increased compliance costs, slower product movements or additional complexity in our supply chains.

Our international operations expose us to additional risks and uncertainties that could affect our financial results.

PPG has a significant investment in global operations. This broad geographic footprint serves to lessen the significance of economic impacts occurring in any one region. Notwithstanding the benefits of geographic diversification, our ability to achieve and maintain profitable growth in international markets is subject to risks related to the differing legal, political, social and


2017 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND 10-K

regulatory requirements and economic conditions of many countries. As a result of our operations outside the U.S., we are subject to certain inherent risks, including political and economic uncertainty, inflation rates, exchange rates, trade protection measures, local labor conditions and laws, restrictions on foreign investments and repatriation of earnings, and weak intellectual property protection. Our percentage of sales generated in 2017 by products sold outside the U.S. was approximately

62%

.

Changes in the tax regimes and related government policies and regulations in the countries in which we operate could adversely affect our results and our effective tax rate.

As a multinational corporation, we are subject to various taxes in both the U.S. and non-U.S. jurisdictions. Due to economic and political conditions, tax rates in these various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. Our future effective income tax rate could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets or changes in tax laws or their interpretation. In December 2017, the U.S. enacted the U.S. Tax Cuts and Job Act. While the Company has made a preliminary assessment of the new legislation’s impact on PPG, U.S. regulatory agencies will be issuing further regulations and clarifying interpretations over the next year which could alter the Company’s conclusions regarding the impact of the new law. Further, PPG may continue to refine its estimates to incorporate new or better information as it comes available. Recent developments, including the European Commission’s investigations on illegal state aid as well as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development project on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting may result in changes to long-standing tax principles, which could adversely affect our effective tax rate or result in higher cash tax liabilities. If our effective income tax rate was to increase, our cash from operating activities, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected.

Although we believe that our tax filing positions are appropriate, the final determination of tax audits or tax disputes may be different from what is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. If future audits find that additional taxes are due, we may be subject to incremental tax liabilities, possibly including interest and penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our cash from operating activities, financial condition and results of operations.

Business disruptions could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition.

Unexpected events, including supply disruptions, temporary plant and/or power outages, work stoppages, natural disasters and severe weather events, computer system disruptions, fires, war or terrorist activities, could increase the cost of doing business or otherwise harm the operations of PPG, our customers and our suppliers. It is not possible for us to predict the occurrence or consequence of any such events. However, such events could reduce our ability to supply products, reduce demand for our products or make it difficult or impossible for us to receive raw materials from suppliers or to deliver products to customers.

Integrating acquired businesses into our existing operations.

Part of the Company’s strategy is growth through acquisitions. Over the last decade, we have successfully completed more than 50 acquisitions and we will likely acquire additional businesses and enter into additional joint ventures in the future. Growth through acquisitions and the formation of joint ventures involve risks, including:

•

difficulties in assimilating acquired companies and products into our existing business;

•

delays in realizing the benefits from the acquired companies or products;

•

diversion of our management’s time and attention from other business concerns;

2017 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K


Our ability to understand our customers’ specific preferences and requirements, and to innovate, develop, produce and market products that meet customer demand is critical to our business results.

Our business relies on continued global demand for our brands and products. To achieve business goals, we must develop and sell products that appeal to customers. This is dependent on a number of factors, including our ability to produce products that meet the quality, performance and price expectations of our customers and our ability to develop effective sales, advertising and marketing programs.

We believe the automotive industry will experience significant and continued change in the coming years. Vehicle manufacturers continue to develop new safety features such as collision avoidance technology and self-driving vehicles that may reduce vehicle collisions in the future, potentially lowering demand for our refinish coatings. In addition, through the introduction of new technologies, new business models or new methods of travel, such as ridesharing, the number of automotive OEM new-builds may decline, potentially reducing demand for our automotive OEM coatings.

Our future growth will depend on our ability to continue to innovate our existing products and to develop and introduce new products. If we fail to keep pace with product innovation on a competitive basis or to predict market demands for our products, our businesses, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.

The industries in which we operate are highly competitive.

With each of our businesses, an increase in competition may cause us to lose market share, lose a large regional or global customer, or compel us to reduce prices to remain competitive, which could result in reduced margins for our products. Competitive pressures may not only reduce our margins but may also impact our revenues and our growth which could adversely affect our results of operations.

The security of our information technology systems could be compromised, which could adversely affect our ability to operate.

Increased global information technology security requirements, threats and sophisticated and targeted computer crime pose a risk to the security of our systems, networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data. Despite our efforts to protect sensitive information and confidential and personal data, our facilities and systems may be vulnerable to security breaches. This could lead to negative publicity, theft, modification or destruction of proprietary information or key information, manufacture of defective products, production downtimes and operational disruptions, which could adversely affect our reputation, competitiveness and results of operations.

Item 3. Legal Proceedings

PPG is involved in a number of lawsuits and claims, both actual and potential, including some that it has asserted against others, in which substantial monetary damages are sought. These lawsuits and claims may relate to contract, patent, environmental, product liability, asbestos exposure, antitrust, employment and other matters arising out of the conduct of PPG’s current and past business activities. To the extent that these lawsuits and claims involve personal injury and property damage, PPG believes it has adequate insurance; however, certain of PPG’s insurers are contesting coverage with respect to some of these claims, and other insurers may contest coverage. PPG’s lawsuits and claims against others include claims against insurers and other third parties with respect to actual and contingent losses related to environmental, asbestos and other matters.

The results of any future litigation and claims are inherently unpredictable. However, management believes that, in the aggregate, the outcome of all lawsuits and claims involving PPG, including asbestos-related claims, will not have a material effect on PPG’s consolidated financial position or liquidity; however, such outcome may be material to the results of operations of any particular period in which costs, if any, are recognized.

For many years, PPG has been a defendant in lawsuits involving claims alleging personal injury from exposure to asbestos. For a description of asbestos litigation affecting the Company, see Note 13, “Commitments and Contingent Liabilities” under Item 8 of this Form 10-K.

In the past, the Company and others have been named as defendants in several cases in various jurisdictions claiming damages related to exposure to lead and remediation of lead-based coatings applications. PPG has been dismissed as a defendant from most of these lawsuits and has never been found liable in any of these cases.

In March 2016, the Natural Resource Trustees for the Calcasieu River Estuary (the United States Department of the Interior, acting through the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration of the United States Department of Commerce, the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality and the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries) reached an agreement in principle with PPG and two other potentially responsible parties to resolve the Trustees’ claims for natural resource damages alleged to have been caused by the release of hazardous substances into the Estuary. In the fourth quarter of 2017, PPG signed a consent decree prepared by the US Department of Justice for settlement of potential natural resource damage claims at the Calcasieu River Estuary. PPG’s share of this settlement is $3.6 million. Payment of PPG’s share of the settlement is required to be made into an escrow account within 30 days of filing the agreement with the court and is expected to occur in the first quarter of 2018.

Item 5. Market for the Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities

The information required by Item 5 regarding market information, including stock exchange listings and quarterly stock market prices, dividends and holders of common stock is included in Exhibit 13.1 filed with this Form 10-K and is incorporated herein by reference. This information is also included in the PPG Shareholder Information on page 5 of the Annual Report to shareholders.

Directors who are not also officers of the Company may receive common stock equivalents pursuant to the PPG Industries, Inc. Deferred Compensation Plan for Directors (“PPG Deferred Compensation Plan for Directors”). Common stock equivalents are hypothetical shares of common stock having a value on any given date equal to the value of a share of common stock. Common stock equivalents earn dividend equivalents that are converted into additional common stock equivalents but carry no voting rights or other rights afforded to a holder of common stock. The common stock equivalents credited to directors under this plan are exempt from registration under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 as private offerings made only to directors of the Company in accordance with the provisions of the plan.

Under the PPG Deferred Compensation Plan for Directors, each director may elect to defer the receipt of all or any portion of the compensation paid to such director for serving as a PPG director. All deferred payments are held in the form of common stock equivalents. Payments out of the deferred accounts are made in the form of common stock of the Company (and cash as to any fractional common stock equivalent). The directors, as a group, were credited with 14,007; 17,807; and 15,445 common stock equivalents in


,

Selling, general and administrative expenses

Other charges and other income

Interest expense, net of Interest income

Interest expense, net of interest income decreased $14 million in 2017 versus 2016 primarily due to lower interest rate debt outstanding during 2017. Interest expense, net of Interest income increased $13 million in 2016 versus 2015 as interest income decreased year-over-year due to lower interest rates and lower average cash deposits on hand.

Business restructuring

In 2016, PPG recorded a pre-tax business restructuring charge of $195 million. During 2017, PPG realized approximately $50 million of cost savings related to restructuring actions. Once fully implemented, the total annual savings run rate is expected to be approximately $125 million. Refer to Note 7, "Business Restructuring" in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information.

In 2015, PPG recorded a pre-tax restructuring charge of $136 million, of which about 85% represented employee severance and other cash charges. As of December 31, 2016, substantially all actions have been completed.


2017 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND 10-K

Pension settlements

During 2017, PPG made lump-sum payments to certain retirees who had participated in PPG's U.S. qualified and non-qualified pension plans totaling approximately $127 million. As the lump-sum payments were in excess of the expected 2017 service and interest costs for the affected plans, PPG remeasured the periodic benefit obligation of these plans in the period payments were made and recorded settlement charges totaling $60 million ($38 million after-tax) during 2017.

During 2016, PPG permanently transferred approximately $1.8 billion of its U.S. and Canadian pension obligations and assets to several highly rated insurance companies. These actions triggered remeasurement and partial settlement of certain of the Company’s defined benefit pension plans. PPG recognized a $968 million pre-tax settlement charge in connection with these transactions. Refer to Note 12, "Employee Benefit Plans" in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information.

Other charges

Other charges in 2017 were lower than 2016 due to the absence of environmental charges and certain asset write-downs. In 2016, Other charges were higher than in 2015 due to environmental charges of $82 million. These charges were principally for environmental remediation at a former chromium manufacturing plant and associated sites in New Jersey.

Other income

Other income was higher in 2017 than in 2016 primarily due to the gain from the sale of the Mexican Plaka business of $25 million. Other income in 2016 was higher than in 2015 due to gains totaling $46 million resulting from the sale of a PPG legacy U.S. automotive glass and services business and a U.S. business affiliate, higher equity earnings from a 2017 acquisition of a 40% interest in a joint venture and was partially offset by the absence of certain business transaction-related gains.

Effective tax rate and earnings per diluted share, continuing operations

The effective tax rate for the year-ended

December 31, 2017

was

30.7%

and increased 3.1% from the prior year primarily due to recording the net charge triggered by the enactment of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. This charge is approximately $37 million higher than the net charge included in PPG’s fourth quarter earnings release and Form 8-K furnished on January 18, 2018, primarily due to new IRS regulations issued and refinements of management estimates.

As reported, earnings per diluted share from continuing operations for the year ended

December 31, 2017

increased year-over-year, primarily due to the absence of the pension settlement charge of $616 million after-tax recorded in 2016. Refer to the Regulation G Reconciliations - Results of Operations for additional information. The Company’s earnings per diluted share and adjusted earnings per diluted share both benefited from the 7.4 million, 10.7 million and 7.0 million shares of stock repurchased in


,


and


, respectively.

Regulation G Reconciliations - Results of Operations

PPG Industries believes investors’ understanding of the company’s operating performance is enhanced by the disclosure of net income, earnings per diluted share and the effective tax rate adjusted for certain charges. PPG’s management considers this information useful in providing insight into the company’s ongoing operating performance because it excludes the impact of items that cannot reasonably be expected to recur on a quarterly basis or that are not attributable to our primary operations. Net income and earnings per diluted share adjusted for these items are not recognized financial measures determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and should not be considered a substitute for net income or earnings per diluted share or other financial measures as computed in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In addition, adjusted net income, earnings per diluted share and the effective tax rate may not be comparable to similarly titled measures as reported by other companies.

Performance of Reportable Business Segments

Performance Coatings

2017 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K


Looking Ahead

In the first quarter 2018, we expect sales volumes in the architectural coatings - Americas and Asia Pacific business to be seasonally lower than the fourth quarter 2017. In addition, overall volume trends by customer channel are anticipated to be consistent with the fourth quarter 2017. The PPG TIMELESS® product, launched in certain HOME DEPOT® stores in 2017, is projected to continue to meet our sales targets and is being expanded to more locations during 2018. We also anticipate additional growth-related spending of up to $5 million in the first quarter to support the continued momentum in the region. The volume growth trend for architectural coatings - EMEA is expected to improve modestly in the first quarter 2018, with results remaining uneven by country. We expect continued, high end-use demand in our automotive refinish coatings business as customers continue to adopt PPG’s industry leading technologies. In aerospace coatings, we anticipate continued improvement in industry demand growth. The protective and marine coatings business is expected to perform in-line with the market in the first quarter 2018.

We expect raw material costs to remain elevated in the first-quarter 2018 at similar levels experienced in the fourth quarter. Further selling price increases in 2018 will be needed to offset more recent raw material inflation. There will be no material benefit from acquisition-related sales in the segment, and, based on mid-January exchange rates, foreign currency translation is expected to have a similar sequential favorable impact on segment sales and income in the first quarter 2018.

Due to the timing of the Easter holiday, there is one fewer ship day in the first-quarter 2018 compared to first-quarter 2017, which is expected to unfavorably impact global architectural coatings sales volumes by about $20 million to $25 million in net sales. This unfavorable impact will reverse in the second quarter.


2017 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND 10-K

Industrial Coatings

2017 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K


Looking ahead

In the first quarter of 2018, we expect global automotive industry production growth to be about 1% led by Europe and Mexico. In China, automotive production is expected to modestly decrease in the first quarter of 2018, reflecting the expiration of a small engine subsidy that had been in effect the past several years. We anticipate solid general industrial demand growth trends to continue in aggregate, but remain mixed by geography and end-use market. PPG’s market outperformance is expected to continue. In our packaging coatings business, we anticipate volume growth will continue due to the ongoing industry conversion to BPA non-intent interior can coatings, with PPG’s year-over-year growth rates continuing at an above market level in 2018. We expect acquisition-related sales to add approximately $30 million to first quarter 2018 segment sales and, based on mid-January exchange rates, foreign currency translation is expected to have a similar sequential favorable impact on segment sales and income in the first quarter 2018.

Segment margin recovery continues to be a priority for 2018. Based on recent raw material inflation, segment margin recovery is expected to continue through the first half of 2018. All businesses in the segment have made progress with selling price initiatives and additional price increases have been announced for early 2018. Also, efforts to reduce costs remain a key focus in 2018.

Review and Outlook

During 2017, economic conditions improved in all of our major geographical regions while remaining mixed by end-use market. PPG’s aggregate organic sales grew 1.5% versus the prior year and were higher in the second half of 2017 compared to the first half of 2017. Acquisition-related sales from two acquisitions completed in 2016 and the four completed in 2017 contributed over 1% to net sales growth year-over-year. Foreign currency translation was modestly favorable to net sales year-over-year. Favorable foreign currency translation experienced in the second half of 2017 slightly offset unfavorable impacts during the first half of the year. Raw material inflation rose by a mid-single-digit percentage driven mostly by supply related factors, including an unusual high number of supplier force majeure events in Europe, government mandated production curtailments in China to help improve pollution, and severe hurricanes in the U.S. In addition, oil prices moved sharply higher in the second half of the year also contributing to raw material inflation.

U.S. and Canada

During 2017, the pace of economic activity improved in the U.S. and Canada region versus the prior year, with higher industrial production despite lower automotive industry builds. Demand in the residential and commercial construction markets were modestly higher in 2017 compared to 2016. New home starts advanced about 2% in 2017 versus approximately 6% in 2016. Residential remodeling declined 1% in 2017 versus 2016, while commercial construction was flat compared to 7% growth in 2016. Market demand for architectural paint shifted more to trade paint as U.S. unemployment continued to decline. Demand in the overall U.S. DIY paint market remained soft throughout the year. PPG’s architectural coatings performance in the U.S. followed market trends with solid improvement in company-owned same store sales throughout the year. The automotive refinish coatings business benefited from higher miles driven and more congestion on the roads due to lower unemployment. PPG’s packaging coatings business continued to expand well ahead of the industry end-use market growth driven by continued strong sales growth momentum related to customer adoption of PPG’s new interior can coatings technologies. Similar to 2016, PPG’s automotive OEM coatings business lagged industry demand levels due to a customer-driven market-share shift away from PPG that was offset in other regions of the world. The U.S. and Canada region remained PPG’s largest, representing approximately 43% of 2017 sales, although a smaller percentage of total sales than in the prior year.

Europe, Middle East and Africa

European economic activity improved in 2017 despite continued regional uncertainty over the United Kingdom’s exit from the European Union. Overall GDP and industrial production improved in the region. Regional demand continued to be mixed by country and end-use market. Demand for PPG’s products in several end-use markets drove the regional growth rate, including above market performance in automotive OEM coatings, aerospace coatings  and specialty coatings and materials. PPG’s architectural coatings - EMEA business sales volumes decreased year-over-year, driven by soft market demand in France and more competitive pressures in Northern and Eastern Europe.

EMEA represented approximately 30% of PPG’s 2017 sales, similar to prior year levels. Regional coatings volumes remain approximately 13% below their pre-recession levels in 2008. The modest volume recovery reflects the slow pace of economic growth in the region. PPG expects continued volume growth over time at attractive incremental margins due to significant cost structure improvements and available capacity to satisfy additional demand. In the second half of the year, the euro appreciated approximately 5% against the U.S. dollar. The British pound recovered some of its 2016 declines versus the U.S. dollar gaining about 10% from the start of 2017.


2017 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND 10-K

Asia Pacific and Latin America

The emerging regional markets of Asia Pacific and Latin America represented 27% of PPG’s 2017 sales in aggregate, 200 basis points higher than the prior year.

Asia remained the largest emerging region, with sales of approximately $2.5 billion, led by China, which continued as PPG’s second largest country by revenue. Sales volume growth in Asia was led by the Industrial Coatings segment, in part due to strong sales volume growth in general industrial and automotive OEM. These increases were partially offset by the continued demand decline in the marine shipbuilding industry.

Overall, demand in Latin America improved year-over-year, with continued above market growth in Mexico and Central America. Economic conditions modestly improved in South America, primarily led by Brazil. In Mexico, the PPG-Comex business added over 200 new concessionaire locations, and strong growth continued in the automotive industry due to the opening of new automotive assembly plants within the country in the past 18 months. Foreign currency translation turned favorable in the second half of the year, principally the Mexican peso and Chinese yuan. In Central America, the Company continued to grow organically following a 2015 acquisition to expand its presence in the architectural end-use market.

Regional Outlook

Looking ahead to 2018, we expect to continue to operate in a more balanced global growth environment. We anticipate the positive economic trends in 2017 to mostly continue. We expect economic growth rates to remain consistent with 2017 for the U.S. and Canada, Europe, and Asia Pacific regions, and we expect the Latin America region will increase its economic growth year-over-year, when compared to 2017.

We anticipate PPG’s U.S. and Canada regional growth will be led by general industrial coatings and packaging coatings, with flat automotive industry builds. We expect growth in the housing and commercial construction markets to be better than 2017.

We expect growth rates in Europe to stay at similar levels as 2017 but will remain mixed by sub-region and country. Favorable end-use market trends are expected to continue, particularly in automotive OEM coatings as industry build growth rates are anticipated to remain positive. Market demand is expected to improve in the architectural coatings business. There is greater risk to the economic environment in the U.K. as their exit from the European Union progresses.

In Asia Pacific, we expect continued industrial production growth in China as well as gains in Southeast Asia and India. In China, we see continued above global average growth with heightened risk as the Chinese economy continues to shift and rely more on domestic consumption. The regional declines in marine coatings sales volumes were less severe in the second half of 2017, and we expect a moderate recovery in sales volumes starting in the second half of 2018. Automotive build growth is expected to remain modestly positive.

In Latin America, we anticipate economic expansion will be led by Brazil and that Mexico’s economic conditions will modestly improve.

Significant other factors

During 2017, PPG finalized the divestiture of its North American fiber glass business. This is a transformational milestone for the Company as it completed the culmination of a multi-year strategic shift in the company’s business portfolio. The pre-tax cash proceeds from the sale were approximately $540 million.

In December 2016, PPG initiated a $195 million global restructuring program, with anticipated annual savings of approximately $125 million once fully implemented. The expected cost savings are broadly spread across all regions and all business units. The company achieved approximately $50 million of savings in 2017 and expects to achieve the full annualized target of $125 million by 2019. PPG will continue to aggressively manage the company’s cost structure to ensure alignment with the overall demand environment and make adjustments as required to remain competitive in the marketplace.

Raw materials are a significant input cost to the process of manufacturing coatings. PPG experiences fluctuating energy and raw material costs driven by various factors, including changes in supplier feedstock costs and inventories, global industry activity levels, foreign currency exchange rates, and global supply and demand factors. In aggregate, average raw material costs were higher in 2017 versus 2016, due to supplier force majeure, natural disasters and environmental regulation enforcement. PPG currently expects overall coatings raw material prices to increase a mid-single-digit percentage in the first half of 2018, with impacts varied by region and commodity.

In 2017, aggregate selling prices were modestly higher year-over-year, reflecting the company’s efforts to offset higher raw material costs. We expect to see further benefits from selling price actions taken in 2017 and other actions planned in 2018 to recover profit contribution margins. The Company will carefully monitor raw material costs during 2018 and assess the need for additional increases to selling prices to compensate for increases in raw material costs.

2017 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K


Pension and postretirement benefit costs, excluding settlements, curtailments and special termination benefits, totaled approximately $50 million in 2017, down approximately $70 million from 2016. In 2018, we expect pension and other postretirement benefit costs to decrease by approximately $15 million to $20 million due to strong 2017 asset performance improving the expected return on assets component of net periodic benefit cost as well as certain U.S. plan changes made in 2017.

PPG contributed $54 million to its U.S. defined benefit pension plans in 2017 and an additional $25 million in January 2018. In 2017, the Company made contributions aggregating $33 million to its non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans. In 2018, mandatory contributions to PPG’s non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans are expected to be between $20 million and $30 million.

In 2017, unfavorable foreign currency translation experienced in the first half was completely offset by favorable foreign currency translation experienced in the second half of the year. Based on mid-January 2018 exchange rates, the Company expects year-over-year favorable foreign currency translation to increase 2018 sales by $250 million to $300 million and 2018 income before income taxes by $25 million to $30 million. We expect the foreign currency translation impact to be more prevalent during the first half of 2018, due to prior year foreign exchange rate trends. The foreign currency environment continues to be volatile and the impact on 2018 net sales and income before income taxes could differ from the guidance provided above. The Company generally purchases raw materials, incurs manufacturing costs and sells finished goods in the same currency, so we typically incur only modest foreign currency transaction costs.

With the enactment of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the Company’s 2018 effective tax rate from continuing operations is expected to be in the range of 23.0% and 24.0%. This range represents the Company’s best estimate, including the new legislation, however, our estimate is subject to revision as the Company completes its assessment of the new law and as additional regulations and interpretations are issued. Other factors may affect the expected 2018 effective tax rate positively or negatively throughout the year, including changes to various statutory tax rates and regulations around the world.

Over the past four years, the Company used $3.4 billion of cash to repurchase about 33 million shares of PPG stock, including over $800 million in 2017. The Company ended the year with approximately $3.6 billion remaining under its current share repurchase authorizations. During 2017, the Company deployed approximately $325 million for acquisitions and $434 million for dividends. PPG increased its per-share dividend in July 2017, marking the 46th annual increase and the 118th consecutive year of dividend payments. The Company is committed to deploying a minimum of $2.4 billion of cash during 2018 on acquisitions and share repurchases as part of our previously communicated commitment to deploy $3.5 billion in 2017 and 2018 combined. In 2017, PPG deployed $1.1 million for acquisitions and share repurchases.

PPG ended 2017 with approximately $1.5 billion in cash and short-term investments. The Company expects continued strong cash generation in 2018.

Commitments and Contingent Liabilities, including Environmental Matters

PPG is involved in a number of lawsuits and claims, both actual and potential, including some that it has asserted against others, in which substantial monetary damages are sought. See Item 3. “Legal Proceedings” and Note 13, “Commitments and Contingent Liabilities,” under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for a description of certain of these lawsuits.

As discussed in Item 3 and Note 13, although the result of any future litigation of such lawsuits and claims is inherently unpredictable, management believes that, in the aggregate, the outcome of all lawsuits and claims involving PPG, including asbestos-related claims, will not have a material effect on PPG’s consolidated financial position or liquidity; however, any such outcome may be material to the results of operations of any particular period in which costs, if any, are recognized.

It is PPG’s policy to accrue expenses for contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Reserves for environmental contingencies are exclusive of claims against third parties and are generally not discounted. In management’s opinion, the Company operates in an environmentally sound manner and the outcome of the Company’s environmental contingencies will not have a material effect on PPG’s financial position or liquidity; however, any such outcome may be material to the results of operations of any particular period in which costs, if any, are recognized. Management anticipates that the resolution of the Company’s environmental contingencies will occur over an extended period of time.


2017 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND 10-K

The Company continues to analyze, assess and remediate the environmental issues associated with PPG’s former chromium manufacturing plant in Jersey City, N.J. and associated sites (“New Jersey Chrome”). Information will continue to be generated from the ongoing groundwater remedial investigation activities related to New Jersey Chrome and will be incorporated into a final draft remedial action work plan for groundwater expected to be submitted to the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection in 2021.

There are multiple, future events yet to occur, including further remedy selection and design, remedy implementation and execution and applicable governmental agency or community organization approvals. Considerable uncertainty exists regarding the timing of these future events for the New Jersey Chrome sites. Final resolution of these events is expected to occur over the next several years. As these events occur and to the extent that the cost estimates of the environmental remediation remedies change, the existing reserve for this environmental remediation matter will be adjusted.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

During the past three years, PPG has had sufficient financial resources to meet its operating requirements, to fund our capital spending, including acquisitions, share repurchases and pension plans and to pay increasing dividends to shareholders.

Cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments

Cash from operating activities - continuing operations

2017 vs. 2016

The $338 million increase in cash from operating activities - continuing operations, was primarily due to the absence of the prior year funding of the Pittsburgh Corning asbestos trust (the “Trust”), lower defined benefit pension contributions, lower restructuring payments and lower interest payments, partially offset by higher cash taxes paid in 2017 and higher working capital.

2016 vs. 2015

The $541 million decrease in cash from operating activities - continuing operations, was primarily due to the after-tax funding of the Trust, partially offset by lower working capital and lower defined benefit pension contributions.

Operating working capital

Operating Working Capital is a subset of total working capital and represents (1) receivables from customers, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, (2) inventories, and (3) trade liabilities. See Note 3, “Working Capital Detail” under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information related to the components of the Company’s Operating Working Capital. We believe Operating Working Capital represents the key components of working capital under the operating control of our businesses.

A key metric we use to measure our working capital management is Operating Working Capital as a percentage of sales (fourth quarter sales annualized).

2017 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K


Environmental expenditures

We expect cash outlays for environmental remediation activities in 2018 to be between $25 million and $75 million.

Defined benefit pension plan contributions

PPG contributed $54 million and $25 million to its U.S. defined benefit pension plans during 2017 and in January 2018, respectively. Some contributions to PPG’s non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans in 2017 were required by local funding requirements. PPG expects to make mandatory contributions to its non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans in the range of $20 million to $30 million in 2018. PPG may make voluntary contributions to its defined benefit pension plans in 2018 and beyond.

Asbestos settlement trust funding

In June 2016, PPG fully funded its portion of the trust that was established by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania in May 2016. PPG’s total cash obligations to fund the Trust totaled $813 million (pre-tax). All payments were applied against a previously established PPG reserve for the total asbestos trust obligation. The company utilized cash on hand for the payments, and this funding had no impact on PPG’s previously stated cash-deployment targets. Refer to Note 13, “Commitments and Contingent Liabilities” under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information.

Cash used for investing activities - continuing operations

2017 vs. 2016

The $535 million decrease in cash used for investing activities - continuing operations, was primarily due to the absence of the prior year proceeds from the sale of the flat glass business, European fiber glass business and two Asian joint ventures, as well as lower capital expenditures, including business acquisitions, partially offset by the current year proceeds from the sale of the North American fiber glass business.

2016 vs. 2015

The $821 million increase in cash from investing activities - continuing operations, was primarily due to the proceeds received from the divestiture of the flat glass business, European fiber glass business and two Asian joint ventures, partially offset by lower cash received from the maturity of short-term investments.

Capital expenditures, including business acquisitions

(1)     Includes modernization and productivity improvements, expansion of existing businesses and environmental control projects.

(2)     Excluding cash acquired, business acquisitions totaled $332 million, $362 million, and $440 million in


,


and


, respectively.

Capital expenditures related to modernization and productivity improvements, expansion of existing businesses and environmental control projects is expected to be in the range of 2.5% to 3.0% of sales during 2018.

A primary focus for the Company in 2018 will continue to be cash deployment focused on profitable income growth, including pursuing opportunities for additional strategic acquisitions.


2017 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND 10-K

Cash proceeds from divestitures

In September 2017, PPG completed the sale of its North American fiber glass business to Nippon Electric Glass Co. and received approximately $540 million in pre-tax cash proceeds.

During 2016, PPG finalized the sale of its flat glass business and several other businesses and business affiliates. The Company received total pre-tax cash proceeds of approximately $1.1 billion from these business divestitures. Refer to Note   2, “Acquisitions and Divestitures” under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information.

Cash used for financing activities - continuing operations

2017 vs. 2016

The $744 million increase in cash used for financing activities - continuing operations, was primarily due to repayment of long term debt and higher dividends in 2017, partially offset by issuance of long term debt in 2016 and lower net purchases of treasury stock year-over-year.

2016 vs. 2015

The $398 million increase in cash used for financing activities - continuing operations, was primarily due to higher dividends in 2016, higher net purchases of treasury stock year-over-year, lower net issuance of long term debt in 2016, partially offset by lower taxes withheld for share-based payments.

Share repurchase activity

We anticipate completing additional share repurchases during 2018. The Company has approximately $3.6 billion remaining under the current authorizations from the Board of Directors, the latest of which was approved in December 2017. The current authorized repurchase programs have no expiration date.

Dividends paid to shareholders

PPG has paid uninterrupted annual dividends since 1899, and 2017 marked the 46th consecutive year of increased annual per-share dividend payments to shareholders. The Company raised its per-share dividend by 13% to $0.45 per share in July 2017.

Debt issued and repaid

The ratio of total debt, including capital leases, to total debt and equity was 43% at December 31, 2017 down from 47% in 2016.

2017 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K


Credit agreements and lines of credit

In December 2015, PPG entered into a five-year credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) with several banks and financial institutions as further discussed in Note 8, “Borrowings and Lines of Credit” under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. The Credit Agreement provides for a $1.8 billion unsecured revolving credit facility. The Credit Agreement will terminate on December 18, 2020. During the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, there were no borrowings outstanding under the existing or the prior Credit Agreement.

In addition to the amounts available under the lines of credit, the Company has an automatic shelf registration statement on file with the SEC pursuant to which it may issue, offer and sell from time to time on a continuous or delayed basis any combination of securities in one or more offerings.

See Note 8, “Borrowings and Lines of Credit,” under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for information regarding notes entered into and repaid as well as details regarding the use and availability of committed and uncommitted lines of credit, letters of credit, guarantees and debt covenants.

Contractual obligations

We continue to believe that our cash on hand and short term investments, cash from operations and the Company’s access to capital markets will continue to be sufficient to fund our operating activities, capital spending, acquisitions, dividend payments, debt service, share repurchases, contributions to pension plans, and PPG’s significant contractual obligations. These significant contractual obligations are presented in the following table.

(1)

Includes interest on all outstanding debt.

(2)

Includes the high end of the range of the expected mandatory pension contributions for 2018 only and U.S. contributions made in January 2018, as PPG is unable to estimate the pension contributions beyond 2018.

(3)

The unconditional purchase commitments are principally take-or-pay obligations related to the purchase of certain materials, including industrial gases and electricity, consistent with customary industry practice.

Other liquidity matters

On December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Act”) which, among other things lowered the U.S. corporate statutory income tax rate from 35% to 21%, eliminated certain deductible items and added other deductible items for corporations, imposed a tax on unrepatriated foreign earnings and eliminated U.S. taxes on most future foreign earnings. In December 2017, the Company recorded a net tax charge of $134 million related to the Act. The net charge consists of the  tax on unrepatriated foreign earnings of approximately $250 million and a charge of approximately $125 million related to the remeasurement of PPG’s U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities at the new enacted statutory rate. These charges were partially offset by a benefit from the reversal of an existing deferred tax liability on repatriated foreign earnings of approximately $150 million and a benefit resulting from PPG’s decision to accelerate recognition of certain U.S. tax attributes during the fourth quarter.

This net charge is $37 million higher than the net charge included in PPG’s fourth quarter earnings release and Form 8-K furnished on January 18, 2018, primarily due to new IRS regulations issued and refinements of management estimates. The net charge recorded as a provisional amount as of December 31, 2017 represents the Company’s best estimate using information available as of February 1, 2018. The Company anticipates U.S. regulatory agencies will issue further regulations during 2018, which may alter this estimate. The Company is still evaluating among other things, its position with respect to permanent reinvestment of foreign earnings overseas and other related outside basis difference considerations and the amount of tax owed on unrepatriated earnings by subsidiaries. The Company believes its remeasurement of the U.S deferred tax assets and liabilities is complete, except for changes in estimates that can result from finalizing the filing of our 2017 U.S.


2017 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND 10-K

income tax return, which are not anticipated to be material, and changes that may be a direct impact of other provisional amounts recorded due to the enactment of the Act. The Company will refine its estimates to incorporate new or better information as it comes available through the filing date of its 2017 U.S. income tax returns in the fourth quarter of 2018.

The tax owed by PPG on its unrepatriated foreign earnings is payable over eight years and is subject to a prescriptive calculation to determine the portion payable in 2018 and beyond. PPG’s current estimate, using this prescriptive method, indicates its tax payable will be increased by approximately $1 million to $3 million per year through 2025.  As such, the portion of the tax on unrepatriated foreign earnings not payable within the next 12 months is presented within “Other liabilities” on the consolidated balance sheet.

The Company currently expects its 2018 on-going effective tax rate from continuing operations to be in the range of 23% to 24%.

At December 31, 2017, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions, including an accrual of related interest and penalties along with positions only impacting the timing of tax benefits, was $163 million. The timing of payments will depend on the progress of examinations with tax authorities. PPG does not expect a significant tax payment related to these obligations within the next year. The Company is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate as to when any significant cash settlements with taxing authorities may occur.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

The Company’s off-balance sheet arrangements include the operating leases and unconditional purchase commitments disclosed in the “Liquidity and Capital Resources” section in the contractual obligations table as well as letters of credit and guarantees as discussed in Note 8, “Borrowings and Lines of Credit,” under Item 8 of this Form 10-K.

Critical Accounting Estimates

Management has evaluated the accounting policies used in the preparation of the financial statements and related notes presented under Item 8 of this Form 10-K and believes those policies to be reasonable and appropriate. We believe that the most critical accounting estimates made in the preparation of our financial statements are those related to accounting for contingencies, under which we accrue a loss when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated, and to accounting for pensions, other postretirement benefits, business combinations, goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives because of the importance of management judgment in making the estimates necessary to apply these policies.

Contingencies

Contingencies, by their nature, relate to uncertainties that require management to exercise judgment both in assessing the likelihood that a liability has been incurred as well as in estimating the amount of potential loss. The most important contingencies impacting our financial statements are those related to the collectability of accounts receivable, to environmental remediation, to pending, impending or overtly threatened litigation against the Company and to the resolution of matters related to open tax years. For more information on these matters, see Note 3, “Working Capital Detail,” Note 11, “Income Taxes” and Note 13, “Commitments and Contingent Liabilities” under Item 8 of this Form 10-K.

Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans

Accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits involves estimating the cost of benefits to be provided well into the future and attributing that cost over the time period each employee works. To accomplish this, we make extensive use of assumptions about inflation, investment returns, mortality, turnover, medical costs and discount rates. The Company has established a process by which management reviews and selects these assumptions annually. See Note 12, “Employee Benefit Plans,” under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for information on these plans and the assumptions used.

Business Combinations

In accordance with the accounting guidance for business combinations, the Company uses the acquisition method of accounting to allocate costs of acquired businesses to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the dates of acquisition. The excess costs of acquired businesses over the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recognized as goodwill. The valuations of the acquired assets and liabilities will impact the determination of future operating results. In addition to using management estimates and negotiated amounts, the Company uses a variety of information sources to determine the estimated fair values of acquired assets and liabilities including: third-party appraisals for the estimated value and lives of identifiable intangible assets and property, plant and equipment; third-party actuaries for the estimated obligations of defined benefit pension plans and similar benefit obligations; and legal counsel or other experts to assess the obligations associated with legal, environmental and other contingent liabilities. The business and technical judgment of management was used in determining wh

ich intangible assets have indefinite lives and in

2017 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K


determining the useful lives of finite-lived intangible assets in accordance with the accounting guidance for goodwill and other intangible assets.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets

The Company tests indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill for impairment annually by either performing a qualitative evaluation or a quantitative test. The qualitative evaluation is an assessment of factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair values of a reporting unit or asset is less than its carrying amount. Fair values under the quantitative test are estimated using discounted cash flow methodologies that are based on projections of the amounts and timing of future revenues and cash flows. For more information on these matters, see Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” under Item 8 of this Form 10-K.

We believe that the amounts recorded in the financial statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K related to these contingencies, pensions, other postretirement benefits, business combinations, goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives are based on the best estimates and judgments of the appropriate PPG management, although actual outcomes could differ from our estimates.

Currency

Comparing exchange rates from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017, the U.S. dollar weakened against the currencies in most countries in which PPG operates, most notably the Mexican peso, British pound, Chinese yuan and euro. As a result, consolidated net assets at December 31, 2017 increased by approximately $231 million from December 31, 2016.

Comparing exchange rates from December 31, 2015 to December 31, 2016, the U.S. dollar strengthened against the currencies in most countries in which PPG operates, most notably the Mexican peso, British pound, Chinese yuan and euro. As a result, consolidated net assets at December 31, 2016 decreased by approximately $465 million from December 31, 2015.

Comparing exchange rates during 2017 to those of 2016, in the countries in which PPG operates, the U.S. dollar was stronger overall, which had an unfavorable impact of approximately $7 million on full year 2017 income before income taxes from the translation of this foreign income into U.S. dollars.

Comparing exchange rates during 2016 to those of 2015, in the countries in which PPG operates, the U.S. dollar was stronger overall, which had an unfavorable impact of approximately $70 million on full year 2016 income before income taxes from the translation of this foreign income into U.S. dollars.

Forward-Looking Statements

The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor for forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of the Company. Management’s Discussion and Analysis and other sections of this Annual Report contain forward-looking statements that reflect the Company’s current views with respect to future events and financial performance.

You can identify forward-looking statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to current or historic facts. Forward-looking statements are identified by the use of the words “aim,” “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “estimate,” “project,” “outlook,” “forecast” and other expressions that indicate future events and trends. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made, and the Company undertakes no obligation to update any forward looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. You are advised, however, to consult any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Also, note the following cautionary statements.

Many factors could cause actual results to differ materially from the Company’s forward-looking statements. Such factors include the impacts of the natural disasters in Mexico, Puerto Rico and the U.S., and their length and severity, any currently unanticipated future impacts from the natural disasters, global economic conditions, increasing price and product competition by foreign and domestic competitors, fluctuations in cost and availability of raw materials, the ability to increase selling price, the ability to recover margins, our ability to maintain favorable supplier relationships and arrangements, the timing of and the realization of anticipated cost savings from restructuring initiatives, difficulties in integrating acquired businesses and achieving expected synergies therefrom, economic and political conditions in the markets we serve, the ability to penetrate existing, developing and emerging foreign and domestic markets, foreign exchange rates and fluctuations in such rates, fluctuations in tax rates, the impact of future legislation, the impact of environmental regulations, unexpected business disruptions and the unpredictability of existing and possible future litigation. However, it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors.

Consequently, while the list of factors presented here and under Item 1A is considered representative, no such list should be considered to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties. Unlisted factors may present significant additional obstacles to the realization of forward-looking statements.


2017 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND 10-K

Consequences of material differences in the results compared with those anticipated in the forward-looking statements could include, among other things, lower sales or income, business disruption, operational problems, financial loss, legal liability to third parties, other factors set forth in Item 1A of this Form 10-K and similar risks, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

PPG is exposed to market risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and was exposed to changes in PPG’s stock price. The Company may enter into derivative financial instrument transactions in order to manage or reduce these market risks. A detailed description of these exposures and the Company’s risk management policies are provided in Note 9, “Financial Instruments, Hedging Activities and Fair Value Measurements,” under Item 8 of this Form 10-K.

The following disclosures summarize PPG’s exposure to market risks and information regarding the use of and fair value of derivatives employed to manage its exposure to such risks. Quantitative sensitivity analyses have been provided to reflect how reasonably possible, unfavorable changes in market rates can impact PPG’s consolidated results of operations, cash flows and financial position.

Foreign Currency Risk

We conduct operations in many countries around the world. Our results of operations are subject to both currency transaction and currency translation risk. Foreign currency forward contracts outstanding during


and


were generally designated as a hedge of PPG’s exposure to foreign currency transaction risk. As of

December 31, 2017

and


, the fair value of these contracts was a net liability of $19 million and a net asset of $16 million, respectively. The potential reduction in PPG’s income from continuing operations resulting from the impact of adverse changes in exchange rates on the fair value of its outstanding foreign currency hedge contracts of 10% for European and Canadian currencies and 20% for Asian and Latin American currencies for the years ended

December 31, 2017

and


would have been $255 million and $105 million, respectively.

As of

December 31, 2017

and


, PPG had U.S. dollar to Euro cross currency swap contracts with a total notional amount of $560 million outstanding. As of

December 31, 2017

and


, the fair value of these contracts was a net asset of $2 million and $65 million, respectively. A 10% increase in the value of the Euro to the U.S. dollar would have had an unfavorable effect on the fair value of these swap contracts by reducing the value of these instruments by $58 million and by $54 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

As of

December 31, 2017

and


, PPG had non-U.S. dollar denominated debt outstanding of $2.8 billion and $3.1 billion, respectively. A weakening of the U.S. dollar by 10% against European currencies and by 20% against Asian and South American currencies would have resulted in unrealized translation losses of $314 million and $344 million as of

December 31, 2017

and


, respectively.

Interest Rate Risk

The Company manages its interest rate risk by balancing its exposure to fixed and variable rates while attempting to minimize its interest costs. A 10% increase in interest rates in the U.S., Canada, Mexico and Europe and a 20% increase in interest rates in Asia and South America would have an insignificant effect on PPG’s variable rate debt obligations and interest expense for the years ended

December 31, 2017

and


, respectively. Further, a 10% reduction in interest rates would have increased the present value of the Company’s fixed rate debt by approximately $61 million and $65 million as of

December 31, 2017

and


, respectively; however, such changes would not have had an effect on PPG’s annual income from continuing operations or cash flows.

Equity Price Risk

In prior years, PPG entered into equity forward arrangements to hedge the Company’s exposure to changes in the fair value of its future obligation to contribute PPG stock to the Trust (see Note 9, “Financial Instruments, Hedging Activities and Fair Value Measurements” and Note 13, “Commitments and Contingent Liabilities,” under Item 8 of this Form 10-K). In June 2016, PPG satisfied its funding obligation to the Trust and the equity forward arrangements were settled. At settlement, the aggregated fair value of the equity forward arrangements was an asset of $258 million.

Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of PPG Industries, Inc.

Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of PPG Industries, Inc. and its subsidiaries

as of December 31, 2017 and 2016,

and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2017, including the related notes and schedule of valuation and qualifying accounts for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2017 appearing under item 15(a)(2)(collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017, based on criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework

(2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

In our opinion, the consolidated

financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, and the results of their

operations and their

cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2017

in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017, based on criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework

(2013)

issued by the COSO.

Basis for Opinions

The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management Report on Establishing and Maintaining Adequate Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.  Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated

financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits.  We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) ("PCAOB") and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated

financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

Our audits of the consolidated

financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated

financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks.  Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated

financial statements.  Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated

financial statements.  Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.  Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Management Report

Responsibility for Preparation of the Financial Statements and Establishing and Maintaining Adequate Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

We are responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report. The consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and include amounts that are based on the best estimates and judgments of management.

We are also responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Internal control over financial reporting, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, a system of internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance and may not prevent or detect misstatements. In addition, because of changing conditions, there is risk in projecting any evaluation of internal controls to future periods.

We conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2017

. In making this evaluation, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)

. Our evaluation included reviewing the documentation of our controls, evaluating the design effectiveness of our controls and testing their operating effectiveness. Based on this evaluation we have concluded that, as of

December 31, 2017

, the Company’s internal controls over financial reporting were effective.

PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has issued their report, included on page 40 of this Form 10-K, regarding the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

of the voting stock and has the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies of the investee are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. As a result, PPG’s share of income or losses from such equity affiliates is included in the accompanying consolidated statement of income and PPG’s share of these companies’ shareholders’ equity is included in “Investments” in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. Transactions between PPG and its subsidiaries are eliminated in consolidation.

Use of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting period. Such estimates also include the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed resulting from the allocation of the purchase price related to business combinations consummated. Actual outcomes could differ from those estimates.

Revenue Recognition

The Company recognizes revenue when the earnings process is complete. Revenue is recognized by all operating segments when goods are shipped and title to inventory and risk of loss passes to the customer or when services have been rendered.

Shipping and Handling Costs

Amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling are reported in “Net sales” in the accompanying consolidated statement of income. Shipping and handling costs incurred by the Company for the delivery of goods to customers are included in “Cost of sales, exclusive of depreciation and amortization” in the accompanying consolidated statement of income.

Selling, General and Administrative Costs

Amounts presented as “Selling, general and administrative” in the accompanying consolidated statement of income are comprised of selling, customer service, distribution and advertising costs, as well as the costs of providing corporate-wide functional support in such areas as finance, law, human resources and planning. Distribution costs pertain to the movement and storage of finished goods inventory at company-owned and leased warehouses and other distribution facilities.

Advertising Costs

Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and totaled

$313 million

, $

322 million

and $

324 million

in


,


and


, respectively.

Research and Development

Research and development costs, which consist primarily of employee related costs, are charged to expense as incurred.

Legal Costs

Legal costs, primarily include costs associated with acquisition and divestiture transactions, general litigation, environmental regulation compliance, patent and trademark protection and other general corporate purposes, are charged to expense as incurred.

Foreign Currency Translation

The functional currency of most significant non-U.S. operations is their local currency. Assets and liabilities of those operations are translated into U.S. dollars using year-end exchange rates; income and expenses are translated using the average exchange rates for the reporting period. Unrealized foreign currency translation gains and losses are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive loss, a separate component of shareholders’ equity.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

Cash Equivalents

Cash equivalents are highly liquid investments (valued at cost, which approximates fair value) acquired with an original maturity of three months or less.

Short-term Investments

Short-term investments are highly liquid, high credit quality investments (valued at cost plus accrued interest) that have stated maturities of greater than three months to one year. The purchases and sales of these investments are classified as investing activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows.

Marketable Equity Securities

The Company’s investment in marketable equity securities is recorded at fair market value and reported in “Other current assets” and “Investments” in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet with changes in fair market value recorded in income for those securities designated as trading securities and in other comprehensive income, net of tax, for those securities designated as available for sale.

Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Most U.S. inventories are stated at cost, using the last-in, first-out (“LIFO”) method of accounting, which does not exceed net realizable value. All other inventories are stated at cost, using the first-in, first-out (“FIFO”) method of accounting, which does not exceed net realizable value. PPG determines cost using either average or standard factory costs, which approximate actual costs, excluding certain fixed costs such as depreciation and property taxes. See Note 3, “Working Capital Detail” for further information concerning the Company’s inventory.

Derivative Financial Instruments

The Company recognizes all derivative financial instruments (a “derivative”) as either assets or liabilities at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the use of the instrument.

For a derivative that is considered “effective” as a hedge of an exposure to variability in expected future cash flows (cash flow hedge), the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative is recorded in other comprehensive income (“OCI”) and the ineffective portion, if any, is reported in income from continuing operations. Amounts accumulated in OCI are reclassified into income from continuing operations in the same period or periods during which the hedged transactions are recorded in income from continuing operations.

For a derivative that is considered “effective” as a hedge of an exposure to changes in the fair value (fair value hedge) of an asset, a liability or a firm commitment, the change in the derivative’s fair value is reported in income from continuing operations, offsetting the gain or loss recognized for the change in fair value of the asset, liability, or firm commitment that is being hedged.

For a derivative, debt or other financial instrument that is considered “effective” as a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation, the gain or loss associated with the financial instrument is reported as a translation gain or loss in accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”). Gains and losses in AOCI related to hedges of the Company’s net investments in foreign operations are reclassified out of AOCI and recognized in income from continuing operations upon a substantial liquidation, sale or partial sale of such investments or upon impairment of all or a portion of such investments. The cash flow impact of these instruments have been and will be classified as investing activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows.

Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments not designated as hedges for hedge accounting purposes are recognized in income from continuing operations in the period of change.

Property, Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment is recorded at cost. Depreciation is computed on a straight-line method based on the estimated useful lives of related assets. Additional depreciation expense is recorded when facilities or equipment are subject to abnormal economic conditions or obsolescence.

The cost of significant improvements that add to productive capacity or extend the lives of properties are capitalized. Costs for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred. When a capitalized asset is retired or otherwise disposed of, the original cost and related accumulated depreciation balance are removed from the accounts and any related gain or loss is recorded in income from continuing operations. The amortization cost of capitalized leased assets is recorded in depreciation expense. Property and other long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. See Note 4, “Property, Plant and Equipment” for further details.

2017 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K


Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

Goodwill and Identifiable Intangible Assets

Goodwill represents the excess of the cost over the fair value of acquired identifiable tangible and intangible assets less liabilities assumed from acquired businesses. Identifiable intangible assets acquired in business combinations are recorded based upon their fair value at the date of acquisition.

The Company tests goodwill of each reporting unit for impairment at least annually in connection with PPG’s strategic planning process. The Company tests goodwill for impairment by either performing a qualitative evaluation or a quantitative test. The qualitative evaluation is an assessment of factors, including reporting unit specific operating results as well as industry, market and general economic conditions, to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair values of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. The Company may elect to bypass this qualitative assessment for some or all of its reporting units and perform a quantitative test. The quantitative goodwill impairment test is performed during the fourth quarter by comparing the estimated fair value of the associated reporting unit as of September 30 to its carrying value. The Company’s reporting units are its operating segments. (See Note 19, “Reportable Business Segment Information,” for further information concerning the Company’s operating segments.) Fair value is estimated using discounted cash flow methodologies.

The Company has determined that certain acquired trademarks have indefinite useful lives. The Company tests the carrying value of these trademarks for impairment at least annually, or as needed whenever events and circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. The annual assessment takes place in the fourth quarter of each year either by completing a qualitative assessment or quantitatively by comparing the estimated fair value of each trademark as of September 30 to its carrying value. Fair value is estimated by using the relief from royalty method (a discounted cash flow methodology). The qualitative assessment includes consideration of factors, including revenue relative to the asset being assessed, the operating results of the related business as well as industry, market and general economic conditions, to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the asset is less than its carrying amount.

Identifiable intangible assets with finite lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives (


to


years) and are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable.

Receivables and Allowances

All trade receivables are reported on the balance sheet at the outstanding principal adjusted for any allowance for credit losses and any charge offs. The Company provides an allowance for doubtful accounts to reduce receivables to their estimated net realizable value when it is probable that a loss will be incurred. Those estimates are based on historical collection experience, current economic and market conditions, a review of the aging of accounts receivable and the assessments of current creditworthiness of customers.

Product Warranties

The Company accrues for product warranties at the time the associated products are sold based on historical claims experience. The reserve, pre-tax charges against income and cash outlays for product warranties were not significant to the consolidated financial statements of the Company for any year presented.

Asset Retirement Obligations

An asset retirement obligation represents a legal obligation associated with the retirement of a tangible long-lived asset that is incurred upon the acquisition, construction, development or normal operation of that long-lived asset. PPG recognizes asset retirement obligations in the period in which they are incurred, if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The asset retirement obligation is subsequently adjusted for changes in fair value. The associated estimated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long-lived asset and depreciated over its useful life. PPG’s asset retirement obligations are primarily associated with the retirement or closure of certain assets used in PPG’s manufacturing process. The accrued asset retirement obligation recorded on PPG’s balance sheet was

$19 million

and

$18 million

as of

December 31, 2017

and


, respectively.

PPG’s only conditional asset retirement obligation relates to the possible future abatement of asbestos contained in certain PPG production facilities. The asbestos in PPG’s production facilities arises from the application of normal and customary building practices in the past when the facilities were constructed. This asbestos is encapsulated in place and, as a result, there is no current legal requirement to abate it. Inasmuch as there is no requirement to abate, the Company does not have any current plans or an intention to abate and therefore the timing, method and cost of future abatement, if any, are not known. The Company has not recorded an asset retirement obligation associated with asbestos abatement, given the uncertainty concerning the timing of future abatement, if any.

Reclassifications

Certain reclassifications of prior years’ data have been made to conform to the current year presentation. These reclassifications had no impact on our previously reported net income, cash flows or shareholders’ equity.

Accounting Standards Adopted in


PPG’s adoption of the following accounting standard updates (“ASU”) in 2017 did not have a material impact on PPG's consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows:

Accounting Standards to be Adopted in Future Years

In February 2018, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU No. 2018-2, “Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income.” This ASU allows a reclassification from Accumulated other comprehensive income to Retained earnings for stranded tax effects resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 and for interim periods therein. Early adoption of this ASU is permitted. PPG does not believe this ASU will have a material impact on its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-12, "Derivatives and Hedging - Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities." This ASU modifies the presentation and disclosure of hedging results. Further, it provides partial relief on the timing of certain aspects of hedge documentation and eliminates the requirement to recognize hedge ineffectiveness separately in income. The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 and for interim periods therein. Early adoption of this ASU is permitted. PPG does not believe this ASU will have a material impact on its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

In May 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-09, "Stock Compensation - Scope of Modification Accounting." This ASU requires all equity award modifications to be accounted for as a modification unless the fair value, vesting conditions and classification of the award as equity or liability are the same as the classification of the original award immediately before the original award is modified. The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 and for interim periods therein. PPG does not believe this ASU will have a material impact on its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-07, "Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost." This ASU requires the service cost component of net benefit costs to be disaggregated from all other components and be reported in the same line item or items as other compensation costs. The other components of net benefit cost are required to be presented in the income statement separately from the service cost. The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 and for interim periods therein. PPG does not believe this ASU will have a material impact on its consolidated financial position, results of operation or cash flows. Beginning January 1, 2018, in connection with the adoption of this new ASU, PPG will change the method by which pension costs are allocated to its strategic business units. Namely, only service costs will be attributed to the strategic business units and all other components will remain in unallocated corporate overhead. PPG will recast its statement of operations and segment income for this change in allocation.

In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, "Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments." This ASU addresses eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of eliminating the existing diversity in practice. The amendments in this ASU are effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 and for interim periods therein. PPG does not believe this ASU will have a material impact on its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, “Financial Instruments - Credit Losses.” This ASU requires an organization to measure all expected credit losses for financial assets held at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Financial institutions and other organizations will now use forward-looking information to better inform their credit loss estimates. The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019 and for interim periods therein. Entities may chose to adopt the new ASU as of its fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2018. PPG does not believe this ASU will have a material impact on its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

2017 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K


Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, “Leases.” This ASU requires all lessees to recognize on the balance sheet right to use assets and lease liabilities for the rights and obligations created by lease arrangements with terms greater than 12 months. The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 and for interim periods therein. PPG is in the process of assessing the impact the adoption of this ASU will have on its consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. At a minimum, total assets and total liabilities will increase in the period the ASU is adopted. Early adoption of this ASU is permitted. At December 31, 2017, PPG’s undiscounted future minimum payments outstanding for lease obligations were approximately

$840 million

.

In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01, “Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Liabilities.” This ASU simplifies the accounting and disclosures related to equity investments. The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 and for interim periods therein. Adoption of this ASU will not have a material impact on PPG’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Topic 606.” This ASU replaces nearly all existing U.S. GAAP guidance on revenue recognition. The standard prescribes a five-step model for recognizing revenue, the application of which will require significant judgment. The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and for interim periods therein. The provisions of this ASU may be applied retroactively or on a modified retrospective (cumulative effect) basis. PPG will adopt the standard using the modified retrospective approach in January 2018. PPG believes the preponderance of the Company’s contracts with customers are standard ship and bill arrangements where revenue is recognized at the time of shipment. Under the provisions of this ASU, PPG believes certain costs currently reported in Selling, general and administrative costs will be reclassified to Cost of sales, exclusive of depreciation and amortization on the Consolidated Statement of Income, as they represent costs incurred in satisfaction of performance obligations. In addition, PPG expects the cost of certain customer incentives to be recorded as a reduction of Net sales rather than Cost of sales, exclusive of depreciation and amortization or Selling, general and administrative costs. Adoption of this ASU will not have a significant impact on PPG’s consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

2. Acquisitions and Divestitures

Acquisitions

The Crown Group

On October 2, 2017, PPG acquired The Crown Group (“Crown”), a U.S.-based coatings application services business, which is reported as part of PPG's Industrial Coatings reportable segment. Crown is one of the leading component and product finishers in North America. Crown applies coatings to customers’ manufactured parts and assembled products at 11 U.S. sites. Most of Crown’s facilities, which also provide assembly, warehousing and sequencing services, are located at customer facilities or positioned near customer manufacturing sites. The company serves manufacturers in the automotive, agriculture, construction, heavy truck and alternative energy industries. Crown has annual sales of approximately

$125 million

.

Taiwan Chlorine Industries

Taiwan Chlorine Industries (“TCI”) was established in 1986 as a joint venture between PPG and China Petrochemical Development Corporation (“CPDC”) to produce chlorine-based products in Taiwan, at which time PPG owned 60 percent of the venture. In conjunction with the 2013 separation of its commodity chemicals business, PPG conveyed to Axiall Corporation ("Axiall") its 60% ownership interest in TCI. Under PPG’s agreement with CPDC, if certain post-closing conditions were not met following the three year anniversary of the separation, CPDC had the option to sell its 40% ownership interest in TCI to Axiall for

$100 million

. In turn, Axiall had a right to designate PPG as its designee to purchase the 40% ownership interest of CPDC. In April 2016, Axiall announced that CPDC had decided to sell its ownership interest in TCI to Axiall. In June 2016, Axiall formally designated PPG to purchase the

40%

ownership interest in TCI. In August 2016, Westlake Chemical Corporation acquired Axiall, which became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Westlake. On April 11, 2017, PPG finalized its purchase of CPDC’s 40% ownership interest in TCI. The difference between the acquisition date fair value and the purchase price of PPG’s 40% ownership interest in TCI has been recorded as a loss in discontinued operations during the year-ended December 31, 2017.

MetoKote Corporation

In July 2016, PPG completed the acquisition of MetoKote Corporation ("MetoKote"), a U.S.-based coatings application services business. MetoKote applies coatings to customers' manufactured parts and assembled products. It operates on-site coatings services within several customer manufacturing locations, as well as at regional service centers, located throughout the U.S., Canada, Mexico, the United Kingdom, Germany, Hungary and the Czech Republic. Customers ship parts to MetoKote service centers where they are treated to enhance paint adhesion and painted with electrocoat, powder or liquid coatings technologies. Coated parts are then shipped to the customer’s next stage of assembly. MetoKote coats an average of more than

1.5 million

parts per day.


2017 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND 10-K

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

The following table summarizes the estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as reflected in the final purchase price allocation for MetoKote.

(a)

The net deferred income tax liability is included in assets due to the Company's tax jurisdictional netting.

The pro-forma impact on PPG's sales and results of operations, including the pro forma effect of events that are directly attributable to the acquisition, was not significant. While calculating this impact, no cost savings or operating synergies that may result from the acquisition were included. Since the acquisition, the results of this acquired business comprise the coatings services operating segment, included within the Industrial Coatings reportable segment.

Other Acquisitions

In


,


, and


, the Company completed several smaller business acquisitions. The total consideration paid for these acquisitions, net of cash acquired, debt assumed and other post closing adjustments, was

$74 million

,

$43 million

and

$371 million

, respectively.

In January 2018, PPG acquired ProCoatings, a leading architectural paint and coatings wholesaler located in The Netherlands. ProCoatings, established in 2001, distributes a large portfolio of well-known professional paint brands through its network of 23 multi-brand stores. The company employs nearly 100 people.

Divestitures

Glass Segment

In 2017, PPG completed a multi-year strategic shift in the Company's business portfolio, resulting in the exit of all glass operations which consisted of the global fiber glass business, PPG's ownership interest in two Asian fiber glass joint ventures and the flat glass business. Accordingly, the results of operations, including the gains on the divestitures, and cash flows have been recast as discontinued operations for all periods presented. PPG now has two reportable business segments.

The net sales and income from discontinued operations related to the former Glass segment for the three years ended December 31,


,


, and


were as follows:

North American Fiber Glass Business

On September 1, 2017, PPG completed the sale of its North American fiber glass business to Nippon Electric Glass Co. Ltd. (“NEG”). Cash proceeds from the sale were

$541 million

, resulting in a pre-tax gain of

$343 million

, net of certain accruals and contingencies established in conjunction with the divestiture.

PPG’s fiber glass operations included manufacturing facilities in Chester, South Carolina, and Lexington and Shelby, North Carolina; and administrative and research-and-development operations in Shelby and in Harmar, Pennsylvania, near Pittsburgh. The business, which employed more than

1,000

people and had net sales of approximately

$350 million

in 2016, supplies the transportation, energy, infrastructure and consumer markets.

2017 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K


Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

The Company's December 31, 2016 consolidated balance sheet has been recast to present the assets and liabilities of the North American fiber glass business as held for sale. The major classes of assets and liabilities of the Glass segment included in the PPG consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2016 were as follows:

(a)

The net deferred income tax liability is included in assets held for sale due to the Company's tax jurisdictional netting.

Flat Glass Business

In October 2016, PPG completed the sale of its flat glass manufacturing and glass coatings operations to Vitro S.A.B. de C.V. PPG received approximately

$740 million

in cash proceeds and recorded a pre-tax gain of

$421 million

on the sale.  Under the terms of the agreement, PPG divested its entire flat glass manufacturing and glass coatings operations, including production sites located in Fresno, California; Salem, Oregon; Carlisle, Pennsylvania; and Wichita Falls, Texas; four distribution/fabrication facilities located across Canada; and a research-and-development center located in Harmar, Pennsylvania. PPG’s flat glass business included approximately 1,200 employees. The business manufactures glass that is fabricated into products used primarily in commercial and residential construction.

European Fiber Glass Business

In October 2016, PPG completed the sale of its European fiber glass business to glass manufacturer NEG. PPG recorded a pre-tax loss of

$42 million

, consisting predominately of a

$46 million

pension settlement charge. The European fiber glass business manufactures reinforcement materials for thermoset and thermoplastic composite applications for the transportation, energy, infrastructure and consumer markets. Manufacturing facilities in Hoogezand, Netherlands, and Wigan, England, and a research and development facility in Hoogezand were included in the transaction.

PFG Fiber Glass Joint Ventures

In November 2016, PPG sold its 50% ownership interests in its two PFG fiber glass joint ventures to its joint venture partner Nan Ya Plastics Corporation (“Nan Ya”). Nan Ya is affiliated with Taiwan-based Formosa Plastics Group. The PFG fiber glass joint ventures supply electronic yarn fibers used in integrated electronic circuit boards and fiber glass reinforcement products for automotive applications. PPG recorded a net pre-tax gain of

$36 million

on the sale.

Other Divestitures

Plaka Business

In June 2017, PPG completed the sale of the assets of its Mexico-based Plaka plasterboard and cement-board business to Knauf International GmbH and recorded a

$25 million

pre-tax gain on the sale. The Company's consolidated balance sheet presents the assets and liabilities of the Plaka business as held for sale as of December 31, 2016.

Pittsburgh Glass Works

In April 2016, PPG sold its minority ownership interest in Pittsburgh Glass Works LLC ("PGW") to LKQ Corporation concurrent with the majority partner’s sale of its ownership interest. PPG recorded a pre-tax gain on the sale of

$20 million

. PPG accounted for its interest in PGW under the equity method of accounting. PPG’s share of net earnings from PGW are reported in “Other income” in the Consolidated Statement of Income for all periods presented and have not been reclassified as discontinued operations, as the divestiture of PGW does not represent a strategic shift in PPG’s operations and PGW did not have a major impact on PPG's ongoing results of operations.

7. Business Restructuring

The Company records restructuring liabilities that represent charges incurred in connection with consolidations of certain operations, including operations from acquisitions, as well as headcount reduction programs. These charges consist primarily of severance costs and asset write-downs.

In December 2016, PPG’s Board of Directors approved a business restructuring program which includes actions necessary to reduce its global cost structure. The program is focused on certain regions and end-use markets where business conditions are the weakest, as well as reductions in production capacity and various global functional and administrative costs. A pre-tax restructuring charge of

$195 million

was recorded in December 2016, of which approximately

$136 million

represents employee severance and other cash costs and nearly

$60 million

is related to the write-down of certain assets held for sale and other non-cash costs. The restructuring actions will result in the net reduction of approximately

1,700

positions, with substantially all actions to be completed in the first half of 2018.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

2015 Activities

In December 2015, PPG entered into a five-year credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) with several banks and financial institutions. The Credit Agreement replaced the Company's Five Year Credit Agreement dated as of September 12, 2012. The Credit Agreement provides for a

$1.8 billion

unsecured revolving credit facility. The Company has the ability to increase the size of the Credit Agreement by up to an additional

$500 million

, subject to the receipt of lender commitments and other conditions. The Credit Agreement will terminate on December 18, 2020. The Company has the right, subject to certain conditions set forth in the Credit Agreement, to designate certain subsidiaries of the Company as borrowers under the Credit Agreement. In connection with any such designation, the Company is required to guarantee the obligations of any such subsidiaries under the Credit Agreement. There were no amounts outstanding under the Credit Agreement during the years ended

December 31, 2017

and 2016. The available borrowing rate on a one month, U.S. dollar denominated borrowing was

2.56%

at

December 31, 2017

.

Borrowings under the Credit Agreement may be made in U.S. dollars or in euros. The Credit Agreement provides that loans will bear interest at rates based, at the Company’s option, on one of two specified base rates plus a margin based on certain formulas defined in the Credit Agreement. Additionally, the Credit Agreement contains a Commitment Fee, as defined in the Credit Agreement, on the amount of unused commitments under the Credit Agreement ranging from

0.080%

to

0.225%

per annum. The average Commitment Fee in


was

0.09%

, and PPG is committed to pay

0.09%

in


.

The Credit Agreement also supports the Company’s commercial paper borrowings. There were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2017 and 2016.

The Credit  Agreement contains usual and customary restrictive covenants for facilities of its type, which include, with specified exceptions, limitations on the Company’s ability to create liens or other encumbrances, to enter into sale and leaseback transactions and to enter into consolidations, mergers or transfers of all or substantially all of its assets. The Credit  Agreement maintains the same restrictive covenant as the prior credit agreement whereby the Company must maintain a ratio of Total Indebtedness to Total Capitalization, as defined in the Credit Agreement, of

60%

or less. As of

December 31, 2017

, total indebtedness was

41%

of the Company’s total capitalization.

The Credit Agreement also contains customary events of default, including the failure to make timely payments when due under the Credit Agreement or other material indebtedness, the failure to satisfy covenants contained in the Credit Agreement, a change in control of the Company and specified events of bankruptcy and insolvency that would permit the lenders to accelerate the repayment of any loans.

In June 2015, PPG’s

€300 million

3.875%

notes matured and the Company repaid these obligations using

$336 million

of cash on hand.

In March 2015, PPG completed a public offering of

€600 million

0.875%

notes due 2022 and

€600 million

1.400%

Notes due 2027, or

€1.2 billion

(

$1.26 billion

) in aggregate principal amount.  These notes were issued pursuant to PPG’s existing shelf registration statement and pursuant to an indenture between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee, as supplemented. The Indenture governing these notes contains covenants that limit the Company’s ability to, among other things, incur certain liens securing indebtedness, engage in certain sale-leaseback transactions, and enter into certain consolidations, mergers, conveyances, transfers or leases of all or substantially all the Company’s assets. The terms of these notes also require the Company to make an offer to repurchase notes upon a Change of Control Triggering Event (as defined in the Indenture) at a price equal to

101%

of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. The Company may issue additional debt from time to time pursuant to the Indenture.

The aggregate cash proceeds from the notes, net of discounts and fees, was

$1.24 billion

.  The notes are denominated in euro and have been designated as hedges of net investments in the Company’s European operations. For more information, refer to Note 9 “Financial Instruments, Hedging Activities and Fair Value Measurements.”

Restrictive Covenants and Cross-Default Provisions

As of December 31,


, PPG was in full compliance with the restrictive covenants under its various credit agreements, loan agreements and indentures.

Additionally, the Company’s Credit Agreement contains customary cross-default provisions. These provisions provide that a default on a debt service payment of

$50 million

or more for longer than the grace period provided under another agreement may result in an event of default under this agreement. The Company’s

9%

non-callable debentures also contain a customary cross default provision triggered by the Company’s default on a debt service payment of

$10 million

or more. None of the Company’s primary debt obligations are secured or guaranteed by the Company’s affiliates.

and


, respectively. The primary leased assets include paint stores, transportation equipment, warehouses and other distribution facilities, and office space, including the Company’s corporate headquarters located in Pittsburgh, Pa.

Minimum lease commitments for operating leases that have initial or remaining lease terms in excess of one year are as follows:

Lines of Credit, Letters of Credit, Surety Bonds and Guarantees

PPG’s non-U.S. operations have uncommitted lines of credit totaling

$589 million

of which

$2 million

was used as of

December 31, 2017

. These uncommitted lines of credit are subject to cancellation at any time and are generally not subject to any commitment fees.

The Company had outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds of

$163 million

and

$160 million

as of

December 31, 2017

and


, respectively. The letters of credit secure the Company’s performance to third parties under certain self-insurance programs and other commitments made in the ordinary course of business.

As of

December 31, 2017

and


, guarantees outstanding were

$14 million

and

$12 million

, respectively. The guarantees relate primarily to debt of certain entities in which PPG has an ownership interest and selected customers of certain PPG businesses. A portion of such debt is secured by the assets of the related entities. The carrying value of these guarantees were

$1 million

at

December 31, 2017

and


and the fair values of these guarantees were

$1 million

at

December 31, 2017

and


. The fair value of each guarantee was estimated by comparing the net present value of two hypothetical cash flow streams, one based on PPG’s incremental borrowing rate and the other based on the borrower’s incremental borrowing rate, as of the effective date of the guarantee. Both streams were discounted at a risk free rate of return. The Company does not believe any loss related to these letters of credit, surety bonds or guarantees is likely.

9. Financial Instruments, Hedging Activities and Fair Value Measurements

Financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, cash held in escrow, marketable equity securities, accounts receivable, company-owned life insurance, accounts payable, short-term and long-term debt instruments, and derivatives. The fair values of these financial instruments approximated their carrying values at

December 31, 2017

and


, in the aggregate, except for long-term debt instruments.

2017 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K


Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

Hedging Activities

The Company has exposure to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates and had exposure to PPG’s stock price changes. As a result, financial instruments, including derivatives, have been used to hedge these underlying economic exposures. Certain of these instruments qualify as cash flow, fair value and net investment hedges upon meeting the requisite criteria, including effectiveness of offsetting hedged or underlying exposures. Changes in the fair value of derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognized in income from continuing operations in the period incurred.

PPG’s policies do not permit speculative use of derivative financial instruments. PPG enters into derivative financial instruments with high credit quality counterparties and diversifies its positions among such counterparties in order to reduce its exposure to credit losses. The Company did not realize a credit loss on derivatives during the three-year period ended

December 31, 2017

.

All of PPG’s outstanding derivative instruments are subject to accelerated settlement in the event of PPG’s failure to meet its debt or payment obligations under the terms of the instruments’ contractual provisions. In addition, should the Company be acquired and its payment obligations under the derivative instruments’ contractual arrangements not be assumed by the acquirer, or should PPG enter into bankruptcy, receivership or reorganization proceedings, the instruments would also be subject to accelerated settlement.

In


and


, there were no derivative instruments de-designated or discontinued as a hedging instrument. There were no gains or losses deferred in AOCI that were reclassified to income from continuing operations during the three-year period ended

December 31, 2017

related to hedges of anticipated transactions that were no longer expected to occur.

Fair Value Hedges

In prior years, PPG designated certain foreign currency forward contracts as hedges against the Company’s exposure to future changes in fair value of certain firm sales commitments denominated in foreign currencies.

Prior to June 2016, PPG entered into renewable equity forward arrangements to hedge the impact to PPG's income from continuing operations for changes in the fair value of

2,777,778

shares of PPG stock that were contributed to the asbestos settlement trust as discussed in Note 13, “Commitments and Contingent Liabilities.” These financial instruments were recorded at fair value as assets or liabilities and changes in the fair value of these financial instruments are reflected in the “Asbestos settlement – net” caption of the accompanying consolidated statement of income. The total principal amount paid for these shares was approximately

$60 million

. During the terms of these equity forward arrangements, PPG paid to the counterparty interest based on the principal amount and the counterparty paid to PPG an amount equal to the dividends paid on these shares which reduced the transaction price by approximately

$10 million

, net. The difference between the principal amount and any amounts related to unpaid interest or dividends and the market price for these shares, adjusted for credit risk, represented the fair value of these financial instruments as well as the amount that PPG received when the counterparty chose to settle these financial instruments. In conjunction with the funding of the asbestos settlement trust, the equity forward arrangements were settled. At settlement, in June 2016, the fair value of the equity forward arrangement was an asset of

$258 million

.

The Company has used interest rate swaps from time to time to manage it’s exposure to changing interest rates. When outstanding, the interest rate swaps were designated as fair value hedges of certain outstanding debt obligations of the Company and were recorded at fair value. There were no interest rate swaps outstanding as of

December 31, 2017

and


. However, in prior years, PPG settled interest rate swaps and received cash. The fair value adjustment of the debt at the time the interest rate swaps were settled is still being amortized as a reduction to interest expense over the remaining term of the related debt, the impact of which is insignificant.

Cash Flow Hedges

PPG designates certain foreign currency forward contracts as cash flow hedges of the Company’s exposure to variability in exchange rates on intercompany and third party transactions denominated in foreign currencies. As of

December 31, 2017

and


, the fair value of all foreign currency forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges was a net

asset

of

$3 million

and

$13 million

, respectively.

Net Investment Hedges

PPG uses cross currency swaps, foreign currency forward contracts and euro-denominated debt to hedge a significant portion of its net investment in its European operations, as follows:

As of

December 31, 2017

and


, U.S. dollar to euro cross currency swap contracts with a total notional amount of

$560 million

were outstanding and are scheduled to expire in March 2018. On settlement of the remaining outstanding contracts, PPG will receive

$560 million

U.S. dollars and pay euros to the counterparties. During the term of these contracts, PPG


2017 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND 10-K

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

receives semiannual payments in March and September of each year based on a U.S. dollar, long-term interest rate fixed as of the contract inception date, and PPG makes annual payments in March of each year to the counterparties based on a euro, long-term interest rate fixed as of the contract inception date. As of

December 31, 2017

and


, the fair value of these contracts was an asset of

$2 million

and

$65 million

, respectively.

At

December 31, 2017

and


, PPG had designated

€2.3 billion

and

€2.8 billion

, respectively, of euro-denominated borrowings as hedges of a portion of its net investment in the Company’s European operations. The carrying value of these instruments at

December 31, 2017

and


was

$2.7 billion

and

$2.9 billion

, respectively.

During 2017,


and


, PPG used foreign currency forward contracts to hedge a portion of its net investment in its European operations. Changes in the fair value of these derivative instruments were recorded in AOCI as gains or losses. As of

December 31, 2017

,


and


, none of these contracts remained outstanding. The Company paid

$3 million

to settle a foreign currency forward contract in 2017. In 2016,

no

cash proceeds were received from the settlement of these contracts and, in 2015, PPG received cash proceeds of

$19 million

from the settlement of these contracts.

Other Financial Instruments

PPG uses foreign currency forward contracts to manage net transaction exposures that do not qualify for hedge accounting; therefore, the change in the fair value of these instruments is recorded in “Other charges” in the accompanying consolidated statement of income in the period of change. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the fair value of these contracts were a liability of

$20 million

and an asset of

$2 million

, respectively.

Gains/Losses Deferred in AOCI

As of

December 31, 2017

and


, the Company had accumulated pre-tax unrealized translation gains in AOCI related to the euro-denominated borrowings, foreign currency forward contracts, and the cross currency swaps of

$16 million

and

$482 million

, respectively.

The following tables summarize the location and amount of gains (losses) related to derivative and debt financial instruments for the years ended

Fair Value Measurements

The Company follows a fair value measurement hierarchy to measure its assets and liabilities. As of

December 31, 2017

and


, respectively, the assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis were cash equivalents, equity securities and derivatives. In addition, the Company measures its pension plan assets at fair value (see Note 12, “Employee Benefit Plans” for further details). The Company’s financial assets and liabilities are measured using inputs from the following three levels:

2017 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K


Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets and liabilities that the Company has the ability to access at the measurement date. Level 1 inputs are considered to be the most reliable evidence of fair value as they are based on unadjusted quoted market prices from various financial information service providers and securities exchanges.

Level 2 inputs are directly or indirectly observable prices that are not quoted on active exchanges, which include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. The fair values of the derivative instruments reflect the instruments’ contractual terms, including the period to maturity, and uses observable market-based inputs, including forward curves.

Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs employed for measuring the fair value of assets or liabilities. The Company does not have any recurring financial assets or liabilities that are recorded in its consolidated balance sheets as of

December 31, 2017

and


that are classified as Level 3 inputs.

Assets and liabilities reported at fair value on a recurring basis

Long-Term Debt

(a)

Excluding capital lease obligations of

$15 million

and short term borrowings of

.

(b)

Excluding capital lease obligations of

$18 million

and short term borrowings of

$99 million

as of

December 31, 2016

.

The fair values of the debt instruments were based on discounted cash flows and interest rates then currently available to the Company for instruments of the same remaining maturities and were measured using level 2 inputs.

Assets and liabilities reported at fair value on a nonrecurring basis

There were no significant adjustments to the fair value of nonmonetary assets or liabilities during the year ended

December 31, 2017

. In conjunction with the 2016 restructuring actions, certain nonmonetary assets were written down to their fair value. Refer to Note 7, “Business Restructuring” for further details associated with these actions.”

Call and put option on noncontrolling interest

PPG owns a majority interest in a coatings business whose financial results are included in PPG’s consolidated financial statements. PPG has recorded the noncontrolling interest in this consolidated affiliate as a liability instead of equity in its consolidated balance sheets due to call and put option provisions associated with the noncontrolling interest, which have similar terms. This liability was

$44 million

and

$38 million

at

December 31, 2017

and


, respectively.

2017 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K


Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

A reconciliation of the statutory U.S. corporate federal income tax rate to the Company’s effective tax rate follows:

On December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Act”) which, among other things lowered the U.S. corporate statutory income tax rate from

35%

to

21%

, eliminated certain deductible items and added other deductible items for corporations, imposed a tax on unrepatriated foreign earnings and eliminated U.S. taxes on most future foreign earnings. In December 2017, the Company recorded a net tax charge of

$134 million

related to the Act. The net charge consists of the tax on unrepatriated foreign earnings of approximately

$250 million

and a charge of approximately

$125 million

related to the remeasurement of PPG’s U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities at the new enacted statutory rate. These charges were partially offset by a benefit from the reversal of an existing deferred tax liability on repatriated foreign earnings of approximately

$150 million

and a benefit resulting from PPG’s decision to accelerate recognition of certain U.S. tax attributes during the fourth quarter.

The net charge recorded as a provisional amount as of December 31, 2017 represents the Company’s best estimate using information available as of February 1, 2018. The Company anticipates U.S. regulatory agencies will issue further regulations during 2018, which may alter this estimate. The Company is still evaluating among other things, its position with respect to permanent reinvestment of foreign earnings overseas and other related outside basis difference considerations and the amount of tax owed on unrepatriated earnings by subsidiaries. The Company believes its remeasurement of the U.S deferred tax assets and liabilities is complete, except for changes in estimates that can result from finalizing the filing of our 2017 U.S. income tax return, which are not anticipated to be material, and changes that may be a direct impact of other provisional amounts recorded due to the enactment of the Act. The Company will refine its estimates to incorporate new or better information as it comes available through the filing date of its 2017 U.S. income tax returns in the fourth quarter of 2018.

The tax owed by PPG on its unrepatriated foreign earnings is payable over eight years and is subject to a prescriptive calculation to determine the portion payable in 2018 and beyond. PPG’s current estimate, using this prescriptive method, indicates its tax payable will be increased by approximately

$1 million

to

$3 million

per year through 2025.  As such, the portion of the tax on unrepatriated foreign earnings not payable within the next 12 months is presented within “Other liabilities” on the consolidated balance sheet.

The total tax expense for 2017 also includes a deferred tax benefit of

$22 million

related to the

$60 million

of pre-tax pension settlement charges discussed in Note 12, “Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits.” During 2016, the Company recorded a

$151 million

net tax charge associated with the funding of the Pittsburgh Corning (“PC”) asbestos settlement trust (the “Trust”) described in Note 13, "Commitments and Contingent Liabilities." Further, in conjunction with the funding of the Trust, PPG provided taxes on the earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries and recorded one-time book tax benefits for its contribution of the Company's ownership interest in PC's European subsidiary to the Trust and for a change in the measurement of certain deferred tax liabilities.

In


and


, U.S. deferred tax on foreign earnings includes the remeasurement of a U.S. deferred tax liability to repatriate foreign earnings on which PPG has not asserted permanent reinvestment in the foreign jurisdiction.

Income (Loss) before income taxes of the Company’s U.S. operations for

2017 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND 10-K

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

Deferred income taxes

Deferred income taxes are provided for the effect of temporary differences that arise because there are certain items treated differently for financial accounting than for income tax reporting purposes. The deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined by applying the enacted tax rate in the year in which the temporary difference is expected to reverse.

Net operating loss and credit carryforwards

A valuation allowance of

$170 million

and

$119 million

has been established for carry-forwards at December 31, 2017 and 2016, when the ability to utilize them is not likely.

Undistributed foreign earnings

The Company had

$3.4 billion

and

$5.3 billion

of undistributed earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. These amounts relate to approximately


subsidiaries in approximately


taxable jurisdictions. The Company estimates repatriation of undistributed earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 would have resulted in a U.S. tax cost of approximately $

30 million

(assuming tax reform) and $

350 million

, respectively.

Over the past several years, PPG has established deferred tax liabilities on certain undistributed earnings, namely in connection with divestitures and the funding of the Pittsburgh Corning Asbestos Trust (refer to Note 13, “Commitments and Contingent Liabilities”). At December 31, 2016, the expected future tax cost to repatriate these foreign earnings which were not permanently reinvested totaled

$189 million

. At December 31, 2016, no significant deferred U.S. income taxes had been provided on the remaining

$3.5 billion

of PPG’s undistributed earnings as they were considered to be reinvested for an indefinite period of time or will be repatriated when it is tax effective to do so.

In 2017, in conjunction with the enactment of the Act, PPG owes U.S. tax on substantially all unrepatriated earnings. As of December 31, 2017, the Company has provisionally not changed its intention to reinvest foreign earnings indefinitely or repatriate when it is tax effective to do so, and as such has not established a liability for foreign withholding taxes or other costs that would be incurred if the earnings were repatriated.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

Unrecognized tax benefits

The Company files federal, state and local income tax returns in numerous domestic and foreign jurisdictions. In most tax jurisdictions, returns are subject to examination by the relevant tax authorities for a number of years after the returns have been filed. The Company is no longer subject to examinations by tax authorities in any major tax jurisdiction for years before 2006. Additionally, the Internal Revenue Service has completed its examination of the Company’s U.S. federal income tax returns filed for years through 2011. The examinations of the Company’s U.S. federal income tax returns for 2012 through 2013 are currently underway.

A reconciliation of the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits (excluding interest and penalties) as of December 31 follows:

The Company expects that any reasonably possible change in the amount of unrecognized tax benefits in the next 12 months would not be significant.

The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate was

$140 million

as of December 31,


.

Interest and penalties

The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.

12. Employee Benefit Plans

Defined Benefit Plans

PPG has defined benefit pension plans that cover certain employees worldwide. The principal defined benefit pension plans are those in the U.S., Canada, the Netherlands and the U.K. These plans in the aggregate represent approximately

93%

of the projected benefit obligation at

December 31, 2017

, of which the U.S. defined benefit pension plans represent the largest component.

U.S. defined benefit plans

As of January 1, 2006, the Company closed the salaried defined benefit plans to new entrants. The defined benefit plan of certain hourly employees was closed to new entrants in 2006 or thereafter. Eligible employees participate in a defined contribution retirement plan. In 2011, the Company approved amendments related to certain U.S. defined benefit plans so that depending upon the affected employee’s combined age and years of service to PPG, certain employees stopped or will stop accruing benefits either during 2011 or in 2020. The affected employees will participate in the Company’s defined contribution retirement plans from the date their benefits under their respective defined benefit plans are frozen. The Company has amended other defined benefit plans in other countries in a similar way and plans to continue reviewing and potentially changing other PPG defined benefit plans in the future.

U.S. pension annuity contracts

In June 2016, the Company entered into a Definitive Purchase Agreement by and among the Company, Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company (“MassMutual”) and State Street Bank & Trust Company (“State Street”), as independent fiduciary to the Company’s United States defined benefit pension plans (the “Plans”), and a Definitive Purchase Agreement by and among the Company, Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (“MetLife”) and State Street. In August 2016, pursuant to the

two

Definitive Purchase Agreements, the Plans purchased group annuity contracts that irrevocably transferred to the


2017 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND 10-K

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

two

insurance companies certain pension benefit obligations for approximately

13,200

of the Company’s retirees in the United States who started receiving their monthly retirement benefit payments on or before April 1, 2016. The value of the benefit obligation of each affected former salaried employee’s retirement benefit obligation is irrevocably guaranteed by, and split equally between, MassMutual and MetLife. Pursuant to these Definitive Purchase Agreements, MassMutual serves as the lead administrator. The value of each affected former hourly employee’s retirement benefit obligation is irrevocably guaranteed by MetLife, and MetLife will serve as the administrator. The amount of each affected retiree’s annuity payment is equal to the amount of such individual’s pension benefit. The purchase of group annuity contracts was funded directly by the assets of the Plans. By irrevocably transferring the obligations and assets to MassMutual and MetLife, the Company reduced its overall pension projected benefit obligation by approximately

$1.6 billion

and recognized a non-cash pension settlement charge of approximately

$535 million

after-tax (

$857 million

pre-tax).

Following the transfer of the aforementioned U.S. retiree obligations and assets to third party insurers, PPG contributed

$29 million

and

$146 million

to its U.S. plans in 2017 and 2016, respectively. These contributions were funded using cash on hand.

During 2016, as a result of the purchase of group annuity contracts, PPG merged two of its qualified defined benefit pension plans that contained retired plan participants into one surviving plan. In conjunction with the merger and purchase of group annuity contracts, PPG remeasured its qualified pension plan benefit obligations using prevailing discount rates as of July 31, 2016 which averaged

3.6%

as compared to a

4.5%

discount rate as of December 31, 2015. The remeasurement increased the Company's cumulative pension benefit obligation of its remaining plans by

$306 million

and increased the Company's full year 2016 qualified defined benefit pension expense by approximately

$10 million

.

Canadian pension annuity contracts

In 2016, the Company purchased group annuity contracts that transferred pension benefit obligations for certain of the Company’s retirees and terminated vested participants in Canada who started receiving their monthly retirement benefit payments on or before April 1, 2016 to Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada (“Sun Life”) and The Canada Life Assurance Company (“Canada Life”). The amount of each affected retiree’s annuity payment is equal to the amount of such individual’s pension benefit. The purchase of group annuity contracts was funded directly by the assets of the Canadian plans. By transferring the obligations and assets to Sun Life and Canada Life, the Company reduced its overall pension projected benefit obligation by approximately

$200 million

and recognized a non-cash pension settlement charge of

$47 million

after-tax (

$64 million

pre-tax). The Company made voluntary contributions aggregating

$7 million

to the Canadian plans in 2016 related to the pension annuity contracts. These contributions were funded using cash on hand.

Sale of the flat glass business

In 2016, PPG completed the sale of its flat glass business as discussed in Note 2, “Acquisitions and Divestitures.” PPG transferred to Vitro certain defined benefit pension liabilities resulting in a settlement charge of

$11 million

which is included in the net gain on the sale of the flat glass business. This transaction lowered the projected benefit obligation of PPG’s defined benefit pension plan by approximately

$100 million

. PPG transferred pension assets of

$55 million

in 2016 in connection with the sale and expects to transfer an additional

$5 million

to

$10 million

of pension assets in 2018.

Sale of the European fiber glass business

In 2016, PPG completed the sale of its European fiber glass business as discussed in Note 2, “Acquisitions and Divestitures.” PPG transferred to NEG certain defined benefit pension liabilities resulting in a net settlement charge of

$46 million

. This amount is included in Income from discontinued operations, net of tax in 2016.This transaction lowered the projected benefit obligation of PPG’s defined benefit pension plans by approximately

$340 million

. PPG transferred pension assets of approximately

$250 million

in connection with the sale.

Postretirement medical

PPG sponsors welfare benefit plans that provide postretirement medical and life insurance benefits for certain U.S. and Canadian employees and their dependents of which the U.S. welfare benefit plans represent approximately

85%

of the projected benefit obligation at December 31, 2017. Salaried and certain hourly employees in the U.S. hired on or after October 1, 2004, or rehired on or after October 1, 2012 are not eligible for postretirement medical benefits.

The U.S. welfare benefit plans include an Employee Group Waiver Plan (“EGWP”) for certain Medicare-eligible retirees and their dependents which includes a fully-insured Medicare Part D prescription drug plan. As such, PPG is not eligible to receive the federal subsidy provided under the Medicare Act of 2003 for these retirees and their dependents.

These plans in the U.S. and Canada require retiree contributions based on retiree-selected coverage levels for certain retirees and their dependents and provide for sharing of future benefit cost increases between PPG and participants based on management discretion. The Company has the right to modify, amend or terminate certain of these benefit plans in the future.

2017 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K


Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

In 2016, the Company communicated plan design changes to certain Medicare-eligible retiree plan participants. Effective January 1, 2017, the Company-sponsored Medicare-eligible plans were replaced by a Medicare private exchange. By offering retiree health coverage through a private Medicare exchange, PPG is able to provide Medicare-eligible participants with more choice of plans and plan designs, greater flexibility, and different price points for coverage.  Beginning January 1, 2017, PPG’s contribution for health care coverage related to Medicare-eligible retirees is in the form of a tax-free account known as a Health Reimbursement Arrangement (HRA). The HRA can be used to pay for health care and prescription drug plan premiums and certain out-of-pocket medical costs; unused funds can be carried over to future years.

The announcement of these plan design changes triggered a remeasurement of PPG’s retiree medical benefit obligation using prevailing interest rates. The plan design change resulted in a

$306 million

reduction in the Company's postretirement benefit obligation. PPG accounted for the plan design change prospectively, and the plan design change will be amortized to periodic postretirement benefit cost over a

5.6

year period.

The following table sets forth the changes in projected benefit obligations (“PBO”) (as calculated as of December 31), plan assets, the funded status and the amounts recognized in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet for the Company’s defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans:

The PBO is the actuarial present value of benefits attributable to employee service rendered to date, including the effects of estimated future pay increases. The accumulated benefit obligation (“ABO”) is the actuarial present value of benefits attributable to employee service rendered to date, but does not include the effects of estimated future pay increases. The ABO for all defined benefit pension plans as of

December 31, 2017

and


was

$3,382 million

and

$3,171 million

, respectively.


2017 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND 10-K

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

The following table details the pension plans where the benefit liability exceeds the fair value of the plan assets:

Net actuarial losses and prior service cost/(credit) deferred in accumulated other comprehensive loss

The accumulated net actuarial losses for pensions and other postretirement benefits relate primarily to historical declines in the discount rate as well as updated mortality assumptions. The accumulated net actuarial losses exceed

10%

of the higher of the market value of plan assets or the PBO at the beginning of the year, therefore, amortization of such excess has been included in net periodic benefit costs for pension and other postretirement benefits in each of the last three years. The amortization period is the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits unless a plan is mostly inactive in which case the amortization period is the average remaining life expectancy of the plan participants. Accumulated prior service cost (credit) is amortized over the future service periods of those employees who are active at the dates of the plan amendments and who are expected to receive benefits.

The net decrease in accumulated other comprehensive loss (pre-tax) in


relating to defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefits is primarily attributable to pension settlement charges and other postretirement plan design changes, as follows:

The 2017 net actuarial loss related to the Company’s pension and other postretirement benefit plans of

$3 million

was primarily due to a decrease in the weighted average discount rate used to determine the benefit obligation at December 31, 2017, partially offset by asset performance gains in excess of the expected return on plan assets for the year.

The estimated amount of accumulated net actuarial loss for the defined benefit pension plans that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive income into net periodic benefit cost in


is

$68 million

. The estimated amounts of accumulated net actuarial loss and prior service (credit) for the other postretirement benefit plans that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into net periodic benefit cost in


are

$17 million

and

$(60) million

, respectively.

Net periodic benefit cost

Net periodic benefit cost/(income) is included in Cost of sales, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, Selling, general and administrative, Research and development, and Income from discontinued operations, net of tax in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.

Key assumptions

The following weighted average assumptions were used to determine the benefit obligation for the Company’s defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans as of

December 31, 2017

and


:

(1)

The discount rate for U.S. defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans was

3.7%

and

4.3%

as of

December 31, 2017

and


, respectively.

The following weighted average assumptions were used to determine the net periodic benefit cost for the Company’s defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans for the three years in the period ended

December 31, 2017

:

These assumptions for each plan are reviewed on an annual basis. In determining the expected return on plan asset assumption, the Company evaluates the mix of investments that comprise each plan’s assets and external forecasts of future long-term investment returns. The Company compares the expected return on plan assets assumption to actual historic returns to ensure reasonability. For 2017, the return on plan assets assumption for PPG’s U.S. defined benefit pension plans was

7.5%

. A change in the rate of return of 1 percentage point, with other assumptions held constant, would impact 2017 net periodic pension expense by

$11 million

. The global expected return on plan assets assumption to be used in determining 2018 net periodic pension expense will be

5.30%

(

7.40%

for the U.S. plans only).

The discount rate used in accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits is determined by reference to a current yield curve and by considering the timing and amount of projected future benefit payments. In 2016, the Company changed the method it uses to estimate the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost for pension and other postretirement benefit costs for substantially all of its U.S. and foreign plans. Historically, the service and interest cost components were estimated using a single weighted-average discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the projected benefit obligation at the beginning of the period. The Company has elected to use a full yield curve approach (“Split-rate” method) in the estimation of these components of benefit cost by applying specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows. The Company made this change to improve the correlation between projected benefit cash flows and the corresponding yield curve spot rates and to provide a more precise measurement of service and interest costs. This change does not affect the measurement of the Company’s total benefit obligations. The Company accounted for this change as a change in estimate and, accordingly, began recognizing its effect in fiscal year 2016. A change in the discount rate of 1 percentage point, with all other assumptions held constant, would impact


net periodic benefit expense for our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans by

$22 million

and

$26 million

, respectively.

In 2017, the Company updated mortality tables used to calculate its U.S. defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities. The Company considered the available mortality tables released by the Society of Actuaries’ Retirement


2017 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND 10-K

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

Plans Experience Committee and performed a review of its own mortality history, as well the industry in which the Company operates to assess future improvements in mortality rates based on its U.S. population.  The Company chose to value its U.S. defined benefit pension and other postretirement  benefit liabilities using a slightly modified assumption of future mortality which better approximates our plan participant population.

The weighted-average healthcare cost trend rate (inflation) used for


was

6.1%

declining to a projected

4.5%

in the year


. For


, the assumed weighted-average healthcare cost trend rate used will be

5.8%

declining to a projected

4.5%

between 2019 and 2039 for medical and prescription drug costs, respectively. These assumptions are reviewed on an annual basis. In selecting rates for current and long-term health care cost assumptions, the Company takes into consideration a number of factors, including the Company’s actual health care cost increases, the design of the Company’s benefit programs, the demographics of the Company’s active and retiree populations and external expectations of future medical cost inflation rates. If these


health care cost trend rates were increased or decreased by one percentage point per year, such increase or decrease would have the following effects:

Contributions to defined benefit pension plans

(a)

During 2016 and 2015, U.S. contributions totaling

$12 million

and

$26 million

associated with the former glass segment were recast as cash flows from operations - discontinued operations and are excluded from the table above.

(b)

During 2016 non-U.S. contributions totaling

$4 million

associated with the former European fiberglass business were recast as cash flows from operations - discontinued operations and are excluded from the table above.

Substantially all contributions made to PPG’s non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans in 2017 and 2016 were required by local funding requirements. PPG expects to make mandatory contributions to its non-U.S. plans in the range of

$20 million

to

$30 million

in


. PPG contributed $25 million to its U.S. defined benefit pension plans in January 2018. PPG may make voluntary contributions to its defined benefit pension plans in


and beyond.

Benefit payments

The estimated benefits expected to be paid under the Company’s defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans are:

U.S. Qualified Pension

Beginning in 2012, the Company initiated a lump sum payout program that gave certain terminated vested participants in certain U.S. defined benefit pension plans the option to take a one-time lump sum cash payment in lieu of receiving a future monthly annuity.  During 2017, PPG paid

$87 million

in lump sum benefits to terminated vested participants who elected to participate in the program.  As the lump-sum payments were in excess of the expected 2017 service and interest costs for the qualified pension plans, PPG remeasured the periodic benefit obligation of the qualified plans and recorded a settlement charge totaling

$35 million

(

$22 million

after-tax).

U.S. Non-qualified Pension

In the first quarter 2017, PPG made lump-sum payments to certain retirees who had participated in PPG's U.S. non-qualified pension plan (the "Nonqualified Plan") totaling approximately

$40 million

. As the lump-sum payments were in excess of the

2017 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K


Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

expected 2017 service and interest costs for the Nonqualified Plan, PPG remeasured the periodic benefit obligation of the Nonqualified Plan as of March 1, 2017 and recorded a settlement charge totaling

$22 million

(

$14 million

after-tax).

Plan assets

Each PPG sponsored defined benefit pension plan is managed in accordance with the requirements of local laws and regulations governing defined benefit pension plans for the exclusive purpose of providing pension benefits to participants and their beneficiaries. Investment committees comprised of PPG managers have fiduciary responsibility to oversee the management of pension plan assets by third party asset managers. Pension plan assets are held in trust by financial institutions and managed on a day-to-day basis by the asset managers. The asset managers receive a mandate from each investment committee that is aligned with the asset allocation targets established by each investment committee to achieve the plan’s investment strategies. The performance of the asset managers is monitored and evaluated by the investment committees throughout the year.

Pension plan assets are invested to generate investment earnings over an extended time horizon to help fund the cost of benefits promised under the plans while mitigating investment risk. The asset allocation targets established for each pension plan are intended to diversify the investments among a variety of asset categories and among a variety of individual securities within each asset category to mitigate investment risk and provide each plan with sufficient liquidity to fund the payment of pension benefits to retirees.

The following summarizes the weighted average target pension plan asset allocation as of

December 31, 2017

and


for all PPG defined benefit plans:


2017 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND 10-K

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

The fair values of the Company’s pension plan assets at

December 31, 2017

and


, by asset category, are as follows:

(1)

These levels refer to the accounting guidance on fair value measurement described in Note 9, “Financial Instruments, Hedging Activities and Fair Value Measurements.”

(2)

These amounts represent holdings in investment grade debt or equity securities of issuers in both developed markets and emerging economies.

(3)

This category represents investment grade debt securities from a diverse set of industry issuers.

(4)

These investments are primarily long duration fixed income securities.

(5)

This category represents commingled funds invested in diverse portfolios of debt securities.

(6)

This category includes mortgage-backed and asset backed debt securities, municipal bonds and other debt securities including derivatives.

(7)

Certain investments that are measured at net asset value per share (or its equivalent) are not required to be classified in the fair value hierarchy.

The change in the fair value of the Company’s Level 3 pension assets for the years ended

December 31, 2017

and


was as follows:

Real estate properties are externally appraised at least annually by reputable, independent appraisal firms. Property valuations are also reviewed on a regular basis and are adjusted if there has been a significant change in circumstances related to the property since the last valuation.

2017 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K


Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

Other debt securities consist of insurance contracts, which are externally valued by insurance companies based on the present value of the expected future cash flows.

Hedge funds consist of a wide range of investments which target a relatively stable investment return. The underlying funds are valued at different frequencies, some monthly and some quarterly, based on the value of the underlying investments. Other assets consist primarily of small investments in private equity funds and senior secured debt obligations of non-investment grade borrowers.

Retained liabilities and legacy settlement charges

PPG has retained certain liabilities for defined benefit pension and postretirement benefits earned for service up to the date of sale of its former automotive glass and service business for employees who were active as of the divestiture date and for individuals who were retirees of the business as of the divestiture date, totaling

$369 million

and

$342 million

at

December 31, 2017

and


, respectively, for employees who were active as of the divestiture date and for individuals who were retirees of the business as of the divestiture date. PPG recognized expense of

$2 million

,

$20 million

and

$17 million

related to these obligations in


,


, and


, respectively.

There have been multiple PPG facility closures in Canada related to the former automotive glass and services business as well as other PPG businesses. These various plant closures have resulted in partial and full windups, and related settlement charges, of pension plans for various hourly and salary employees employed by these locations. The charges are recorded for the individual plans when a particular windup is approved by the Canadian pension authorities. The Company has made all contributions to the individual plan and has discharged the liability through either lump sum payments to participants or purchasing annuities.

During 2016, PPG completed the wind-up of

two

legacy Canadian plans and recorded after-tax wind-up charges totaling

$34 million

(

$47 million

pre-tax). Cash contributions made in conjunction with these windups were approximately

$1 million

. The Company recorded a settlement charge of

$7 million

in 2015 related to legacy plant closures. We expect limited additional settlement charges related to these legacy plant closures; although the Company retains the right to continue to review and potentially change other PPG defined benefit plans in the future.

Other Plans

Defined contribution plans

The Company has defined contribution plans for certain employees in the U.S., China, United Kingdom, Australia, Italy, and other countries. For the years ended December 31,


,


, and


, the Company recognized expense for its defined contribution retirement plans of

$57 million

,

$70 million

and

$60 million

, respectively. The Company’s annual cash contributions to its defined contribution retirement plans approximated the expense recognized in each year. As of

December 31, 2017

and


, the Company’s obligation for contributions to be made to its defined contribution retirement plans was

$15 million

and

$11 million

, respectively.

Employee savings plan

PPG’s Employee Savings Plan (“Savings Plan”) covers substantially all employees in the U.S., Puerto Rico and Canada. The Company makes matching contributions to the Savings Plan, at management’s discretion, based upon participants’ savings, subject to certain limitations. For most participants not covered by a collective bargaining agreement, Company-matching contributions are established each year at the discretion of the Company and are applied to participant savings up to a maximum of

6%

of eligible participant compensation. For those participants whose employment is covered by a collective bargaining agreement, the level of Company-matching contribution, if any, is determined by the relevant collective bargaining agreement. The Company-matching contribution remained at

100%

for


.

In 2016, the Company terminated its U.S. defined contribution plan and subsequently merged the plan into the Savings Plan. Under the combined plan, eligible employees will continue to receive a contribution equal to between

2%

and

5%

of annual compensation, based on age and years of service.

Compensation expense and cash contributions related to the Company match of participant contributions to the Savings Plan for

,


, and


, respectively, are deductible for U.S. Federal tax purposes.

Deferred compensation plan

The Company has a deferred compensation plan for certain key managers which allows them to defer a portion of their compensation in a phantom PPG stock account or other phantom investment accounts. The amount deferred earns a return based on the investment options selected by the participant. The amount owed to participants is an unfunded and unsecured


2017 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND 10-K

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

general obligation of the Company. Upon retirement, death, disability, termination of employment, scheduled payment or unforeseen emergency, the compensation deferred and related accumulated earnings are distributed in accordance with the participant’s election in cash or in PPG stock, based on the accounts selected by the participant.

The plan provides participants with investment alternatives and the ability to transfer amounts between the phantom non-PPG stock investment accounts. To mitigate the impact on compensation expense of changes in the market value of the liability, the Company has purchased a portfolio of marketable securities that mirror the phantom non-PPG stock investment accounts selected by the participants, except the money market accounts. These investments are carried by PPG at fair market value, and the changes in market value of these securities are also included in income from continuing operations. Trading occurs in this portfolio to align the securities held with the participant’s phantom non-PPG stock investment accounts, except the money market accounts.

The cost of the deferred compensation plan, comprised of dividend equivalents accrued on the phantom PPG stock account, investment income and the change in market value of the liability, was

$19 million

13. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities

PPG is involved in a number of lawsuits and claims, both actual and potential, including some that it has asserted against others, in which substantial monetary damages are sought. These lawsuits and claims may relate to contract, patent, environmental, product liability, antitrust, employment and other matters arising out of the conduct of PPG’s current and past business activities. To the extent that these lawsuits and claims involve personal injury and property damage, PPG believes it has adequate insurance; however, certain of PPG’s insurers are contesting coverage with respect to some of these claims, and other insurers, as they had prior to the asbestos settlement described below, may contest coverage with respect to some of the asbestos claims if the settlement is not implemented. PPG’s lawsuits and claims against others include claims against insurers and other third parties with respect to actual and contingent losses related to environmental, asbestos and other matters.

The results of any current or future litigation and claims are inherently unpredictable. However, management believes that, in the aggregate, the outcome of all lawsuits and claims involving PPG will not have a material effect on PPG’s consolidated financial position or liquidity; however, such outcome may be material to the results of operations of any particular period in which costs, if any, are recognized.

Asbestos matters

Prior to 2000, the Company had been named as a defendant in numerous claims alleging bodily injury from (i) exposure to asbestos-containing products allegedly manufactured, sold or distributed by the Company, its subsidiaries, or for which they are otherwise alleged to be liable; (ii) exposure to asbestos allegedly present at a facility owned or leased by the Company; or (iii) exposure to asbestos-containing products of Pittsburgh Corning Corporation (“PC”) for which the Company was alleged to be liable under a variety of legal theories (the Company and Corning Incorporated were each 50% shareholders in PC).

Pittsburgh Corning Corporation asbestos bankruptcy

In 2000, PC filed for Chapter 11 in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania in an effort to permanently and comprehensively resolve all of its pending and future asbestos-related liability claims. At the time of the bankruptcy filing, the Company had been named as one of many defendants in approximately 114,000 open claims. The Bankruptcy Court subsequently entered a series of orders preliminarily enjoining the prosecution of asbestos litigation against PPG until after the effective date of a confirmed PC plan of reorganization. During the pendency of this preliminary injunction staying asbestos litigation against PPG, PPG and certain of its historical liability insurers negotiated a settlement with representatives of present and future asbestos claimants. That settlement was incorporated into a PC plan of reorganization that was confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court on May 24, 2013 and ultimately became effective on April 27, 2016. With the effectiveness of the plan, the preliminary injunction staying the prosecution of asbestos litigation against PPG expired by its own terms on May 27, 2016. In accordance with the settlement, the Bankruptcy Court issued a permanent channeling injunction under Section 524(g) of the Bankruptcy Code that prohibits present and future claimants from asserting claims against PPG that arise, in whole or in part, out of exposure to asbestos or asbestos-containing products manufactured, sold and/or distributed by PC or asbestos on or emanating from any PC premises. The channeling injunction, by its terms, also prohibits codefendants in cases that

2017 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K


Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

are subject to the channeling injunction from asserting claims against PPG for contribution, indemnification or other recovery. The channeling injunction also precludes the prosecution of claims against PPG arising from alleged exposure to asbestos or asbestos-containing products to the extent that a claimant is alleging or seeking to impose liability, directly or indirectly, for the conduct of, claims against, or demands on PC by reason of PPG’s: (i) ownership of a financial interest in PC; (ii) involvement in the management of PC, or service as an officer, director or employee of PC or a related party; (iii) provision of insurance to PC or a related party; or (iv) involvement in a financial transaction affecting the financial condition of PC or a related party. The foregoing PC related claims are referred to as “PC Relationship Claims.”

The channeling injunction channels the Company’s liability for PC Relationship Claims to a trust funded in part by PPG and its participating insurers for the benefit of current and future PC asbestos claimants (the “Trust”). The Trust is the sole recourse for holders of PC Relationship Claims. PPG and its affiliates have no further liability or responsibility for, and will be permanently protected from, pending and future PC Relationship Claims. The channeling injunction does not extend to present and future claims against PPG that arise out of alleged exposure to asbestos or asbestos-containing products historically manufactured, sold and/or distributed by PPG or its subsidiaries or for which they are alleged to be liable that are not PC Relationship Claims, and does not extend to claims against PPG alleging personal injury allegedly caused by asbestos on premises presently or formerly owned, leased or occupied by PPG. These claims are referred to as non-PC Relationship Claims.

In accordance with the PC plan of reorganization, PPG's equity interest in PC was canceled. PPG satisfied its funding obligations to the Trust on June 9, 2016, when it conveyed to the Trust the stock it owned in Pittsburgh Corning Europe and

2,777,778

shares of PPG’s common stock and made a cash payment to the Trust in the amount of

$764 million

. PPG’s historical insurance carriers participating in the PC plan of reorganization are required to make cash payments to the Trust of approximately

$1.7 billion

, subject to a right of prepayment at a

5.5%

discount rate.

On October 13, 2016, the Bankruptcy Court issued an order entering a final decree and closing the Chapter 11 case. That order provided that the Bankruptcy Court retained jurisdiction to enforce any order issued in the case and any agreements approved by the court, enforce the terms and conditions or the modified third amended Plan, and consider any requests to reopen the case.

The following table outlines the impact on PPG's financial statements for the year-ended December 31, 2016, including the change in fair value of the PPG stock contributed to the Trust, the equity forward instrument and the increase in the net present value of the payments made to the trust.

(a)

Cash outflows related to the asbestos settlement funding totaled

$813 million

in 2016.

Non-PC relationship asbestos claims

At the time PC filed for bankruptcy, PPG had been named as one of many defendants in one or more of the categories of asbestos-related claims identified above. Over the course of the 16 years during which the PC bankruptcy proceedings, and corresponding preliminary injunction staying the prosecution of asbestos-related claims against PPG, were pending, certain plaintiffs alleging premises claims filed motions seeking to lift the stay with respect to more than 1,000 individually-identified premises. The Bankruptcy Court granted motions to lift the stay in respect to certain of these premises claims and directed PPG to engage in a process to address any additional premises claims that were the subject of pending or anticipated lift-stay motions. As a result of the overall process as directed by the Bankruptcy Court involving more than 1,000 premises claims between 2006 and May 27, 2016, hundreds of these claims were withdrawn or dismissed without payment and approximately 650 premises claims were dismissed upon agreements by PPG and its insurers to resolve such claims in exchange for monetary payments.


2017 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND 10-K

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

With respect to the remaining claims not identified above and still reportable within the inventory of 114,000 asbestos-related claims at the time PC filed for bankruptcy, the Company considers such claims to fall within one or more of the following categories: (1) claims that have been closed or dismissed as a result of processes undertaken during the bankruptcy; (2) claims that may have been previously filed on the dockets of state and federal courts in various jurisdictions, but are inactive as to the Company; and (3) claims that are subject, in whole or in part, to the channeling injunction and thus will be resolved, in whole or in part, in accordance with the Trust procedures established under the PC bankruptcy reorganization plan. As a result of the foregoing, the Company does not consider these three categories of claims to be open or active litigation against it, although the Company cannot now determine whether, or the extent to which, any of these claims may in the future be reinstituted, reinstated, or revived such that they may become open and active asbestos-related claims against it.

Current open and active claims post-Pittsburgh Corning bankruptcy

The Company is aware of approximately


open and active asbestos-related claims pending against the Company and certain of its subsidiaries. These claims consist primarily of non-PC Relationship Claims and claims against a subsidiary of PPG. The Company is defending the remaining open and active claims vigorously.

Since April 1, 2013, a subsidiary of PPG has been implicated in claims alleging death or injury caused by asbestos-containing products manufactured, distributed or sold by a North American architectural coatings business or its predecessors which was acquired by PPG. All such claims have been either served upon or tendered to the seller for defense and indemnity pursuant to obligations undertaken by the seller in connection with the Company’s purchase of the North American architectural coatings business. The seller has accepted the defense of these claims subject to the terms of various agreements between the Company and the seller. The seller’s defense and indemnity obligations in connection with newly filed claims will cease with respect to claims filed after April 1, 2018.

PPG has established reserves totaling approximately

$180 million

for asbestos-related claims that would not be channeled to the Trust which, based on presently available information, we believe will be sufficient to encompass all of PPG’s current and potential future asbestos liabilities.  These reserves include a

$162 million

reserve established in 2009 in connection with an amendment to the PC plan of reorganization.  These reserves, which are included within "Other liabilities" on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, represent PPG’s best estimate of its liability for these claims. PPG does not have sufficient current claim information or settlement history on which to base a better estimate of this liability in light of the fact that the Bankruptcy Court’s injunction staying most asbestos claims against the Company was in effect from April 2000 through May 2016. PPG will monitor the activity associated with its remaining asbestos claims and evaluate, on a periodic basis, its estimated liability for such claims, its insurance assets then available, and all underlying assumptions to determine whether any adjustment to the reserves for these claims is required.

The amount reserved for asbestos-related claims by its nature is subject to many uncertainties that may change over time, including (i) the ultimate number of claims filed; (ii) the amounts required to resolve both currently known and future unknown claims; (iii) the amount of insurance, if any, available to cover such claims; (iv) the unpredictable aspects of the litigation process, including a changing trial docket and the jurisdictions in which trials are scheduled; (v) the outcome of any trials, including potential judgments or jury verdicts; (vi) the lack of specific information in many cases concerning exposure for which PPG is allegedly responsible, and the claimants’ alleged diseases resulting from such exposure; and (vii) potential changes in applicable federal and/or state tort liability law. All of these factors may have a material effect upon future asbestos-related liability estimates. As a potential offset to any future asbestos financial exposure, under the PC plan of reorganization PPG retained, for its own account, the right to pursue insurance coverage from certain of its historical insurers that did not participate in the PC plan of reorganization. While the ultimate outcome of PPG’s asbestos litigation cannot be predicted with certainty, PPG believes that any financial exposure resulting from its asbestos-related claims will not have a material adverse effect on PPG’s consolidated financial position, liquidity or results of operations.

Environmental matters

It is PPG’s policy to accrue expenses for environmental contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Reserves for environmental contingencies are exclusive of claims against third parties and are generally not discounted. In management’s opinion, the Company operates in an environmentally sound manner and the outcome of the Company’s environmental contingencies will not have a material effect on PPG’s financial position or liquidity; however, any such outcome may be material to the results of operations of any particular period in which costs, if any, are recognized. Management anticipates that the resolution of the Company’s environmental contingencies will occur over an extended period of time.

As of

December 31, 2017

and


, PPG had reserves for environmental contingencies associated with PPG’s former chromium manufacturing plant in Jersey City, N.J. (“New Jersey Chrome”) and for other environmental contingencies, including National Priority List sites and legacy glass and chemical manufacturing sites. These reserves are reported as “Accounts payable and accrued liabilities” and “Other liabilities” in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.

2017 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K


Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

Pre-tax charges against income for environmental remediation costs are included in “Other charges” in the accompanying consolidated statement of income. The pre-tax charges and cash outlays related to such environmental remediation in


,


and


, were as follows:

The Company continues to analyze, assess and remediate the environmental issues associated with New Jersey Chrome as further discussed below. During the past three years, charges for estimated environmental remediation costs were significantly higher than PPG’s historical range. Excluding the charges related to New Jersey Chrome, pre-tax charges against income for environmental remediation have ranged between approximately

$5 million

and

$35 million

per year for the past


years.

Management expects cash outlays for environmental remediation costs to range from

$25 million

to

$75 million

annually from 2018 through 2022.

It is possible that technological, regulatory and enforcement developments, the results of environmental studies and other factors could alter the Company’s expectations with respect to future charges against income and future cash outlays. Specifically, the level of expected future remediation costs and cash outlays is highly dependent upon activity related to New Jersey Chrome as discussed below.

Remediation: New Jersey Chrome

In June 2009, PPG entered into a settlement agreement with the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (“NJDEP”) and Jersey City, New Jersey (which had asserted claims against PPG for lost tax revenue) which was in the form of a Judicial Consent Order (the "JCO"). Under the JCO, PPG accepted sole responsibility for the remediation activities at its former chromium manufacturing location in Jersey City and


additional sites. The principal contaminant of concern is hexavalent chromium. The JCO also provided for the appointment of a court-approved Site Administrator who is responsible for establishing a master schedule for the remediation of the


PPG sites which existed at that time.

One

site was subsequently removed from the JCO process during 2014 and will be remediated separately at a future date. A total of


sites remain subject to the JCO process.

The most significant assumptions underlying the estimate of remediation costs for all New Jersey Chrome sites are those related to the extent and concentration of chromium impacts in the soil, as these determine the quantity of soil that must be treated in place, the quantity that will have to be excavated and transported for offsite disposal, and the nature of disposal required. During 2016, PPG completed updated assessments of costs incurred to date versus current progress and the potential cost impacts of the most recent information, including the extent of impacted soils, percentage of hazardous versus non-hazardous soils, daily soil excavation rates, and engineering, administrative and other associated costs. Based on these assessments, a reserve adjustment of

$60 million

was recorded during 2016. Principal factors affecting costs included refinements in the estimate of the mix of hazardous to non-hazardous soils to be excavated, an overall increase in soil volumes to be excavated, enhanced water management requirements, decreased daily soil excavation rates due to site conditions, initial estimates for remedial actions related to groundwater, and increased oversight and management costs. The reserve adjustments for the estimated costs to remediate all New Jersey Chrome sites are exclusive of any third party indemnification, as the recovery of any such amounts is uncertain. In 2017, the cost of remediation activities reduced the reserve by

$27 million

.

Groundwater remediation at the former Garfield Avenue chromium-manufacturing site and

five

adjacent sites is expected to occur over several years after NJDEP’s approval of the work plan. Ongoing groundwater monitoring will be utilized to develop a final groundwater remedial action work plan which is currently expected to be submitted to NJDEP in 2021.


2017 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND 10-K

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

PPG’s financial reserve for remediation of all New Jersey Chrome sites is

$136 million

at

December 31, 2017

. The major cost components of this liability continue to be related to excavation, transportation and disposal of impacted soil, as well as construction services. These components each account for approximately

29%

,

27%

and

23%

of the accrued amount, respectively.

There are multiple, future events yet to occur, including further remedy selection and design, remedy implementation and execution and applicable governmental agency or community organization approvals. Considerable uncertainty exists regarding the timing of these future events for the New Jersey Chrome sites. Final resolution of these events is expected to occur over the next several years. As these events occur and to the extent that the cost estimates of the environmental remediation remedies change, the existing reserve for this environmental remediation matter will be adjusted.

Remediation: other sites

Among other sites at which PPG is managing environmental liabilities, remedial actions are occurring at a legacy chemical manufacturing site in Barberton, Ohio, where PPG has completed a Facility Investigation and Corrective Measure Study under USEPA’s Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) Corrective Action Program. PPG has also been addressing the impacts from a legacy plate glass manufacturing site in Kokomo, Indiana under the Voluntary Remediation Program of the Indiana Department of Environmental Management. PPG is currently performing additional investigation activities at this location.

With respect to certain waste sites, the financial condition of other potentially responsible parties also contributes to the uncertainty of estimating PPG’s final costs. Although contributors of waste to sites involving other potentially responsible parties may face governmental agency assertions of joint and several liability, in general, final allocations of costs are made based on the relative contributions of wastes to such sites. PPG is generally not a major contributor to such sites.

Separation and merger of the commodity chemicals business

As a result of the commodity chemicals business separation transaction, PPG has retained responsibility for potential environmental liabilities that may result from future Natural Resource Damage claims and any potential tort claims at the Calcasieu River Estuary associated with activities and historical operations of the Lake Charles, La. facility. In the fourth quarter of 2017, PPG signed a consent decree prepared by the US Department of Justice for settlement of potential natural resource damage claims at the Calcasieu River Estuary. Payment of PPG’s previously accrued for share of costs into an escrow account will be required within 30 days of lodging of the agreement with the court. Lodging is expected to occur in the first quarter of 2018.

PPG retained additional responsibility for all liabilities relating to, arising out of or resulting from sediment contamination in the Ohio River resulting from historical activities and operations at the Natrium, W.Va. facility, exclusive of remedial activities, if any, that would have been required to have been performed on-site at the Natrium facility. PPG’s obligations with respect to the Ohio River sediment contamination terminated because PPG received no notice of any requirements to further assess or to remediate sediment contamination in the Ohio River, caused by PPG’s operation of the Natrium facility prior to the separation of the commodity chemicals business, during an indemnification period established in the agreement transferring the business to Axiall that ended on December 30, 2017.

Remediation: reasonably possible matters

In addition to the amounts currently reserved for environmental remediation, the Company may be subject to loss contingencies related to environmental matters estimated to be as much as

$100 million

to

$200 million

. Such unreserved losses are reasonably possible but are not currently considered to be probable of occurrence. These reasonably possible unreserved losses relate to environmental matters at a number of sites, none of which are individually significant. The loss contingencies related to these sites include significant unresolved issues such as the nature and extent of contamination at these sites and the methods that may have to be employed to remediate them.

The impact of evolving programs, such as natural resource damage claims, industrial site re-use initiatives and domestic and international remediation programs, also adds to the present uncertainties with regard to the ultimate resolution of this unreserved exposure to future loss. The Company’s assessment of the potential impact of these environmental contingencies is subject to considerable uncertainty due to the complex, ongoing and evolving process of investigation and remediation, if necessary, of such environmental contingencies, and the potential for technological and regulatory developments.

16. Other Income

17. Stock-Based Compensation

The Company’s stock-based compensation includes stock options, restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and grants of contingent shares that are earned based on achieving targeted levels of total shareholder return. All current grants of stock options, RSUs and contingent shares are made under the PPG Industries, Inc. Amended and Restated Omnibus Incentive Plan (“PPG Amended Omnibus Plan”), which was amended and restated effective April 21, 2016. Shares available for future grants under the PPG Amended Omnibus Plan were

8.0 million

as of

December 31, 2017

.

Stock Options

PPG has outstanding stock option awards that have been granted under the PPG Amended Omnibus Plan. Under the PPG Amended Omnibus Plan, certain employees of the Company have been granted options to purchase shares of common stock at prices equal to the fair market value of the shares on the date the options were granted. The options are generally exercisable

36 months

after being granted and have a maximum term of


years. Upon exercise of a stock option, shares of Company stock are issued from treasury stock.

The fair value of stock options issued to employees is measured on the date of grant and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period. PPG estimates the fair value of stock options using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The risk-free interest rate is determined by using the U.S. Treasury yield curve at the date of the grant and using a maturity equal to the expected life of the option. The expected life of options is calculated using the average of the vesting term and the maximum term, as prescribed by accounting guidance on the use of the simplified method for determining the expected term of an employee share option. The expected dividend yield and volatility are based on historical stock prices and dividend amounts over past time periods equal in length to the expected life of the options.

The following weighted average assumptions were used to calculate the fair values of stock option grants in each year:

The weighted average fair value of options granted was

$21.15

per share,

$17.94

per share and

$26.94

per share for the years ended December 31,

1.5

years.

The following table presents stock option activity for the years ended

December 31, 2017

,


and


:

Restricted Stock Units (“RSUs”)

Long-term incentive value is delivered to selected key management employees by granting RSUs, which have either time or performance-based vesting features. The fair value of an RSU is equal to the market value of a share of PPG stock on the date of grant. Time-based RSUs vest over the

three

-year period following the date of grant, unless forfeited, and will be paid out in the form of stock, cash or a combination of both at the Company’s discretion at the end of the

three

year vesting period. Performance-based RSUs vest based on achieving specific annual performance targets for earnings per share growth and cash flow return on capital over the

three

calendar year-end periods following the date of grant. Unless forfeited, the performance-based RSUs will be paid out in the form of stock, cash or a combination of both at the Company’s discretion at the end of the

three

-year performance period if PPG meets the performance targets. The amount paid for performance-based awards may range from

0%

to

180%

of the original grant, based upon the frequency with which the annual earnings per share growth and cash flow return on capital performance targets are met over the

three

calendar year periods comprising the vesting period. For the purposes of expense recognition, PPG has assumed that performance-based RSUs granted in 2015 will vest at the

150%

level and those granted in 2016 and 2017 will vest at the

100%

level. As of

December 31, 2017

,

four

of the

six

possible performance targets had been met for the 2015 grant,

two

of the

four

possible performance targets had been met for the 2016 grant, and

one

two

possible performance targets had been met for the 2017 grant.

There was

$14 million

of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested RSUs outstanding as of

December 31, 2017

. This cost is expected to be recognized as expense over a weighted average period of

1.7

years.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

Contingent Share Grants

The Company also provides grants of contingent shares to selected key executives that may be earned based on PPG total shareholder return (“TSR”) over the

three

-year period following the date of grant. Contingent share grants (referred to as “TSR awards”) are made annually and are paid out at the end of each

three

-year period based on the Company’s performance. Performance is measured by determining the percentile rank of the total shareholder return of PPG common stock in relation to the total shareholder return of the S&P 500 for the

three

-year period following the date of grant. This comparison group represents the entire S&P 500 Index as it existed at the beginning of the performance period, excluding any companies that have been removed from the index because they ceased to be publicly traded. The payment of awards following the

three

-year award period will be based on performance achieved in accordance with the scale set forth in the plan agreement and may range from

0%

to

220%

of the initial grant. A payout of

100%

is earned if the target performance is achieved. Contingent share awards for the 2015-2017, 2016-2018, and 2017-2019 periods earn dividend equivalents for the award period, which will be paid to participants or credited to the participants’ deferred compensation plan accounts with the award payout at the end of the period based on the actual number of contingent shares that are earned. Any payments made at the end of the award period may be in the form of stock, cash or a combination of both. The TSR awards qualify as liability awards, and compensation expense is recognized over the

three

-year award period based on the fair value of the awards (giving consideration to the Company’s percentile rank of total shareholder return) remeasured in each reporting period until settlement of the awards.

As of

December 31, 2017

, there was

$3 million

of total unrecognized compensation cost related to outstanding TSR awards based on the current estimate of fair value. This cost is expected to be recognized as expense over a weighted average period of

1.7

years.

19. Reportable Business Segment Information

Segment Organization and Products

PPG is a multinational manufacturer with


operating segments (which the Company refers to as “strategic business units”) that are organized based on the Company’s major products lines. These operating segments are also the Company’s reporting units for purposes of testing goodwill for impairment (see Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”).

The Company’s reportable business segments include the following

two

segments: Performance Coatings and Industrial Coatings. The operating segments have been aggregated based on economic similarities, the nature of their products, production processes, end-use markets and methods of distribution.

The Performance Coatings reportable segment is comprised of the refinish, aerospace, architectural coatings – Americas and Asia-Pacific, architectural coatings - EMEA, and protective and marine coatings operating segments. This reportable segment primarily supplies a variety of protective and decorative coatings, sealants and finishes along with paint strippers, stains and related chemicals, as well as transparencies and transparent armor.


2017 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND 10-K

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

The Industrial Coatings reportable segment is comprised of the automotive original equipment manufacturer (“OEM”) coatings, industrial coatings, packaging coatings, coatings services and the specialty coatings and materials operating segments. This reportable segment primarily supplies a variety of protective and decorative coatings and finishes along with adhesives, sealants, metal pretreatment products, optical monomers and coatings, precipitated silicas and other specialty materials.

Effective January 1, 2018, the coating services operating segment has been merged into the industrial coatings operating segment and the Company will have


operating segments. Management teams and operations will be realigned to better deliver our total value proposition and provide optimal solutions to our customers, as well as to achieve operational efficiencies.

Production facilities and markets for Performance Coatings and Industrial Coatings are global. PPG’s reportable segments continue to pursue opportunities to further develop their global markets, including efforts in Asia, Eastern Europe and Latin America. Each of the reportable segments in which PPG is engaged is highly competitive. The diversification of our product lines and the worldwide markets served tend to minimize the impact on PPG’s total sales and income from continuing operations of changes in demand in a particular market or in a particular geographic area.

The accounting policies of the operating segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies (See Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”). The Company allocates resources to operating segments and evaluates the performance of operating segments based upon segment income, which is income before interest expense – net, income taxes, and noncontrolling interests and excludes certain charges which are considered to be unusual or non-recurring. The Company also evaluates performance of operating segments based on working capital reduction, margin growth, and sales volume growth. Legacy items include current costs related to former operations of the Company, including certain environmental remediation, pension and other postretirement benefit costs, and certain charges for legal and other matters which are considered to be unusual or non-recurring. These legacy costs are excluded from the segment income that is used to evaluate the performance of the operating segments.

Corporate unallocated costs include the costs of corporate staff functions not directly associated with the operating segments, the cost of corporate legal cases, net of related insurance recoveries and the cost of certain insurance and stock-based compensation programs. Net periodic pension expense is allocated to the operating segments and the portion of net periodic pension expense related to the corporate staff functions is included in the Corporate unallocated costs.

Product movement between Performance Coatings and Industrial Coatings is limited, is accounted for as an inventory transfer, and is recorded at cost plus a mark-up, the impact of which is not significant to the segment income of the reportable segments.
