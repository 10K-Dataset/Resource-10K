PART I

ITEMS 1 and 2.

BUSINESS AND PROPERTIES

GENERAL

Apache Corporation, a Delaware corporation formed in 1954, is an independent energy company that explores for, develops, and produces natural gas, crude oil, and natural gas liquids. Apache currently has exploration and production operations in three geographic areas: the U.S., Egypt, and offshore the U.K. in the North Sea (North Sea). Apache also has exploration interests in Suriname and other international locations that may, over time, result in reportable discoveries and development opportunities. Apache’s midstream business is operated by Altus Midstream Company (ALTM) through its subsidiary Altus Midstream LP (collectively, Altus). Altus owns, develops, and operates a midstream energy asset network in the Permian Basin of West Texas, anchored by midstream service contracts to Apache’s production from its Alpine High resource play. Additionally, Altus owns equity interests in a total of four Permian Basin pipelines that will access various points along the Texas Gulf Coast, providing it with fully integrated, wellhead-to-water connectivity.

Our common stock, par value $0.625 per share, has been listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) since 1969, on the Chicago Stock Exchange (CHX) since 1960, and on the Nasdaq Global Select Market (Nasdaq) since 2004. Through our website,

BUSINESS STRATEGY

Our VISION is to be the premier exploration and production company, contributing to global progress by helping meet the world's energy needs.

Our MISSION is to grow in an innovative, safe, environmentally responsible, and profitable manner for the long-term benefit of our stakeholders.

Our STRATEGY is to take a differentiated approach to the exploration and production of cost-advantaged hydrocarbons through innovation, technology, optimization, continuous improvement, and relentless focus on costs to deliver top-tier, long-term returns.

Rigorous management of the Company’s asset portfolio plays a key role in optimizing shareholder value over the long term. Over the past several years, Apache has entered into a series of transactions that have upgraded its portfolio of assets, enhanced its capital allocation process to further optimize investment returns, and increased focus on internally generated exploration with full-cycle, returns-focused growth. These efforts included the monetization of certain non-strategic assets, including gas-weighted properties in the Midcontinent/Gulf Coast region and selling other non-core leasehold positions. The Company made strategic decisions to allocate the proceeds of these divestitures to more impactful development opportunities across its portfolio and exploration efforts in Suriname. In addition, in November 2018 the Company completed a transaction with Altus Midstream Company and its then wholly owned subsidiary Altus Midstream LP to create a publicly traded, pure-play, Permian Basin to Gulf Coast midstream C-corporation anchored by gathering, processing, and transmission assets at Alpine High. This transaction facilitated funding the capital requirements for midstream infrastructure and led to the acquisition of equity interests in four Permian Basin long-haul pipeline entities.

Apache’s U.S. upstream oil and gas assets are complemented by its international assets in Egypt and the North Sea, each of which adds to the Company’s inventory of exploration and development opportunities and generates cash flows in excess of current


capital investments, providing the Company greater ability to develop its onshore Permian Basin properties while maintaining financial flexibility in a volatile commodity price environment. Apache’s diverse regional portfolio and asset inventory includes, at scale, both conventional and unconventional resources covering oil, rich gas with NGLs, and lean gas. This range of assets provides optionality to fund a capital program capable of delivering a sustainable combination of long-term returns with a moderate pace of growth.

For a more in-depth discussion of the Company’s


results, divestitures, strategy, and its capital resources and liquidity, please see Part II, Item 7—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this Form 10-K.

BUSINESS OVERVIEW

The following business overview further describes the operations and activities for the Company’s upstream exploration and production properties, by geographic region, and Altus midstream. Apache has historically employed a decentralized, geographic region-focused approach to operations. In recent years, the Company has centralized certain operational activities in an effort to capture greater efficiencies through shared services. In light of the continued streamlining of the Company’s asset portfolio through divestitures and strategic transactions, in late 2019 management initiated a comprehensive redesign of Apache’s organizational structure and operations that it believes will better position the Company to be competitive for the long-term and further reduce recurring costs. The reorganization is ongoing and is expected to be substantially completed for the technical functions by the end of the first quarter of 2020. Changes for the corporate support functions will be ongoing through most of 2020.

UPSTREAM EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION PROPERTIES

Operating Areas

Apache has exploration and production operations in three geographic areas: the U.S., Egypt, and the North Sea. Apache also has exploration interests in Suriname and other international locations that may, over time, result in reportable discoveries and development opportunities.

The following table sets out a brief comparative summary of certain key


data for each of Apache’s operating areas. Additional data and discussion are provided in Part II, Item 7—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this Form 10-K.

(1)

Apache’s operations in Egypt, excluding the impacts of a one-third noncontrolling interest, contributed

21 percent

of


production and accounted for

13 percent

of year-end estimated proved reserves.

(2)

Sales volumes from the North Sea for


were

21.8

MMboe. Sales volumes may vary from production volumes as a result of the timing of liftings in the Beryl field.

United States

In


, Apache’s U.S. upstream oil and gas operations contributed approximately

59 percent

of production and

68 percent

of estimated year-end proved reserves. Apache has access to significant liquid hydrocarbons across its 5.2 million gross acres in the U.S., 78 percent of which are undeveloped.


Permian Region

The Permian region located in West Texas and New Mexico includes the Permian sub-basins: Midland Basin, Central Basin Platform/Northwest Shelf, and Delaware Basin. Examples of shale plays within this region include the Woodford, Barnett, Pennsylvanian, Cline, Wolfcamp, Bone Spring, and Spraberry. The Permian region is one of Apache’s core growth areas. Highlights of the Company’s operations in the region include:

•

Over 2.9 million gross acres (1.8 million net acres) with exposure to numerous plays focused primarily in the Midland Basin, the Central Basin Platform/Northwest Shelf, and the Delaware Basin.

•

Estimated proved reserves of 665.8 MMboe at year-end 2019, representing 66 percent of the Company’s worldwide proved reserves.

•

In 2019, the Permian region averaged 11 rigs and drilled or participated in 232 wells, 206 of which were horizontal, with a 100 percent success rate.

•

Annual production of

254.3

Mboe/d increased

21 percent

from 2018. Fourth-quarter 2019 production increased

13 percent

from the prior sequential quarter and

22 percent

from the fourth quarter of 2018, a reflection of the success of the Company’s Midland Basin oil-focused drilling program and production from its Alpine High field.

In late 2016, Apache announced the discovery of a new resource play, “Alpine High.” Apache’s Alpine High acreage lies in the southern portion of the Delaware Basin, primarily in Reeves County, Texas, and contains multiple geologic formations and target zones spanning the full hydrocarbon phase window from dry gas to wet gas to oil. Over the past two years, the Company focused on geological testing and transitioned to initial tests of full-field development of the Alpine High play, drilling 100 wells and 82 wells in 2018 and 2019, respectively. Given the prevailing gas and NGL price environment and disappointing performance of recent multi-well development pads in the second half of 2019, Apache materially reduced planned investment and currently has no future drilling plans at Alpine High.

Permian region drilling activity outside of Alpine High primarily focused in the Southern Midland Basin, with an average of 3.5 rigs running throughout the year targeting oil plays in the Wolfcamp, Spraberry, and lower Cline formations. The region also ran an average of 1.5 rigs during 2019 on the Company’s Delaware Basin acreage in New Mexico focused on oil plays in the Bone Spring formation. For 2019, the region drilled or participated in 150 wells excluding Alpine High activity, with a 100 percent success rate. Since 2017, the region has operated its unconventional oil-focused program at a relatively steady and deliberate pace. This has generated competitive well results, solid returns, and an attractive oil production growth rate. For 2020, the Company plans to reduce its operated rig count in the Permian region but deliver on a low-to-mid-single digit oil growth rate.

Midcontinent/Gulf Coast Region

The Midcontinent/Gulf Coast region has historically included developed and undeveloped acreage in western Oklahoma, the Texas Panhandle and the Eagle Ford shale in east Texas. In the second quarter of 2019, Apache completed the sale of non-core, gas-weighted assets in the Woodford-SCOOP and STACK plays for aggregate cash proceeds of approximately

$223 million

. In the third quarter of 2019, Apache completed the sale of non-core, gas-weighted assets in the western Anadarko Basin of Oklahoma and Texas for aggregate cash proceeds of approximately

$322 million

and the assumption of asset retirement obligations of $49 million. The asset sales reflect the divestiture of a significant portion of the Company’s Midcontinent/Gulf Coast onshore region and further streamlines Apache’s portfolio. The region retained acreage of approximately 664,000 gross acres (263,000 net acres) and nearly 240 gross wells (150 net), primarily located in Eagle Ford shale and Austin Chalk areas of Southeast Texas.

Gulf of Mexico Region

The Gulf of Mexico region comprises assets in the offshore waters of the Gulf of Mexico and onshore Louisiana. In addition to its interest in several deepwater exploration and development offshore leases, when the Company sold in 2013 substantially all of its offshore assets in water depths less than 1,000 feet, it retained a 50 percent ownership interest in all exploration blocks and in horizons below production in development blocks, and access to existing infrastructure. During 2019, Apache’s Gulf of Mexico region continued to operate on a reduced capital budget, having participated in 2 non-operated exploratory wells with an average 15 percent working interest, both of which were successful. The region contributed

4.7

Mboe/d to the Company’s total production for the year.

U.S. Marketing

In general, most of the Company’s U.S. natural gas production is sold at either monthly or daily index-based prices. The tenor of the Company’s sales contracts span from daily to multi-year transactions. Natural gas is sold to a variety of customers that include local distribution, utility, and midstream companies as well as end-users, marketers, and integrated major oil companies. Apache strives to maintain a diverse client portfolio, which is intended to reduce the concentration of credit risk. Beginning in 2017, Apache began selling gas to markets in Mexico and to LNG export facilities in the U.S.


Apache primarily markets its U.S. crude oil production to integrated major oil companies, marketing, and transportation companies, and refiners based on a West Texas Intermediate (WTI) price or other regional pricing indices (e.g. WTI Houston, West Texas Sour (WTS), or WTI Midland), adjusted for quality, transportation, and a market-reflective differential.

Apache’s objective is to maximize the value of crude oil sold by identifying the best markets and most economical transportation routes available to move the product. Sales contracts are generally 30-day evergreen contracts that renew automatically until canceled by either party. These contracts provide for sales that are priced daily at prevailing market prices. Also, from time to time, the Company will enter into physical term sales contracts. These term contracts typically have a firm transportation commitment and often provide for a higher than prevailing market price.

Apache’s U.S. NGL production is sold under contracts with prices based on Gulf Coast supply and demand conditions, less the costs for transportation and fractionation, or on a weighted-average sales price received by the purchaser.

U.S. Delivery Commitments

The Company has entered into long-term delivery commitments for natural gas and crude oil, which require Apache to deliver an average of 270 Bcf of natural gas per year for the period from 2020 through 2029 at variable, market-based pricing and deliver an average of 6.7 MMbbl of crude oil per year from 2020 through 2025 at variable, market-based pricing.

Apache currently expects to fulfill its delivery commitments with production from its proved reserves, production from continued development and/or spot market purchases as necessary. Apache may also enter into contractual arrangements to reduce its delivery commitments. The Company has not experienced any significant constraints in satisfying the committed quantities required by its delivery commitments.

For more information regarding the Company’s commitments, please see Part II, Item 7—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Capital Resources and Liquidity—Contractual Obligations.

International

In


, international assets contributed

41 percent

of Apache’s production and

56 percent

of oil and gas revenues.

Approximately

32 percent

of estimated proved reserves at year-end were located outside the U.S.

Apache has two international regions:

•

The Egypt region, which includes onshore conventional assets in Egypt’s Western Desert.

•

The North Sea region, which includes offshore assets based in the United Kingdom.

The Company also has an offshore exploration program in Suriname.

Egypt

Apache has 24 years of exploration, development and operations experience in Egypt and is one of the largest acreage holders in Egypt’s Western Desert. At year-end


, the Company held 5.1 million gross acres in 24 separate concessions.

Development leases within concessions currently have expiration dates ranging from 4 to 24 years, with extensions possible for additional commercial discoveries or on a negotiated basis. Approximately 70 percent of the Company’s gross acreage in Egypt is undeveloped, providing Apache with considerable exploration and development opportunities for the future.

Apache’s Egypt operations are conducted pursuant to production sharing contracts (PSCs). Under the terms of the Company’s PSCs, the contractor partner (Contractor) bears the risk and cost of exploration, development, and production activities. In return, if exploration is successful, the Contractor receives entitlement to variable physical volumes of hydrocarbons, representing recovery of the costs incurred and a stipulated share of production after cost recovery. Additionally, the Contractor’s income taxes, which remain the liability of the Contractor under domestic law, are paid by Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation (EGPC) on behalf of the Contractor out of EGPC’s production entitlement. Income taxes paid to the Arab Republic of Egypt on behalf of the Contractor are recognized as oil and gas sales revenue and income tax expense and reflected as production and estimated reserves. Because Contractor cost recovery entitlement and income taxes paid on its behalf are determined as a monetary amount, the quantities of production entitlement and estimated reserves attributable to these monetary amounts will fluctuate with commodity prices. In addition, because the Contractor income taxes are paid by EGPC, the amount of the income tax has no economic impact on Apache’s Egypt operations despite impacting Apache’s production and reserves.


The Company’s estimated proved reserves in Egypt are reported under the economic interest method and exclude the host country’s share of reserves. In addition, Sinopec International Petroleum Exploration and Production Corporation (Sinopec) holds a one-third minority participation interest in Apache’s oil and gas operations in Egypt. The Egypt region, including the one-third noncontrolling interest, contributed

28 percent

of


production and

19 percent

of year-end estimated proved reserves. Excluding the impacts of the noncontrolling interest, Egypt contributed

21 percent

of


production and

13 percent

of year-end estimated proved reserves.

In


, the region drilled 41 development and 23 exploration wells. A key component of the region’s success has been the ability to acquire and evaluate 3-D seismic surveys that enable Apache’s technical teams to consistently high-grade existing prospects and identify new targets across multiple pay horizons in the Cretaceous, Jurassic, and deeper Paleozoic formations. The Company has completed seismic surveys covering over 3 million acres to date. The region continues to build and enhance its drilling inventory, supplemented with recent seismic acquisitions and new play concept evaluations, on both new and existing acreage. Heading into 2020, the region plans to advance its large-scale seismic shoot and continue to build its prospect inventory.

North Sea

Apache has interests in approximately 419,000 gross acres in the U.K. North Sea. The region contributed

13 percent

of Apache’s


production and approximately

13 percent

of year-end estimated proved reserves.

Apache entered the North Sea in 2003 after acquiring an approximate 97 percent working interest in the Forties field (Forties). Since acquiring Forties, Apache has actively invested in the region and has established a large inventory of drilling prospects through successful exploration programs and the interpretation of 4-D seismic. Building upon its success in Forties, in 2011 Apache acquired Mobil North Sea Limited, providing the region with additional exploration and development opportunities across numerous fields, including operated interests in the Beryl, Ness, Nevis, Nevis South, Skene, and Buckland fields and a non-operated interest in the Maclure field. Apache also has a non-operated interest in the Nelson field acquired in 2011. The Beryl field, which is a geologically complex area with multiple fields and stacked pay potential, provides for significant exploration opportunity. The North Sea region plays a strategic role in Apache’s portfolio by providing competitive investment opportunities and potential reserve upside with high-impact exploration potential.

During


, the region drilled 11 development wells with a 100 percent success rate: five platform wells in the Forties field, three platform wells in the Beryl field, and three subsea wells in the Beryl area.

The North Sea region’s Storr exploration discovery came on-line in the fourth quarter of 2019, and its second well at Garten came on-line in the first quarter of 2020. The first well at the Company’s Storr development is a high-rate gas condensate well that is tied back to existing infrastructure at the Beryl Alpha platform. The Garten #2 well encountered approximately 1,200 feet of net pay and compares favorably to the Garten #1 well, which came on-line in November 2018 with initial 30-day production rates of 13 Mb/d and 17 MMcf/d from 700 feet of net pay. Apache holds a 100 percent working interest in the Garten complex.

In 2020, the Company plans to run one to two platform rigs in the North Sea between the Forties and Beryl assets as well as a semi-submersible rig drilling principally in the Beryl area where the Company has short-cycle subsea tie-back opportunities.

International Marketing

Apache’s natural gas production in Egypt is sold to EGPC primarily under an industry-pricing formula, a sliding scale based on Dated Brent crude oil with a minimum of $1.50 per MMBtu and a maximum of $2.65 per MMBtu, plus an upward adjustment for liquids content. Crude oil production is sold to third parties in the export market or to EGPC when called upon to supply domestic demand. Oil production sold to third parties is sold and exported from one of two terminals on the northern coast of Egypt. Oil production sold to EGPC is sold at prices related to the export market

.

Apache’s North Sea crude oil production is sold under term, entitlement volume contracts and fixed volume spot contracts with a market-based index price plus a differential to capture the higher market value under each type of arrangement. Natural gas from the Beryl field is processed through the Scottish Area Gas Evacuation (SAGE) gas plant, which Apache divested to Ancala Midstream Acquisitions Limited in late 2017. The gas is sold to a third party at the St. Fergus entry point of the national grid on a National Balancing Point index price basis. The condensate mix from the SAGE plant is processed further downstream. The split streams of propane and butane are sold on a monthly entitlement basis, and condensate is sold on a spot basis at the Braefoot Bay terminal using index pricing less transportation.

Other Exploration

New Ventures

Apache’s global New Ventures team provides exposure to new growth opportunities by looking outside of the Company’s traditional core areas and targeting higher-risk, higher-reward exploration opportunities located in frontier basins as well as new plays in more mature basins.


In December 2019, Apache entered into a joint venture agreement with Total S.A. to explore and develop Block 58 offshore Suriname. Apache holds a 50 percent working interest in Block 58, which comprises approximately 1.4 million acres in water depths ranging from less than 100 meters to more than 2,100 meters. During 2019, the Company drilled an exploration well, the Maka Central-1, in Block 58 and announced a significant oil discovery in January 2020. The well successfully tested for the presence of hydrocarbons in multiple stacked targets in the upper Cretaceous-aged Campanian and Santonian intervals and encountered both oil and gas condensate. The Company began drilling its second exploration well, Sapakara West-1, in January 2020. Following completion of the Sapakara West-1, the Company will drill a third, and likely a fourth exploration test in Block 58 during 2020.

Drilling Statistics

Worldwide in


, Apache drilled or participated in drilling 315 gross wells, with 299 (95 percent) completed as producers. Historically, Apache’s drilling activities in the U.S. have generally concentrated on exploitation and extension of existing producing fields rather than exploration. As a general matter, Apache’s operations outside of the U.S. focus on a mix of exploration and development wells. In addition to Apache’s completed wells, at year-end a number of wells had not yet reached completion: 105 gross (99.8 net) in the U.S., 25 gross (23.7 net) in Egypt, 5 gross (3.8 net) in the North Sea, and 1 gross (0.5 net) in Suriname.

The following table shows the results of the oil and gas wells drilled and completed for each of the last three fiscal years:

, approximately 19 percent of U.S. net undeveloped acreage was held by production.

As of

December 31, 2019

, Apache had 257,000 net undeveloped acres scheduled to expire by year-end


if production is not established or Apache takes no other action to extend the terms. Additionally, Apache has 1.4 million and 561,000 net undeveloped acres set to expire in


and


, respectively. The Company strives to extend the terms of many of these licenses and concession areas through operational or administrative actions but cannot assure that such extensions can be achieved on an economic basis or otherwise on terms agreeable to both the Company and third parties, including governments.


Exploration concessions in Apache’s Egypt region comprise a significant portion of Apache’s net undeveloped acreage expiring over the next three years. Apache has 98,000 net undeveloped acres expiring in Egypt during


. Approximately 1.3 million and 98,000 net undeveloped acres are set to expire in


and


, respectively. There were no reserves recorded on this undeveloped acreage. Apache will continue to pursue acreage extensions and access to new concessions in areas in which it believes exploration opportunities exist.

Additionally, Apache has exploration interests in Suriname consisting of 390,000 net undeveloped acres in Block 53 and 720,000 net undeveloped acres in Block 58 set to expire in 2022 and 2026, respectively, contingent on planned drilling activity. Apache has acquired 3-D seismic surveys over all the acreage. No reserves have been booked on this undeveloped acreage.

Estimated Proved Reserves and Future Net Cash Flows

Proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of natural gas, crude oil, condensate, and NGLs, which by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations. Estimated proved developed oil and gas reserves can be expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods. The Company reports all estimated proved reserves held under production-sharing arrangements utilizing the “economic interest” method, which excludes the host country’s share of reserves.

Estimated reserves that can be produced economically through application of improved recovery techniques are included in the “proved” classification when successful testing by a pilot project or the operation of an active, improved recovery program using reliable technology establishes the reasonable certainty for the engineering analysis on which the project or program is based. Economically producible means a resource that generates revenue that exceeds, or is reasonably expected to exceed, the costs of the operation. Reasonable certainty means a high degree of confidence that the quantities will be recovered. Reliable technology is a grouping of one or more technologies (including computational methods) that has been field-tested and has been demonstrated to provide reasonably certain results with consistency and repeatability in the formation being evaluated or in an analogous formation. In estimating its proved reserves, Apache uses several different traditional methods that can be classified in three general categories: (1) performance-based methods; (2) volumetric-based methods; and (3) analogy with similar properties. Apache will, at times, utilize additional technical analysis, such as computer reservoir models, petrophysical techniques, and proprietary 3-D seismic interpretation methods, to provide additional support for more complex reservoirs. Information from this additional analysis is combined with traditional methods outlined above to enhance the certainty of the Company’s reserve estimates.

Proved undeveloped reserves include those reserves that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion. Undeveloped reserves may be classified as proved reserves on undrilled acreage directly offsetting development areas that are reasonably certain of production when drilled, or where reliable technology provides reasonable certainty of economic producibility. Undrilled locations may be classified as having undeveloped reserves only if a development plan has been adopted indicating that they are scheduled to be drilled within five years, unless specific circumstances justify a longer time period.


The following table shows proved oil, NGL, and gas reserves as of

December 31, 2019

, based on average commodity prices in effect on the first day of each month in


, held flat for the life of the production, except where future oil and gas sales are covered by physical contract terms. This table shows reserves on a boe basis in which natural gas is converted to an equivalent barrel of oil based on a ratio of 6 Mcf to 1 bbl. This ratio is not reflective of the current price ratio between the two products.

(1)

Includes total proved developed and total proved undeveloped reserves of


MMboe and


MMboe, respectively, attributable to a one-third noncontrolling interest in Egypt.

As of

December 31, 2019

, Apache had total estimated proved reserves of


MMbbls of crude oil,


MMbbls of NGLs, and

1.6

Tcf of natural gas. Combined, these total estimated proved reserves are the volume equivalent of

1.0 billion

barrels of oil or 6.1 Tcf of natural gas, of which oil represents 55 percent. As of

December 31, 2019

, the Company’s proved developed reserves totaled


MMboe and estimated PUD reserves totaled


MMboe, or approximately 12 percent of worldwide total proved reserves. Apache has elected not to disclose probable or possible reserves in this filing. The Company does not have any fields that contain 15 percent or more of its total proved reserves for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017.

During


, Apache added


MMboe of proved reserves through exploration and development activity, partially offset by combined

downward

revisions of previously estimated reserves of


MMboe. Engineering and performance upward revisions accounted for


MMboe and downward revisions related to changes in product prices accounted for


MMboe. The Company also sold 107 MMboe of proved reserves associated with U.S. divestitures, primarily related to the sale of the Company’s Woodford-SCOOP and STACK plays and western Anadarko Basin assets.

The Company’s estimates of proved reserves, proved developed reserves, and PUD reserves as of

December 31, 2019

,


, and


, changes in estimated proved reserves during the last three years, and estimates of future net cash flows from proved reserves are contained in Note 18—Supplemental Oil and Gas Disclosures in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part IV, Item 15 of this Form 10-K. Estimated future net cash flows were calculated using a discount rate of 10 percent per annum, end of period costs, and an unweighted arithmetic average of commodity prices in effect on the first day of each of the previous 12 months, held flat for the life of the production, except where prices are defined by contractual arrangements.

Proved Undeveloped Reserves

The Company’s total estimated PUD reserves of


MMboe as of

December 31, 2019

, decreased by 35 MMboe from 153 MMboe of PUD reserves reported at the end of


. During the year, Apache converted 85 MMboe of PUD reserves to proved developed reserves through development drilling activity. In the U.S., Apache converted 72 MMboe, with the remaining 13 MMboe in Apache’s international areas. Apache sold 18 MMboe of PUD reserves in the U.S. and did not acquire any PUD reserves during the year. Apache added 119 MMboe of new PUD reserves through extensions and discoveries. Apache recognized a 7 MMboe upward engineering revision in proved undeveloped reserves during the year. Downward engineering revisions included 28 MMboe associated with product prices, 29 MMboe associated with revised development plans, and 1 MMboe associated with interest revisions.


During the year, a total of approximately $1.0 billion was spent on projects associated with proved undeveloped reserves. A portion of Apache’s costs incurred each year relate to development projects that will convert undeveloped reserves to proved developed reserves in future years. During 2019, Apache spent approximately $749 million on PUD reserve development activity in the U.S. and $264 million in the international areas. As of

December 31, 2019

, Apache had no material amounts of proved undeveloped reserves scheduled to be developed beyond five years from initial disclosure.

Preparation of Oil and Gas Reserve Information

Apache’s reported reserves are reasonably certain estimates which, by their very nature, are subject to revision. These estimates are reviewed throughout the year and revised either upward or downward, as warranted.

Apache’s proved reserves are estimated at the property level and compiled for reporting purposes by a centralized group of experienced reservoir engineers that is independent of the operating groups. These engineers interact with engineering and geoscience personnel in each of Apache’s operating areas and with accounting and marketing employees to obtain the necessary data for projecting future production, costs, net revenues, and ultimate recoverable reserves. All relevant data is compiled in a computer database application, to which only authorized personnel are given security access rights consistent with their assigned job function. Reserves are reviewed internally with senior management and presented to Apache’s Board of Directors in summary form on a quarterly basis. Annually, each property is reviewed in detail by our corporate and operating region engineers to ensure forecasts of operating expenses, netback prices, production trends, and development timing are reasonable.

Apache’s Executive Vice President of Development, Planning, Reserves and Fundamentals is the person primarily responsible for overseeing the preparation of our internal reserve estimates and for coordinating any reserves audits conducted by a third-party engineering firm. He has Bachelor of Science and Master of Science degrees in Petroleum Engineering and over 30 years of experience in the energy industry and energy sector of the banking industry. The Executive Vice President of Development, Planning, Reserves and Fundamentals reports directly to our Chief Executive Officer.

The estimate of reserves disclosed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K is prepared by the Company’s internal staff, and the Company is responsible for the adequacy and accuracy of those estimates. The Company engages Ryder Scott Company, L.P. Petroleum Consultants (Ryder Scott) to conduct a reserves audit, which includes a review of our processes and the reasonableness of our estimates of proved hydrocarbon liquid and gas reserves. The Company selects the properties for review by Ryder Scott based primarily on relative reserve value. The Company also considers other factors such as geographic location, new wells drilled during the year and reserves volume. During


, the properties selected for each country ranged from 83 to 95 percent of the total future net cash flows discounted at 10 percent. These properties also accounted for over 91 percent of the reserves value of Apache’s international proved reserves and 95 percent of the reserves value of Apache’s new wells drilled worldwide. In addition, all fields containing five percent or more of the Company’s total proved reserves volume were included in Ryder Scott’s review. The review covered 85 percent of total proved reserves by volume.

Ryder Scott’s review for the years


,


, and


covered 87, 86, and 92 percent, respectively, of the value and 85, 83, and 84 percent, respectively, of the volume of the Company’s worldwide estimated proved reserves. Ryder Scott’s


review covered 85, 86, and 80 percent of the estimated proved reserve volume in the U.S., Egypt, and U.K., respectively.

Ryder Scott’s review of


covered 82 percent of U.S., 85 percent of Egypt, and 81 percent of the U.K.’s total proved reserves.

Ryder Scott’s review of


covered 84 percent of U.S., 85 percent of Egypt, and 81 percent of the U.K.’s total proved reserves.

The Company has filed Ryder Scott’s independent report as an exhibit to this Form 10-K.

According to Ryder Scott’s opinion, based on their review, including the data, technical processes, and interpretations presented by Apache, the overall procedures and methodologies utilized by Apache in determining the proved reserves comply with the current SEC regulations, and the overall proved reserves for the reviewed properties as estimated by Apache are, in aggregate, reasonable within the established audit tolerance guidelines as set forth in the Society of Petroleum Engineers auditing standards.


ALTUS MIDSTREAM ASSETS

In November 2018, Apache completed a transaction with Altus Midstream Company and its then wholly-owned subsidiary Altus Midstream LP (collectively, Altus) to create a pure-play, Permian Basin to Gulf Coast midstream C-corporation anchored by gathering, processing, and transmission assets at Alpine High. Pursuant to the agreement, Apache contributed certain Alpine High midstream assets and options to acquire equity interests in five separate third-party pipeline projects (the Pipeline Options) to Altus Midstream LP and/or its subsidiaries. In exchange for the assets, Apache received economic voting and non-economic voting shares in Altus Midstream Company and limited partner interests in Altus Midstream LP, representing an approximate 79 percent ownership interest in the combined entities.

Apache fully consolidates the assets and liabilities of Altus in its consolidated financial statements, with a corresponding noncontrolling interest reflected separately.

Gathering, Processing, and Transmission Assets

Altus owns, develops, and operates gas gathering, processing, and transmission assets in the Permian Basin of West Texas. Altus generates revenue by providing fee-based natural gas gathering, compression, processing, and transmission services for Apache’s production from its Alpine High resource play. As of December 31, 2019, Altus’ assets included approximately 178 miles of in-service natural gas gathering pipelines, approximately 55 miles of residue-gas pipelines with four market connections, and approximately 38 miles of NGL pipelines. Three cryogenic processing trains, each with nameplate capacity of 200 MMcf/d, were placed into service during 2019. Other assets include an NGL truck loading terminal with six Lease Automatic Custody Transfer units and eight NGL bullet tanks with 90,000 gallon capacity per tank. Altus’ existing gathering, processing, and transmission infrastructure is expected to provide capacity levels capable of fulfilling its midstream contracts to service Apache’s production from Alpine High and additional third-party customers as the market activity in the area continues to develop.

Apache, as part of its fourth quarter 2019 capital planning review, notified Altus of its intention to materially reduce funding to Alpine High. This notification prompted Altus management to assess its long-lived infrastructure assets for impairment given the expected reduction to future throughput volumes. Altus subsequently recorded impairments on its gathering, processing, and transmission assets. For further discussion of these impairments, please see Note 1 “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in within Part IV, Item 15 of this Form 10-K.

Pipeline Options and Equity Interests

Gulf Coast Express Pipeline

In December 2018, Altus Midstream LP closed on the exercise of its option to acquire a 15 percent equity interest in the Gulf Coast Express Pipeline (GCX) from Kinder Morgan Texas Pipeline LLC (Kinder Morgan). Altus Midstream LP acquired an additional 1 percent equity interest in May 2019, for a total 16 percent equity interest in GCX. GCX is a long-haul natural gas pipeline with capacity of approximately 2.0 Bcf/d and transports natural gas from the Waha area in northern Pecos County, Texas to the Agua Dulce Hub near the Texas Gulf Coast. GCX is operated by Kinder Morgan and was placed into service in September 2019.

EPIC Crude Oil Pipeline

In March 2019, Altus Midstream LP’s subsidiary closed on the exercise of its option with EPIC Pipeline LP, thereby acquiring a 15 percent equity interest in the EPIC crude oil pipeline (EPIC). The long-haul crude oil pipeline extends from the Orla area in northern Reeves County, Texas to the Port of Corpus Christi, Texas, and has Permian Basin initial throughput capacity of approximately 600 Mb/d. The project includes terminals in Orla, Pecos, Crane, Wink, Midland, Hobson, and Gardendale, Texas with Port of Corpus Christi connectivity and export access. It services Delaware Basin, Midland Basin, and Eagle Ford Shale production. EPIC is operated by EPIC Consolidated Operations, LLC and was commissioned in February 2020.

Permian Highway Pipeline

In May 2019, Altus Midstream LP’s subsidiary closed on the exercise of its option with Kinder Morgan, thereby acquiring an approximate 26.7 percent equity interest in the Permian Highway Pipeline (PHP). Upon completion, the long-haul natural gas pipeline is expected to have capacity of approximately 2.1 Bcf/d and will transport natural gas from the Waha area in northern Pecos County, Texas to the Katy, Texas area with connections to U.S. Gulf Coast and Mexico markets. PHP will be operated by Kinder Morgan and is expected to be in service in early 2021.

Shin Oak NGL Pipeline

In July 2019, Altus Midstream LP’s subsidiary closed on the exercise of its option with Enterprise Products Operating LLC (Enterprise Products), thereby acquiring a 33 percent equity interest in Breviloba LLC, which owns Shin Oak NGL Pipeline (Shin Oak). The long-haul NGL pipeline has capacity of up to 550 Mb/d and transports NGL production from the Orla area in northern Reeves County, Texas through the Waha area in northern Pecos County, Texas, and on to Mont Belvieu, Texas. Shin Oak is operated by Enterprise Products and was placed into service during 2019.


Pipeline Option Outstanding

Salt Creek NGL Pipeline

Altus Midstream LP’s subsidiary’s option to acquire a 50 percent equity interest in the Salt Creek NGL Pipeline, an intra-basin NGL pipeline, was originally set to expire on January 31, 2020; however, the parties executed an extension for the option until March 2, 2020.

TITLE TO INTERESTS

As is customary in our industry, a preliminary review of title records, which may include opinions or reports of appropriate professionals or counsel, is made at the time we acquire properties. We believe that our title to all of the various interests set forth above is satisfactory and consistent with the standards generally accepted in the oil and gas industry, subject only to immaterial exceptions that do not detract substantially from the value of the interests or materially interfere with their use in our operations. The interests owned by us may be subject to one or more royalty, overriding royalty, or other outstanding interests (including disputes related to such interests) customary in the industry. The interests may additionally be subject to obligations or duties under applicable laws, ordinances, rules, regulations, and orders of arbitral or governmental authorities. In addition, the interests may be subject to burdens such as production payments, net profits interests, liens incident to operating agreements and current taxes, development obligations under oil and gas leases, and other encumbrances, easements, and restrictions, none of which detract substantially from the value of the interests or materially interfere with their use in our operations.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT APACHE

Response Plans and Available Resources

Apache and its wholly owned subsidiary, Apache Deepwater LLC (ADW), developed Oil Spill Response Plans (the Plans) for their respective Gulf of Mexico operations and offshore operations in the North Sea and Suriname, which ensure rapid and effective responses to spill events that may occur on such entities’ operated properties. Annually, drills are conducted to measure and maintain the effectiveness of the Plans.


Apache is a member of Oil Spill Response Limited (OSRL), a large international oil spill response cooperative, which entitles any Apache entity worldwide to access OSRL’s services. Apache also has a contract for response resources and services with National Response Corporation (NRC). NRC is the world’s largest commercial Oil Spill Response Organization and is the global leader in providing end-to-end environmental, industrial, and emergency response solutions with operating bases in 13 countries.

In the event of a spill in the Gulf of Mexico, Clean Gulf Associates (CGA) is the primary oil spill response association available to Apache and ADW. Both Apache and ADW are members of CGA, a not-for-profit association of producing and pipeline companies operating in the Gulf of Mexico. CGA was created to provide a means of effectively staging response equipment and providing immediate spill response for its member companies’ operations in the Gulf of Mexico.

Additionally, Apache is an active member of Wild Well Control’s WellCONTAINED Subsea Containment System for Suriname operations. This membership includes contingency planning, and response, to an uncontrolled subsea well event. Apache utilizes a detailed Source Control Emergency Response Plan (SCERP) for offshore Suriname planning. The SCERP has been designed to ensure that the goals of Apache’s source control emergency preparedness efforts will be met in the unlikely event of an actual response to an uncontrolled well event. This includes the use of subsea dispersant systems and field deployment of one of Wild Well Control’s containment system capping stacks.

Competitive Conditions

The oil and gas business is highly competitive in the exploration for and acquisitions of reserves, the acquisition of oil and gas leases, equipment and personnel required to find and produce reserves, and the gathering and marketing of oil, gas, and natural gas liquids. Our competitors include national oil companies, major integrated oil and gas companies, other independent oil and gas companies, and participants in other industries supplying energy and fuel to industrial, commercial, and individual consumers.

Certain of our competitors may possess financial or other resources substantially larger than we possess or have established strategic long-term positions and maintain strong governmental relationships in countries in which we may seek new entry. As a consequence, we may be at a competitive disadvantage in bidding for leases or drilling rights.

However, we believe our diversified portfolio of core assets, which comprises large acreage positions and well-established production bases across three geographic areas, our balanced production mix between oil and gas, our management and incentive systems, and our experienced personnel give us a strong competitive position relative to many of our competitors who do not possess similar geographic and production diversity. Our global position provides a large inventory of geologic and geographic opportunities in the geographic areas in which we have producing operations to which we can reallocate capital investments in response to changes in commodity prices, local business environments, and markets. It also reduces the risk that we will be materially impacted by an event in a specific area or country.

Environmental Compliance

As an owner or lessee and operator of oil and gas properties and facilities, we are subject to numerous federal, state, local, and foreign country laws and regulations relating to discharge of materials into, and protection of, the environment. These laws and regulations may, among other things, impose liability on the lessee under an oil and gas lease for the cost of pollution clean-up resulting from operations, subject the lessee to liability for pollution damages and require suspension or cessation of operations in affected areas. Although environmental requirements have a substantial impact upon the energy industry as a whole, we do not believe that these requirements affect us differently, to any material degree, than other companies in our industry.

We have made and will continue to make expenditures in our efforts to comply with these requirements, which we believe are necessary business costs in the oil and gas industry. We have established policies for continuing compliance with environmental laws and regulations, including regulations applicable to our operations in all countries in which we do business. We have established operating procedures and training programs designed to limit the environmental impact of our field facilities and identify and comply with changes in existing laws and regulations. The costs incurred under these policies and procedures are inextricably connected to normal operating expenses such that we are unable to separate expenses related to environmental matters; however, we do not believe expenses related to training and compliance with regulations and laws that have been adopted or enacted to regulate the discharge of materials into the environment will have a material impact on our capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position.


ITEM 1A.

RISK FACTORS

Our business activities and the value of our securities are subject to significant hazards and risks, including those described below. If any of such events should occur, our business, financial condition, liquidity, and/or results of operations could be materially harmed, and holders and purchasers of our securities could lose part or all of their investments. Additional risks relating to our securities may be included in the prospectuses for securities we issue in the future.

Crude oil, natural gas, and NGL price volatility could adversely affect our operating results and the price of our common stock.

Our revenues, operating results, and future rate of growth depend highly upon the prices we receive for our crude oil, natural gas, and NGL production. Historically, the markets for these commodities have been volatile and are likely to continue to be volatile in the future. For example, the NYMEX daily settlement price for the prompt month oil contract in


ranged from a high of $66.30 per barrel to a low of $45.89 per barrel. The NYMEX daily settlement price for the prompt month natural gas contract in


ranged from a high of $3.59 per MMBtu to a low of $2.07 per MMBtu. The market prices for crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs depend on factors beyond our control. These factors include demand, which fluctuates with changes in market and economic conditions, and other factors, including:

•

worldwide and domestic supplies of crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs;

•

actions taken by foreign oil and gas producing nations, including the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC);

•

political conditions and events (including instability, changes in governments, or armed conflict) in oil and gas producing regions;

•

the level of global crude oil and natural gas inventories;

•

the price and level of imported foreign crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs;

•

the price and availability of alternative fuels, including coal and biofuels;

•

the availability of pipeline capacity and infrastructure;

•

the availability of crude oil transportation and refining capacity;

•

weather conditions;

•

domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes; and

•

the overall economic environment.

Our results of operations, as well as the carrying value of our oil and gas properties, are substantially dependent upon the prices of oil, natural gas, and NGLs, which have declined significantly since June 2014. Despite slight increases in oil and natural gas prices in


, prices have remained significantly lower than levels seen in recent years, which has adversely affected our revenues, operating income, cash flow, and proved reserves. Continued low prices could have a material adverse impact on our operations and limit our ability to fund capital expenditures. Without the ability to fund capital expenditures, we would be unable to replace reserves and production. Sustained low prices of crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs may further adversely impact our business as follows:

•

limiting our financial condition, liquidity, and/or ability to fund planned capital expenditures and operations;

•

reducing the amount of crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs that we can produce economically;

•

causing us to delay or postpone some of our capital projects;

•

reducing our revenues, operating income, and cash flows;

•

limiting our access to sources of capital, such as equity and long-term debt;

•

reducing the carrying value of our oil and gas properties, resulting in additional non-cash impairments;

•

reducing the carrying value of our gathering, processing, and transmission facilities, resulting in additional impairments; or

•

reducing the carrying value of goodwill.


Our ability to sell crude oil, natural gas, or NGLs and/or receive market prices for these commodities and/or meet volume commitments under transportation services agreements may be adversely affected by pipeline and gathering system capacity constraints, the inability to procure and resell volumes economically, and various transportation interruptions.

A portion of our crude oil, natural gas, and NGL production in any region may be interrupted, limited, or shut in from time to time for numerous reasons, including as a result of weather conditions, accidents, loss of pipeline or gathering system access, field labor issues or strikes, or capital constraints that limit the ability of third parties to construct gathering systems, processing facilities, or interstate pipelines to transport our production, or we might voluntarily curtail production in response to market conditions. If a substantial amount of our production is interrupted at the same time, it could temporarily adversely affect our cash flows. Additionally, if we are unable to procure and resell third-party volumes at or above a net price that covers the cost of transportation, our cash flows could be adversely affected.

Future economic conditions in the U.S. and certain international markets may materially adversely impact our operating results.

Current global market conditions and uncertainty, including the economic instability in Europe and certain emerging markets, are likely to have significant long-term effects on our operating results. Global economic growth drives demand for energy from all sources, including fossil fuels. A lower future economic growth rate could result in decreased demand growth for our oil and gas production as well as lower commodity prices, which would reduce our cash flows from operations and our profitability.

Weather and climate may have a significant adverse impact on our revenues and production.

Demand for oil and gas are, to a significant degree, dependent on weather and climate, which impact the price we receive for the commodities we produce. In addition, our exploration and development activities and equipment can be adversely affected by severe weather, such as freezing temperatures, hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico, or storms in the North Sea, which may cause a loss of production from temporary cessation of activity or lost or damaged equipment. Our planning for normal climatic variation, insurance programs, and emergency recovery plans may inadequately mitigate the effects of such weather conditions, and not all such effects can be predicted, eliminated, or insured against.

Our operations involve a high degree of operational risk, particularly risk of personal injury, damage or loss of equipment, and environmental accidents.

Our operations are subject to hazards and risks inherent in the drilling, production, and transportation of crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs, including:

•

well blowouts, explosions, and cratering;

•

pipeline or other facility ruptures and spills;

•

fires;

•

formations with abnormal pressures;

•

equipment malfunctions;

•

hurricanes, storms, and/or cyclones, which could affect our operations in areas such as on and offshore the Gulf Coast and North Sea, and other natural and anthropogenic disasters and weather conditions; and

•

surface spillage and surface or ground water contamination from petroleum constituents, saltwater, or hydraulic fracturing chemical additives.

Failure or loss of equipment, as the result of equipment malfunctions, cyberattacks, or natural disasters such as hurricanes, could result in property damages, personal injury, environmental pollution, and other damages for which we could be liable. Litigation arising from a catastrophic occurrence, such as a well blowout, explosion, fire at a location where our equipment and services are used, or ground water contamination from hydraulic fracturing chemical additives may result in substantial claims for damages. Ineffective containment of a drilling well blowout or pipeline rupture or surface spillage and surface or ground water contamination from petroleum constituents or hydraulic fracturing chemical additives could result in extensive environmental pollution and substantial remediation expenses. If a significant amount of our production is interrupted, our containment efforts prove to be ineffective, or litigation arises as the result of a catastrophic occurrence, our cash flows and, in turn, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.


A terrorist or cyberattack targeting systems and infrastructure used by us or others in the oil and gas industry may adversely impact our operations.

Our business has become increasingly dependent on digital technologies to conduct certain exploration, development, and production activities. We depend on digital technology to estimate quantities of oil and gas reserves, process and record financial and operating data, analyze seismic and drilling information, communicate with our employees and third-party partners, and conduct many of our activities. Unauthorized access to our digital technology could lead to operational disruption, data corruption, communication interruption, loss of intellectual property, loss of confidential and fiduciary data, and loss or corruption of reserves or other proprietary information. Strategic targets, such as energy-related assets, may be at greater risk of future terrorist attacks, environmental activist group activities, or cyberattacks than other targets in the United States. Also, external digital technologies control nearly all of the oil and gas distribution and refining systems in the United States and abroad, which are necessary to transport and market our production. A cyberattack directed at oil and gas distribution systems could damage critical distribution and storage assets or the environment, delay or prevent delivery of production to markets, and make it difficult or impossible to accurately account for production and settle transactions. Any such terrorist attack, environmental activist group activity, or cyberattack that affects the Company or our customers, suppliers, or others with whom we do business could have a material adverse effect on our business, cause it to incur a material financial loss, subject it to possible legal claims and liability, and/or damage our reputation.

While certain of our insurance policies may allow for coverage of associated damages resulting from such events, if we were to incur a significant liability for which we were not fully insured, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, the proceeds of any such insurance may not be paid in a timely manner and may be insufficient if such an event were to occur.

While we have experienced cyberattacks in the past, we have not suffered any material losses as a result of such attacks; however, there is no assurance that we will not suffer such losses in the future. Further, as cyberattacks continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any vulnerabilities to cyberattacks. In addition, cyberattacks against us or others in our industry could result in additional regulations, which could lead to increased regulatory compliance costs, insurance coverage cost, or capital expenditures. The Company cannot predict the potential impact to our business or the energy industry resulting from additional regulations.

Our commodity price risk management and trading activities may prevent us from benefiting fully from price increases and may expose us to other risks.

To the extent that we engage in price risk management activities to protect ourselves from commodity price declines, we may be prevented from realizing the benefits of price increases above the levels of the derivative instruments used to manage price risk. In addition, our hedging arrangements may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances, including instances in which:

•

our production falls short of the hedged volumes;

•

there is a widening of price-basis differentials between delivery points for our production and the delivery point assumed in the hedge arrangement;

•

the counterparties to our hedging or other price risk management contracts fail to perform under those arrangements; or

•

an unexpected event materially impacts commodity prices.

The credit risk of financial institutions could adversely affect us.

We have exposure to different counterparties, and we have entered into transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including commercial banks, investment banks, insurance companies, other investment funds, and other institutions. These transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty. Deterioration in the credit or financial markets may impact the credit ratings of our current and potential counterparties and affect their ability to fulfill their existing obligations to us and their willingness to enter into future transactions with us. We may also have exposure to financial institutions in the form of derivative transactions in connection with any hedges. We also have exposure to insurance companies in the form of claims under our policies. In addition, if any lender under our credit facilities is unable to fund its commitment, our liquidity will be reduced by an amount up to the aggregate amount of such lender’s commitment under our credit facilities.


We are exposed to a risk of financial loss if a counterparty fails to perform under a derivative contract. This risk of counterparty non-performance is of particular concern given the recent volatility of the financial markets and significant decline in commodity prices, which could lead to sudden changes in a counterparty’s liquidity and impair its ability to perform under the terms of the derivative contract. We are unable to predict sudden changes in a counterparty’s creditworthiness or ability to perform. Even if we do accurately predict sudden changes, our ability to negate the risk may be limited depending upon market conditions. Furthermore, the bankruptcy of one or more of our hedge providers or some other similar proceeding or liquidity constraint might make it unlikely that we would be able to collect all or a significant portion of amounts owed to us by the distressed entity or entities. During periods of falling commodity prices, our hedge receivable positions increase, which increases our exposure. If the creditworthiness of our counterparties deteriorates and results in their nonperformance, we could incur a significant loss.

The distressed financial conditions of our purchasers and partners could have an adverse impact on us in the event they are unable to pay us for the products or services we provide or to reimburse us for their share of costs.

Concerns about global economic conditions and the volatility of oil, natural gas, and NGL prices have had a significant adverse impact on the oil and gas industry. We are exposed to risk of financial loss from trade, joint venture, joint interest billing, and other receivables. We sell our crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs to a variety of purchasers. As operator, we pay expenses and bill our non-operating partners for their respective shares of costs. As a result of current economic conditions and the severe decline in commodity prices, some of our customers and non-operating partners may experience severe financial problems that may have a significant impact on their creditworthiness. We cannot provide assurance that one or more of our financially distressed customers or non-operating partners will not default on their obligations to us or that such a default or defaults will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, future results of operations, or future cash flows. Furthermore, the bankruptcy of one or more of our customers or non-operating partners or some other similar proceeding or liquidity constraint might make it unlikely that we would be able to collect all or a significant portion of amounts owed by the distressed entity or entities. Nonperformance by a trade creditor or non-operating partner could result in significant financial losses.

A downgrade in our credit rating could negatively impact our cost of and ability to access capital.

We receive debt ratings from the major credit rating agencies in the United States. Factors that may impact our credit ratings include debt levels, planned asset purchases or sales, and near-term and long-term production growth opportunities. Liquidity, asset quality, cost structure, product mix, commodity pricing levels, and other factors are also considered by the rating agencies. A ratings downgrade could adversely impact our ability to access debt markets in the future and increase the cost of future debt; past ratings downgrades have required, and any future downgrades may require, us to post letters of credit or other forms of collateral for certain obligations. Throughout


, our credit rating remained unchanged by Moody’s at Baa3/Stable and Standard and Poor’s

at BBB/Stable. Any future downgrades could result in additional postings of collateral ranging from approximately $864 million to $1.4 billion, depending upon timing and availability of tax relief.

Market conditions may restrict our ability to obtain funds for future development and working capital needs, which may limit our financial flexibility.

The financial markets are subject to fluctuation and are vulnerable to unpredictable shocks. We have a significant development project inventory and an extensive exploration portfolio, which will require substantial future investment. We and/or our partners may need to seek financing in order to fund these or other future activities. Our future access to capital, as well as that of our partners and contractors, could be limited if the debt or equity markets are constrained. This could significantly delay development of our property interests.

The discontinuation of LIBOR, and the adoption of an alternative reference rate, may have a material adverse impact on our floating rate indebtedness and financing costs.

Pursuant to the terms of our revolving credit facility (1) we may elect to use London Interbank Offering Rate (LIBOR) as a benchmark for establishing the interest rate on floating interest rate borrowings and (2) the commission payable to the lenders on the face amount of each outstanding letter of credit uses LIBOR as a benchmark. In July 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority (the regulatory authority over LIBOR) stated they will plan for a phase out of regulatory oversight of LIBOR after 2021 to allow for an orderly transition to an alternate reference rate. In the United States, the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (the working group formed to recommend an alternative rate to LIBOR) has identified the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) as its preferred alternative rate for LIBOR. There can be no guarantee that SOFR will become a widely accepted benchmark in place of LIBOR. Although the full impact of the transition away from LIBOR, including the discontinuance of LIBOR publication and the adoption of SOFR as the replacement rate for LIBOR, remains unclear, these changes may have an adverse impact on our floating rate indebtedness and financing costs under our revolving credit facility.


Our ability to declare and pay dividends is subject to limitations.

The payment of future dividends on our capital stock is subject to the discretion of our board of directors, which considers, among other factors, our operating results, overall financial condition, credit-risk considerations, and capital requirements, as well as general business and market conditions. Our board of directors is not required to declare dividends on our common stock and may decide not to declare dividends.

Any indentures and other financing agreements that we enter into in the future may limit our ability to pay cash dividends on our capital stock, including common stock. In addition, under Delaware law, dividends on capital stock may only be paid from “surplus,” which is the amount by which the fair value of our total assets exceeds the sum of our total liabilities, including contingent liabilities, and the amount of our capital; if there is no surplus, cash dividends on capital stock may only be paid from our net profits for the then-current and/or the preceding fiscal year. Further, even if we are permitted under our contractual obligations and Delaware law to pay cash dividends on common stock, we may not have sufficient cash to pay dividends in cash on our common stock.

Discoveries or acquisitions of additional reserves are needed to avoid a material decline in reserves and production.

The production rate from oil and gas properties generally declines as reserves are depleted, while related per-unit production costs generally increase as a result of decreasing reservoir pressures and other factors. Therefore, unless we add reserves through exploration and development activities, identify additional behind-pipe zones, secondary recovery reserves, or tertiary recovery reserves through engineering studies, or acquire additional properties containing proved reserves, our estimated proved reserves will decline materially as reserves are produced. Future oil and gas production is, therefore, highly dependent upon our level of success in acquiring or finding additional reserves on an economic basis. Furthermore, if oil or gas prices increase, our cost for additional reserves could also increase.

We may not realize an adequate return on wells that we drill.

Drilling for oil and gas involves numerous risks, including the risk that we will not encounter commercially productive oil or gas reservoirs. The wells we drill or participate in may not be productive, and we may not recover all or any portion of our investment in those wells. The seismic data and other technologies we use do not allow us to know conclusively prior to drilling a well that crude or natural gas is present or may be produced economically. The costs of drilling, completing, and operating wells are often uncertain, and drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed, or canceled as a result of a variety of factors including, but not limited to:

•

unexpected drilling conditions;

•

pressure or irregularities in formations;

•

equipment failures or accidents;

•

fires, explosions, blowouts, and surface cratering;

•

marine risks, such as capsizing, collisions, and hurricanes;

•

other adverse weather conditions; and

•

increases in the cost of or shortages or delays in the availability of drilling rigs and equipment.

Future drilling activities may not be successful, and, if unsuccessful, this failure could have an adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial condition. While all drilling, whether developmental or exploratory, involves these risks, exploratory drilling involves greater risks of dry holes or failure to find commercial quantities of hydrocarbons.

Material differences between the estimated and actual timing of critical events or costs may affect the completion and commencement of production from development projects.

We are involved in several large development projects, and the completion of these projects may be delayed beyond our anticipated completion dates. Our projects may be delayed by project approvals from joint venture partners, timely issuances of permits and licenses by governmental agencies, weather conditions, manufacturing and delivery schedules of critical equipment, and other unforeseen events. Delays and differences between estimated and actual timing of critical events may adversely affect our large development projects and our ability to participate in large-scale development projects in the future. In addition, our estimates of future development costs are based on current expectation of prices and other costs of equipment and personnel we will need to implement such projects. Our actual future development costs may be significantly higher than we currently estimate.


If costs become too high, our development projects may become uneconomic to us, and we may be forced to abandon such development projects.

We may fail to fully identify potential problems related to acquired reserves or to properly estimate those reserves.

Although we perform a review of properties that we acquire that we believe is consistent with industry practices, such reviews are inherently incomplete. It generally is not feasible to review in-depth every individual property involved in each acquisition. Ordinarily, we will focus our review efforts on the higher-value properties and will sample the remainder. However, even a detailed review of records and properties may not necessarily reveal existing or potential problems, nor will it permit us as a buyer to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to assess fully and accurately their deficiencies and potential. Inspections may not always be performed on every well, and environmental problems, such as groundwater contamination, are not necessarily observable even when an inspection is undertaken. Even when problems are identified, we often assume certain environmental and other risks and liabilities in connection with acquired properties. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved oil and gas reserves and future production rates and costs with respect to acquired properties, and actual results may vary substantially from those assumed in the estimates. In addition, there can be no assurance that acquisitions will not have an adverse effect upon our operating results, particularly during the periods in which the operations of acquired businesses are being integrated into our ongoing operations.

Our liabilities could be adversely affected in the event one or more of our transaction counterparties become the subject of a bankruptcy case.

From time to time we have divested noncore or nonstrategic domestic and international assets. The agreements relating to these transactions contain provisions pursuant to which liabilities related to past and future operations have been allocated between the parties by means of liability assumptions, indemnities, escrows, trusts, and similar arrangements. One of the most significant of these liabilities involves the decommissioning of wells and facilities previously owned by us. One or more of the counterparties in these transactions could fail to perform its obligations under these agreements as a result of financial distress. In the event that any such counterparty were to become the subject of a case or proceeding under Title 11 of the United States Code or any other relevant insolvency law or similar law (which we collectively refer to as Insolvency Laws), the counterparty may not perform its obligations under the agreements related to these transactions. In that case, our remedy in the proceeding would be a claim for damages for the breach of the contractual arrangements, which may be either a secured claim or an unsecured claim depending on whether or not we have collateral from the counterparty for the performance of the obligations. Resolution of our claim for damages in such a proceeding may be delayed, and we may be forced to use available cash to cover the costs of the obligations assumed by the counterparties under such agreements should they arise.

Despite the provisions in our agreements requiring purchasers of our state or federal leasehold interests to assume certain liabilities and obligations related to such interests, if a purchaser of such interests becomes the subject of a case or proceeding under relevant Insolvency Laws or becomes unable financially to perform such liabilities or obligations, we would expect the relevant governmental authorities to require us to perform and hold us responsible for such liabilities and obligations. In such event, we may be forced to use available cash to cover the costs of such liabilities and obligations should they arise.

If a court or a governmental authority were to make any of the foregoing determinations or take any of the foregoing actions, or any similar determination or action, it could adversely impact our cash flows, operations, or financial condition.

Crude oil, natural gas, and NGL reserves are estimates, and actual recoveries may vary significantly.

There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating crude oil, natural gas, and NGL reserves and their value. Reservoir engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs that cannot be measured in an exact manner. Because of the high degree of judgment involved, the accuracy of any reserve estimate is inherently imprecise and a function of the quality of available data and the engineering and geological interpretation. Our reserves estimates are based on 12-month average prices, except where contractual arrangements exist; therefore, reserves quantities will change when actual prices increase or decrease. In addition, results of drilling, testing, and production may substantially change the reserve estimates for a given reservoir over time. The estimates of our proved reserves and estimated future net revenues also depend on a number of factors and assumptions that may vary considerably from actual results, including:

•

historical production from the area compared with production from other areas;

•

the effects of regulations by governmental agencies, including changes to severance and excise taxes;

•

future operating costs and capital expenditures; and

•

workover and remediation costs.


For these reasons, estimates of the economically recoverable quantities of crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs attributable to any particular group of properties, classifications of those reserves, and estimates of the future net cash flows expected from them prepared by different engineers or by the same engineers but at different times may vary substantially. Accordingly, reserves estimates may be subject to upward or downward adjustment, and actual production, revenue, and expenditures with respect to our reserves likely will vary, possibly materially, from estimates.

Additionally, because some of our reserves estimates are calculated using volumetric analysis, those estimates are less reliable than the estimates based on a lengthy production history. Volumetric analysis involves estimating the volume of a reservoir based on the net feet of pay of the structure and an estimation of the area covered by the structure. In addition, realization or recognition of proved undeveloped reserves will depend on our development schedule and plans. A change in future development plans for proved undeveloped reserves could cause the discontinuation of the classification of these reserves as proved.

Certain of our undeveloped leasehold acreage is subject to leases that will expire over the next several years unless production is established on units containing the acreage.

A sizeable portion of our acreage is currently undeveloped. Unless production in paying quantities is established on units containing certain of these leases during their terms, the leases will expire. If our leases expire, we will lose our right to develop the related properties. Our drilling plans for these areas are subject to change based upon various factors, including drilling results, commodity prices, the availability and cost of capital, drilling and production costs, availability of drilling services and equipment, gathering system and pipeline transportation constraints, and regulatory approvals.

We may incur significant costs related to environmental matters.

As an owner or lessee and operator of oil and gas properties, we are subject to various federal, state, local, and foreign country laws and regulations relating to the discharge of materials into and protection of the environment. These laws and regulations may, among other things, impose liability on the lessee under an oil and gas lease for the cost of pollution cleanup and other remediation activities resulting from operations, subject the lessee to liability for pollution and other damages, limit or constrain operations in affected areas, and require suspension or cessation of operations in affected areas. Our efforts to limit our exposure to such liability and cost may prove inadequate and result in significant adverse effects to our results of operations. In addition, it is possible that the increasingly strict requirements imposed by environmental laws and enforcement policies could require us to make significant capital expenditures. Such capital expenditures could adversely impact our cash flows and our financial condition.

Our United States operations are subject to governmental risks.

Our United States operations have been, and at times in the future may be, affected by political developments and by federal, state, and local laws and regulations such as restrictions on production, changes in taxes, royalties and other amounts payable to governments or governmental agencies, price or gathering rate controls, and environmental protection laws and regulations.

In response to the Deepwater Horizon incident in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico in April 2010 and as directed by the Secretary of the U.S. Department of the Interior, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) and the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) issued guidelines and regulations regarding safety, environmental matters, drilling equipment, and decommissioning applicable to drilling in the Gulf of Mexico. These regulations imposed additional requirements and caused delays with respect to development and production activities in the Gulf of Mexico.

With respect to oil and gas operations in the Gulf of Mexico, the BOEM has issued a Notice to Lessees (NTL No. 2016-N01) significantly revising the obligations of companies operating in the Gulf of Mexico to provide supplemental assurances of performance with respect to plugging, abandonment, and decommissioning obligations associated with wells, platforms, structures, and facilities located upon or used in connection with such companies’ oil and gas leases. While requirements under the NTL have not yet been fully implemented by BOEM, the NTL will likely require that Apache provide additional security to BOEM with respect to plugging, abandonment, and decommissioning obligations relating to Apache’s current ownership interests in various Gulf of Mexico leases. We are working closely with BOEM to make arrangements for the provision of such additional required security, if such security becomes necessary under the NTL. Additionally, we are not able to predict the effect that these changes might have on counterparties to which Apache has sold Gulf of Mexico assets or with whom Apache has joint ownership. Such changes could cause the bonding obligations of such parties to increase substantially, thereby causing a significant impact on the counterparties’ solvency and ability to continue as a going concern.

New political developments, the enactment of new or stricter laws or regulations or other governmental actions impacting our United States operations, and increased liability for companies operating in this sector may adversely impact our results of operations.


Changes to existing regulations related to emissions and the impact of any changes in climate could adversely impact our business.

Certain countries where we operate, including the United Kingdom, either tax or assess some form of greenhouse gas (GHG) related fees on our operations. Exposure has not been material to date, although a change in existing regulations could adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations. Additionally, there has been discussion in other countries where we operate, including the United States, regarding legislation or regulation of GHG. Any such legislation or regulation, if enacted, could either tax or assess some form of GHG-related fees on our operations and could lead to increased operating expenses or cause us to make significant capital investments for infrastructure modifications.

In the event the predictions for rising temperatures and sea levels suggested by reports of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change do transpire, we do not believe those events by themselves are likely to impact our assets or operations. However, any increase in severe weather could have a material adverse effect on our assets and operations.

Negative public perception regarding us and/or our industry could have an adverse effect on our operations.

Negative public perception regarding us and/or our industry resulting from, among other things, concerns raised by advocacy groups about hydraulic fracturing, waste disposal, oil spills, and explosions of natural gas transmission lines may lead to increased regulatory scrutiny, which may, in turn, lead to new state and federal safety and environmental laws, regulations, guidelines, and enforcement interpretations. These actions may cause operational delays or restrictions, increased operating costs, additional regulatory burdens, and increased risk of litigation. Moreover, governmental authorities exercise considerable discretion in the timing and scope of permit issuance, and the public may engage in the permitting process, including through intervention in the courts. Negative public perception could cause the permits we require to conduct our operations to be withheld, delayed, or burdened by requirements that restrict our ability to profitably conduct our business.

Changes in tax rules and regulations, or interpretations thereof, may adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the TCJA) was signed into law. In addition to reducing the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent effective January 1, 2018, certain provisions in the TCJA move the U.S. away from a worldwide tax system and closer to a territorial system for earnings of foreign corporations, establishing a participation exemption system for taxation of foreign income. The new law includes a transition rule to effect this participation exemption regime. The TCJA also includes provisions which could impact or limit the Company’s ability to deduct interest expense or utilize net operating losses.

The U.S. federal and state income tax laws affecting oil and gas exploration, development, and extraction may be further modified by administrative, legislative, or judicial interpretation at any time. Previous legislative proposals, if enacted into law, could make significant changes to such laws, including the elimination of certain key U.S. federal income tax incentives currently available to oil and gas exploration and production companies. These changes include, but are not limited to, (i) the repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for oil and gas properties, (ii) the elimination of current deductions for intangible drilling and development costs, and (iii) an extension of the amortization period for certain geological and geophysical expenditures. The passage or adoption of these changes, or similar changes, could eliminate or postpone certain tax deductions that are currently available with respect to oil and gas exploration and development. We are unable to predict whether any of these changes or other proposals will be enacted. Any such changes could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

Proposed federal, state, or local regulation regarding hydraulic fracturing could increase our operating and capital costs.

Several proposals are before the U.S. Congress that, if implemented, would either prohibit or restrict the practice of hydraulic fracturing or subject the process to regulation under the Safe Drinking Water Act. Several states and political subdivisions are considering legislation, ballot initiatives, executive orders, or other actions to regulate hydraulic fracturing practices that could impose more stringent permitting, transparency, and well construction requirements on hydraulic-fracturing operations or otherwise seek to ban fracturing activities altogether. Hydraulic fracturing of wells and subsurface water disposal are also under public and governmental scrutiny due to potential environmental and physical impacts, including possible contamination of groundwater and drinking water and possible links to induced seismicity. In addition, some municipalities have significantly limited or prohibited drilling activities and/or hydraulic fracturing or are considering doing so. We routinely use fracturing techniques in the U.S. and other regions to expand the available space for natural gas and oil to migrate toward the wellbore. It is typically done at substantial depths in formations with low permeability.


Although it is not possible at this time to predict the final outcome of the governmental actions regarding hydraulic fracturing, any new federal, state, or local restrictions on hydraulic fracturing that may be imposed in areas in which we conduct business could result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions in the U.S.

International operations have uncertain political, economic, and other risks.

Our operations outside the United States are based primarily in Egypt and the United Kingdom. On a barrel equivalent basis, approximately

41 percent

of our


production was outside the United States, and approximately

32 percent

of our estimated proved oil and gas reserves on

December 31, 2019

, were located outside the United States. As a result, a significant portion of our production and resources are subject to the increased political and economic risks and other factors associated with international operations including, but not limited to:

•

general strikes and civil unrest;

•

the risk of war, acts of terrorism, expropriation and resource nationalization, and forced renegotiation or modification of existing contracts;

•

import and export regulations;

•

taxation policies, including royalty and tax increases and retroactive tax claims, and investment restrictions;

•

price control;

•

transportation regulations and tariffs;

•

constrained oil or natural gas markets dependent on demand in a single or limited geographical area;

•

exchange controls, currency fluctuations, devaluations, or other activities that limit or disrupt markets and restrict payments or the movement of funds;

•

laws and policies of the United States affecting foreign trade, including trade sanctions;

•

the effects of the U.K.’s withdrawal from the European Union, including any resulting instability in global financial markets or the value of foreign currencies such as the British pound;

•

the possibility of being subject to exclusive jurisdiction of foreign courts in connection with legal disputes relating to licenses to operate and concession rights in countries where we currently operate;

•

the possible inability to subject foreign persons, especially foreign oil ministries and national oil companies, to the jurisdiction of courts in the United States; and

•

difficulties in enforcing our rights against a governmental agency because of the doctrine of sovereign immunity and foreign sovereignty over international operations.

Foreign countries have occasionally asserted rights to oil and gas properties through border disputes. If a country claims superior rights to oil and gas leases or concessions granted to us by another country, our interests could decrease in value or be lost. Even our smaller international assets may affect our overall business and results of operations by distracting management’s attention from our more significant assets. Certain regions of the world in which we operate have a history of political and economic instability. This instability could result in new governments or the adoption of new policies that might result in a substantially more hostile attitude toward foreign investments such as ours. In an extreme case, such a change could result in termination of contract rights and expropriation of our assets. This could adversely affect our interests and our future profitability.

The impact that future terrorist attacks or regional hostilities, as have occurred in countries and regions in which we operate, may have on the oil and gas industry in general and on our operations in particular is not known at this time. Uncertainty surrounding military strikes or a sustained military campaign may affect operations in unpredictable ways, including disruptions of fuel supplies and markets, particularly oil, and the possibility that infrastructure facilities, including pipelines, production facilities, processing plants, and refineries, could be direct targets or indirect casualties of an act of terror or war. We may be required to incur significant costs in the future to safeguard our assets against terrorist activities.


A deterioration of conditions in Egypt or changes in the economic and political environment in Egypt could have an adverse impact on our business.

Deterioration in the political, economic, and social conditions or other relevant policies of the Egyptian government, such as changes in laws or regulations, export restrictions, expropriation of our assets or resource nationalization, and/or forced renegotiation or modification of our existing contracts with EGPC, or threats or acts of terrorism could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Our operations in Egypt, excluding the impacts of a one-third noncontrolling interest, contributed

21 percent

of our


production and accounted for

13 percent

of our year-end estimated proved reserves and

23 percent

of our estimated discounted future net cash flows.

Our operations are sensitive to currency rate fluctuations.

Our operations are sensitive to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly between the U.S. dollar and the British pound. Our financial statements, presented in U.S. dollars, may be affected by foreign currency fluctuations through both translation risk and transaction risk. Volatility in exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations, particularly through the weakening of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies.

We do not always control decisions made under joint operating agreements, and the parties under such agreements may fail to meet their obligations.

We conduct many of our E&P operations through joint operating agreements with other parties under which we may not control decisions, either because we do not have a controlling interest or are not an operator under the agreement. There is risk that these parties may at any time have economic, business, or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours, and, therefore, decisions may be made which are not what we believe to be in our best interest. Moreover, parties to these agreements may be unable to meet their economic or other obligations, and we may be required to fulfill those obligations alone. In either case, the value of our investment may be adversely affected.

We face strong industry competition that may have a significant negative impact on our results of operations.

Strong competition exists in all sectors of the oil and gas E&P industry. We compete with major integrated and other independent oil and gas companies for acquisitions of oil and gas leases, properties, and reserves, equipment and labor required to explore, develop, and operate those properties, and marketing of crude oil, natural gas, and NGL production. Crude oil, natural gas, and NGL prices impact the costs of properties available for acquisition and the number of companies with the financial resources to pursue acquisition opportunities. Many of our competitors have financial and other resources substantially larger than we possess and have established strategic, long-term positions and maintain strong governmental relationships in countries in which we may seek new entry. As a consequence, we may be at a competitive disadvantage in bidding for drilling rights. In addition, many of our larger competitors may have a competitive advantage when responding to factors that affect demand for oil and gas production, such as fluctuating worldwide commodity prices and levels of production, the cost and availability of alternative fuels, and the application of government regulations. We also compete in attracting and retaining personnel, including geologists, geophysicists, engineers, and other specialists. These competitive pressures may have a significant negative impact on our results of operations.

Our insurance policies do not cover all of the risks we face, which could result in significant financial exposure.

Exploration for and production of crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs can be hazardous, involving natural disasters and other events such as blowouts, cratering, fires, explosions, and loss of well control, which can result in damage to or destruction of wells or production facilities, injury to persons, loss of life, or damage to property or the environment. Our international operations are also subject to political risk. The insurance coverage that we maintain against certain losses or liabilities arising from our operations may be inadequate to cover any such resulting liability; moreover, insurance is not available to us against all operational risks.

Certain anti-takeover provisions in our charter and Delaware law could delay or prevent a hostile takeover.

Our charter authorizes our board of directors to issue preferred stock in one or more series and to determine the voting rights and dividend rights, dividend rates, liquidation preferences, conversion rights, redemption rights, including sinking fund provisions and redemption prices, and other terms and rights of each series of preferred stock. In addition, Delaware law imposes restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of 15 percent or more of our outstanding common stock. These provisions may deter hostile takeover attempts that could result in an acquisition of us that would have been financially beneficial to our shareholders.


We own an approximate 79 percent interest in Altus, which holds substantially all of our former gathering, processing and transmission assets in Alpine High. Altus may be subject to different risks than those described in this Form 10-K.

We own an approximate 79 percent interest in Altus, which holds substantially all of our former gathering, processing and transmission assets in Alpine High. Altus owns, develops, and operates a midstream energy asset network in the Permian Basin of West Texas, anchored by midstream service contracts to service Apache’s production from its Alpine High resource play. Altus primarily generates revenue by providing fee-based natural gas gathering, compression, processing and transmission services. Given the nature of its business, Altus may be subject to different and additional risks than those described in this Form 10-K. For a description of these risks, please refer to the Forms 10-K and 10-Q filed by ALTM.

Overview

Apache’s mission is to grow in an innovative, safe, environmentally responsible, and profitable manner for the long-term benefit of its stakeholders. Apache is focused on rigorous portfolio management, disciplined financial structure, and optimization of returns.

Apache Corporation, a Delaware corporation formed in 1954, is an independent energy company that explores for, develops, and produces natural gas, crude oil, and NGLs. Apache currently has exploration and production operations in three geographic areas: the U.S., Egypt, and offshore the U.K. in the North Sea (North Sea). Apache also has exploration interests in Suriname and other international locations that may, over time, result in reportable discoveries and development opportunities. Apache’s midstream business is operated by Altus Midstream Company through its subsidiary Altus Midstream LP (collectively, Altus). Altus owns, develops, and operates a midstream energy asset network in the Permian Basin of West Texas. Additionally, Altus owns equity interests in a total of four Permian Basin pipelines that will access various points along the Texas Gulf Coast, providing it with fully integrated, wellhead-to-water connectivity.

Apache’s U.S. unconventional assets are complemented by its conventional international assets in Egypt and the North Sea, each of which adds to the Company’s inventory of exploration and development opportunities and generates cash flows in excess of current capital investments, facilitating the Company’s ability to develop its onshore U.S. properties while maintaining financial flexibility in a volatile commodity price environment. Apache’s diverse portfolio and asset inventory allows for very flexible allocation of capital across the portfolio. Consistent with this strategy, Apache closely monitors hydrocarbon pricing fundamentals and will reallocate capital as part of its ongoing planning process. For additional detail on the Company’s forward capital investment outlook, refer to the “Capital and Operational Outlook” below.

For 2019, Apache reduced its upstream capital costs incurred by approximately 27 percent compared to the prior year in response to lower realized commodity prices. Worldwide crude oil price realizations declined

8 percent

, and natural gas and natural gas liquids price realizations were lower by 27 percent and 41 percent, respectively, compared to 2018. Apache’s capital spending reduction aligned with its

$2.9 billion

of cash from operating activities generated in 2019, which was down

$910 million

or

24 percent

from the prior year. During the year, the Company advanced key environmental, social and governance initiatives, met corporate goals around capital spending and cash returns, and further streamlined and repositioned its asset portfolio. Specifically, the Company closed on several divestitures of non-core, gas-weighted assets in the Oklahoma and Texas panhandle areas. These decisions progressed Apache’s efforts to invest to prioritize long-term returns and cash flow, strengthen its balance sheet, and maintain the Company’s dividend.

During


, Apache reported a loss attributable to common stock of

$3.6 billion

, or

$9.43

per diluted common share, compared to net income of

$40 million

, or

$0.11

per share in


. The


results include asset impairments of

$2.9 billion

and unproved leasehold impairments of

$619 million

. These non-cash impairments were primarily related to the Company’s upstream assets in Alpine High and gathering and processing assets from the consolidated results of Altus Midstream. Given the prevailing gas and NGL price environment and disappointing performance of recent multi-well development pads, Apache materially reduced planned investment and currently has no future drilling plans at Alpine High.


Operational Highlights

Key operational highlights for the year include:

United States

•

Equivalent production from the Permian region, which accounts for

91 percent

of Apache’s total U.S. production,

increased

21 percent

from


to 2019 driven by the success of the Midland Basin oil-focused drilling program and production increases at its Alpine High field. The Permian region averaged 11 operated rigs during the year, drilling 233 gross wells.

International

•

The Egypt region’s gross equivalent production

decreased

7 percent

and net production

decreased

11 percent

from 2018 primarily a result of natural decline and fewer wells brought on-line during the period. The region continues to build and enhance its robust drilling inventory, supplemented with recent seismic acquisitions and new play concept evaluations, on both new and existing acreage.

•

The North Sea region averaged 3 rigs during 2019, drilling 11 gross development wells with a 100 percent success rate. During the year, the region averaged production of


Mboe/d and contributed

$1.3 billion

of revenues. Production

increased

9 percent

from 2018, primarily the result of production from the Garten field, which came on-line in November 2018.

•

The North Sea region’s Storr exploration discovery came on-line in the fourth quarter of 2019, and its second well at Garten came on-line in the first quarter of 2020. The first well at the Company’s Storr development is a high-rate gas condensate well that is tied back to existing infrastructure at the Beryl Alpha platform. The Garten #2 well encountered approximately 1,200 feet of net pay and compares favorably to the Garten #1 well, which came on-line in November 2018 with initial 30-day production rates of 13 Mb/d and 17 MMcf/d from 700 feet of net pay. Apache holds a 100 percent working interest in the Garten complex.

•

During 2019, the Company drilled an exploration well, the Maka Central-1, in Block 58 offshore Suriname and announced a significant oil discovery in January 2020. The well successfully tested the presence of hydrocarbons in multiple stacked targets in the upper Cretaceous-aged Campanian and Santonian intervals. The well confirmed 73 meters of oil pay and 50 meters of light oil and gas condensate pay, and appraisal planning is underway. The Company began drilling its second exploration well, Sapakara West-1, in January 2020. Following completion of the Sapakara West-1, the Company will drill a third, and likely a fourth exploration test in Block 58 during 2020.

•

In December 2019, Apache entered into a joint venture agreement to explore and develop Block 58 offshore Suriname. Under the terms of the agreement, Apache and Total S.A. will each hold a 50 percent working interest in Block 58, which comprises approximately 1.4 million acres in water depths ranging from less than 100 meters to more than 2,100 meters. In exchange for a 50 percent interest, Apache will receive various forms of consideration, including $5 billion of carry for its first $7.5 billion of appraisal and development capital and 25 percent carry on all appraisal and development capital beyond its first $7.5 billion. The Company also received $100 million at closing and $75 million in the first quarter of 2020 for reimbursement of 50 percent of all costs incurred on Block 58 to date. Apache will receive an additional $75 million upon achievement of first oil production. Apache will operate the drilling of the first three exploration wells in the block (and may operate a fourth), including the Maka Central-1 well, and subsequently transfer operatorship to Total.

For a more detailed discussion related to Apache’s various geographic regions, please refer to “Upstream Exploration and Production Properties—Operating Areas” set forth in Part I, Item 1 and 2 of this Form 10-K.

Acquisition and Divestiture Activity

Over Apache’s 65-year history, the Company has repeatedly demonstrated its ability to capitalize quickly and decisively on changes in its industry and economic conditions. A key component of this strategy is to continuously review and optimize Apache’s portfolio of assets in response to these changes. Most recently, Apache has completed a series of divestitures designed to monetize nonstrategic assets and enhance Apache’s portfolio in order to allocate resources to more impactful exploration and development opportunities. These divestments include:

•

Midcontinent/Gulf Coast Divestiture

In the second quarter of 2019, Apache completed the sale of non-core, gas-weighted assets in the Woodford-SCOOP and STACK plays for aggregate cash proceeds of approximately

$223 million

. In the third quarter of 2019, Apache completed the sale of non-core, gas-weighted assets in the western Anadarko Basin of


Oklahoma and Texas for aggregate cash proceeds of approximately

$322 million

and the assumption of asset retirement obligations of $49 million.

•

U.S. Leasehold Divestitures & Other

During 2019, the Company also completed the sale of certain other non-core producing assets, GPT assets, and leasehold acreage, primarily in the Permian region, in multiple transactions for total cash proceeds of

$73 million

.

•

Altus Transaction

In the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company completed the previously announced agreement with Altus Midstream Company and its then wholly-owned subsidiary Altus Midstream LP (collectively, Altus). Altus owns gas gathering, processing, and transmission assets in the Permian Basin of West Texas, anchored by midstream contracts to service Apache’s production from its Alpine High resource play. Altus primarily generates revenue by providing fee-based natural gas gathering, compression, processing, and transmission services.

•

Altus Pipeline Options

As part of the Altus transaction, Apache contributed options to acquire equity interests in five separate third-party pipeline projects to Altus Midstream LP and/or its subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2019, four of the five joint venture equity options had been exercised by Altus to acquire various ownership interests in the associated third-party pipeline limited liability entities.

•

U.S. and North Sea Divestitures

During 2018, Apache completed the sale of certain non-core assets, primarily leasehold acreage in the U.S. and North Sea regions, in multiple transactions for total cash proceeds of approximately $138 million.

•

Canadian Operations

On June 30, 2017, Apache completed the sale of its Canadian assets at Midale and House Mountain for total cash proceeds of approximately $228 million. In August of 2017, Apache completed the sale of its remaining Canadian operations for cash proceeds of approximately $478 million, effectively exiting operations in Canada.

•

U.S. Leasehold Divestitures

During 2017, Apache completed the sale of certain non-core assets, primarily leasehold acreage in the Permian and Midcontinent/Gulf Coast regions, in multiple transactions for total cash proceeds of $798 million.

•

North Sea Gathering, Processing, and Transmission (GPT) Facility

In November 2017, Apache completed the sale of its 30.28 percent interest in the Scottish Area Gas Evacuation (SAGE) gas plant and its 60.56 percent interest in the Beryl pipeline in the North Sea to Ancala Midstream Acquisitions Limited for cash proceeds of $134 million.

For detailed information regarding Apache’s acquisitions and divestitures, please refer to Note 2—Acquisitions and Divestitures in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part IV, Item 15 of this Form 10-K.


Results of Operations

Oil and Gas Revenues

Apache’s oil and gas revenues by region are as follows:

58,177

boe/d for


,


, and


, respectively. Sales volumes may vary from production volumes as a result of the timing of liftings in the Beryl field.


Pricing

The following table presents pricing information by region:

Crude Oil Prices

A substantial portion of our crude oil production is sold at prevailing market prices, which fluctuate in response to many factors that are outside of the Company’s control. Average realized crude oil prices for


were

down

8 percent

compared to


, a direct result of the

decreasing

benchmark oil prices over the past year. Crude oil prices realized in


averaged

$60.05

per barrel.

Continued volatility in the commodity price environment reinforces the importance of our asset portfolio. While the market price received for natural gas varies among geographic areas, crude oil tends to trade within a global market. Price movements for all types and grades of crude oil generally move in the same direction.

Natural Gas Prices

Natural gas, which currently has a limited global transportation system, is subject to price variances based on local supply and demand conditions. Our primary markets include North America, Egypt, and the U.K. An overview of the market conditions in our primary gas-producing regions follows:

•

North America has a common market. Most of the Company’s gas is sold on a monthly or daily basis at either monthly or daily index-based prices. The Company’s U.S. regions averaged

$1.26

per Mcf in


,

down

from

$2.12

per Mcf in


. Current year prices realized by Apache were negatively influenced by limited pipeline takeaway capacity from the Permian Basin that resulted in over supply at various locations in the basin.

•

In Egypt, our gas is sold to Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation (EGPC), primarily under an industry-pricing formula, a sliding scale based on Dated Brent crude oil with a minimum of $1.50 per MMBtu and a maximum of $2.65 per MMBtu,


plus an upward adjustment for liquids content. Overall, the region averaged

$2.83

per Mcf in


, which remained flat compared with the prior year.

•

Natural gas from the North Sea Beryl field is processed through the SAGE gas plant. The gas is sold to a third party at the St. Fergus entry point of the national grid on a National Balancing Point index price basis. The region averaged

$4.48

per Mcf in


, a

39 percent

decrease

from an average of

$7.33

per Mcf in


.

NGL Prices

Apache’s U.S. NGL production, which accounts for

96 percent

of the Company’s total


NGL production, is sold under contracts with prices at market indices based on Gulf Coast supply and demand conditions, less the costs for transportation and fractionation, or on a weighted-average sales price received by the purchaser.

increased

11.5

Mb/d compared to


, primarily a result of the Alpine High development and partially offset by the sale of the Company’s Woodford-SCOOP and STACK plays and western Anadarko Basin assets in the U.S.

Altus Revenues

Apache is the largest single owner of the voting common stock of Altus and has an approximate 79 percent ownership interest in Altus. Altus generates revenue primarily by providing fee-based natural gas gathering, compression, processing, and transmission services. Altus owns and operates a midstream energy asset network in the Permian Basin of West Texas primarily to service Apache’s production from its Alpine High resource play, which commenced production in May 2017.

During


and


, midstream services revenues totaling

$136 million

and

$77 million

, respectively, were generated through fee-based contractual arrangements with Apache. These affiliated revenues are eliminated upon consolidation. The increase compared to the prior year was primarily driven by higher throughput volumes from Apache’s drilling activity levels at Alpine High in late 2018 and the first half of 2019.

Given the prevailing gas and NGL price environment and disappointing performance of multi-well development pads in the second half of 2019, Apache materially reduced planned investment and currently has no future drilling plans at Alpine High. As such, Altus’ aggregate gathering and processing volumes from Apache are expected to decline over time. Other producers developing plays in surrounding areas are expected to provide additional opportunities for Altus to pursue third-party treating, processing, and transportation agreements.


Operating Expenses

The table below presents a comparison of the Company’s operating expenses for the years ended December 31,


,


, and


. All operating expenses include costs attributable to a noncontrolling interest in Egypt and ALTM.

Lease Operating Expenses (LOE)

LOE includes several key components, such as direct operating costs, repair and maintenance, and workover costs. Direct operating costs generally trend with commodity prices and are impacted by the type of commodity produced and the location of properties (i.e., offshore, onshore, remote locations, etc.). Fluctuations in commodity prices impact operating cost elements both directly and indirectly. They directly impact costs such as power, fuel, and chemicals, which are commodity price based. Commodity prices also affect industry activity and demand, thus indirectly impacting the cost of items such as rig rates, labor, boats, helicopters, materials, and supplies. Oil, which contributed approximately half of Apache’s


production, is inherently more expensive to produce than natural gas. Repair and maintenance costs are typically higher on offshore properties.

During


, LOE

increased

$8 million

, or

1 percent

, on an absolute dollar basis compared to


. On a per-unit basis, LOE

decreased

$0.09

, or

1 percent

, compared to


, from

$8.47

per boe to

$8.38

per boe. LOE in the U.S. decreased 10 percent on a per-BOE basis, partially offset by localized cost increases in Egypt.

Gathering, Processing, and Transmission (GPT)

GPT expenses include processing and transmission costs paid to third-party carriers and to Altus for Apache’s upstream natural gas production associated with its Alpine High play. GPT expenses also include midstream operating costs incurred by Altus. The following table presents a summary of these expenses:


GPT costs

decreased

$42 million

from


. Third-party processing and transmission costs

decreased

$44 million

, primarily driven by a decrease in contracted pricing and the Company’s sale of non-core assets in Oklahoma and Texas. Midstream operating expenses, incurred primarily by Altus, remained relatively flat compared to


.

Midstream service affiliate costs

increased

$57 million

from


. The increase was commensurate with higher throughput volumes from Apache’s natural gas production at Alpine High. These affiliate costs are eliminated upon consolidation.

Taxes Other Than Incom

e

Taxes other than income primarily consist of severance taxes on properties onshore and in state waters off the coast of the U.S. and ad valorem taxes on properties in the U.S. Severance taxes are generally based on a percentage of oil and gas production revenues. We are also subject to a variety of other taxes, including U.S. franchise taxes.

Taxes other than income totaled

$207 million

,

a decrease

of

$8 million

from


, primarily the result of a decrease in severance taxes on lower commodity prices and the divestiture of the Company’s non-core assets in Oklahoma and Texas, partially offset by ad valorem taxes on higher production levels and midstream infrastructure in the U.S.

Exploration Expense

Exploration expense includes unproved leasehold impairments, exploration dry hole expense, geological and geophysical expense, and the costs of maintaining and retaining unproved leasehold properties. Exploration expenses in


increased

$302 million

compared to


. The following table presents a summary of these expenses:

Unproved leasehold impairments

increased

$405 million

compared to


. Higher leasehold impairments in 2019 were associated with the Company’s decision to reallocate capital away from planned investment in the Alpine High play. Dry hole expense

decreased

$80 million

compared to


, which is associated with reduced exploration activity when compared to the prior year. Exploration overhead

decreased

$27 million

from


, primarily a result of a decrease in exploratory activity. The Company drilled 31 and 103 gross exploratory wells in 2019 and 2018, respectively.

General and Administrative (G&A) Expenses

G&A expenses

decrease

d

$25 million

, or

6 percent

, from


. The

decrease

in G&A expense was primarily related to lower cash-based stock compensation expense resulting from a decrease in the Company’s stock price and lower incentive compensation. The prior year periods also reflect a non-recurring charge to accelerate vesting on outstanding stock awards for certain retirement eligible employees.

Transaction, Reorganization, and Separation (TRS) Costs

TRS costs totaled

$50 million

,

an increase

of

$22 million

from


, primarily the result of severance costs associated with the Company’s reorganization announced during the fourth quarter of 2019.

Apache has historically employed a decentralized, region-focused approach to operations. In recent years, the Company has centralized certain operational activities in an effort to capture greater efficiencies through shared services. In light of the continued streamlining of the Company’s asset portfolio through divestitures and strategic transactions, in late 2019 management initiated a comprehensive redesign of Apache’s organizational structure and operations that it believes will better position the Company to be competitive for the long-term and further reduce recurring costs. The reorganization is ongoing and is expected to be substantially completed for the technical functions by the end of the first quarter of 2020. Changes for the corporate support functions will be ongoing through most of 2020.


Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization (DD&A)

Oil and gas property DD&A expense of

$2.5 billion

in


increased

$247 million

compared to


, primarily a result of a higher depletion rate resulting from negative proved reserve revisions associated with natural gas and NGL pricing. The Company’s oil and gas property DD&A rate

increased

$1.22

per boe in


compared to


, from

$13.33

to

$14.55

. GPT depreciation

increased

$22 million

in


compared to


, associated with capital spending to finalize construction on Altus midstream infrastructure.

Impairments

During


, the Company recorded asset impairments totaling

$2.9 billion

in connection with fair value assessments, including

$1.5 billion

for oil and gas proved properties in the U.S. primarily in Alpine High,

$1.3 billion

impairment of GPT facilities primarily in the Altus Midstream reporting segment,

$149 million

on divested unproved properties and leasehold acreage in the western Anadarko Basin in Oklahoma and Texas, and

$21 million

of inventory and other miscellaneous assets, including office leasehold impairments from Apache’s recent announcement to close its San Antonio regional office. The impairments for Alpine High and Altus Midstream were associated with the Company’s fourth quarter 2019 capital plan allocation decision to materially reduce planned investment in the Alpine High play.

During 2018, the Company recorded asset impairments totaling $511 million in connection with fair value assessments, including $328 million for oil and gas proved properties in the U.S. and Egypt, $56 million impairment of a gathering and processing facility in Oklahoma, $113 million for the impairment of an equity method investment based on a negotiated sales price, a $10 million impairment on the carrying values of capitalized exploratory well costs related to the sale of unproved properties in the North Sea, and $4 million for inventory write-downs.

The following table presents a summary of asset impairments recorded for


,


, and


:

Financing Costs, Net

Financing costs incurred during the period comprised the following:

Net financing costs

decrease

d

$16 million

from


. The

decrease

is primarily related to lower interest expense and a smaller loss recognized from the extinguishment of debt in two separate debt tender offer transactions occurring during 2019 and 2018 as further discussed below under “Capital Resources and Liquidity.” Interest income in 2019 decreased $9 million compared to the prior year on lower average cash balances held by the Company.


Provision for Income Taxes

Income tax expense in


totaled

$674 million

. During


, Apache’s effective tax rate was impacted primarily by an increase in the amount of valuation allowance against the Company’s U.S. deferred tax assets. Income tax expense in 2018 totaled $672 million. During 2018, Apache’s effective tax rate was impacted primarily by the adjustment to the provision amounts recorded in 2017 related to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the TCJA) and an increase in the Company’s valuation allowance.

On December 22, 2017, the TCJA was signed into law. In addition to reducing the corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent effective January 1, 2018, certain provisions in the TCJA move the U.S. away from a worldwide tax system and closer to a territorial system for earnings of foreign corporations, establishing a participation exemption system for taxation of foreign income. The new law includes a transition rule to effect this participation exemption regime. As a result of the enacted legislation, taxpayers were required to include in taxable income for the tax year ending December 31, 2017, the pro rata share of deferred income of each specified foreign corporation with respect to which the taxpayer is a U.S. shareholder. In 2017, the Company recorded a $419 million provisional deferred tax expense attributable to the deemed repatriation of foreign earnings required under the TCJA.

Also on December 22, 2017, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (SAB 118), which provides guidance for the application of Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 740, Income Taxes, for the income tax effects of the TCJA. SAB 118 provides a measurement period which should not extend beyond one year of the enactment date of the TCJA. In 2018, the Company recorded an additional $103 million deferred tax expense attributable to the deemed repatriation of foreign earnings. This deferred tax expense combined with the provisional amount recorded in 2017 were fully offset by available foreign tax credits. The Company completed its analysis of the income tax effects of the TCJA in the fourth quarter of 2018.

Apache recorded a full valuation allowance against its U.S. net deferred tax assets. Apache will continue to maintain a full valuation allowance on its U.S. net deferred tax assets until there is sufficient evidence to support the reversal of all or some portion of this allowance.

For additional information regarding income taxes, please refer to Note 10—Income Taxes in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part IV, Item 15 of this Form 10-K.


Capital and Operational Outlook

Apache’s strategic approach and multi-year outlook emphasizes retaining cash flow in excess of the Company’s dividend payments, reducing outstanding debt, prioritizing long-term returns over growth, aggressively managing its cost structure, and advancing exploration and appraisal activities in Suriname. Apache’s differentiated asset portfolio and continued capital allocation discipline will drive these efforts. Apache currently plans to invest $1.6 billion to $1.9 billion in its upstream oil and gas activities in 2020, assuming WTI pricing of approximately $50 per barrel. In terms of capital allocation, Alpine High will receive minimal to no funding, and some capital will be shifted from Permian oil projects to our Egypt region. Based on current plan projections, for 2020, the Company expects to:

•

maintain its current dividend;

•

retain cash flow to initiate progress on debt reduction goals;

•

allocate approximately $200 million to exploration; and

•

achieve flat-to-low single-digit corporate oil production growth, year-over-year.

To the extent WTI pricing continues to fall, capital investment will be reduced, as will near-term production outlooks. However, if oil prices move materially higher, the Company will prioritize further debt reduction over increasing capital activity. Apache also continues cost management efforts, centralizing the organization and emphasizing incentives directly related to specific asset performance rather than a region focus. The Company expects to achieve at least $150 million of annual savings from overhead and operating cost reductions associated with this initiative.

Separate from the Company’s upstream oil and gas activities, Altus will primarily direct capital spending toward its equity method interests in four Permian Basin long-haul pipeline entities, which include the following equity interest ownership stakes:

•

16 percent in the Gulf Coast Express natural gas pipeline (GCX);

•

15 percent in the EPIC crude pipeline (EPIC);

•

26.7 percent in the Permian Highway natural gas pipeline (PHP); and

•

33 percent in the Shin Oak NGL pipeline (Shin Oak).

EPIC is installing additional operational storage capacity and completing an additional dock, and PHP is still under construction. The Company estimates that Altus, based on its equity interests in each pipeline, will incur approximately

$300 million

of additional capital contributions associated with the remaining construction costs in these joint venture pipelines during 2020. Infrastructure build-out for Altus’ GPT assets was substantially completed during 2019, and capital investment for its GPT assets in 2020 is expected to be limited.

Capital Resources and Liquidity

Operating cash flows are the Company’s primary source of liquidity. Apache’s operating cash flows, both in the short-term and the long-term, are impacted by highly volatile oil and natural gas prices, as well as costs and sales volumes. Significant changes in commodity prices impact Apache’s revenues, earnings and cash flows. These changes potentially impact Apache’s liquidity if costs do not trend with changes in commodity prices. Historically, costs have trended with commodity prices, albeit on a lag. Sales volumes also impact cash flows; however, they have a less volatile impact in the short term.

Apache’s long-term operating cash flows are dependent on reserve replacement and the level of costs required for ongoing operations. Cash investments are required to fund activity necessary to offset the inherent declines in production and proved crude oil and natural gas reserves. Future success in maintaining and growing reserves and production is highly dependent on the success of Apache’s drilling program and its ability to add reserves economically. Changes in commodity prices also impact estimated quantities of proved reserves. In the year ended 2019, Apache recognized negative reserve revisions of approximately 11 percent of its year-end 2018 estimated proved reserves as a result of lower prices. If prices for 2020 approximate commodity future prices as of December 31, 2019, the Company is not reasonably likely to report additional negative revisions.

At times, the Company may also elect to utilize available cash on hand, committed borrowing capacity, access to both debt and equity capital markets, or proceeds from the sale of nonstrategic assets for all other liquidity and capital resource needs.

Apache believes the liquidity and capital resource alternatives available to the Company, combined with proactive measures to adjust its capital budget to reflect volatile commodity prices and anticipated operating cash flows, will be adequate to fund short-


term and long-term operations, including Apache’s capital development program, repayment of debt maturities, payment of dividends, and any amount that may ultimately be paid in connection with commitments and contingencies.

The table presents capital expenditures on a cash basis; therefore, the amounts may differ from those discussed elsewhere in this document, which include accruals.

Sources of Cash and Cash Equivalents

Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities

Operating cash flows are the Company’s primary source of capital and liquidity and are impacted, both in the short term and the long term, by volatile oil and natural gas prices. The factors that determine operating cash flows are largely the same as those that affect net earnings, with the exception of non-cash expenses such as DD&A, asset retirement obligation (ARO) accretion, exploratory dry hole expense, asset impairments, and deferred income tax expense.

Net cash provided by operating activities for


totaled

$2.9 billion

,

down

$910 million

from


. The decrease primarily reflects lower commodity prices during 2019 compared to 2018.

For a detailed discussion of commodity prices, production, and expenses, please see “Results of Operations” in this Item 7. For additional detail on the changes in operating assets and liabilities and the non-cash expenses that do not impact net cash provided by operating activities, please see the Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows in the Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part IV, Item 15 of this Form 10-K.


Proceeds from Altus Transaction and Asset Divestitures

In November 2018, Apache and Altus Midstream Company completed a previously announced transaction to create a pure-play, Permian Basin to Gulf Coast midstream C-corporation. Upon close, Altus Midstream Company contributed approximately $628 million of cash, net of transaction expenses, into its then wholly-owned subsidiary Altus Midstream LP. Apache contributed its Alpine High midstream assets into Altus Midstream LP in exchange for an approximate 79 percent ownership interest in Altus Midstream Company and Altus Midstream LP (collectively, Altus). Apache fully consolidates the assets and liabilities of Altus. Proceeds from the Altus transaction were used to fund development of the Altus assets.

Also during


and


, Apache recorded proceeds from divestitures totaling

$718 million

and

$138 million

, respectively. For information regarding the Company’s acquisitions and divestitures, please see Note 2—Acquisitions and Divestitures in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part IV, Item 15 of this Form 10-K.

Fixed-Rate Debt Borrowings

On June 19, 2019, Apache closed offerings of $1.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes, comprised of $600 million in aggregate principal amount of 4.250% notes due January 15, 2030 (2030 notes) and $400 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.350% notes due July 1, 2049 (2049 notes). The notes are redeemable at any time, in whole or in part, at Apache’s option, subject to a make-whole premium. The aggregate net proceeds of $989 million from the sale of the notes, comprised of net proceeds from the sale of the 2030 notes of $595 million and the 2049 notes of $394 million, were used to purchase certain outstanding notes in cash tender offers and for general corporate purposes.

In August 2018, Apache closed an offering of $1.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured 4.375% notes due October 15, 2028. The notes are redeemable at any time, in whole or in part, at Apache’s option, subject to a make-whole premium. The net proceeds from the sale of the notes of $992 million were used to purchase certain outstanding notes in cash tender offers, repay notes that matured in September 2018, and for general corporate purposes.

Proceeds from Altus Credit Facility

The construction of Altus’ gathering and processing assets and the exercise of its options for equity interests in four Permian Basin long-haul pipeline entities required capital expenditures in excess of Altus’ cash on hand and operational cash flows. As of

December 31, 2019

,

$396 million

in borrowings were outstanding under Altus Midstream LP’s revolving credit facility. The Company anticipates that Altus Midstream LP will continue to utilize revolving credit facility borrowing capacity in addition to Altus’ cash flow from operating activities to fund its future capital needs.

Redeemable Noncontrolling Interest - Altus Preferred Unit Limited Partners

On June 12, 2019, Altus Midstream LP issued and sold Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Units for an aggregate issue price of $625 million in a private offering. Altus Midstream LP received approximately $611 million in cash proceeds from the sale after deducting transaction costs and discounts to certain purchasers. These proceeds were used to fund capital contributions related to Altus’ equity interests in certain of the Permian Basin long-haul pipeline entities and repayment of outstanding principal on its revolving credit facility (discussed above). For more information, please refer to Note 13—Redeemable Noncontrolling Interest - Altus in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part IV, Item 15 of this Form 10-K.

For more information regarding the Company’s equity method interests, please see Note 6—Equity Method Interests in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part IV, Item 15 of this Form 10-K.

Payments on Fixed-Rate Debt

On June 21, 2019, the Company closed cash tender offers for certain outstanding notes. Apache accepted for purchase $932 million aggregate principal amount of notes for approximately $1.0 billion, which included principal, the net premium to par, and an early tender premium totaling $28 million, as well as accrued and unpaid interest of $14 million. The Company recorded a net loss of $75 million on extinguishment of debt, including $7 million of unamortized debt issuance costs and discounts, in connection with the note purchases. Additionally, on July 1, 2019, Apache’s 7.625% senior notes in original principal amount of $150 million matured and were repaid.

In August 2018, the Company closed cash tender offers for certain outstanding notes. Apache accepted for purchase $731 million aggregate principal amount of notes for approximately $828 million, which included principal, the discount to par, and an early tender premium totaling $820 million, as well as accrued and unpaid interest of $8 million. The Company recorded a net loss of $94 million on extinguishment of debt, including $5 million of unamortized debt issuance costs and discount, in connection with the note purchases. Apache also made repayments of current year note maturities totaling $550 million during 2018.

Dividends

The Company has paid cash dividends on its common stock for 54 consecutive years through

and

$345 million

to Sinopec in


and


, respectively.

Shares Repurchased

In 2013 and 2014, Apache’s Board of Directors authorized the purchase of up to 40 million shares of the Company’s common stock. Shares may be purchased either in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions. The Company initiated the buyback program on June 10, 2013, and through

December 31, 2019

, had repurchased a total of 40 million shares at an average price of $79.18 per share. During 2018, the Company repurchased a total of 7.8 million shares at an average price of $38.99 per share. During the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the purchase of up to 40 million additional shares of the Company’s common stock. The Company is not obligated to acquire any specific number of shares and did not purchase any shares during 2019.

Liquidity


Cash and Cash Equivalents

At

December 31, 2019

, Apache had

$247 million

in cash and cash equivalents, of which approximately

$6 million

was held by Altus. The majority of the cash is invested in highly liquid, investment-grade instruments with maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase.

Debt

At

December 31, 2019

, outstanding debt, which consisted of notes, debentures, subsidiary credit facility borrowings, and finance lease obligations, totaled

$8.6 billion

, of which approximately $406 million was related to Altus. Current debt as of

December 31, 2019

, included $11 million for finance lease obligations, of which $10 million was related to Altus.

Available Credit Facilities

In March 2018, the Company entered into a revolving credit facility with commitments totaling $4.0 billion. In March 2019, the term of this facility was extended by one year to March 2024 (subject to Apache’s remaining one-year extension option) pursuant to Apache’s exercise of an extension option. The Company can increase commitments up to $5.0 billion by adding new lenders or obtaining the consent of any increasing existing lenders. The facility includes a letter of credit subfacility of up to $3.0 billion, of which $2.08 billion was committed as of

December 31, 2019

. The facility is for general corporate purposes and committed borrowing capacity fully supports Apache’s commercial paper program. Letters of credit are available for security needs, including in respect of abandonment obligations assumed in various North Sea acquisitions. As of

December 31, 2019

, there were no borrowings or letters of credit outstanding under this facility.

At Apache’s option, the interest rate per annum for borrowings under the 2018 facility is either a base rate, as defined, plus a margin, or the London Inter-bank Offered Rate (LIBOR), plus a margin. Apache also pays quarterly a facility fee at a per annum rate on total commitments. The margins and the facility fee vary based upon Apache’s senior long-term debt rating. At

December 31, 2019

, the base rate margin was 0.075 percent, the LIBOR margin was 1.075 percent, and the facility fee was 0.175 percent. A commission is payable quarterly to lenders on the face amount of each outstanding letter of credit at a per annum rate equal to the LIBOR margin then in effect. Customary letter of credit fronting fees and other charges are payable to issuing banks.

The financial covenants of the 2018 credit facility require Apache to maintain an adjusted debt-to-capital ratio of not greater than 60 percent at the end of any fiscal quarter. For purposes of this calculation, capital excludes the effects of non-cash write-downs, impairments, and related charges occurring after June 30, 2015. At

December 31, 2019

, Apache’s debt-to-capital ratio as calculated under the credit facility was 31 percent.

The 2018 facility’s negative covenants restrict the ability of Apache and its subsidiaries to create liens securing debt on their hydrocarbon-related assets, with exceptions for liens typically arising in the oil and gas industry; liens securing debt incurred to finance the acquisition, construction, improvement, or capital lease of assets, provided that such debt, when incurred, does not exceed the subject purchase price and costs, as applicable, and related expenses; liens on subsidiary assets located outside of the United States and Canada; and liens arising as a matter of law, such as tax and mechanics’ liens. Apache also may incur liens on assets if debt secured thereby does not exceed 15 percent of Apache’s consolidated net tangible assets, or approximately

$2.4 billion

as of

December 31, 2019

. Negative covenants also restrict Apache’s ability to merge with another entity unless it is the surviving entity, dispose of substantially all of its assets, and guarantee debt of non-consolidated entities in excess of the stated threshold.

In November 2018, Altus Midstream LP entered into a revolving credit facility for general corporate purposes that matures in November 2023 (subject to Altus Midstream LP’s two, one-year extension options). The agreement for this facility, as amended, provides aggregate commitments from a syndicate of banks of $800 million. All aggregate commitments include a letter of credit subfacility of up to $100 million and a swingline loan subfacility of up to $100 million. Altus Midstream LP may increase commitments up to an aggregate $1.5 billion by adding new lenders or obtaining the consent of any increasing existing lenders. As of

December 31, 2019

, there were

$396 million

of borrowings and no letters of credit outstanding under this facility.

The agreement for Altus Midstream LP’s credit facility, as amended, restricts distributions in respect of capital to Apache and other unit holders in certain circumstances. Unless the Leverage Ratio is less than or equal to 4.00:1.00, the agreement limits such distributions to $30 million per calendar year until either (i) the consolidated net income of Altus Midstream LP and its restricted subsidiaries, as adjusted pursuant to the agreement, for three consecutive calendar months equals or exceeds $350.0 million on an annualized basis or (ii) Altus Midstream LP has a specified senior long-term debt rating; in addition, before the occurrence of one of those two events, the Leverage Ratio must be less than or equal to 5.00:1.00. In no event can any distribution be made that would, after giving effect to it on a pro forma basis, result in a Leverage Ratio greater than (i) 5.00:1.00 or (ii) for a specified period after a qualifying acquisition, 5.50:1.00. The Leverage Ratio is the ratio of (1) the consolidated indebtedness of


Altus Midstream LP and its restricted subsidiaries to (2) EBITDA (as defined in the agreement) of Altus Midstream LP and its restricted subsidiaries for the 12-month period ending immediately before the determination date. The Leverage Ratio as of December 31, 2019 was less than 4.00:1.00.

The terms of Altus Midstream LP’s Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Units also contain certain restrictions on distributions in respect of capital, including the common units held by Apache and any other units that rank junior to the Preferred Units with respect to distributions or distributions upon liquidation. Refer to Note 13—Redeemable Noncontrolling Interest - Altus for further information. In addition, the amount of any cash distributions to Altus Midstream LP by any entity in which it has an interest accounted for by the equity method is subject to such entity’s compliance with the terms of any debt or other agreements by which it may be bound, which in turn may impact the amount of funds available for distribution by Altus Midstream LP to its partners.

The Altus Midstream LP credit facility is unsecured and is not guaranteed by Apache or any of Apache’s other subsidiaries.

There are no clauses in either the agreement for Apache’s 2018 credit facility or for Altus Midstream LP’s 2018 credit facility that permit the lenders to accelerate payments or refuse to lend based on unspecified material adverse changes. These agreements do not have drawdown restrictions or prepayment obligations in the event of a decline in credit ratings. However, each agreement allows the lenders to accelerate payment maturity and terminate lending and issuance commitments for nonpayment and other breaches, and if a borrower or any of its subsidiaries defaults on other indebtedness in excess of the stated threshold, is insolvent, or has any unpaid, non-appealable judgment against it for payment of money in excess of the stated threshold. Lenders may also accelerate payment maturity and terminate lending and issuance commitments under the applicable agreement if Apache or Altus Midstream LP, as applicable, undergoes a specified change in control or any borrower has specified pension plan liabilities in excess of the stated threshold. Each of Apache and Altus Midstream LP was in compliance with the terms of its 2018 credit facility as of

December 31, 2019

.

There is no assurance that the financial condition of banks with lending commitments to Apache or Altus Midstream LP will not deteriorate. We closely monitor the ratings of the banks in our bank groups. Having large bank groups allows the Company to mitigate the potential impact of any bank’s failure to honor its lending commitment.

Commercial Paper Program

As of

December 31, 2019

, Apache has available a $3.5 billion commercial paper program which, subject to market availability, facilitates Apache borrowing funds for up to 270 days at competitive interest rates. The commercial paper program is fully supported by available borrowing capacity under Apache’s 2018 $4.0 billion committed credit facility. If Apache is unable to issue commercial paper following a significant credit downgrade or dislocation in the market, Apache’s 2018 committed credit facility, which matures in 2024, is available as a 100 percent backstop. As of

December 31, 2019

, Apache had no borrowings under its commercial paper program.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

Apache enters into customary agreements in the oil and gas industry for drilling rig commitments, firm transportation agreements, and other obligations as described below in “Contractual Obligations” in this Item 7. Other than the off-balance sheet arrangements described herein, Apache does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements with unconsolidated entities that are reasonably likely to materially affect our liquidity or capital resource positions.


Contractual Obligations

The following table summarizes the Company’s contractual obligations as of

December 31, 2019

. For additional information regarding these obligations, please see Note 9—Debt and Financing Costs and Note 11—Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part IV, Item 15 of this Form 10-K.

(1)

Includes outstanding principal amounts at December 31, 2019. This table does not include future commitment fees, interest expense, or other fees on Altus’ credit facility because they are floating rate instruments, and management cannot determine with accuracy the timing of future loan advances, repayments, or future interest rates to be charged.

(2)

Amounts represent the Company’s undiscounted finance lease obligation related to physical power generators being leased on a one-year term with the right to purchase and a separate lease for the Company’s Midland, Texas regional office building.

(3)

Amounts represent future lease payments associated with oil and gas operations inclusive of amounts billable to partners and other working interest owners. Such payments may be capitalized as a component of oil and gas properties and subsequently depreciated, impaired, or written off as exploration expense.

(4)

Amounts represent any agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms. These include minimum commitments associated with take-or-pay contracts, NGL processing agreements, drilling work program commitments, and agreements to secure capacity rights on third-party pipelines. Amounts exclude certain product purchase obligations related to marketing and trading activities for which there are no minimum purchase requirements or the amounts are not fixed or determinable. Total costs incurred under take-or-pay and throughput obligations were

$111 million

,

$132 million

, and

$134 million

for 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively.

(5)

Subsequent to December 31, 2019, Apache entered into an agreement to assign approximately

$171 million

of its firm transportation obligations beginning in March 2020.

(6)

This table does not include the Company’s liability for dismantlement, abandonment, and restoration costs of oil and gas properties or pension or postretirement benefit obligations. For additional information regarding these liabilities, please see Notes 8 and 12, respectively, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part IV, Item 15 of this Form 10-K.

As further described above under “Capital and Operational Outlook,” Altus Midstream LP and/or its subsidiaries have exercised four of the five options to acquire equity interests in third-party joint venture pipelines. Upon exercising each individual option, Altus Midstream LP and/or its subsidiaries may be required to fund future capital expenditures for its equity interest share in the development of the applicable pipeline. EPIC is installing additional operational storage capacity and completing an additional dock, and PHP is still under construction. The Company estimates that Altus, based on its equity interests in each pipeline, will incur approximately

$300 million

of additional capital contributions associated with the remaining construction costs in these joint venture pipelines during 2020.

Apache is also subject to various contingent obligations that become payable only if certain events or rulings were to occur. The inherent uncertainty surrounding the timing of and monetary impact associated with these events or rulings prevents any meaningful accurate measurement, which is necessary to assess settlements resulting from litigation. Apache’s management believes that it has adequately reserved for its contingent obligations, including approximately

$2 million

for environmental remediation and approximately

$21 million

for various contingent legal liabilities. For a detailed discussion of the Company’s environmental and legal contingencies, please see Note 11—Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part IV, Item 15 of this Form 10-K.


In addition, the Company has potential exposure to future obligations related to divested properties. Apache has divested various leases, wells, and facilities located in the Gulf of Mexico where the purchasers typically assume all obligations to plug, abandon, and decommission the associated wells, structures, and facilities acquired. One or more of the counterparties in these transactions could, either as a result of the severe decline in oil and natural gas prices or other factors related to the historical or future operations of their respective businesses, face financial problems that may have a significant impact on their solvency and ability to continue as a going concern. If a purchaser of our Gulf of Mexico assets becomes the subject of a case or proceeding under relevant insolvency laws or otherwise fails to perform required abandonment obligations, Apache could be required to perform such actions under applicable federal laws and regulations. In such event, Apache may be forced to use available cash to cover the costs of such liabilities and obligations should they arise.

With respect to oil and gas operations in the Gulf of Mexico, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) has issued a Notice to Lessees (NTL No. 2016-N01) significantly revising the obligations of companies operating in the Gulf of Mexico to provide supplemental assurances of performance with respect to plugging, abandonment, and decommissioning obligations associated with wells, platforms, structures, and facilities located upon or used in connection with such companies’ oil and gas leases. While requirements under the NTL have not yet been fully implemented by BOEM, the NTL will likely require that Apache provide additional security to BOEM with respect to plugging, abandonment, and decommissioning obligations relating to Apache’s current ownership interests in various Gulf of Mexico leases. We are working closely with BOEM to make arrangements for the provision of such additional required security, if such security becomes necessary under the NTL. Additionally, we are not able to predict the effect that these changes might have on counterparties to which Apache has sold Gulf of Mexico assets or with whom Apache has joint ownership. Such changes could cause the bonding obligations of such parties to increase substantially, thereby causing a significant impact on the counterparties’ solvency and ability to continue as a going concern.

Insurance Program

We maintain insurance policies that include coverage for physical damage to our assets, general liabilities, workers’ compensation, employers’ liability, sudden and accidental pollution, and other risks. Our insurance coverage is subject to deductibles or retentions that we must satisfy prior to recovering on insurance. Additionally, our insurance is subject to policy exclusions and limitations. There is no assurance that insurance will adequately protect us against liability from all potential consequences and damages. Further we do not have coverage in place for a variety of other risks including Gulf of Mexico named windstorm and business interruption.

Our current insurance policies covering physical damage to our assets provide up to $1 billion in coverage per occurrence. These policies also provide sudden and accidental pollution coverage.

Our current insurance policies covering general liabilities provide $500 million in coverage, scaled to Apache’s interest. Our service agreements, including drilling contracts, generally indemnify Apache for injuries and death of the service provider’s employees as well as subcontractors hired by the service provider.

Apache purchases multi-year political risk insurance from the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) and highly-rated insurers covering a portion of its investments in Egypt for losses arising from confiscation, nationalization, and expropriation risks. The Islamic Corporation for the Insurance of Investment and Export Credit (ICIEC, an agency of the Islamic Development Bank) reinsures OPIC. In the aggregate, these insurance policies provide up to $750 million of coverage to Apache, subject to policy terms and conditions and a retention of approximately $1 billion.

Apache has an additional insurance policy with OPIC, which, subject to policy terms and conditions, provides up to $300 million of coverage through 2024 for losses arising from (1) non-payment by EGPC of arbitral awards covering amounts owed Apache on past due invoices and (2) expropriation of exportable petroleum in the event that actions taken by the government of Egypt prevent Apache from exporting our share of production. The Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA), a member of the World Bank Group, provides $150 million in reinsurance to OPIC.

Future insurance coverage for our industry could increase in cost and may include higher deductibles or retentions. In addition, some forms of insurance may become unavailable or unavailable on terms economically acceptable.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Apache prepares its financial statements and the accompanying notes in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which require management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. Apache identifies certain accounting policies as critical based on, among other things, their impact on the portrayal of Apache’s financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity and the degree of difficulty, subjectivity, and complexity in their deployment. Critical accounting policies cover accounting


matters that are inherently uncertain because the future resolution of such matters is unknown. Management routinely discusses the development, selection, and disclosure of each of the critical accounting policies. The following is a discussion of Apache’s most critical accounting policies.

Reserves Estimates

Proved oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities of natural gas, crude oil, condensate, and NGLs that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing conditions, operating conditions, and government regulations.

Proved undeveloped reserves include those reserves that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion. Undeveloped reserves may be classified as proved reserves on undrilled acreage directly offsetting development areas that are reasonably certain of production when drilled, or where reliable technology provides reasonable certainty of economic producibility. Undrilled locations may be classified as having undeveloped reserves only if a development plan has been adopted indicating that they are scheduled to be drilled within five years, unless specific circumstances justify a longer time.

Despite the inherent imprecision in these engineering estimates, our reserves are used throughout our financial statements. For example, since we use the units-of-production method to amortize our oil and gas properties, the quantity of reserves could significantly impact our DD&A expense. A material adverse change in the estimated volumes of reserves could result in property impairments. Finally, these reserves are the basis for our supplemental oil and gas disclosures.

Reserves are calculated using an unweighted arithmetic average of commodity prices in effect on the first day of each of the previous 12 months, held flat for the life of the production, except where prices are defined by contractual arrangements. Operating costs, production and ad valorem taxes and future development costs are based on current costs with no escalation.

Apache has elected not to disclose probable and possible reserves or reserve estimates in this filing.

Oil and Gas Exploration Costs

Apache accounts for its exploration and production activities using the successful efforts method of accounting. Costs of acquiring unproved and proved oil and gas leasehold acreage are capitalized. Costs of drilling and equipping productive wells, including development dry holes, and related production facilities are also capitalized. Oil and gas exploration costs, other than the costs of drilling exploratory wells, are charged to expense as incurred. Costs associated with drilling an exploratory well are initially capitalized, or suspended, pending a determination as to whether proved reserves have been found. On a quarterly basis, management reviews the status of all suspended exploratory well costs in light of ongoing exploration activities and determines whether the Company is making sufficient progress in its ongoing exploration and appraisal efforts or, in the case of discoveries requiring government sanctioning, whether development negotiations are underway and proceeding as planned. If management determines that future appraisal drilling or development activities are unlikely to occur, associated suspended exploratory well costs are recorded as dry hole expense and reported in exploration expense in the statement of consolidated operations. Otherwise, the costs of exploratory wells remain capitalized.

Long-Lived Asset Impairments

Long-lived assets used in operations, including proved oil and gas properties and GPT assets, are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate a possible significant deterioration in future cash flows expected to be generated by an asset. Individual assets are grouped for impairment purposes based on a judgmental assessment of the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets. If there is an indication that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be recovered, the asset is assessed by management through an established process in which changes to significant assumptions such as prices, volumes, and future development plans are reviewed. If, upon review, the sum of the undiscounted pre-tax cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset group, the carrying value is written down to estimated fair value. Because there usually is a lack of quoted market prices for long-lived assets, the fair value of impaired assets is assessed by management using the income approach.


Under the income approach, the fair value of each asset group is estimated based on the present value of expected future cash flows. The income approach is dependent on a number of factors including estimates of forecasted revenue and operating costs, proved reserves, the success of future exploration for and development of unproved reserves, expected throughput volumes for GPT assets, discount rates, and other variables. Key assumptions used in developing a discounted cash flow model described above include estimated quantities of crude oil and natural gas reserves; estimates of market prices considering forward commodity price curves as of the measurement date; and estimates of operating, administrative, and capital costs adjusted for inflation. We discount the resulting future cash flows using a discount rate believed to be consistent with those applied by market participants.

To assess the reasonableness of our fair value estimate, when available we use a market approach to compare the fair value to similar assets. This requires management to make certain judgments about the selection of comparable assets, recent comparable asset transactions, and transaction premiums.

Although we base the fair value estimate of each asset group on assumptions we believe to be reasonable, those assumptions are inherently unpredictable and uncertain, and actual results could differ from the estimate. Negative revisions of estimated reserves quantities, increases in future cost estimates, divestiture of a significant component of the asset group, or sustained decreases in crude oil or natural gas prices could lead to a reduction in expected future cash flows and possibly an additional impairment of long-lived assets in future periods.

Over the past several years, the Company has experienced substantial volatility in commodity prices, which impacted our future development plans and operating cash flows. As such, we recorded impairments of certain proved oil and gas properties and gathering, processing, and transmission facilities in 2019 and 2018. For discussion of these impairments, see “Fair Value Measurements” of Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Asset Retirement Obligation (ARO)

The Company has significant obligations to remove tangible equipment and restore land or seabed at the end of oil and gas production operations. Apache’s removal and restoration obligations are primarily associated with plugging and abandoning wells and removing and disposing of offshore oil and gas platforms in the North Sea and Gulf of Mexico. Estimating the future restoration and removal costs is difficult and requires management to make estimates and judgments. Asset removal technologies and costs are constantly changing, as are regulatory, political, environmental, safety, and public relations considerations.

ARO associated with retiring tangible long-lived assets is recognized as a liability in the period in which the legal obligation is incurred and becomes determinable. The liability is offset by a corresponding increase in the underlying asset. The ARO liability reflects the estimated present value of the amount of dismantlement, removal, site reclamation, and similar activities associated with Apache’s oil and gas properties and other long-lived assets. The Company utilizes current retirement costs to estimate the expected cash outflows for retirement obligations. Inherent in the present value calculation are numerous assumptions and judgments including the ultimate settlement amounts, inflation factors, credit-adjusted discount rates, timing of settlement, and changes in the legal, regulatory, environmental, and political environments. Accretion expense is recognized over time as the discounted liability is accreted to its expected settlement value.

Income Taxes

Our oil and gas exploration and production operations are subject to taxation on income in numerous jurisdictions worldwide. We record deferred tax assets and liabilities to account for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements and our tax returns. We routinely assess the ability to realize our deferred tax assets. If we conclude that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized under accounting standards, the tax asset would be reduced by a valuation allowance. Numerous judgments and assumptions are inherent in the determination of future taxable income, including factors such as future operating conditions (particularly as related to prevailing oil and gas prices).

The Company regularly assesses and, if required, establishes accruals for uncertain tax positions that could result from assessments of additional tax by taxing jurisdictions in countries where the Company operates. The Company recognizes a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, based on the technical merits of the position. These accruals for uncertain tax positions are subject to a significant amount of judgment and are reviewed and adjusted on a periodic basis in light of changing facts and circumstances considering the progress of ongoing tax audits, case law, and any new legislation. The Company believes that its accruals for uncertain tax positions are adequate in relation to the potential for any additional tax assessments.


ITEM 7A.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

The primary objective of the following information is to provide forward-looking quantitative and qualitative information about our exposure to market risk. The term market risk relates to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in oil, gas, and NGL prices, interest rates, or foreign currency and adverse governmental actions. The disclosures are not meant to be precise indicators of expected future losses, but rather indicators of reasonably possible losses. The forward-looking information provides indicators of how we view and manage our ongoing market risk exposures.

Commodity Price Risk

The Company’s revenues, earnings, cash flow, capital investments and, ultimately, future rate of growth are highly dependent on the prices the Company receives for its crude oil, natural gas and NGLs, which have historically been very volatile because of unpredictable events such as economic growth or retraction, weather, political climate, and global supply and demand. The Company’s average crude oil realizations have

decrease

d

8 percent

to

$60.05

per barrel in


from

$65.30

per barrel in


. The Company’s average natural gas price realizations have

decrease

d

27 percent

to

$1.90

per Mcf in


from

$2.61

per Mcf in


. The Company’s average NGL realizations have

decrease

d

41 percent

to

$15.74

per barrel in


from

$26.87

per barrel in


. Based on average daily production for


, a $1.00 per barrel change in the weighted average realized oil price would have increased or decreased revenues for the year by approximately

$87 million

, a $0.10 per Mcf change in the weighted average realized price of natural gas would have increased or decreased revenues for the year by approximately

$36 million

, and a $1.00 per barrel change in the weighted average realized NGL price would have increased or decreased revenues for the year by approximately

$26 million

.

Apache periodically enters into derivative positions on a portion of its projected oil and natural gas production through a variety of financial and physical arrangements intended to manage fluctuations in cash flows resulting from changes in commodity prices. Such derivative positions may include the use of futures contracts, swaps, and/or options. Apache does not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes. As of

December 31, 2019

, the Company did not have any commodity derivative positions. See Note 4—Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part IV, Item 15 of this Form 10-K for notional volumes and terms with the Company’s derivative contracts.

Interest Rate Risk

At

December 31, 2019

, Apache had approximately $8.2 billion net carrying value of notes and debentures outstanding, all of which was fixed-rate debt, with a weighted average interest rate of 4.88 percent. Although near-term changes in interest rates may affect the fair value of Apache’s fixed-rate debt, they do not expose the Company to the risk of earnings or cash flow loss associated with that debt. Apache is also exposed to interest rate risk related to its interest-bearing cash and cash equivalents balances and amounts outstanding under its commercial paper program and credit facilities. As of

December 31, 2019

, the Company’s cash and cash equivalents totaled approximately

$247 million

, approximately 73 percent of which was invested in money market funds and short-term investments with major financial institutions. A change in the interest rate applicable to the Company’s short-term investments and credit facility borrowings would have a de minimis impact on earnings and cash flows but could impact interest costs associated with future debt issuances or any future borrowings under its commercial paper program, revolving credit facilities, and money market lines of credit.

Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk

The Company’s cash activities relating to certain international operations is based on the U.S. dollar equivalent of cash flows measured in foreign currencies. The Company’s North Sea production is sold under U.S. dollar contracts, and the majority of costs incurred are paid in British pounds. In Egypt, substantially all oil and gas production is sold under U.S. dollar contracts, and the majority of the costs incurred are denominated in U.S. dollars. Transactions denominated in British pounds are converted to U.S. dollar equivalents based on the average exchange rates during the period.

Foreign currency gains and losses also arise when monetary assets and monetary liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the end of each month. Currency gains and losses are included as either a component of “Other” under “Revenues and Other” or, as is the case when the Company re-measures its foreign tax liabilities, as a component of the Company’s provision for income tax expense on the statement of consolidated operations. A foreign currency net gain or loss of $6 million would result from a 10 percent weakening or strengthening, respectively, in the British pound as of

December 31, 2019

.

The Company is subject to increased foreign currency risk associated with the effects of the U.K.’s withdrawal from the European Union. Apache has entered into foreign exchange contracts in order to minimize the impact of fluctuating exchange rates for the British pound on the Company’s operating expenses. As of

December 31, 2019

, the Company has outstanding foreign


exchange contracts with a total notional amount of £162 million. A 10 percent strengthening of the British pound against the U.S. dollar would result in a foreign currency net gain of $15 million, while a 10 percent weakening of the British pound against the U.S. dollar would result in a loss of $11 million.

REPORT OF MANAGEMENT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

Management of the Company is responsible for the preparation and integrity of the consolidated financial statements appearing in this annual report on Form 10-K. The financial statements were prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and include amounts that are based on management’s best estimates and judgments.

Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. Our internal control over financial reporting is supported by a program of internal audits and appropriate reviews by management, written policies and guidelines, careful selection and training of qualified personnel and a written code of business conduct adopted by our Company’s board of directors, applicable to all Company directors and all officers and employees of our Company and subsidiaries.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements and even when determined to be effective, can only provide reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2019

. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013).

Based on our assessment, management believes that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2019

.

The Company’s independent auditors, Ernst & Young LLP, a registered public accounting firm, are appointed by the Audit Committee of the Company’s board of directors. Ernst & Young LLP have audited and reported on the consolidated financial statements of Apache Corporation and subsidiaries and the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. The reports of the independent auditors follow this report on pages F-2 and F-3.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Apache Corporation:

Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

We have audited Apache Corporation and subsidiaries’ internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2019

, based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Apache Corporation and subsidiaries (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2019

, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of

December 31, 2019

and


, the related statements of consolidated operations, comprehensive income (loss), cash flows and changes in equity and noncontrolling interest for each of the three years in the period ended

December 31, 2019

, and the related notes and our report dated

February 27, 2020

expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Basis for Opinion

The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Report of Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Nature of Operations

Apache Corporation (Apache or the Company) is an independent energy company that explores for, develops, and produces natural gas, crude oil, and natural gas liquids. The Company has exploration and production operations in

three

geographic areas: the United States (U.S.), Egypt, and offshore the U.K. in the North Sea (North Sea). Apache also has exploration interests in Suriname and other international locations that may, over time, result in reportable discoveries and development opportunities.

Apache’s midstream business is operated by Altus Midstream Company through its subsidiary Altus Midstream LP (collectively, Altus), which owns, develops, and operates a midstream energy asset network in the Permian Basin of West Texas, anchored by midstream service contracts to Apache. Additionally, Altus owns equity interests in a total of

four

Permian Basin pipelines that will access various points along the Texas Gulf Coast, providing it with fully integrated, wellhead-to-water connectivity.

1.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Accounting policies used by Apache and its subsidiaries reflect industry practices and conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (GAAP). The Company’s financial statements for prior periods include reclassifications that were made to conform to the current-year presentation. Significant accounting policies are discussed below.

Principles of Consolidation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Apache and its subsidiaries after elimination of intercompany balances and transactions. The Company’s undivided interests in oil and gas exploration and production ventures and partnerships are proportionately consolidated.

The Company consolidates all other investments in which, either through direct or indirect ownership, Apache has more than a


percent

voting interest or controls the financial and operating decisions. Noncontrolling interests represent third-party ownership in the net assets of a consolidated Apache subsidiary and are reflected separately in the Company’s financial statements. Sinopec International Petroleum Exploration and Production Corporation (Sinopec) owns a

one-third

minority participation in Apache’s Egypt oil and gas business as a noncontrolling interest, which is reflected as a separate component of equity in Apache’s consolidated balance sheet.

Additionally, third-party investors own a minority interest of approximately


percent

of Altus Midstream Company (ALTM), which is reflected as a separate noncontrolling interest component of equity in Apache’s consolidated balance sheet. Apache consolidates the activities of ALTM, which qualifies as a variable interest entity (VIE) under GAAP. Apache has concluded that it is the primary beneficiary of the VIE, as defined in the accounting standards, since Apache has the power, through its ownership, to direct those activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of ALTM and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could be potentially significant to ALTM. This conclusion was based on a qualitative analysis that considered ALTM’s governance structure, the commercial agreements between ALTM, Altus Midstream LP, and Apache, and the voting rights established between the members, which provide Apache with the ability to control the operations of Altus. On June 12, 2019, Altus Midstream LP issued and sold Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Units (the Preferred Units) through a private offering that admitted additional limited partners with separate rights for the Preferred Unit holders. For further details on the terms of the Preferred Units and rights of the holders, refer to Note 13—Redeemable Noncontrolling Interest - Altus.

Investments in which Apache holds less than


percent

of the voting interest are typically accounted for under the equity method of accounting, with the balance recorded separately as “Equity method interests” in Apache’s consolidated balance sheet and results of operations recorded as a component of “Other” under “Revenues and Other” in the Company’s statement of consolidated operations.

Refer to Note 6—Equity Method Interests for more detail.

Use of Estimates

Preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Apache evaluates its estimates and assumptions on a regular basis. Actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions used in preparation of its financial statements and changes in these estimates are recorded when known. Significant estimates with regard to these financial statements include the fair value determination of acquired assets and liabilities (see Note 2—Acquisitions and Divestitures), the estimate of proved oil and gas reserves and related present value estimates of future net cash flows therefrom

APACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)

(see Note 18—Supplemental Oil and Gas Disclosures (Unaudited)), the assessment of asset retirement obligations (see Note 8—Asset Retirement Obligation), the estimates of fair value for long-lived assets (see “Fair Value Measurements” and “Property and Equipment” sections in this Note 1 below), and the estimate of income taxes (see Note 10—Income Taxes).

Fair Value Measurements

Certain assets and liabilities are reported at fair value on a recurring basis in Apache’s consolidated balance sheet. Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 820-10-35, “Fair Value Measurement” (ASC 820), provides a hierarchy that prioritizes and defines the types of inputs used to measure fair value. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to Level 1 inputs, which consist of unadjusted quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets. Level 2 inputs consist of quoted prices for similar instruments. Level 3 valuations are derived from inputs that are significant and unobservable; hence, these valuations have the lowest priority.

The valuation techniques that may be used to measure fair value include a market approach, an income approach, and a cost approach. A market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities. An income approach uses valuation techniques to convert future amounts to a single present amount based on current market expectations, including present value techniques, option-pricing models, and the excess earnings method. The cost approach is based on the amount that currently would be required to replace the service capacity of an asset (replacement cost).

Recurring fair value measurements are presented in further detail in Note 4—Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, Note 9—Debt and Financing Costs, Note 12—Retirement and Deferred Compensation Plans, and Note 13—Redeemable Noncontrolling Interest - Altus.

Apache also uses fair value measurements on a nonrecurring basis when certain qualitative assessments of its assets indicate a potential impairment.

The following table presents a summary of asset impairments recorded in connection with fair value assessments for


,


, and


:

For the year ended

December 31, 2019

, the Company recorded asset impairments totaling

$

2.9

billion

in connection with fair value assessments. During the fourth quarter of 2019, following a material reduction to planned investment in Apache’s Alpine High development, the Company recorded impairments totaling

$

1.4

billion

for its Alpine High proved properties and upstream infrastructure which were written down to their fair values. These impairments are discussed in further detail below in “Property and Equipment - Oil and Gas Property.”

During the fourth quarter of 2019 Altus separately assessed its long-lived infrastructure assets for impairment based on expected reductions to future throughput volumes from Alpine High. Altus subsequently recorded impairments totaling

$

1.3

on its gathering, processing, and transmission (GPT) facilities. In the third quarter of 2019, Altus also recorded an impairment charge of

$


million

related to the cancellation of construction on a previously planned compressor station. These impairments are discussed in further detail below in “Property and Equipment - Gathering, Processing, and Transmission Facilities.”

Separate from the Company’s Alpine High and Altus impairments, Apache entered into agreements to sell certain of its assets in the western Anadarko Basin in Oklahoma and Texas. As a result of these agreements, a separate impairment analysis was performed for each of the assets within the disposal groups. The analyses were based on the agreed-upon proceeds less costs to sell for the transaction, a Level 1 fair value measurement. The carrying value of the net assets to be divested exceeded the fair value implied by the expected net proceeds, resulting in impairments in the second and fourth quarters of 2019 totaling

For the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company recorded asset impairments totaling

$


million

in connection with fair value assessments. Impairments totaling

$


million

and

$


million

were recorded for proved properties, and a gathering and processing facility in Oklahoma, respectively, which were written down to their fair values. These impairments are discussed in further detail below in “Property and Equipment.” During the third quarter of 2018, Apache agreed to sell certain of its unproved properties offshore the U.K. in the North Sea (North Sea). As a result, the Company performed a fair value assessment of the properties and recorded a

$


million

impairment on the carrying values of the associated capitalized exploratory well costs. The fair value of the impaired assets was determined using the negotiated sales price, a Level 1 fair value measurement. Also in 2018, the Company recorded

$


million

for the impairment of an equity method investment in the U.S. based on a negotiated sales price and

$


million

for inventory write-downs in the U.S. for obsolescence.

For the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company recorded asset impairments totaling

$


million

in connection with fair value assessments. In 2016, the U.K. government enacted Finance Bill 2016, providing tax relief to exploration and production (E&P) companies operating in the U.K. North Sea. Under the enacted legislation, the U.K. Petroleum Revenue Tax (PRT) rate was reduced to

zero

from the previously enacted


percent

rate in effect from January 1, 2016. PRT expense ceased prospectively from that date. During 2017, the Company fully impaired the aggregate remaining value of the recoverable PRT decommissioning asset of

$


million

that would have been realized from future abandonment activities. The recoverable value of the PRT decommissioning asset was estimated using the income approach. The expected future cash flows used in the determination were based on anticipated spending and timing of planned future abandonment activities for applicable fields, considering all available information at the date of review. Apache has classified this fair value measurement as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

The Company considers all highly liquid short-term investments with a maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents. These investments are carried at cost, which approximates fair value.

As of

December 31, 2019

and


, Apache had

$


million

and

$

of the cash and cash equivalents balance at

December 31, 2019

and


, respectively, was held by Altus.

Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

Accounts receivable are stated at the historical carrying amount net of write-offs and an allowance for doubtful accounts. The carrying amount of Apache’s accounts receivable approximates fair value because of the short-term nature of the instruments. The Company routinely assesses the collectability of all material trade and other receivables. Many of Apache’s receivables are from joint interest owners on properties Apache operates. The Company may have the ability to withhold future revenue disbursements to recover any non-payment of these joint interest billings. The Company accrues a reserve on a receivable when, based on the judgment of management, it is probable that a receivable will not be collected and the amount of any reserve may be reasonably estimated.

As of

December 31, 2019

,


, and

Inventories

Inventories consist principally of tubular goods and equipment and are stated at the lower of weighted-average cost or net realizable value. Oil produced but not sold, primarily in the North Sea, is also recorded to inventory and is stated at the lower of the cost to produce or net realizable value.

APACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)

Property and Equipment

The carrying value of Apache’s property and equipment represents the cost incurred to acquire the property and equipment, including capitalized interest, net of any impairments. For business combinations, property and equipment cost is based on the fair values at the acquisition date.

Oil and Gas Property

The Company follows the successful efforts method of accounting for its oil and gas property. Under this method of accounting, exploration costs such as exploratory geological and geophysical costs, delay rentals, and exploration overhead are expensed as incurred. All costs related to production, general corporate overhead, and similar activities are expensed as incurred. If an exploratory well provides evidence to justify potential development of reserves, drilling costs associated with the well are initially capitalized, or suspended, pending a determination as to whether a commercially sufficient quantity of proved reserves can be attributed to the area as a result of drilling. This determination may take longer than one year in certain areas depending on, among other things, the amount of hydrocarbons discovered, the outcome of planned geological and engineering studies, the need for additional appraisal drilling activities to determine whether the discovery is sufficient to support an economic development plan, and government sanctioning of development activities in certain international locations. At the end of each quarter, management reviews the status of all suspended exploratory well costs in light of ongoing exploration activities; in particular, whether the Company is making sufficient progress in its ongoing exploration and appraisal efforts or, in the case of discoveries requiring government sanctioning, whether development negotiations are underway and proceeding as planned. If management determines that future appraisal drilling or development activities are unlikely to occur, associated suspended exploratory well costs are expensed.

Acquisition costs of unproved properties are assessed for impairment at least annually and are transferred to proved oil and gas properties to the extent the costs are associated with successful exploration activities. Significant undeveloped leases are assessed individually for impairment based on the Company’s current exploration plans. Unproved oil and gas properties with individually insignificant lease acquisition costs are amortized on a group basis over the average lease term at rates that provide for full amortization of unsuccessful leases upon lease expiration or abandonment. Costs of expired or abandoned leases are charged to exploration expense, while costs of productive leases are transferred to proved oil and gas properties. Costs of maintaining and retaining unproved properties, as well as amortization of individually insignificant leases and impairment of unsuccessful leases, are included in exploration costs in the statement of consolidated operations.

Costs to develop proved reserves, including the costs of all development wells and related equipment used in the production of crude oil and natural gas, are capitalized. Depreciation of the cost of proved oil and gas properties is calculated using the unit-of-production (UOP) method. The UOP calculation multiplies the percentage of estimated proved reserves produced each quarter by the carrying value of associated proved oil and gas properties. The reserve base used to calculate depreciation for leasehold acquisition costs and the cost to acquire proved properties is the sum of proved developed reserves and proved undeveloped reserves. The reserve base used to calculate the depreciation for capitalized well costs is the sum of proved developed reserves only. Estimated future dismantlement, restoration and abandonment costs, net of salvage values, are included in the depreciable cost.

Oil and gas properties are grouped for depreciation in accordance with ASC 932 “Extractive Activities—Oil and Gas.” The basis for grouping is a reasonable aggregation of properties with a common geological structural feature or stratigraphic condition, such as a reservoir or field.

When circumstances indicate that the carrying value of proved oil and gas properties may not be recoverable, the Company compares unamortized capitalized costs to the expected undiscounted pre-tax future cash flows for the associated assets grouped at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are independent of cash flows of other assets. If the expected undiscounted pre-tax future cash flows, based on Apache’s estimate of future crude oil and natural gas prices, operating costs, anticipated production from proved reserves and other relevant data, are lower than the unamortized capitalized cost, the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value. Fair value is generally estimated using the income approach described in ASC 820. If applicable, the Company utilizes prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving assets and liabilities that are identical or comparable to the item being measured as the basis for determining fair value. The expected future cash flows used for impairment reviews and related fair value calculations are typically based on judgmental assessments of future production volumes, commodity prices, operating costs, and capital investment plans, considering all available information at the date of review, a Level 3 fair value measurement.

Gathering, Processing, and Transmission Facilities

GPT facilities totaled

$


million

and

$

1.9

billion

at

December 31, 2019

and


, respectively, with accumulated depreciation for these assets totaling

$


million

and

$


million

for the respective periods. GPT facilities are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The estimation of useful life takes into consideration anticipated production lives from the fields serviced by the GPT assets, whether Apache-operated or third party, as well as potential development plans by Apache for undeveloped acreage within or in close proximity to those fields.

The Company assesses the carrying amount of its GPT facilities whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. If the carrying amount of these facilities is more than the sum of the undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss is recognized for the excess of the carrying value over its fair value.

As part of Apache’s fourth quarter 2019 capital planning review, the Company decided to materially reduce its planned investment in the Alpine High play. Altus management subsequently assessed its long-lived infrastructure assets for impairment given the expected reduction to future throughput volumes and recorded impairments of

$

1.3

billion

on its gathering, processing, and transmission assets. The fair values of the impaired assets were determined to be

$


million

as of the time of the impairment and were estimated using the income approach. The income approach considered internal estimates of future throughput volumes, processing rates, and costs. These assumptions were applied to develop future cash flow projections that were then discounted to estimated fair value, using discount rates believed to be consistent with those applied by market participants. In the third quarter of 2019, Altus separately recorded an impairment charge of

$


million

related to the cancellation of construction on a previously planned compressor station based on estimated sales proceeds for the associated equipment. Apache has classified these non-recurring fair value measurements as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.

During 2018, the Company recorded impairments of the entire net book value of certain GPT assets in the U.S. in the amount of

$


million

associated with a proposed divestiture package. During 2017, the Company recorded

no

impairments on GPT assets.

and


, respectively.

Asset Retirement Costs and Obligations

The initial estimated asset retirement obligation related to property and equipment and subsequent revisions are recorded as a liability at fair value, with an offsetting asset retirement cost recorded as an increase to the associated property and equipment on the consolidated balance sheet. Revisions in estimated liabilities can result from changes in estimated inflation rates, changes in service and equipment costs and changes in the estimated timing of an asset’s retirement. Asset retirement costs are depreciated using a systematic and rational method similar to that used for the associated property and equipment. Accretion expense on the liability is recognized over the estimated productive life of the related assets.

Capitalized

Interest

For significant projects, interest is capitalized as part of the historical cost of developing and constructing assets. Significant oil and gas investments in unproved properties actively being explored, significant exploration and development projects that have not commenced production, significant midstream development activities that are in progress, and investments in equity method affiliates that are undergoing the construction of assets that have not commenced principal operations qualify for interest capitalization. Interest is capitalized until the asset is ready for service. Capitalized interest is determined by multiplying the Company’s weighted-average borrowing cost on debt by the average amount of qualifying costs incurred. Once an asset subject to interest capitalization is completed and placed in service, the associated capitalized interest is expensed through depreciation or impairment.

Goodwill

Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of an entity over the estimated fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, and it is recorded in “Deferred charges and other” in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet. The Company assesses the carrying amount of goodwill by testing for impairment annually and when impairment indicators arise. The impairment test requires allocating goodwill and all other assets and liabilities to assigned reporting units. Apache assesses each country as a reporting unit, with Egypt being the only reporting unit to have associated goodwill. The fair value of the reporting unit is determined and compared to the book value of the reporting unit. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the book value, including goodwill, then goodwill is written down to its implied fair value through a charge to expense.

When there is a disposal of a reporting unit or a portion of a reporting unit that constitutes a business, goodwill associated with that business is included in the carrying amount to determine the gain or loss on disposal. The amount of goodwill allocated to the carrying amount of a business can significantly impact the amount of gain or loss recognized on the sale of that business. The amount of goodwill to be included in that carrying amount is based on the relative fair value of the business to be disposed of and the portion of the reporting unit that will be retained.

Revenue Recognition

On January 1, 2018, Apache adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606),” using the modified retrospective method on all contracts at the date of initial application. No cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings was recognized. As a result of the adoption, gas processing fees previously netted in revenue are recorded as “Gathering, processing, and transmission” in the Company’s statement of consolidated operations upon adoption. This accounting treatment has no impact on net income (loss), the consolidated balance sheet, the statement of consolidated cash flows, nor the statement of consolidated changes in equity and noncontrolling interest. Prior comparative periods have not been restated and continue to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods.

Upstream

The Company’s upstream oil and gas segments primarily generate revenue from contracts with customers from the sale of its crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids production volumes. Because the Company’s production fluctuates with potential operational issues, it is occasionally necessary to purchase third-party oil and gas to fulfill sales obligations and commitments. Sales proceeds related to third-party oil and gas purchases are also classified as revenue from customers. Under these short-term commodity sales contracts, the physical delivery of each unit of quantity represents a single, distinct performance obligation on behalf of the Company. Contract prices are determined based on market-indexed prices, adjusted for quality, transportation, and other market-reflective differentials. Revenue is measured by allocating an entirely variable market price to each performance obligation and recognized at a point in time when control is transferred to the customer. The Company considers a variety of facts and circumstances in assessing the point of control transfer, including but not limited to: whether the purchaser can direct the use of the hydrocarbons, the transfer of significant risks and rewards, and the Company’s right to payment. Control typically transfers to customers upon the physical delivery at specified locations within each contract and the transfer of title.

The Company’s Egyptian operations are conducted pursuant to production sharing contracts under which the contractor partners (Contractors) pay all operating and capital costs for exploring and developing defined concessions. A percentage of the production, generally up to


percent

, is available to Contractors to recover these operating and capital costs over contractually defined periods. The balance of the production is split among the Contractors and the Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation (EGPC) on a contractually defined basis. Additionally, the Contractors’ income taxes, which remain the liability of the Contractors under domestic law, are paid by EGPC on behalf of the Contractors out of EGPC’s production entitlement. Income taxes paid to the Arab Republic of Egypt on behalf of Apache as Contractor are recognized as oil and gas sales revenue and income tax expense and reflected as production and estimated reserves. Revenues related to Egypt’s tax volumes are considered revenue from a non-customer.

Midstream

The Company’s Altus segment generates revenue from contracts with its customer from its gathering, compression, processing, and transmission services provided on Apache’s natural gas and natural gas liquid production volumes. Under these long-term commercial service contracts, providing the related service represents a single, distinct performance obligation on behalf of Altus that is satisfied over time. In accordance with the terms of these agreements, Altus receives a fixed fee for each contract year, subject to yearly fee escalation recalculations. Revenue is measured using the output method and recognized in the amount to which Altus has the right to invoice, as performance completed to date corresponds directly with the value to its customers. For all periods presented, all midstream segment revenues were attributable to sales between Altus and Apache. All midstream revenues between Apache and Altus are fully eliminated upon consolidation.

Consolidated Revenues from Contracts with Customers

The following table represents consolidated revenues from contracts with customers for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018:

(1)

Oil and gas production revenues from non-customer represents income taxes paid to the Arab Republic of Egypt by EGPC on behalf of the Company. Revenue and associated expenses related to such tax volumes are recorded as “Oil and gas production revenues” and “Current income tax provision,” respectively, in the Company’s statement of consolidated operations.

(2)

Purchased oil and gas sales represent proceeds from the sale of commodity volumes which were purchased from third parties to fulfill volume commitments. Proceeds and associated costs related to such volumes are both recorded as “Other” under “Revenues and Other” in the Company’s statement of consolidated operations. Associated purchase costs totaled

$


million

and

$


million

for the years ended December 31,


and


, respectively.

Refer to Note 17—Business Segment Information for a disaggregation of revenue by product and reporting segment.

Payment Terms and Contract Balances

Payment terms under all contracts with customers are typically due and received within a short-term period of one year or less, after physical delivery of the product or service has been rendered. Receivables from contracts with customers, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, totaled

$


million

and

$

1.0

billion

as of

December 31, 2019

and


, respectively.

In accordance with the provisions of ASC 606, variable market prices for each short-term commodity sale are allocated entirely to each performance obligation as the terms of payment relate specifically to the Company’s efforts to satisfy its obligations. As such, we have elected the practical expedients available under the standard to not disclose the aggregate transaction price allocated to unsatisfied, or partially unsatisfied, performance obligations as of the end of the reporting period.

Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

Apache periodically enters into derivative contracts to manage its exposure to commodity price, interest rate, and/or foreign exchange risk. These derivative contracts, which are generally placed with major financial institutions, may take the form of forward contracts, futures contracts, swaps, or options.

Apache records all derivative instruments, other than those that meet the normal purchases and sales exception, on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at fair value. The Company does not apply hedge accounting to any of its derivative instruments. As a result, gains and losses from the change in fair value of derivative instruments are reported in current-period income as “Other” under “Revenues and Other” in the statement of consolidated operations.

For more information, please refer to Note 4—Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.

Income Taxes

Apache records deferred tax assets and liabilities to account for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the financial statements and tax returns. The Company routinely assesses the ability to realize its deferred tax assets. If the Company concludes that it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized, the tax asset is reduced by a valuation allowance. Numerous judgments and assumptions are inherent in the determination of future taxable income, including factors such as future operating conditions (particularly as related to prevailing oil and gas prices) and changing tax laws.

Foreign Currency Transaction Gains and Losses

The U.S. dollar is the functional currency for each of Apache’s international operations. The functional currency is determined country-by-country based on relevant facts and circumstances of the cash flows, commodity pricing environment and financing arrangements in each country. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses arise when monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are remeasured to their U.S. dollar equivalent at the exchange rate in effect at the end of each reporting period.

F-18

APACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)

Foreign currency gains and losses also arise when revenue and disbursement transactions denominated in a country’s local currency are converted to a U.S. dollar equivalent based on the average exchange rates during the reporting period.

Foreign currency transaction gains and losses related to current taxes payable and deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded as components of the provision for income taxes.

All other foreign currency transaction gains and losses are reflected in “Other” under “Revenues and Other” in the statement of consolidated operations. The Company’s other foreign currency gains and losses netted to losses of

$


million

,

$


million

, and

$

in


,


, and


, respectively.

Insurance Coverage

The Company recognizes an insurance receivable when collection of the receivable is deemed probable. Any recognition of an insurance receivable is recorded by crediting and offsetting the original charge. Any differential arising between insurance recoveries and insurance receivables is recorded as a capitalized cost or as an expense, consistent with its original treatment.

Earnings Per Share

The Company’s basic earnings per share (EPS) amounts have been computed based on the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS reflects potential dilution, using the treasury stock method, which assumes that options were exercised and restricted stock was fully vested. The impact to net income (loss) attributable to common stock on an assumed conversion of the redeemable noncontrolling Preferred Units interest in Altus Midstream LP were anti-dilutive for the year ended December 31, 2019.

Stock-Based Compensation

Apache grants various types of stock-based awards including stock options, restricted stock, cash-settled restricted stock units, and performance-based awards. Stock compensation equity awards granted are valued on the date of grant and are expensed over the required vesting service period. Cash-settled awards are recorded as a liability based on the Company’s stock price and remeasured at the end of each reporting period over the vesting terms. The Company has elected to account for forfeitures as they occur rather than estimate expected forfeitures. The Company’s stock-based compensation plans and related accounting policies are defined and described more fully in Note 14—Capital Stock.

Treasury Stock

The Company follows the weighted-average-cost method of accounting for treasury stock transactions.

New Pronouncements Issued But Not Yet Adopted

In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU 2016-13, “Financial Instruments-Credit Losses.” The standard changes the impairment model for trade receivables, held-to-maturity debt securities, net investments in leases, loans, and other financial assets measured at amortized cost. This ASU requires the use of a new forward-looking “expected loss” model compared to the current “incurred loss” model, resulting in accelerated recognition of credit losses. This update is effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of 2020. The Company has completed its initial assessment of credit losses and continues to evaluate and monitor standard setting activity. The adoption and implementation of this ASU will not have a material impact on its financial statements.

In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, “Disclosure Framework: Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement,” which changes the disclosure requirements for fair value measurements by removing, adding, and modifying certain disclosures. This update is effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of 2020. The adoption and implementation of this ASU will not have a material impact on the disclosures of its financial statements.

In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-15, “Customer’s Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That is a Service Contract.” This pronouncement clarifies the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs in cloud computing arrangements and aligns them with the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software. This update is effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of 2020. The adoption and implementation of this ASU will not have a material impact on its financial statements.

In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-14, “Disclosure Framework: Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Defined Benefit Plans,” which eliminates, modifies, and adds disclosure requirements for defined benefit plans. This update is effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of 2021. The Company does not expect the adoption of this ASU to have a material impact on its financial statements.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)

In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, “Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes.” This pronouncement is part of the Simplification Initiative and simplifies the accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions to the general principles of ASC Topic 740 “Income Taxes.” In addition, the amendment improves consistent application of and simplifies GAAP for other areas of ASC Topic 740 by clarifying and amending existing guidance. This update is effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of 2021, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the new guidance and does not believe this standard will have a material impact on its financial statements.

of cash, net of transaction expenses. The transaction was accounted for by Altus as a reverse recapitalization. Under this method of accounting, Altus Midstream Company was treated as the “acquired” company, and Apache’s contributed assets of approximately

$

1.1

billion

remained at historical cost, with no goodwill or other intangible assets recorded. Apache owns an approximate


percent

ownership interest in Altus.

Apache fully consolidates the assets and liabilities of Altus in its consolidated financial statements, with a corresponding noncontrolling interest reflected separately. Apache recorded a noncontrolling interest of

$


million

upon closing, which is reflected as a separate component of equity in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet. This represents approximately


percent

third party ownership of the net assets in Altus at the time of the transaction. The cash contributions in excess of the noncontrolling interest were recognized as additional paid-in capital.

Other Activity

During 2018, Apache completed the sale of certain non-core assets and leasehold, primarily in the North Sea and Permian regions, in multiple transactions for total cash proceeds of

$

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES

Objectives and Strategies

Apache is exposed to fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas prices on the majority of its worldwide production, as well as transactions denominated in foreign currencies. The Company manages the variability in its cash flows by occasionally entering into derivative transactions on a portion of its crude oil and natural gas production and foreign currency transactions. The Company also utilizes various types of derivative financial instruments to manage fluctuations in cash flows resulting from changes in commodity prices or foreign currency values.

Counterparty Risk

The use of derivative instruments exposes the Company to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparty. To reduce the concentration of exposure to any individual counterparty, Apache utilizes a diversified group of investment-grade rated counterparties, primarily financial institutions, for its derivative transactions. The Company monitors counterparty creditworthiness on an ongoing basis; however, it cannot predict sudden changes in counterparties’ creditworthiness. In addition, even if such changes are not sudden, the Company may be limited in its ability to mitigate an increase in counterparty credit risk. Should one of these counterparties not perform, Apache may not realize the benefit of some of its derivative instruments resulting from changes in commodity prices, currency exchange rates, or interest rates.

Derivative Instruments

Commodity Derivative Instruments

As of December 31, 2019, Apache had no open commodity derivative positions.

Foreign Currency Derivative Instruments

Apache has open foreign currency costless collar contracts in GBP/USD for

£

13.5

million

per each calendar month for 2020 with a weighted average floor and ceiling price of

$

1.26

and

$

, respectively.

Embedded Derivatives

Altus Preferred Units Embedded Derivative

During the second quarter of 2019, Altus Midstream LP issued and sold Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Units. Certain redemption features (the Redemption Option) embedded within the terms of the Preferred Units require bifurcation and measurement at fair value. For further discussion of this derivative, see “Fair Value Measurements” below and Note 13—Redeemable Noncontrolling Interest - Altus.

F-23

APACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)

Pipeline Capacity Embedded Derivative

During the fourth quarter of 2019, Apache entered into an agreement to assign a portion of its contracted capacity under an existing transportation agreement to a third party. Embedded in this agreement is an arrangement under which Apache has the potential to receive payments calculated based on pricing differentials between Houston Ship Channel and Waha during calendar years 2020 and 2021. This feature requires bifurcation and measurement of the change in market value for each period. Unrealized gains or losses in the fair value of this feature are recorded as “Other” under “Revenues and Other” in the statement of consolidated operations. Any proceeds received during the two-year period will be recorded as a deferred gain and reflected in income over the tenure of the host contract.

Fair Value Measurements

The fair values of the Company’s derivative instruments and pipeline capacity embedded derivative are not actively quoted in the open market. The Company primarily uses a market approach to estimate the fair values of these derivatives on a recurring basis, utilizing futures pricing for the underlying positions provided by a reputable third party, a Level 2 fair value measurement.

The fair value of the Redemption Option, a Level 3 fair value measurement, was based on numerous factors including expected future interest rates using the Black-Karasinski model, the imputed interest rate of Altus, the timing of periodic cash distributions, and dividend yields of the Preferred Units. Increases or decreases in interest rates would result in a higher/lower fair value measurement.

The following table presents the Company’s derivative assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis:

The derivative fair values are based on analysis of each contract on a gross basis, excluding the impact of netting agreements with counterparties.

EQUITY METHOD INTERESTS

Apache, through its ownership of Altus, has the following equity method interests in four Permian Basin long-haul pipeline entities which are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. For each of the equity method interests, Altus has the ability to exercise significant influence based on certain governance provisions and its participation in activities and decisions that impact the management and economic performance of the equity method interests.

As of

December 31, 2019

and

December 31, 2018

, unamortized basis differences included in the equity method interest balances were

$


million

and

$


million

, respectively. These amounts represent differences in contributions to date and Altus’ underlying equity in the separate net assets within the financial statements of the respective entities. Unamortized basis differences are amortized into net income over the useful lives of the underlying pipeline assets when they are placed into service.

The following table presents the activity in Altus’ equity method interests for the year ended

December 31, 2019

:

and


:

The ARO liability reflects the estimated present value of the amount of dismantlement, removal, site reclamation, and similar activities associated with Apache’s oil and gas properties and other long-lived assets. The Company utilizes current retirement costs to estimate the expected cash outflows for retirement obligations. The Company estimates the ultimate productive life of the properties, a risk-adjusted discount rate, and an inflation factor in order to determine the current present value of this obligation. To the extent future revisions to these assumptions impact the present value of the existing ARO liability, a corresponding adjustment is made to the oil and gas property or other long-lived asset balance.

During

DEBT AND FINANCING COSTS

Overview

All of the Company’s debt is senior unsecured debt and has equal priority with respect to the payment of both principal and interest. All indentures for the notes and debentures described below place certain restrictions on the Company, including limits on Apache’s ability to incur debt secured by certain liens. Certain of these indentures also restrict the Company’s ability to enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions and give holders the option to require the Company to repurchase outstanding notes and debentures upon certain changes in control. None of the indentures contain prepayment obligations in the event of a decline in credit ratings.

In January 2017, the Company purchased and canceled

$


million

aggregate principal amount of senior notes for

$


million

in cash, including accrued interest and

$


million

of premium, which completed the open market

$


million

repurchase program initiated in 2016. These repurchases resulted in a

$


million

net loss on extinguishment of debt, which is included in “Financing costs, net” in the Company’s consolidated statement of operations. The net loss includes an acceleration of related discount and deferred financing costs.

In August 2018, Apache closed an offering of

$

1.0

billion

in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured

4.375

%

notes due October 15, 2028. The notes are redeemable at any time, in whole or in part, at Apache’s option, subject to a make-whole premium. The net proceeds from the sale of the notes were used to purchase certain outstanding notes in cash tender offers, repay notes that matured in September 2018, and for general corporate purposes.

Also in August 2018, Apache closed cash tender offers for certain outstanding notes. Apache accepted for purchase

$


million

aggregate principal amount of certain notes covered by the tender offers. Apache paid holders an aggregate of approximately

$


million

reflecting principal, the discount to par, early tender premium, and accrued and unpaid interest. The Company recorded a net loss of

$


million

on extinguishment of debt, including

$


million

of unamortized debt issuance costs and discount, in connection with the note purchases.

On June 19, 2019, Apache closed offerings of

$

1.0

billion

in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes, comprised of

$


million

in aggregate principal amount of

4.250

%

notes due January 15, 2030 and

$


million

in aggregate principal amount of

5.350

%

notes due July 1, 2049. The notes are redeemable at any time, in whole or in part, at Apache’s option, subject to a make-whole premium. The net proceeds from the sale of the notes were used to purchase certain outstanding notes in cash tender offers and for general corporate purposes.

On June 21, 2019, the Company closed cash tender offers for certain outstanding notes. Apache accepted for purchase

$


million

aggregate principal amount of certain notes covered by the tender offers. Apache paid holders an aggregate of approximately

The Company has certain uncommitted money market and overdraft lines of credit that are used from time to time for working capital purposes. As of

December 31, 2019

and


, there were

no

outstanding balances on Apache’s lines of credit.

Unsecured Committed Bank Credit Facilities

In March 2018, Apache entered into a revolving credit facility with commitments totaling

$

4.0

billion

. In March 2019, the term of this facility was extended by one year to March 2024 (subject to Apache’s remaining one-year extension option) pursuant to Apache’s exercise of an extension option. The Company can increase commitments up to

$

5.0

billion

by adding new lenders or obtaining the consent of any increasing existing lenders. The facility includes a letter of credit subfacility of up to

$

3.0

billion

, of which

$

2.08

billion

was committed as of

December 31, 2019

. The facility is for general corporate purposes and committed borrowing capacity fully supports Apache’s commercial paper program. Letters of credit are available for security needs, including in respect of abandonment obligations assumed in various North Sea acquisitions. As of

December 31, 2019

, there were

no

borrowings or letters of credit outstanding under this facility. As of December 31, 2018, letters of credit aggregating approximately

£

112.5

million

and no borrowings were outstanding under this facility. In February 2019,

£

109.4

million

of these letters of credit no longer were required and were terminated. In connection with entry into this facility, Apache terminated

$

3.5

billion

and

£


million

in commitments under

two

former credit facilities and wrote off

$


million

of associated debt issuance costs, which is included in “Financing costs, net” in the Company’s consolidated statement of operations.

At Apache’s option, the interest rate per annum for borrowings under the 2018 facility is either a base rate, as defined, plus a margin, or the London Inter-bank Offered Rate (LIBOR), plus a margin. Apache also pays quarterly a facility fee at a per annum rate on total commitments. The margins and the facility fee vary based upon the Company’s senior long-term debt rating. At

December 31, 2019

, the base rate margin was

0.075

percent

, the LIBOR margin was

1.075

percent

, and the facility fee was

0.175

percent

. A commission is payable quarterly to lenders on the face amount of each outstanding letter of credit at a per annum rate equal to the LIBOR margin then in effect. Customary letter of credit fronting fees and other charges are payable to issuing banks.

The financial covenants of the 2018 credit facility require Apache to maintain an adjusted debt-to-capital ratio of not greater than


percent

at the end of any fiscal quarter. For purposes of this calculation, capital excludes the effects of non-cash write-downs, impairments, and related charges occurring after June 30, 2015.

The 2018 facility’s negative covenants restrict the ability of Apache and its subsidiaries to create liens securing debt on its hydrocarbon-related assets, with exceptions for liens typically arising in the oil and gas industry; liens securing debt incurred to finance the acquisition, construction, improvement, or capital lease of assets, provided that such debt, when incurred, does not exceed the subject purchase price and costs, as applicable, and related expenses; liens on subsidiary assets located outside of the United States and Canada; and liens arising as a matter of law, such as tax and mechanics’ liens. Apache also may incur liens on assets if debt secured thereby does not exceed


percent

of Apache’s consolidated net tangible assets, or approximately

$

2.4

billion

as of

December 31, 2019

. Negative covenants also restrict Apache’s ability to merge with another entity unless it is the surviving entity, dispose of substantially all of its assets, and guarantee debt of non-consolidated entities in excess of the stated threshold.

In November 2018, Altus Midstream LP entered into a revolving credit facility for general corporate purposes that matures in November 2023 (subject to Altus Midstream LP’s

two

,

one

-year extension options). The agreement for this facility, as amended, provides aggregate commitments from a syndicate of banks of

$


million

. All aggregate commitments include a letter of credit subfacility of up to

$


million

and a swingline loan subfacility of up to

$


million

. Altus Midstream LP may increase commitments up to an aggregate

$

1.5

billion

by adding new lenders or obtaining the consent of any increasing existing lenders. As of

December 31, 2019

, there were

$


million

of borrowings and

no

letters of credit outstanding under this facility. There were

no

outstanding borrowings or letters of credit under this facility as of

The agreement for Altus Midstream LP’s credit facility, as amended, restricts distributions in respect of capital to Apache and other unit holders in certain circumstances. Unless the Leverage Ratio is less than or equal to

4.00

:

1.00

, the agreement limits such distributions to

$


million

per calendar year until either (i) the consolidated net income of Altus Midstream LP and its restricted subsidiaries, as adjusted pursuant to the agreement, for three consecutive calendar months equals or exceeds

$

350.0

million

. In no event can any distribution be made that would, after giving effect to it on a pro forma basis, result in a Leverage Ratio greater than (i)

5.00

:

1.00

or (ii) for a specified period after a qualifying acquisition,

restricted subsidiaries for the 12-month period ending immediately before the determination date. The Leverage Ratio as of December 31, 2019 was less than

4.00

:

1.00

.

The terms of Altus Midstream LP’s Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Units also contain certain restrictions on distributions in respect of capital, including the common units held by Apache and any other units that rank junior to the Preferred Units with respect to distributions or distributions upon liquidation. Refer to Note 13—Redeemable Noncontrolling Interest - Altus for further information. In addition, the amount of any cash distributions to Altus Midstream LP by any entity in which it has an interest accounted for by the equity method is subject to such entity’s compliance with the terms of any debt or other agreements by which it may be bound, which in turn may impact the amount of funds available for distribution by Altus Midstream LP to its partners.

The Altus Midstream LP credit facility is unsecured and is not guaranteed by Apache or any of Apache’s other subsidiaries.

There are no clauses in either the agreement for Apache’s 2018 credit facility or for Altus Midstream LP’s 2018 credit facility that permit the lenders to accelerate payments or refuse to lend based on unspecified material adverse changes. These agreements do not have drawdown restrictions or prepayment obligations in the event of a decline in credit ratings. However, each agreement allows the lenders to accelerate payment maturity and terminate lending and issuance commitments for nonpayment and other breaches, and if a borrower or any of its subsidiaries defaults on other indebtedness in excess of the stated threshold, is insolvent, or has any unpaid, non-appealable judgment against it for payment of money in excess of the stated threshold. Lenders may also accelerate payment maturity and terminate lending and issuance commitments under the applicable agreement if Apache or Altus Midstream LP, as applicable, undergoes a specified change in control or any borrower has specified pension plan liabilities in excess of the stated threshold. Each of Apache and Altus Midstream LP was in compliance with the terms of its 2018 credit facility as of

Also on December 22, 2017, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (SAB 118) which provides guidance for the application of ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes, for the income tax effects of the TCJA. SAB 118 provides a measurement period which should not extend beyond one year of the enactment date of the TCJA. In 2018, the Company recorded an additional

$


million

deferred tax expense attributable to the deemed repatriation of foreign earnings. This deferred tax expense combined with the provisional amount recorded in 2017 were fully offset by available foreign tax credits. Additional guidance issued by the Internal Revenue Service in 2018 clarified, among other things, the ability for taxpayers generating current tax losses to utilize foreign tax credits to fully offset taxes attributable to the deemed repatriation of foreign earnings, rather than utilizing 2017 current year losses. In light of the new guidance, the Company increased its 2017 net operating losses by

$

1.2

billion

, which resulted in incremental

$


million

deferred tax expense associated with the remeasurement of the 2017 net operating loss deferred tax asset from

35 percent

to

21 percent

. The Company completed its analysis of the income tax effects of the TCJA in the fourth quarter of 2018.

The Company has recorded an increase in valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets, primarily driven by asset impairments. The Company has assessed the future potential to realize these deferred tax assets and has concluded that it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will not be realized based on current economic conditions and expectations for the future.

In 2017, the Company completed the sale of its Canadian assets. As such, except for capital losses incurred on the sale, the deferred tax assets, liabilities, and valuation allowance related to these assets were removed for 2017.

The Company has a U.S. net operating loss carryforward of

$

8.1

billion

, which includes

$


million

of net operating loss subject to annual limitation under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (Code). Net operating losses generated in tax years beginning after 2017 are subject to an

80 percent

taxable income limitation with indefinite carryover under the TCJA. The Company also has a net interest expense carryover of

$


million

under Section 163(j) of the Code subject to indefinite carryover, a U.S. capital loss carryforward of

$

1.8

billion

, which has a

five

year carryover period expiring in 2023 and a Canadian capital loss carryforward of

$


million

which has an indefinite carryover. The Company has recorded a full valuation allowance against the U.S. net operating losses, the state net operating losses, the net interest expense carryover, the U.S. capital loss, and the Canadian capital loss because it is probable that these attributes will not be realized.

On

The Company has a

U.S. foreign tax credit carryforward. The Company has recorded a full valuation allowance against the U.S. foreign tax credits listed above because it is probable that these attributes will expire unutilized.

The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with ASC Topic 740, “Income Taxes,” which prescribes a minimum recognition threshold a tax position must meet before being recognized in the financial statements. Tax positions generally refer to a position taken in a previously filed income tax return or expected to be included in a tax return to be filed in the future that is reflected in the measurement of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities.

A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:

The Company records interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. Each quarter the Company assesses the amounts provided for and, as a result, may increase or reduce the amount of interest and penalties. During the years ended

The 2019 increase of unrecognized tax benefits is primarily related to the Company’s interpretation of certain proposed regulations issued since the passage of the TCJA. The Company is currently under IRS audit for the 2014 through 2017 tax years.

Apache and its subsidiaries are subject to U.S. federal income tax as well as income tax in various states and foreign jurisdictions. The Company’s uncertain tax positions are related to tax years that may be subject to examination by the relevant taxing authority.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

Legal Matters

Apache is party to various legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business, including litigation and governmental and regulatory controls. As of

December 31, 2019

, the Company has an accrued liability of approximately

$


million

for all legal contingencies that are deemed to be probable of occurring and can be reasonably estimated. Apache’s estimates are based on information known about the matters and its experience in contesting, litigating, and settling similar matters. Although actual amounts could differ from management’s estimate, none of the actions are believed by management to involve future amounts that would be material to Apache’s financial position, results of operations, or liquidity after consideration of recorded accruals. For material matters that Apache believes an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible, the Company has disclosed the nature of the matter and a range of potential exposure, unless an estimate cannot be made at this time. It is management’s opinion that the loss for any other litigation matters and claims that are reasonably possible to occur will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.

Argentine Claims

On March 12, 2014, the Company and its subsidiaries completed the sale of all of the Company’s subsidiaries’ operations and properties in Argentina to YPF Sociedad Anonima (YPF). As part of that sale, YPF assumed responsibility for all of the past, present, and future litigation in Argentina involving Company subsidiaries, except that Company subsidiaries have agreed to indemnify YPF for certain environmental, tax, and royalty obligations capped at an aggregate of

$


million

. The indemnity is subject to specific agreed conditions precedent, thresholds, contingencies, limitations, claim deadlines, loss sharing, and other terms and conditions. On April 11, 2014, YPF provided its first notice of claims pursuant to the indemnity. Company subsidiaries have not paid any amounts under the indemnity but will continue to review and consider claims presented by YPF. Further, Company subsidiaries retain the right to enforce certain Argentina-related indemnification obligations against Pioneer Natural Resources Company (Pioneer) in an amount up to

$


million

pursuant to the terms and conditions of stock purchase agreements entered in 2006 between Company subsidiaries and subsidiaries of Pioneer.

Louisiana Restoration

Louisiana surface owners often file lawsuits or assert claims against oil and gas companies, including Apache, claiming that operators and working interest owners in the chain of title are liable for environmental damages on the leased premises, including damages measured by the cost of restoration of the leased premises to its original condition, regardless of the value of the underlying property. From time to time restoration lawsuits and claims are resolved by the Company for amounts that are not material to the Company, while new lawsuits and claims are asserted against the Company. With respect to each of the pending lawsuits and claims, the amount claimed is not currently determinable or is not material. Further, the overall exposure related to these lawsuits and claims is not currently determinable. While an adverse judgment against the Company is possible, the Company intends to actively defend these lawsuits and claims.

Starting in November of 2013 and continuing into 2019, several parishes in Louisiana have pending lawsuits against many oil and gas producers, including Apache. These cases were all removed to federal courts in Louisiana. Some of the cases have been remanded to state court with the remand orders being appealed. Other of the cases have been stayed pending appeal. In these cases, the Parishes, as plaintiffs, allege that defendants’ oil and gas exploration, production, and transportation operations in specified fields were conducted in violation of the State and Local Coastal Resources Management Act of 1978, as amended, and applicable regulations, rules, orders, and ordinances promulgated or adopted thereunder by the Parish or the State of Louisiana. Plaintiffs allege that defendants caused substantial damage to land and water bodies located in the coastal zone of Louisiana. Plaintiffs seek, among other things, unspecified damages for alleged violations of applicable law within the coastal zone, the payment of costs necessary to clear, re-vegetate, detoxify, and otherwise restore the subject coastal zone as near as practicable to its original condition, and actual restoration of the coastal zone to its original condition. While an adverse judgment against the Company is possible, the Company intends to vigorously oppose these claims.

The Court recently entered final judgment in favor of the Company, ruling that the plaintiffs take nothing by their claims and awarding the Company its attorneys’ fees and costs incurred in defending the lawsuit. The plaintiffs have appealed.

Australian Operations Divestiture Dispute

Pursuant to a Sale and Purchase Agreement dated April 9, 2015 (Quadrant SPA), the Company and its subsidiaries divested their remaining Australian operations to Quadrant Energy Pty Ltd (Quadrant). Closing occurred on June 5, 2015. In April 2017, Apache filed suit against Quadrant for breach of the Quadrant SPA. In its suit, Apache seeks approximately AUD

$


million

. In December 2017, Quadrant filed a defense of equitable set-off to Apache’s claim and a counterclaim seeking approximately AUD

$


million

in the aggregate. The Company believes that Quadrant’s claims lack merit and will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operation, or liquidity.

Canadian Operations Divestiture Dispute

Pursuant to a Sale and Purchase Agreement dated July 6, 2017 (Paramount SPA), the Company and its subsidiaries divested their remaining Canadian operations to Paramount Resources LTD (Paramount). Closing occurred on August 16, 2017. On September 11, 2019, four ex-employees of Apache Canada on behalf of themselves and individuals employed by Apache Canada LTD on July 6, 2017, filed an Amended Statement of Claim in a matter styled

Stephen Flesch et. al. v Apache Corporation et. al

., No. 1901-09160 Court of Queen’s Bench of Alberta against the Company and others seeking class certification and a finding that the Paramount SPA amounted to a Change of Control of the Company, entitling them to accelerated vesting under the Company’s equity plans. In the suit, the purported class seeks approximately

$

USD and punitive damages. The Company believes that Plaintiffs’ claims lack merit and will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operation, or liquidity.

California Litigation

On July 17, 2017, in three separate actions, San Mateo County, California, Marin County, California, and the City of Imperial Beach, California, all filed suit individually and on behalf of the people of the state of California against over 30 oil, gas, and coal companies alleging damages as a result of global warming. Plaintiffs seek unspecified damages and abatement under various tort theories. On December 20, 2017, in two separate actions, the City of Santa Cruz and Santa Cruz County and in a separate action on January 22, 2018, the City of Richmond, filed similar lawsuits against many of the same defendants. On November 14, 2018, the Pacific Coast Federation of Fishermen’s Associations, Inc. also filed a similar lawsuit against many of the same defendants. The Company believes that the claims made against it are baseless and intends to vigorously defend these lawsuits.

Castex Lawsuit

In a case styled

Apache Corporation v. Castex Offshore, Inc, et. al.

, Cause No. 2015-48580, in the 113th Judicial District Court of Harris County, Texas, Castex filed claims for alleged damages of approximately

$

, relating to overspend on the Belle Isle Gas Facility upgrade, and the drilling of five sidetracks on the Potomac #3 Well. After a jury trial, a verdict of approximately

$


million

, plus fees, costs and interest was entered against the Company. The Company is appealing.

Oklahoma Class Actions

Apache is a party to two class actions in Oklahoma styled

Bigie Lee Rhea v. Apache Corporation

, Case No. 6:14-cv-00433-JH, and

Albert Steven Allen v. Apache Corporation

, Case No. CJ-2019-00219. The

Rhea

case has been certified, and the appeal of the certification was recently denied. The case includes a class of royalty owners seeking damages of over

$


million

for alleged breach of the implied covenant to market relating to post-production deductions and NGL uplift value. The

Allen

case has not been certified and seeks to represent a group of owners who have allegedly received late payments under Oklahoma statutes. The amount of this claim is not yet reasonably determinable. While an adverse judgment against the Company is possible, the Company intends to vigorously defend these lawsuits and claims.

Environmental Matters

The Company, as an owner or lessee and operator of oil and gas properties, is subject to various federal, state, local, and foreign country laws and regulations relating to discharge of materials into, and protection of, the environment. These laws and regulations may, among other things, impose liability on the lessee under an oil and gas lease for the cost of pollution clean-up resulting from operations and subject the lessee to liability for pollution damages. In some instances, the Company may be directed to suspend or cease operations in the affected area. The Company maintains insurance coverage, which it believes is customary in the industry, although the Company is not fully insured against all environmental risks.

Apache manages its exposure to environmental liabilities on properties to be acquired by identifying existing problems and assessing the potential liability. The Company also conducts periodic reviews, on a Company-wide basis, to identify changes in

F-38

APACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)

its environmental risk profile. These reviews evaluate whether there is a probable liability, the amount, and the likelihood that the liability will be incurred. The amount of any potential liability is determined by considering, among other matters, incremental direct costs of any likely remediation and the proportionate cost of employees who are expected to devote a significant amount of time directly to any possible remediation effort. As it relates to evaluations of purchased properties, depending on the extent of an identified environmental problem, the Company may exclude a property from the acquisition, require the seller to remediate the property to Apache’s satisfaction, or agree to assume liability for the remediation of the property. The Company’s general policy is to limit any reserve additions to any incidents or sites that are considered probable to result in an expected remediation cost exceeding

$

300,000

. Any environmental costs and liabilities that are not reserved for are treated as an expense when actually incurred. In Apache’s estimation, neither these expenses nor expenses related to training and compliance programs are likely to have a material impact on its financial condition.

As of

December 31, 2019

, the Company had an undiscounted reserve for environmental remediation of approximately

$


million

. The Company is not aware of any environmental claims existing as of

December 31, 2019

that have not been provided for or would otherwise have a material impact on its financial position, results of operations, or liquidity. There can be no assurance, however, that current regulatory requirements will not change or past non-compliance with environmental laws will not be discovered on the Company’s properties.

Leases and Contractual Obligations

On January 1, 2019, Apache adopted ASU 2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842),” which requires lessees to recognize separate right-of-use (ROU) assets and lease liabilities for most leases classified as operating leases under previous GAAP. Prior to adoption, the FASB issued transition guidance permitting an entity the option to not evaluate under ASU 2016-02 those existing or expired land easements that were not previously accounted for as leases, as well as an option to apply the provisions of the new standard at its adoption date instead of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements. Apache elected both transitional practical expedients. Under these transition options, comparative reporting was not required, and the provisions of the standard were applied prospectively to leases in effect at the date of adoption.

As allowed under the standard, the Company also applied practical expedients to carry forward its historical assessments of whether existing agreements contain a lease, classification of existing lease agreements, and treatment of initial direct lease costs. Apache also elected to exclude short-term leases (those with terms of 12 months or less) from the balance sheet presentation and accounts for non-lease and lease components as a single lease component for all asset classes. Short-term lease expense in


was

$


million

, primarily related to drilling activities in Block 58 offshore Suriname.

The Company determines if an arrangement is an operating or finance lease at the inception of each contract. If the contract is classified as an operating lease, Apache records an ROU asset and corresponding liability reflecting the total remaining present value of fixed lease payments over the expected term of the lease agreement. The expected term of the lease may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. If the Company’s lease does not provide an implicit rate in the contract, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate when calculating the present value. In the normal course of business, Apache enters into various lease agreements for real estate, drilling rigs, vessels, aircraft, and equipment related to its exploration and development activities, which are typically classified as operating leases under the provisions of the standard. ROU assets are reflected within “Deferred charges and other” within “Other” assets on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet, and the associated operating lease liabilities are reflected within “Other current liabilities” and “Other” within “Deferred Credits and Other Noncurrent Liabilities,” as applicable.

Operating lease expense associated with ROU assets is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Lease expense is reflected on the statement of consolidated operations commensurate with the leased activities and nature of the services performed. Gross fixed operating lease expense, inclusive of amounts billable to partners and other working interest owners, was

$


million

in


.

In addition, the Company periodically enters into finance leases that are similar to those leases classified as capital leases under previous GAAP. Finance lease assets are included in “Other” within “Property and Equipment” on the consolidated balance sheet, and the associated finance lease liabilities are reflected within “Current debt” and “Long-term debt,” as applicable. Prior periods include the reclassification of

$


million

finance lease obligations from “Other” within “Deferred Credits and Other Noncurrent Liabilities” to “Long-term debt” on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet to conform with this presentation. There was no material impact to the Company’s statement of consolidated operations and statement of consolidated cash flows for its treatment of finance leases. Depreciation on the Company’s finance lease assets was

$

RETIREMENT AND DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLANS

Apache Corporation provides retirement benefits to its U.S. employees through the use of multiple plans: a 401(k) savings plan, a money purchase retirement plan, a non-qualified retirement/savings plan, and a non-qualified restorative retirement savings plan. The 401(k) savings plan provides participating employees the ability to elect to contribute up to


percent

of eligible compensation, as defined, to the plan with the Company making matching contributions up to a maximum of


percent

of each employee’s annual eligible compensation. In addition, the Company annually contributes


percent

of each participating employee’s annual eligible compensation to a money purchase retirement plan. The 401(k) savings plan and the money purchase retirement plan are subject to certain annually-adjusted, government-mandated restrictions that limit the amount of employee and Company contributions. For certain eligible employees, the Company also provides a non-qualified retirement/savings plan or a non-qualified restorative retirement savings plan. These plans allow the deferral of up to


percent

of each employee’s base salary, up to


percent

of each employee’s annual bonus (that accepts employee contributions) and the Company’s matching contributions in excess of the government mandated limitations imposed in the 401(k) savings plan and money purchase retirement plan.

Vesting in the Company’s contributions in the 401(k) savings plan, the money purchase retirement plan, the non-qualified retirement savings plan and the non-qualified restorative retirement savings plan occurs at the rate of


percent

for every completed year of employment. Upon a change in control of ownership of Apache Corporation, immediate and full vesting occurs.

Additionally, Apache North Sea Limited maintains a separate retirement plan, as required under the laws of the U.K.

The aggregate annual cost to Apache of all U.S. and international

savings plans, the money purchase retirement plan, non-qualified retirement/savings plan, and non-qualified restorative retirement savings plan was

$

, and

$

Apache also provides a funded noncontributory defined benefit pension plan (U.K. Pension Plan) covering certain employees of the Company’s North Sea operations in the U.K. The plan provides defined pension benefits based on years of service and final salary. The plan applies only to employees who were part of BP North Sea’s pension plan as of April 2, 2003, prior to the acquisition of BP North Sea by the Company effective July 1, 2003.

Additionally, the Company offers postretirement medical benefits to U.S. employees who meet certain eligibility requirements. Eligible participants receive medical benefits up until the age of


or at the date they become eligible for Medicare, provided the participant remits the required portion of the cost of coverage. The plan is contributory with participants’ contributions

Altus Midstream LP is restricted from declaring or making cash distributions on its common units until all required distributions on the Preferred Units have been paid. In addition, before the fifth anniversary of Closing, aggregate cash distributions on, and redemptions of, Altus Midstream LP’s common units are limited to

$


million

of cash from ordinary course operations if permitted under its credit facility. Cash distributions on, and redemptions of, Altus Midstream LP’s common units also are subject to satisfaction of leverage ratio requirements specified in its partnership agreement.

Classification

The Preferred Units are accounted for on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets as a redeemable noncontrolling interest classified as temporary equity based on the terms of the Preferred Units, including the redemption rights with respect thereto.

Initial Measurement

Altus recorded the net transaction price of

$


million

, calculated as the negotiated transaction price of

$


million

, less issue discounts of

$


million

and transaction costs totaling

$


million

.

Certain redemption features embedded within the terms of the Preferred Units require bifurcation and measurement at fair value. Altus bifurcated and recognized at fair value an embedded derivative related to the Preferred Units at inception of

$


million

for a redemption option of the Preferred Unit holders. The derivative is reflected in “Other” within “Deferred Credits and Other Noncurrent Liabilities” on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet at its current fair value of

$


million

. The fair value of the embedded derivative, a Level 3 fair value measurement, was based on numerous factors including expected future interest rates using the Black-Karasinski model, imputed interest rate of Altus, the timing of periodic cash distributions, and dividend yields of the Preferred Units. See Note 4—Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities for more detail.

APACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)

The net transaction price was allocated to the preferred redeemable noncontrolling interest and the embedded features according to the associated initial fair value measurements as follows:

Subsequent Measurement

Altus applies a two-step approach to subsequent measurement of the redeemable noncontrolling interest related to the Preferred Units by first allocating a portion of the net income of Altus Midstream LP in accordance with the terms of the partnership agreement. An additional adjustment to the carrying value of the Preferred Unit redeemable noncontrolling interest at each period end may be recorded, if applicable. The amount of such adjustment is determined based upon the accreted value method to reflect the passage of time until the Preferred Units are exchangeable at the option of the holder. Pursuant to this method, the net transaction price is accreted using the effective interest method to the Redemption Price calculated at the seventh anniversary of Closing. The total adjustment is limited to an amount such that the carrying amount of the Preferred Unit redeemable noncontrolling interest at each period end is equal to the greater of (a)(i) the carrying amount of the Preferred Units, plus (ii) the fair value of the embedded derivative liability or (b) the accreted value of the net transaction price.

Activity related to the Preferred Units for the year ended

December 31, 2019

is as follows:

(1)

Subsequent to the balance sheet date, Altus Midstream LP provided notice to the Preferred Unit holders of record at December 31, 2019 of the amount of the distribution on the Preferred Units for the quarter ended December 31, 2019. The holders also were notified that Altus Midstream LP elected to pay the entire amount of the approximate

distribution in-kind in additional Preferred Units (PIK Units) on February 14, 2020. In total,

11,168

PIK Units were issued in satisfaction of the required distribution.

Stock Compensation Plans

The Company has several stock-based compensation plans, which include stock options, restricted stock, and conditional restricted stock unit plans. On May 12, 2016, the Company’s shareholders approved the 2016 Omnibus Compensation Plan (the 2016 Plan), which is intended to provide eligible employees with equity-based incentives. The 2016 Plan provides for the granting of Incentive Stock Options, Non-Qualified Stock Options, Performance Awards, Restricted Stock Awards, Restricted Stock Units, Stock Appreciation Rights, Cash Awards, or any combination of the foregoing. A total of

14.4

million

shares were authorized and available for grant under the 2016 Plan as of

December 31, 2019

. Previously approved plans remain in effect solely for the purpose of governing grants still outstanding that were issued prior to approval of the 2016 Plan. All new grants are issued from the 2016 Plan. In 2018, the Company began issuing cash-settled awards (phantom units) under the restricted stock and conditional restricted stock unit plans. The phantom units represent a hypothetical interest in the Company’s stock and, once vested, are settled in cash.

Costs related to the plans are capitalized or expensed to “Lease operating expenses,” “Exploration,” or “General and administrative” in the Company’s statement of consolidated operations based on the nature of each employee’s activities.

A description of the Company’s stock-settled and cash-settled units compensation plans and related costs follows:

Stock Options

As of

December 31, 2019

, the Company had issued options to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock under the 2007 Omnibus Equity Compensation Plan, the 2011 Omnibus Equity Compensation Plan (2011 Plan), and the 2016 Plan (together, the Omnibus Plans). New shares of Company stock will be issued for employee stock option exercises. Under the Omnibus Plans, the exercise price of each option equals the closing price of Apache’s common stock on the date of grant. Options issued prior to 2016 generally become exercisable ratably over a

four

-year period and expire


years after granted. Options granted in or after 2016 become exercisable ratably over a

three

-year period and expire

Restricted Stock Units and Restricted Stock Phantom Units

The Company has restricted stock unit and restricted stock phantom unit (cash-settled) plans for eligible employees including officers. The programs created under the Omnibus Plans have been approved by Apache’s Board of Directors. The value of the stock-settled awards issued is established by the market price on the date of grant and is being recorded as compensation expense ratably over the vesting terms. The cash-settled awards compensation expense is recorded as a liability and remeasured at the end of each reporting period over the vesting terms. The restricted stock phantom units represent a hypothetical interest in either the Company’s stock or in ALTM’s common stock, as applicable, and, once vested, are settled in cash. The cash-settled awards compensation expense is recorded as a liability and remeasured at the end of each reporting period over the vesting terms. During

Performance Program

To provide long-term incentives for Apache employees to deliver competitive returns to the Company’s stockholders, the Company has granted conditional restricted stock units to eligible employees. Apache has a performance program for certain eligible employees with payout for


percent

of the shares based upon measurement of total shareholder return (TSR) of Apache common stock as compared to a designated peer group during a three-year performance period. Payout for the remaining


percent

of the shares is based on performance and financial objectives as defined in the plan. The overall results of the objectives are calculated at the end of the award’s stated performance period and, if a payout is warranted, applied to the target number of restricted stock units awarded. The performance shares will immediately vest

three

operating segments: Egypt, North Sea, and the U.S. Apache also has exploration interests in Suriname and other international locations that may, over time, result in reportable discoveries and development opportunities. Apache’s Upstream business explores for, develops, and produces natural gas, crude oil and natural gas liquids. During 2018, Apache established a new reporting segment for its U.S. midstream business separate from its upstream oil and gas development activities. The midstream business is operated by Altus, which owns, develops, and operates a midstream energy asset network in the Permian Basin of West Texas, anchored by midstream service contracts to Apache’s production from its Alpine High resource play. Additionally, Altus owns equity interests in a total of four Permian Basin pipelines that will access various points along the Texas Gulf Coast, providing it with fully integrated, wellhead-to-water connectivity.

The following table sets forth the capitalized costs and associated accumulated depreciation, depletion, and amortization relating to the Company’s oil and gas acquisition, exploration, and development activities:

Oil and Gas Reserve Information

Proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of natural gas, crude oil, condensate, and NGLs, which by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations. Estimated proved developed oil and gas reserves can be expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods. The Company reports all estimated proved reserves held under production-sharing arrangements utilizing the “economic interest” method, which excludes the host country’s share of reserves.

Estimated reserves that can be produced economically through application of improved recovery techniques are included in the “proved” classification when successful testing by a pilot project or the operation of an active, improved recovery program using reliable technology establishes the reasonable certainty for the engineering analysis on which the project or program is based. Economically producible means a resource that generates revenue that exceeds, or is reasonably expected to exceed, the costs of the operation. Reasonable certainty means a high degree of confidence that the quantities will be recovered. Reliable technology is a grouping of one or more technologies (including computational methods) that has been field-tested and has been demonstrated to provide reasonably certain results with consistency and repeatability in the formation being evaluated or in an analogous formation. In estimating its proved reserves, Apache uses several different traditional methods that can be classified in three general categories: (1) performance-based methods; (2) volumetric-based methods; and (3) analogy with similar properties. Apache will, at times, utilize additional technical analysis such as computer reservoir models, petrophysical techniques, and proprietary 3-D seismic interpretation methods to provide additional support for more complex reservoirs. Information from this additional analysis is combined with traditional methods outlined above to enhance the certainty of the Company’s reserve estimates.

There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves and projecting future rates of production and timing of development expenditures. The reserve data in the following tables only represent estimates and should not be construed as being exact.

Approximately


percent

of Apache’s year-end


estimated proved developed reserves are classified as proved not producing. These reserves relate to zones that are either behind pipe, or that have been completed but not yet produced, or zones that have been produced in the past, but are not now producing because of mechanical reasons. These reserves are considered to be a lower tier of reserves than producing reserves because they are frequently based on volumetric calculations rather than performance data. Future production associated with behind pipe reserves is scheduled to follow depletion of the currently producing zones in the same wellbores. Additional capital may have to be spent to access these reserves. The capital and economic impact of production timing are reflected in this Note 18, under “Future Net Cash Flows.”

were calculated using an unweighted arithmetic average of oil and gas prices in effect on the first day of each month in the respective year, except where prices are defined by contractual arrangements. Operating costs, production and ad valorem taxes and future development costs are based on current costs with no escalation. Future development costs include abandonment and dismantlement costs.

The following table sets forth unaudited information concerning future net cash flows for proved oil and gas reserves, net of income tax expense. Income tax expense has been computed using expected future tax rates and giving effect to tax deductions and credits available, under current laws, and which relate to oil and gas producing activities. This information does not purport to present the fair market value of the Company’s oil and gas assets, but does present a standardized disclosure concerning possible future net cash flows that would result under the assumptions used.
