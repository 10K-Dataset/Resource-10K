shall have their statutorily prescribed meanings when used in
this report. Quantities of natural gas are expressed in this
report in terms of thousand cubic feet (Mcf), million cubic feet
(MMcf), billion cubic feet (Bcf) or trillion cubic feet (Tcf).
Oil is quantified in terms of barrels (bbls); thousands of
barrels (Mbbls) and millions of barrels (MMbbls). Natural gas is
compared to oil in terms of barrels of oil equivalent
(boe) or million barrels of oil equivalent (MMboe). Oil and
natural gas liquids are compared with natural gas in terms of
million cubic feet equivalent (MMcfe) and billion cubic feet
equivalent (Bcfe). One barrel of oil is the energy equivalent of
six Mcf of natural gas. Daily oil and gas production is
expressed in terms of barrels of oil per day (b/d) and thousands
or millions of cubic feet of gas per day (Mcf/d and MMcf/d,
respectively) or millions of British thermal units per day
(MMBtu/d). Gas sales volumes may be expressed in terms of one
million British thermal units (MMBtu), which is approximately
equal to one Mcf. With respect to information relating to our
working interest in wells or acreage, “net” oil and
gas wells or acreage is determined by multiplying gross wells or
acreage by our working interest therein. Unless otherwise
specified, all references to wells and acres are gross.


PART I

ITEMS 1 AND 2. BUSINESS AND PROPERTIES

General

Apache Corporation, a Delaware corporation formed in 1954, is an
independent energy company that explores for, develops and
produces natural gas, crude oil and natural gas liquids. In
North America, our exploration and production interests are
focused in the Gulf of Mexico, the Gulf Coast, East Texas, the
Permian Basin, the Anadarko Basin and the Western Sedimentary
Basin of Canada. Outside of North America we have exploration
and production interests onshore Egypt, offshore Western
Australia, offshore the United Kingdom in the North Sea (North
Sea), offshore The People’s Republic of China (China), and
onshore Argentina. Our common stock, par value $0.625 per
share, has been listed on the New York Stock Exchange
(NYSE) since 1969, on the Chicago Stock Exchange
(CHX) since 1960, and on the NASDAQ National Market
(NASDAQ) since January 2004. On May 12, 2005, we filed
certifications of our compliance with the listing standards of
the NYSE and the NASDAQ, including our Chief Executive
Officer’s certification of compliance with the NYSE
standards. Through our website, http://www.apachecorp.com, you
can access electronic copies of the charters of the committees
of our Board of Directors, other documents related to
Apache’s corporate governance (including our Code of
Business Conduct and Governance Principles), and documents
Apache files with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC),
including our annual reports on
Form

10-K,

quarterly reports on
Form

10-Q,

and
current reports on
Form

8-K,

as well
as any amendments to these reports. Included in our annual and
quarterly reports are the certifications of our chief executive
officer and our chief financial officer that are required by
applicable laws and regulations. Access to these electronic
filings is available as soon as practicable after filing with
the SEC. You may also request printed copies of our committee
charters or other governance documents by writing to our
corporate secretary at the address on the cover of this report.

We hold interests in many of our U.S., Canadian, and other
International properties through operating subsidiaries, such as
Apache Canada Ltd., DEK Energy Company (DEKALB), Apache Energy
Limited (AEL), Apache International, Inc., and Apache Overseas,
Inc. Properties referred to in this document may be held by
those subsidiaries. We treat all operations as one line of
business.

Our Growth Strategy

Apache’s strategy is built on a portfolio of assets that
provide opportunities to grow through both grassroots drilling
and acquisition activities. We now have six core
areas — two in the United States, and in Canada,
Egypt, the United Kingdom sector of the North Sea and
Australia — encompassing 35 million acres. In
each core area, our goal is to build critical mass that supports
sustainable, lower-risk, repeatable drilling opportunities,
balanced by higher-risk, higher-reward exploration. Our
portfolio also is balanced in terms of gas vs. oil,
geologic risk, reserve life and political risk.

Over the past five years, we have invested approximately
$13.5 billion, with more than 70 percent of the total
spent on exploration and development activities. During that
five-year period, we have grown production by 75 percent
and reserves by 95 percent. How we allocate our capital
resources is reviewed quarterly, as we assess our portfolio of
drilling opportunities, service costs and the market for
producing assets.

When acquisition opportunities are identified, operational and
technical teams participate in the evaluation process, enabling
our personnel to move in quickly to execute exploitation
activities (including workovers, re-completions and drilling)
that will increase production and reserves, reduce costs per
unit produced and enhance profitability. Over time, we build
teams that have the technical knowledge and sense of urgency to
maximize value. This knowledge of producing basins and our
culture provide a platform for continued growth through
strategic acquisitions and drilling.

More than a decade ago, we recognized that the United States is
a mature oil and gas province and added an international
exploration component to our portfolio strategy, which provides
opportunities for larger reserve targets and a greater ability
to grow production and reserves through drilling. Apache is one
of the



leading acquirers of three-dimensional seismic data in the
industry today. Our technology experts have developed strategies
for cost-effective acquisition of

3-D

seismic, enabling
our technical teams to analyze the data and develop drilling
prospects on an accelerated timetable.

Operating regions are given the autonomy necessary to make
drilling and operating decisions and to act quickly. Management
and incentive systems underscore high cash flow and

rate-of

-return targets,
which are measured monthly, reviewed with senior management
quarterly and utilized to determine annual performance rewards.

The effectiveness of our portfolio strategy is illustrated by
2005 financial and operational results: Record earnings, cash
flow, production and year-end reserves even though Gulf of
Mexico operations were curtailed significantly by two of the
worst Gulf hurricanes in recorded history. Production
interruptions in the Gulf were offset by growth in other regions.

In the United States, the Gulf Coast Region consistently
delivers high returns on capital employed, as well as cash flow
significantly in excess of our exploration and development
spending. Acquisitions are part of the picture because, with
steep decline rates, offshore reserves are generally short-lived
and difficult to replace through drilling alone. The Central
Region brings the balance of long-lived reserves and consistent
drilling results in the Permian Basin of West Texas and New
Mexico, the Anadarko Basin in western Oklahoma and East Texas.
Apache’s future growth in the United States is more likely
to be achieved in the U.S. through drilling and
acquisitions, rather than through drilling activity alone.

In Canada, we have 7 million acres across British Columbia,
Alberta, Saskatchewan and Northwest Territories. We have a
multi-year inventory of low-risk drilling opportunities at
Nevis, Hatton and on acreage acquired in the ExxonMobil farm-in
agreements of 2004 and 2005. With acquisition and land costs
rising in Canada, these farm-ins provide a way for Apache to
earn acreage through drilling on 1,815 sections in Alberta
with no upfront costs. ExxonMobil retains a carried interest in
the fields. We also have opportunities to drill exploration
targets with higher reserve potential in the Northwest
Territories.

In Egypt’s Western Desert, Apache’s 10.7 million
acres encompass a sizable resource play in the Cretaceous Upper
Bahariya formations and outstanding exploration potential in
deeper intervals from lower Cretaceous to Jurassic that are
established producing trends. The Qasr gas/condensate field,
discovered in 2003, is the largest field ever found by Apache
with more than 2 trillion cubic feet of gas and 50 million
barrels of estimated recoverable reserves.

In Australia, we have expanded our exploration program to the
high-potential Perth, Exmouth and Gippsland basins while
continuing to exploit our acreage position and control of key
infrastructure in the Carnarvon Basin.

Apache entered the North Sea in 2003 with our acquisition of the
Forties Field, the largest field ever discovered in the United
Kingdom sector. Through drilling and extensive improvements to
the production infrastructure, we virtually doubled
production — and significantly reduced per-unit
operating costs — from the second quarter of 2003, our
first as operator, through the fourth quarter of 2005. We plan
continued drilling activity at Forties as well as exploration
drilling on blocks obtained in bid rounds.

We have maintained financial flexibility — at
year-end, our

debt-to

-capitalization
ratio was 17 percent — so we are in a solid
position to conduct an active drilling program and, potentially,
to acquire properties where we can add value and earn adequate
rates of return.

Apache has increased reserves in each of the last 20 years
and production in 26 of the last 27 years. We believe our
portfolio of assets provides a platform for profitable growth
through drilling and acquisitions across the cycles of our
dynamic industry.

In 2006, we are planning another active year of drilling. We
revise our capital expenditure estimates throughout the year
based on industry conditions and results to date. Therefore,
accurately projecting annual capital spending is difficult at
best. Our preliminary estimate of 2006 capital expenditures,
excluding acquisitions, is in excess of $3.7 billion. We
generally do not project estimates for acquisitions because
their timing is unpredictable; however, in early 2006 we closed
an acquisition announced in the latter part of 2005.



Also, on January 17, 2006, the Company announced an
agreement with Pioneer Natural Resources (Pioneer). Please refer
to the following Subsequent Acquisitions and Divestiture
section. We continually look for properties which we believe
will add value and earn adequate rates of return and will take
advantage of those opportunities as they arise.

Operating Highlights

We currently have interests in seven countries: the United
States, Canada, Egypt, Australia, the United Kingdom, China, and
Argentina. Our reportable segments are the United States,
Canada, Egypt, Australia, the North Sea, and Other
International. In the U.S., our exploration and production
activities are divided into two regions: Gulf Coast and Central.
At the end of 2005, approximately 69 percent of our
estimated proved reserves were located in North America. Also,
our North American regions contributed approximately
57 percent of our worldwide 2005 production.

The following table sets out a brief comparative summary of
certain key 2005 data for each area. More detailed information
regarding oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids (NGLs)
production and the average sales price received in each
geographic area for 2005, 2004, and 2003 is available later in
this section under “Production, Pricing and Lease Operating
Cost Data”. Also, further discussion and analysis of this
data is available in Item 7, Management’s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in
this Form

10-K.

For information concerning the revenues, expenses, operating
income (loss) and total assets attributable to each of our
reportable segments, see Note 14, Supplemental Oil and Gas
Disclosures (Unaudited), and Note 13, Business Segment
Information of Item 15 in this
Form

For
information regarding Oil and Gas Capital Expenditures for each
of the last three years, see Item 7, Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations, “Capital Resources and Liquidity” in this
Form

The following discussions include references to our plans for
2006. These only represent initial estimates and could vary
significantly from actual results. In recent years, there have
been large differences between our capital expenditure forecasts
and our actual activity. During the year, we routinely adjust
our level of spending based on success and changing industry
conditions.



United States

Gulf Coast

— The Gulf Coast region comprises
our interests in and along the Gulf of Mexico, primarily in the
areas on- and offshore Louisiana and Texas. Apache is the
largest acreage holder and the second largest producer in Gulf
waters less than 1,200 feet deep. In both 2005 and 2004,
the Gulf Coast was our leading region for both production
volumes and revenues. This region performed 325 workover and
recompletion operations during 2005 and completed 88 out of 114
total wells drilled. As of year-end 2005, the Gulf Coast region
accounted for 18.3 percent of our estimated proved
reserves. Although actual annual capital expenditures may change
considerably in 2006, we currently estimate spending
approximately $900 million to drill over 100 wells and
to continue our production enhancement and exploitation
programs. Our 2006 capital estimate does not include an
estimated $340 million of 2006 expenditures for repair,
redevelopment, and plugging and abandonment work required to
repair damage caused by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, a portion
of which will be covered by insurance.

Central

— The Central Region includes assets in
the Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico, East Texas, and
the Anadarko Basin of western Oklahoma, where the Company got
its start over 50 years ago. As of year-end 2005, the
Central region accounted for approximately 23.7 percent of
our estimated proved reserves, the second largest in the
Company. During 2005, we participated in 364 wells, 352 of
which were completed as productive. Apache performed 861
workovers and recompletions in the region during the year.
Although actual annual capital expenditures may change
considerably in 2006, we currently estimate spending
approximately $400 million, including $300 million to
drill nearly 400 wells and to continue our production
enhancement programs.

Marketing —

The Company began directly
marketing its own U.S. natural gas production in July 2003.
Our primary objective is to increase the value we receive for
our production through diversification of our customer base,
optimization of our processing and transportation agreements,
and real-time management of our sales process. The flexibility
to transport our gas from the wellhead has provided us access to
new markets as our customers now include Local Distribution
Companies (LDCs), utilities, end-users, integrated majors and
marketers. We manage the sales risk associated with our natural
gas production fluctuations by selling a portion of our
production into the daily market. We manage our credit risk by
selling to creditworthy customers, monitoring our credit
exposure daily and making adjustments as needed. [Prior to July
2003, Apache sold most of its U.S. natural gas production
to Cinergy Marketing and Trading, LLC (Cinergy) under a
long-term gas purchase agreement at prices based on a published
index. See Note 12, Transactions with Related Parties and
Major Customers of Item 15 in this
Form

10-K.]

In general, most of our gas is being sold on a monthly basis at
either monthly or daily market prices. In an effort to increase
our sales to direct users of natural gas and meet the needs of
our customers, we also periodically sell some of our gas under
long-term contracts at prices that fluctuate with market
conditions. Our relationships with LDCs and direct users of
natural gas continue to be an important focus of our marketing
efforts. Several years ago, we locked in fixed prices on a
portion of our U.S. future natural gas production using
long-term, fixed-price physical contracts. These contracts,
which represented approximately 10 percent of our 2005
U.S. natural gas production, will expire in 2006 through
2008. See Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
about Market Risk “Commodity Risk” in this
Form

10-K.

We market our own U.S. crude oil to integrated majors,
marketers and refiners. Contracts are generally 30 days and
renew automatically until canceled. These oil contracts
generally provide for sales at prices that change with daily
market conditions.

Canada

Overview —

Our exploration and development
activity in the Canadian region is concentrated in the Provinces
of Alberta, British Columbia, Saskatchewan and the Northwest
Territories. The region comprises 26.7 percent of our
estimated proved reserves, the largest in the Company. We hold
over 4.8 million net acres in Canada, the largest of the
North American regions. Canada was our most active drilling area
in 2005, with Apache participating in 1,674 gross wells,
over 80 percent of which were shallow development wells. We
completed 1,551 as producers and conducted 971 workover and
recompletion projects.



Apache is targeting fields such as Provost and Nevis for coalbed
methane (CBM) and in the process has emerged as the
nation’s largest producer of CBM. The North and South Grant
Lands obtained through ExxonMobil Corporation (ExxonMobil)
farm-in agreements (discussed below) provide additional CBM
potential. Although actual annual capital expenditures may
change considerably with industry conditions and results, we
currently estimate spending approximately $1 billion in
2006 to drill around 860 wells, continue our exploration
and exploitation program and develop our gas processing
infrastructure.

On May 5, 2005, Apache signed a farm-in agreement with
ExxonMobil covering approximately 650,000 acres of
undeveloped properties in the Western Canadian province of
Alberta. Under the agreement, Apache is to drill and operate
145 new wells over a

36-month

period with
upside potential for further drilling. ExxonMobil will retain a
37.5 percent royalty on fee lands and 35 percent of
its working interest on leasehold acreage. The agreement also
allows Apache to test additional horizons on approximately
140,000 acres of property covered in a 2004 farm-in
agreement with ExxonMobil. The 2004 farm-in agreement covered
approximately 380,000 acres and stipulated drilling at
least 250 wells over a two-year period beginning in October
of 2004. Through the end of 2005, Apache drilled 457 wells
on the 2004 farm-in acreage, earning 207 additional acreage
sections.

Marketing —

Our Canadian natural gas sales
include sales to LDCs, utilities, end-users, integrated majors,
supply aggregators and marketers in the United States and
Canada. With the expansion of pipeline transport capacity out of
Canada in recent years, Canadian prices have become more closely
correlated with United States prices. To diversify our market
exposure and optimize pricing differences in the U.S. and
Canada, we transport natural gas via our firm transportation
contracts to California, the Chicago area, and eastern Canada.
We currently have a limited number of longer term commitments to
sell gas, but the volumes are relatively small and none of the
terms extend beyond 2011. The prices we receive under these
contracts fluctuate monthly with market indices. The remainder,
which represents over 95 percent of our Canadian natural
gas production, is sold on a monthly basis at either monthly or
daily market prices.

Our Canadian crude oil is primarily sold to refiners, integrated
majors and marketers. To increase the market value of our
condensate and heavier crudes, our condensate is either used or
sold for blending purposes. We sell our crude oil and NGLs on
Canadian Postings, which are market reflective prices that
depend on worldwide crude oil prices and are adjusted for
transportation and quality. In order to reach more purchasers
and diversify our market, we transport crude on 12 pipelines to
the major trading hubs within Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba.

Egypt

Overview —

In Egypt, our operations are
generally conducted pursuant to production sharing contracts
under which the contractor pays all operating and capital
expenditure costs for exploration and development. A percentage
of the production, usually up to 40 percent, is available
to the contractor to recover operating and capital expenditure
costs. In general, the balance of the production is allocated
between the contractor and the Egyptian General Petroleum
Corporation (EGPC) on a contractually defined basis. Apache is
the largest acreage holder and the most active driller in the
Western Desert of Egypt. Egypt is the country with our largest
single acreage position where, as of December 31, 2005, we
held over 7.5 million net acres in 18 separate concessions,
including five new concessions and four exploration period
extensions on existing concessions that received parliamentary
approval in 2005. Development leases within concessions
generally have a

25-year

life with
extensions possible for additional commercial discoveries, or on
a negotiated basis. Apache is the largest producer of liquid
hydrocarbons and natural gas in the Western Desert. Egypt
contributed approximately 18 percent of both Apache’s
production revenues and total production. Egypt accounted for
12.8 percent of total estimated proved reserves at
December 31, 2005. Apache had an active drilling program in
Egypt, completing 104 of 121 gross wells, an
86 percent success rate. Although actual annual capital
expenditures may change considerably with industry conditions
and success, we currently plan to spend approximately
$700 million in 2006 drilling around 130 exploration,
development and appraisal wells and installing and upgrading
production facilities.



On January 6, 2006, the Company completed the sale of its
55 percent interest in the deepwater section of
Egypt’s West Mediterranean Concession to Amerada Hess for
$413 million. Apache announced this transaction on
October 13, 2005, and did not have any oil and gas reserves
recorded for these properties as of year-end 2005.

Please refer to Item 7, Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
“Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates, Allowance for
Doubtful Accounts” in this
Form

10-K

for a
discussion of our Egyptian receivables.

Marketing —

Historically, we and our partners
have sold our natural gas production to EGPC pursuant to

25-year

take-or-pay
contracts. Pricing under these contracts was originally based on
the energy equivalent of 85 percent of Gulf of Suez Blend
crude oil. Beginning in 2000, EGPC introduced an alternative
natural gas pricing formula for certain quantities of gas they
purchase. This Industry Pricing Formula is a sliding scale based
on Dated-Brent crude oil with a minimum of $1.50 per MMbtu
and a maximum of $2.65 per MMbtu upon reaching a
Dated-Brent price of $21.00 per barrel. Generally, the
Industry Pricing Formula applied to all new gas discovered and
produced, however, in exchange for extension of the Khalda
Concession lease in July 2004, Apache preserved the old Gulf of
Suez Blend gas price formula until 2013 for up to
100 MMcf/d produced from the South Umbarka Concession and
the Khalda, Khalda West, Salam and Tarek development leases and
agreed to accept the Industry Pricing on all production in
excess of that amount.

In Egypt, oil from the Khalda Concession, the Qarun Concession
and other nearby Western Desert blocks is either sold directly
into the Egyptian oil pipeline grid or exported. Oil production
that is presently sold to EGPC is sold on a spot basis at a
“Western Desert” price (indexed to Brent Crude Oil).
In 2005, we exported 21 cargoes (approximately 6.7 million
barrels) of Western Desert crude oil from the El Hamra and Sidi
Kerir terminals. These export cargoes were sold at market prices
comparable to domestic sales to EGPC. Additionally, 10 cargoes
representing 2.1 million barrels were sold in Egypt to
other non-governmental purchasers. Additional export sales from
both the Khalda and Qarun areas in the Western Desert have
continued in 2006.

Australia

Overview —

Our exploration activity in
Australia is focused in the offshore Carnarvon, Gippsland,
Browse, and Perth Basins where Apache holds 6.4 million net
acres in 35 Exploration Permits, 10 Production Licenses,
and six Retention Leases. Production operations are concentrated
in the Carnarvon Basin which is the location of all
10 Production Licenses, nine of which are operated by
Apache. In 2005, the region generated $401 million of
production revenues producing 13.1 MMboe (7.9 percent
of our total production) and accounted for 8.9 percent of
our year-end estimated proved reserves. During the year we
participated in drilling 36 wells; 26 exploration and 10
development wells. Eight of the exploration wells and eight of
the development wells were productive for an overall
44 percent success rate.

Australian region 2005 exploration successes included the
Albert, Artreus, and Mohave Flag Sandstone oil discoveries, the
Kultarr gas discovery, and appraisal successes in the Legendre
oil field and the John Brookes gas field. The three Flag
discoveries were drilled from existing infrastructure within the
Harriet Joint Venture acreage and as a result were able to be
completed and placed on production in 2005. Additionally, three
new developments commenced production in 2005, the Rose gas
field in June, the John Brookes gas field in September, and the
Bambra oil and gas field in October. Apache owns a
68.5 percent working and revenue interest in Rose and
Bambra, both of which are located within the Harriet Joint
Venture acreage, and a 55.0 percent working and revenue
interest in John Brookes.

During 2006, the Australian region plans to expand the Bambra
oil and gas development by drilling two additional production
wells, and increase Stag’s water injection capacity through
the addition of a western Stag-29H subsea injection well.
Additionally, the region plans to further appraise the recently
developed John Brookes gas field, as well as the Reindeer gas
field and Vincent oil field. Key factors for success in 2006
will be maintaining oil production, increasing gas production to
fulfill the requirements of six new gas contracts commencing in
2006, covering the significant increase in sales to Burrup
Fertilisers and continuing success in our exploration program.
Although actual annual capital expenditures may change
considerably with industry



conditions and success, we currently estimate spending
approximately $300 million in 2006 for around
50 exploration, appraisal and development wells, and
various new facilities and facility upgrades.

Marketing —

In Australia during 2005, we
executed six new gas sales contracts, agreed to terms for three
more sales by letter agreement, and increased our reserve
commitment in two active contracts. In aggregate, we committed
an additional 403 Bcf of gas (gross) for delivery. Under
the two largest contracts, we will supply 357 Bcf of gas
(gross) over a

16-year

period commencing July 2006. As of December 31, 2005,
Apache had a total of 31 active gas contracts with
expiration dates ranging from June 2006 to July 2030.

Apache expects a significant increase in natural gas sales
during 2006 compared to 2005 with Burrup Fertilisers scheduled
to begin taking its full daily contractual volume of
48.2 MMcf of gas per day (net to Apache) and initiation of
deliveries into the six new gas contracts previously discussed.
Five of the six new contracts will be supplied solely by Apache,
including a full year of sales into two of the contracts.
Generally, natural gas is sold in Western Australia under
long-term, fixed-price contracts, many of which contain price
escalation clauses based on the Australian consumer price index.
Apache realized an average price of US$1.72 per Mcf for gas
sold in Australia during 2005.

We continue to export all of our crude oil production into the
international market at prices which fluctuate with world market
conditions.

North Sea

Overview —

In 2003, we established a new core
area in the North Sea with our acquisition of the Forties Field.
First discovered in 1970, Forties has been one of the most
productive fields in the North Sea. In 2005, the region
generated $1.3 billion of oil revenue on 24 MMboe of
production up 23 percent from 2004 and over 50 percent
above the production level when Apache purchased the field.
During 2005, the North Sea’s oil revenues and daily oil
production were the highest in the Company. The Company spent
$489 million in the North Sea, including $198 million
on facility upgrades to improve the operating efficiency of the
platforms. We drilled 23 exploration and development wells
during 2005 with a 65 percent success rate, adding
45.2 MMboe of reserves. At year-end 2005, the Forties field
alone accounted for 9.3 percent of the Company’s total
estimated proved reserves.

Although actual annual capital expenditures may change
considerably with industry conditions and success, we currently
estimate spending approximately $400 million in 2006 of
which around 80 percent will be spent on the continuation
of the Forties drilling program (14 wells) and facility
upgrades to increase the operating efficiency of the platforms.
A new

3-D

seismic
survey across Forties completed in 2005 and now being processed
will yield a new

4-D

“snapshot” of Forties field and identify additional
drilling targets for the future. The facility upgrades include
new power generation infrastructure, new pipeline export pumps,
new cranes, new automated control systems and increased water
injection capacity. These upgrades will deliver additional oil
volumes and reduce lifting costs in 2006 and beyond.

Approximately 20 percent of our 2006 estimated capital
expenditures in the North Sea is projected to be spent on
expanding business beyond the Forties area. Apache acquired
14 new blocks in the 2004 UK license bid round and an
additional 22 North Sea blocks in the 2005 UK license bid
round. In addition, Apache

“farmed-in”

to four prospects during 2005 with successful discoveries
on three of those prospects that earned the Company ownership
interests in an additional five North Sea blocks. Additional
appraisal work is planned to determine the potential
commerciality of those three discoveries. In 2006, we have a

semi-submersible

drilling rig under contract for the second half of the year and
plan to drill five wells outside of Forties to evaluate the
potential of a significant portion of the new acreage additions.

Marketing —

Concurrent with the acquisition of
the North Sea properties, the Company entered into a separate
two year crude oil physical sales contract with BP PLC for
100 percent of our equity production. A portion of the
crude oil (25,000 b/d through January 31, 2004 and 40,000
b/d for the remainder of the term) was sold at fixed prices
while the remaining balance of crude oil was sold at prevailing
market prices. This contract expired on December 31, 2004.
For 2005, the Company entered into two new term contracts for
the physical sale of our crude oil at prevailing market prices,
which are composed of base market indices, adjusted for the
higher quality of Forties crude relative to Brent and a premium
to reflect the higher market value for term arrangements.



Other International

Argentina.

In 2001, we acquired limited exploration and
production assets from Fletcher Challenge and Anadarko Petroleum
Corporation (Anadarko) in Argentina. As a result of these
transactions, we hold interests in a small number of blocks in
Argentina’s Neuquen Basin. We are the operator with a
100 percent interest in two blocks and hold smaller
interests in three non-operated blocks. For 2005, these
interests represented less than one percent of our estimated
proved reserves and generated $17 million of production
revenue. All of our production is currently sold under term
arrangements into the domestic market under prevailing market
prices which are subject to regulatory caps. Our
December 31, 2005 net acreage position in Argentina
was 304,801 developed acres.

As discussed below, in January 2006, we announced plans to
increase greatly our holdings in Argentina by agreeing to buy
Pioneer’s Argentina operations. The Pioneer transaction is
expected to close in late March 2006. Our 2006 capital budget,
which includes activity on the Pioneer properties, is
approximately $100 million and includes $68 million to
drill 107 wells.

China.

In August 2003, first production came on stream
from our interests in the Zhao Dong block in Bohai Bay, China,
where we are currently the operator, with a 24.5 percent
interest, pursuant to a production sharing contract through
2023. Since production began, our portion of the production was
exported for sale to international markets outside of China at
prevailing market prices. For the period from March 1, 2005
to December 31, 2005, we sold our equity crude oil into the
domestic Chinese market pursuant to a term contract based upon
international market prices for oil imported into China. In
2005, our Chinese interests produced $131 million of
production revenue from 3 MMbbls of production. Although
actual capital expenditures may change considerably with
industry conditions and success, we currently estimate spending
approximately $21 million on 12 new wells, recompletions
and facility upgrades during 2006.

Subsequent Acquisitions and Divestiture

Amerada Hess

On January 5, 2006, the Company completed its purchase of
Amerada Hess’s interest in eight fields located in the
Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico for
$269 million. Apache estimates that these fields had proved
reserves of 27 million barrels of liquid hydrocarbons and
27 billion cubic feet of natural gas as of year-end 2005.
The Company had previously announced on October 13, 2005
that it had agreed to purchase Amerada Hess’s interest for
$404 million. The price and number of properties involved
in this transaction were reduced as a result of third parties
exercising their preferential rights.

On January 6, 2006, the Company completed the sale of its
55 percent interest in the deepwater section of
Egypt’s West Mediterranean Concession to Amerada Hess for
$413 million. Apache announced this transaction on
October 13, 2005 and did not have any oil and gas reserves
recorded for these properties as of year-end 2005.

Pioneer Natural Resources

On January 17, 2006, we announced plans to increase greatly
our holdings in Argentina by agreeing to buy Pioneer’s
Argentina operations. The transaction includes interest in 36
separate blocks on approximately 1.8 million gross acres
located in the Neuquen, Austral and San Jorge Basins. On
January 1, 2006, the properties were producing
approximately 9,000 barrels of liquids and 120 MMcf of
natural gas per day. The Pioneer transaction is expected to
close in late March 2006.

Drilling Statistics

Worldwide, in 2005, we participated in drilling 2,383 gross
wells, with 2,172 (91 percent) completed as producers. We
also performed over 2,157 workovers and recompletions
during the year. Historically, our drilling activities in the
U.S. generally concentrate on exploitation and extension of
existing, producing fields rather than exploration. As a general
matter, our operations outside of the U.S. focus on a mix
of exploration and exploitation wells. In addition to our
completed wells, at year-end several wells had not yet reached
completion: 91 in the U.S. (63.6 net); 40 in Canada
(36 net); 13 in Egypt (13 net); one in Australia
(0.7 net); and one in the North Sea (one net).



The following table shows the results of the oil and gas wells
drilled and tested for each of the last three fiscal years:



Productive Oil and Gas Wells

The number of productive oil and gas wells, operated and
non-operated, in which we had an interest as of
December 31, 2005, is set forth below:



Production, Pricing and Lease Operating Cost Data

The following table describes, for each of the last three fiscal
years, oil, NGLs and gas production, average lease operating
costs (including severance and other taxes) and average sales
prices for each of the countries where we have operations.

Gross and Net Undeveloped and Developed Acreage

The following table sets out our gross and net acreage position
in each country where we have operations.



The “Other International” drilling statistics on the
preceding page include activity in Poland. Apache ceased
operations in Poland in 2003 and the remaining acreage was fully
relinquished in early 2005.

Estimated Proved Reserves and Future Net Cash Flows

As of December 31, 2005, Apache had total estimated proved
reserves of 976 MMbbls of crude oil, condensate and NGLs
and 6.8 Tcf of natural gas. Combined, these total estimated
proved reserves are equivalent to 2.1 billion barrels of
oil or 12.7 Tcf of natural gas. The Company’s estimated
proved reserves grew for the 20th consecutive year.

The Company’s estimates of proved reserves and proved
developed reserves as of December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003,
changes in estimated proved reserves during the last three
years, and estimates of future net cash flows and discounted
future net cash flows from estimated proved reserves are
contained in Note 14, Supplemental Oil and Gas Disclosures
(Unaudited) of Item 15 in this
Form

10-K.

These
estimated future net cash flows are based on prices on the last
day of the year and are calculated in accordance with Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 69,
“Disclosures about Oil and Gas Producing Activities.”
Disclosure of this value and related reserves has been prepared
in accordance with SEC
Regulation

S-X

Rule

4-10.

Proved oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities of
natural gas, crude oil, condensate and NGLs that geological and
engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be
recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing
economic and operating conditions. Reserve estimates are
considered proved if economical producibility is supported by
either actual production or conclusive formation tests.
Estimated reserves that can be produced economically through
application of improved recovery techniques are included in the
“proved” classification when successful testing by a
pilot project or the operation of an active, improved recovery
program in the reservoir provides support for the engineering
analysis on which the project or program is based. Estimated
proved developed oil and gas reserves can be expected to be
recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and
operating methods.

Apache emphasizes that its reported reserves are estimates
which, by their nature, are subject to revision. The estimates
are made using available geological and reservoir data, as well
as production performance data. These estimates are reviewed
throughout the year, and revised either upward or downward, as
warranted by additional performance data.

Apache’s proved reserves are estimated at the property
level and compiled for reporting purposes by a centralized group
of experienced reservoir engineers who are independent of the
operating groups. These engineers interact with engineering and
geoscience personnel in each of Apache’s operating areas,
and with accounting and marketing employees to obtain the
necessary data for projecting future production, costs, net
revenues and ultimate recoverable reserves. Reserves are
reviewed internally with senior management and presented to
Apache’s board of directors in summary form on a quarterly
basis. Annually, each property is reviewed in detail by our
centralized and operating region engineers to ensure forecasts
of operating expenses, netback prices, production trends and
development timing are reasonable.

We engage Ryder Scott Company, L.P. Petroleum Consultants as
independent petroleum engineers to review our estimates of
proved hydrocarbon liquid and gas reserves and provide an
opinion letter on the reasonableness of Apache’s internal
projections. During this review, they prepare independent
projections for each reviewed property and determine if the
Company’s estimates are within engineering tolerance by
geographical area. The independent reviews typically cover a
large percentage of major value fields, international properties
and new wells drilled during the year. During 2005, 2004, and
2003, their review covered 74, 79 and 78 percent of
Apache’s estimated reserve value, respectively.

Employees

On December 31, 2005, we had 2,806 employees. None of our
employees is subject to collective bargaining agreements.



Offices

Our principal executive offices are located at One Post Oak
Central, 2000 Post Oak Boulevard, Suite 100, Houston, Texas
77056-4400. At year-end 2005, we maintained regional exploration
and/or production offices in Tulsa, Oklahoma; Houston, Texas;
Calgary, Alberta; Cairo, Egypt; Perth, Western Australia;
Aberdeen, Scotland; Beijing, China; and Buenos Aires, Argentina.
Apache leases all of its primary office space. The current lease
on our principal executive offices runs through
December 31, 2013. For information regarding the
Company’s obligations under its office leases, see the
information appearing in the table in Item 7,
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations, “Capital Resources and
Liquidity, Contractual Obligations” and Note 10,

Title to Interests

As is customary in our industry, a preliminary review of title
records is made at the time we acquire properties, which may
include opinions or reports of appropriate professionals or
counsel. We believe that our title to all of the various
interests set forth above is satisfactory and consistent with
the standards generally accepted in the oil and gas industry,
subject only to immaterial exceptions which do not detract
substantially from the value of the interests or materially
interfere with their use in our operations. The interests owned
by us may be subject to one or more royalty, overriding royalty,
and other outstanding interests (including disputes related to
such interests) customary in the industry. The interests may
additionally be subject to obligations or duties under
applicable laws, ordinances, rules, regulations, and orders of
arbitral or governmental authorities. In addition, the interests
may be subject to burdens such as production payments, net
profits interests, liens incident to operating agreements and
current taxes, development obligations under oil and gas leases,
and other encumbrances, easements, and restrictions, none of
which detract substantially from the value of the interests or
materially interfere with their use in our operations.

ITEM 1A.

RISK FACTORS

Our business activities and the value of our securities are
subject to significant hazards and risks, including those
described below. If any of such events should occur, our
business, financial condition, liquidity and/or results of
operations could be materially harmed, and holders and
purchasers of our securities could lose part or all of their
investments. Additional risks relating to our securities may be
included in the prospectuses for securities we issue in the
future.

Our Profitability is Highly Dependent on the Prices of Crude
Oil, Natural Gas and Natural Gas Liquids, Which Have
Historically Been Very Volatile

Our estimated proved reserves, revenues, profitability,
operating cash flows and future rate of growth are highly
dependent on the prices of crude oil, natural gas and NGLs,
which are affected by numerous factors beyond our control.
Historically, these prices have been very volatile. A
significant downward trend in commodity prices would have a
material adverse effect on our revenues, profitability and cash
flow, and could result in a reduction in the carrying value of
our oil and gas properties and the amounts of our estimated
proved oil and gas reserves.

Our Commodity Hedging May Prevent Us From Benefiting Fully
From Price Increases and May Expose Us to Other Risks

To the extent that we engage in hedging activities to protect
ourselves from commodity price volatility, we may be prevented
from realizing the benefits of price increases above the levels
of the hedges.

Acquisitions or Discoveries of Additional Reserves are Needed
to Avoid a Material Decline in Reserves and Production

The rate of production from oil and gas properties generally
declines as reserves are depleted. Except to the extent that we
acquire additional properties containing estimated proved
reserves, conduct successful



exploration and development activities or, through engineering
studies, identify additional behind-pipe zones, secondary
recovery reserves or tertiary recovery reserves, our estimated
proved reserves will decline materially as reserves are
produced. Future oil and gas production is, therefore, highly
dependent upon our level of success in acquiring or finding
additional reserves.

Our Drilling Activities May Not Be Productive

Drilling for oil and gas involves numerous risks, including the
risk that we will not encounter commercially productive oil or
gas reservoirs. The costs of drilling, completing and operating
wells are often uncertain, and drilling operations may be
curtailed, delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of
factors including, but not limited to:

Certain future drilling activities may not be successful and, if
unsuccessful, this failure could have an adverse effect on our
future results of operations and financial condition. While all
drilling, whether developmental or exploratory, involves these
risks, exploratory drilling involves greater risks of dry holes
or failure to find commercial quantities of hydrocarbons.

Risks Arising From the Failure to Fully Identify Potential
Problems Related to Acquired Reserves or to Properly Estimate
Those Reserves

One of our primary growth strategies is the acquisition of oil
and gas properties. Although we perform a review of the acquired
properties that we believe is consistent with industry
practices, such reviews are inherently incomplete. It generally
is not feasible to review in depth every individual property
involved in each acquisition. Ordinarily, we will focus our
review efforts on the higher-value properties and will sample
the remainder. However, even a detailed review of records and
properties may not necessarily reveal existing or potential
problems, nor will it permit a buyer to become sufficiently
familiar with the properties to assess fully their deficiencies
and potential. Inspections may not always be performed on every
well, and environmental problems, such as ground water
contamination, are not necessarily observable even when an
inspection is undertaken. Even when problems are identified, we
often assume certain environmental and other risks and
liabilities in connection with acquired properties. There are
numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of
proved oil and gas reserves and actual future production rates
and associated costs with respect to acquired properties, and
actual results may vary substantially from those assumed in the
estimates. In addition, there can be no assurance that
acquisitions will not have an adverse effect upon our operating
results, particularly during the periods in which the operations
of acquired businesses are being integrated into our ongoing
operations.

We Are Subject to Domestic Governmental Risks That May Impact
Our Operations

Our domestic operations have been, and at times in the future
may be, affected by political developments and by federal, state
and local laws and regulations such as restrictions on
production, changes in taxes, royalties and other amounts
payable to governments or governmental agencies, price controls
and environmental protection laws and regulations.



Global Political and Economic Developments May Impact Our
Operations

Political and economic factors in international markets may have
a material adverse effect on our operations. On an
equivalent-barrel basis, approximately 62 percent of our
oil, NGLs and natural gas production in 2005 was outside the
United States, and approximately 58 percent of our
estimated proved oil and gas reserves on December 31, 2005
were located outside of the United States.

There are many risks associated with operations in international
markets, including changes in foreign governmental policies
relating to crude oil, NGLs, and natural gas pricing and
taxation, other political, economic or diplomatic developments,
changing political conditions and international monetary
fluctuations. These risks include: political and economic
instability or war; the possibility that a foreign government
may seize our property with or without compensation;
confiscatory taxation; legal proceedings and claims arising from
our foreign investments or operations; a foreign government
attempting to renegotiate or revoke existing contractual
arrangements, or failing to extend or renew such arrangements;
fluctuating currency values and currency controls; and
constrained natural gas markets dependent on demand in a single
or limited geographical area.

On December 23, 2004, Apache entered into a

20-year

insurance
contract with the Overseas Private Investment Corporation
(OPIC) which provides $300 million of political risk
insurance for the Company’s Egyptian operations. This
policy insures us against (1) non-payment by EGPC of
arbitral awards covering amounts owed Apache on past due
invoices and (2) expropriation of exportable petroleum when
actions taken by the Government of Egypt prevent Apache from
exporting our share of production. See Item 7,
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations, “Critical Accounting Policies
and Estimates, Allowance for Doubtful Accounts” in this
Form

10-K

for
additional discussion of our Egyptian receivables.

Actions of the United States government through tax and other
legislation, executive order and commercial restrictions can
adversely affect our operating profitability in the U.S. as
well as other countries. Various agencies of the United States
and other governments have, from time to time, imposed
restrictions which have limited our ability to gain attractive
opportunities or even operate in various countries. These
restrictions have in the past limited our foreign opportunities
and may continue to do so in the future.

Weather and Climate May Have a Significant Impact on Our
Revenues and Productivity

Demand for oil and natural gas are, to a significant degree,
dependent on weather and climate, which impacts the price we
receive for the commodities we produce. In addition, our
exploration and development activities and equipment can be
adversely affected by severe weather, such as hurricanes in the
Gulf of Mexico, which may cause a loss of production from
temporary cessation of activity or lost or damaged equipment.
While our planning for normal climatic variation, insurance
program, and emergency recovery plans mitigate the effects of
the weather, not all such effects can be predicted, eliminated
or insured against.

Costs Incurred Related to Environmental Matters

We, as an owner or lessee and operator of oil and gas
properties, are subject to various federal, provincial, state,
local and foreign country laws and regulations relating to
discharge of materials into, and protection of the environment.
These laws and regulations may, among other things, impose
liability on the lessee under an oil and gas lease for the cost
of pollution

clean-up

resulting from operations, subject the lessee to liability for
pollution damages, and require suspension or cessation of
operations in affected areas.

We have made and will continue to make expenditures in our
efforts to comply with these requirements, which we believe are
necessary business costs in the oil and gas industry. We have
established policies for continuing compliance with
environmental laws and regulations, including regulations
applicable to our operations in all countries in which we do
business. We also have established operational procedures and
training programs designed to minimize the environmental impact
of our field facilities. The costs incurred by these policies
and procedures are inextricably connected to normal operating
expenses such that we are unable



to separate the expenses related to environmental matters;
however, we do not believe any such additional expenses are
material to our financial position or results of operations.

Apache manages its exposure to environmental liabilities on
properties to be acquired by identifying existing problems and
assessing the potential liability. The Company also conducts
periodic reviews, on a company-wide basis, to identify changes
in its environmental risk profile. These reviews evaluate
whether there is a probable liability, its amount, and the
likelihood that the liability will be incurred. The amount of
any potential liability is determined by considering, among
other matters, incremental direct costs of any likely
remediation and the proportionate cost of our employees who are
expected to devote a significant amount of time to any possible
remediation effort. Our general policy is to limit any reserve
additions to incidents or sites that are considered probable to
result in an expected remediation cost exceeding $100,000. In
October 2003, Apache was issued a Findings of Violation and
Order for Compliance (an “Administrative Order”) by
the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which
cited certain paperwork administrative errors and effluent
violations reported by Apache during the period May 1, 1998
to June 30, 2003, as part of our offshore discharge permit
monitoring. Apache signed a Consent Agreement and Final Order
(CAFO) to pay a monetary penalty of $21,000 and undertake a
Supplemental Environmental Project (SEP) with an estimated
cost of $94,500. The SEP Project was completed and certified on
June 5, 2005, at which time we paid the amount of the
penalty.

We maintain insurance coverage, which we believe is customary in
the industry, although we are not fully insured against all
environmental risks. As described in Note 10, Commitments
and Contingencies of Item 15, in this
Form

10-K,

on
December 31, 2005, we had an accrued liability of
$11.8 million for environmental remediation. We have not
incurred any material environmental remediation costs in any of
the periods presented and we are not aware of any future
environmental remediation matters that would be material to our
financial position or results of operations.

Although environmental requirements have a substantial impact
upon the energy industry, generally these requirements do not
appear to affect us any differently, or to any greater or lesser
extent, than other upstream companies in the industry. We do not
believe that compliance with federal, provincial, state, local
or foreign country provisions regulating the discharge of
materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the
protection of the environment, will have a material adverse
effect upon the capital expenditures, earnings or competitive
position of Apache or its subsidiaries; however, there is no
assurance that changes in or additions to laws or regulations
regarding the protection of the environment will not have such
an impact.

Industry Competition

Strong competition exists in all sectors of the oil and gas
exploration and production industry. We compete with major
integrated and other independent oil and gas companies for
acquisition of oil and gas leases, properties and reserves,
equipment and labor required to explore, develop and operate
those properties and the marketing of oil and natural gas
production. Higher recent crude oil and natural gas prices have
increased the costs of properties available for acquisition and
there are a greater number of companies with the financial
resources to pursue acquisition opportunities. Many of our
competitors have financial and other resources substantially
larger than those we possess and have established strategic
long-term positions and maintain strong governmental
relationships in countries in which we may seek new entry. As a
consequence, we may be at a competitive disadvantage in bidding
for drilling rights. In addition, many of our larger competitors
may have a competitive advantage when responding to factors that
affect demand for oil and natural gas production, such as
changing worldwide prices and levels of production, the cost and
availability of alternative fuels and the application of
government regulations. We also compete in attracting and
retaining personnel, including geologists, geo-physicists,
engineers and other specialists.

Insurance Does Not Cover All Risks

Exploration for and production of oil and natural gas can be
hazardous, involving unforeseen occurrences such as blowouts,
cratering, fires and loss of well control, which can result in
damage to or destruction of wells or production facilities,
injury to persons, loss of life, or damage to property or the
environment. We maintain



insurance against certain losses or liabilities arising from our
operations in accordance with customary industry practices and
in amounts that management believes to be prudent; however,
insurance is not available to us against all operational risks.

In response to large underwriting losses caused by Hurricanes
Katrina and Rita, the insurance industry has reduced capacity
for windstorm damage and substantially increased premium rates.
As a result, there is no assurance that Apache will be able to
arrange insurance to cover fully its Gulf of Mexico exposures at
a reasonable cost when the current policies expire.

Investors In Our Securities May Encounter Difficulties in
Obtaining, Or May Be Unable To Obtain, Recoveries From Arthur
Andersen With Respect To Its Audits Of Our Financial
Statements

On March 14, 2002, our previous independent public
accountant, Arthur Andersen LLP (Arthur Andersen), was indicted
on federal obstruction of justice charges arising from the
federal government’s investigation of Enron Corp. On
June 15, 2002, a jury returned with a guilty verdict
against Arthur Andersen following a trial, though the conviction
was later overturned by the United States Supreme Court. As a
public company, we are required to file with the SEC periodic
financial statements audited or reviewed by an independent
public accountant. On March 29, 2002, we decided not to
engage Arthur Andersen as our independent auditors, and engaged
Ernst & Young LLP (Ernst & Young) to serve as
our new independent auditors for 2002. Ernst & Young
have served as our independent public accountants since that
time. However, included in this annual report on
Form

are
financial data and other information for 2001 that were audited
by Arthur Andersen. Investors in our securities may encounter
difficulties in obtaining, or be unable to obtain, from Arthur
Andersen with respect to its audits of our financial statements,
relief that may be available to investors under the federal
securities laws against auditing firms.

The closing price per share of our common stock, as reported on
the New York Stock Exchange Composite Transactions Reporting
System for February 28, 2006 , was $66.92. On
February 28, 2006, there were 330,307,585 shares of
our common stock outstanding held by approximately
7,500 shareholders of record and approximately 219,000
beneficial owners.

We have paid cash dividends on our common stock for 41
consecutive years through December 31, 2005. When, and if,
declared by our board of directors, future dividend payments
will depend upon our level of earnings, financial requirements
and other relevant factors.

In 1995, under our stockholder rights plan, each of our common
stockholders received a dividend of one “preferred stock
purchase right (a “right”)” for each 2.310
outstanding shares of common stock (adjusted for subsequent
stock dividends and a two-for-one stock split) that the
stockholder owned. These rights were originally scheduled to
expire on January 31, 2006. Effective as of that date, the
rights were reset to one right per share of common stock and the
expiration was extended to January 31, 2016. Unless the
rights have been previously redeemed, all shares of Apache
common stock are issued with rights and, the rights trade
automatically with our shares of common stock. For a description
of the rights, please refer to Note 8, Capital Stock of
Item 15 in this
Form

In 2002, our board of directors declared a five percent dividend
on our shares of common stock payable in common stock on
April 2, 2003 to shareholders of record on March 12,
2003. Pursuant to the terms of the declared five percent stock
dividend, we issued 15,736,496 shares (adjusted for the
2003 stock split) of our common stock on April 2, 2003 to
the holders of the 307,819,628 shares of common stock
outstanding on March 12, 2003. No fractional shares were
issued in connection with the stock dividend and we made cash
payments totaling approximately $1,437,000 in lieu of fractional
shares.

In 2003, in conjunction with the acquisition from BP, the
Company completed the public offering of 19.8 million
shares (adjusted for the stock split) of Apache common stock,
including 2.6 million shares (adjusted for the stock split)
for the underwriters’ over-allotment option, at
$29.05 per share. Net proceeds after placement fees totaled
approximately $554 million. The proceeds were used to repay
indebtedness under our commercial paper program and money market
lines of credit and to invest in short-term treasury-only money
market funds and treasury notes to hold funds for the
$1.3 billion acquisition from BP.

In 2003, our board of directors declared a two-for-one common
stock split which was distributed on January 14, 2004 to
holders of record on December 31, 2003. In connection with
the stock split, the Company issued 166,254,667 shares.

ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
    CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Overview

Apache Corporation is an independent energy company whose
principle business includes exploration, development and
production of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids.
The Company operates in five core countries which, collectively,
contained over 99 percent of the Company’s
2005 year-end estimated proved reserves and accounted for
over 98 percent of the Company’s 2005 oil and gas
production revenues. These principle operations are located in
the United States, Canada, Egypt, Australia and offshore the
United Kingdom in the North Sea. The Company’s smaller
non-core operations in 2005 were conducted offshore China and in
Argentina.

Apache adheres to a portfolio approach to provide diversity in
terms of hydrocarbon mix (crude oil and natural gas), reserve
life, geologic risk and geographic location. Our growth strategy
focuses on economic growth through drilling, acquisitions, or a
combination of both, depending on, among other things, cost
levels and availability of acquisition opportunities. As we
pursue growth, we continually monitor the capital resources
available to us to meet our future financial obligations and
liquidity needs. These obligations and needs are met with cash
on hand, cash generated from our operations, unused committed
borrowing capacity under our global credit facility, and the
capital markets. The interest cost of debt and access to the
equity markets are greatly influenced by the Company’s
ability to maintain both a strong balance sheet and generate
ongoing



operating cash flow. For these reasons, we strive to maintain a
manageable debt load that is properly balanced with equity and
our single-A credit ratings. We are also cognizant of the costs
to add reserves through drilling and acquisitions as well as the
costs necessary to produce such reserves. Consequently, we
closely monitor trends in drilling costs by operating area and
the price at which properties are available for purchase, so
that we may adjust our budgets accordingly and allocate funds to
projects based on potential rate of return. We review operating
costs monthly by operating area, on both an absolute dollar and
per unit of production basis. We then compare these results to
our historical norms factoring in the impact of property
acquisitions and changes in industry conditions in order to
actively manage individual cost elements as appropriate. Given
the inherent volatility and unpredictability of commodity prices
and changing industry conditions, we frequently revise our
forecasts and adjust our budgets accordingly.

Throughout 2005, commodity prices were very strong as the
precarious supply and demand balance for crude oil and natural
gas was impacted by geopolitical factors and U.S. weather
events. Apache’s 2005 consolidated average realized crude
oil price of $51.66 was 47 percent higher than 2004, while
the Company’s average realized natural gas price increased
29 percent to $6.35 per Mcf. Crude oil prices were up
worldwide, while natural gas price gains were mainly
concentrated in North America. The Company’s daily
production averaged 454,495 barrels of oil equivalent
(boe) per day, up one percent from 2004, as gains were
limited by the impact of U.S. hurricanes (discussed below).
These historically high commodity prices and solid production
drove the Company’s attainment of several operational and
financial milestones.

2005 Financial and operating results include:



•

On September 15, 2005, the Company’s Board of
    Directors voted to increase Apache’s quarterly cash
    dividend to 10 cents per share, effective with the November 2005
    payment.

Impact of 2005 Hurricanes

During the third quarter of 2005, four hurricanes struck the
Gulf of Mexico that impacted the Company’s U.S. gulf
coast operations, both onshore and offshore Louisiana and Texas.
During each of these hurricanes, personnel were evacuated and
production was shut-in. Two of these storms, Hurricanes Dennis
and Emily, required only temporary curtailment of production and
caused minor damage to the Company’s production platforms.
The other two storms, Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, caused
extensive damage to both onshore and offshore production and
transportation facilities. In addition to Apache’s property
damage, third-party pipelines, terminals and processing
facilities, which the Company relies upon to transport and
process the crude oil and natural gas it produces, were damaged.
Restoration of full production is dependent on numerous factors,
many of which are beyond the Company’s control. The impact
on operations and results follows:

Production

— The hurricanes reduced
Apache’s 2005 average annual daily production of natural
gas by 59 MMcf/d and of crude oil by 10,813 b/d. The bulk
of the shut-in production was associated with Hurricanes Katrina
and Rita, which struck in late August and late September 2005,
respectively. As of December 31, 2005, approximately
59 MMcf/d of net natural gas production and 20 Mbbls/d
of net crude oil production per day remained shut-in. While we
have seen tremendous progress in restoring production, a portion
of the production may remain shut-in for up to a year.

Financial Results

— The impact on the
Company’s 2005 financial results included a
$397 million reduction of crude oil and natural gas
revenues, approximately $30 million of additional lease
operating expenses (LOE) and $30 million of additional
capitalized costs. The additional LOE and capitalized costs
include insurance deductibles, additional premiums assessed by
Oil Insurance Limited (OIL) and an accrual for an insurance
contingency assessed by OIL should Apache elect to withdraw from
the insurance pool. The shut-in production also resulted in
$57 million less depletion expense. As indicated below, the
Company accrued approximately $79 million of business
interruption insurance claims during the fourth quarter of 2005
in “Other” under “Revenues and Other” of the
Statement of Consolidated Operations.

Assessment of Damage

— Nine operated production
platforms were lost and two were severely damaged during the
storms. Production platforms lost or severely damaged during
Hurricane Katrina were: Main Pass 312-JA; South Timbalier 161-A;
161-B; 161-D; South Pass (SP) 62-A; SP 62-B; West Delta
(WD) 103-A; WD 103-B; WD104-C; and

WD133-B.

The production
platform lost during Hurricane Rita was Ship Shoal 193-B.
Additionally, 12 non-operated structures were destroyed or
severely damaged: 10 Grand Isle 43 platforms; one South Marsh
Island 108 platform; and one Eugene Island 330 platform. Prior
to the hurricanes, aggregate production from the lost and
damaged platforms was approximately 10 Mbbls of oil per day
and 21 MMcf of gas per day. All of these platforms are
expected to be abandoned over the next three years and the
Company has recorded a present value obligation of approximately
$492 million to reflect the estimated abandonment costs to
be incurred (See Note 4, Asset Retirement Obligation of
Item 15 in this
Form

10-K).

The
adjustment for abandonment obligations is recorded in our
property balance and will be reflected in income as additional
depletion expense over time. The impact on fourth quarter 2005
depletion expense was approximately $7 million. A portion
of the obligation will be recovered through insurance proceeds.

Numerous other operated offshore production platforms and
onshore facilities sustained damage as a result of the storms.
While not as severe as the above mentioned platforms, much of
the repairs require replacing grating, handrails, and lost
equipment. In addition, minor structural repairs will also be
required. The Company estimates that approximately
$230 million will be incurred to repair these platforms and
facilities and expects nearly all of these repairs to be
completed during 2006. Although the $230 million estimate
may change, the Company expects to recover the majority of these
costs through insurance proceeds.

Insurance Coverage

— The Company carries
property damage insurance of $250 million per event subject
to a $7.5 million deductible per event, and another
$100 million in aggregate for the policy year. The
$250 million per event in coverage is provided through OIL,
while the $100 million is provided under a separate
commercial policy. The OIL policy is prorated down if total
claims received by the insurer for a single



event exceed $1 billion. As of December 31, 2005, the
Company was advised by OIL that total claims for Hurricane
Katrina would exceed the $1 billion limit, reducing the
Company’s ultimate recoveries by approximately
50 percent, or $125 million. The Company was also
advised that as of December 31, 2005, total estimated
claims for Hurricane Rita would exceed the $1 billion
limit, reducing the Company’s claims for Rita by
approximately 20 percent. Based on current assessments by
OIL, the Company expects to recover from OIL between
$225 million and $250 million for both storms
combined. The Company further expects to recover the full
$100 million on the commercial policy.

The Company also carries business interruption insurance
coverage through its commercial policy to cover deferred and
lost oil and natural gas production revenues. The business
interruption insurance began 60 days after occurrence of
each event subject to a daily limit of $750,000 per event
and an aggregate limit of $150 million. Coverage is based
on current market prices and began October 28, 2005 for
shut-in production caused by Hurricane Katrina and
November 22, 2005 for Hurricane Rita. The Company accrued
claims in 2005 totaling $79 million, with the remainder of
the aggregate $150 million limit available for 2006.
Proceeds received from the Business Interruption Insurance are
reflected in “Other” under “Revenues and
Other” on the Statement of Consolidated Operations and are
included in cash flows from operating activities.

In response to large underwriting losses caused by Hurricanes
Katrina and Rita, the insurance industry has reduced capacity
for windstorm damage in the Gulf of Mexico and substantially
increased premium rates. As a result, there is no assurance that
Apache will be able to arrange adequate insurance to cover its
Gulf of Mexico exposures at a reasonable cost when the current
policies expire.

Exploration and Development Activity

The Company spent $3.8 billion on capital expenditures in
2005, 52 percent, or $1.3 billion more than in 2004.
Expenditures for 2005 exploration and production activity
accounted for 90 percent, or $3.4 billion, of capital
spending, a $1.0 billion increase over 2004. The balance of
2005 capital spending, which totaled $393 million, up
$254 million, was for oil and gas processing facilities and
pipelines in Canada, Egypt and Australia. The Company spent
$39 million on acquisitions in 2005 compared to
$1.1 billion in 2004, as 2005 market conditions provided a
limited number of attractive acquisition opportunities. However,
in early 2006, we closed an acquisition announced in late 2005.
Also, on January 17, 2006, the Company announced an
agreement to purchase the Argentine operations of Pioneer
Natural Resources (Pioneer) for $675 million. Please refer
to the Subsequent Acquisitions and Divestiture section of this
Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Acquisition
expenditures typically vary year to year based on the
availability of opportunities that fit Apache’s overall
strategy. Significant highlights in each of our core areas
follow:

U.S.

•

The Company spent $1.1 billion to drill 478 wells,
    adding 91.9 MMBoe of reserves through extension and
    development activity. The Company had one of the five most
    active drilling programs in the Gulf of Mexico and Western
    Oklahoma, and one of the top 10 drilling programs in West Texas.
    In the Gulf Coast region, we drilled 66 Gulf of Mexico wells and
    48 onshore wells with a 77 percent success rate. In the
    Central region, we drilled 364 wells with a 97 percent
    success rate. The U.S. accounted for 38 percent of our
    2005 equivalent production and 42 percent of the
    Company’s estimated proved reserves at year-end 2005, down
    from 41 percent and 44 percent in 2004, respectively.

•

On January 5, 2006, the Company completed its purchase of
    Amerada Hess’s interest in eight fields located in the
    Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico for
    $269 million. Apache estimates that these fields had proved
    reserves of 27 million barrels of liquid hydrocarbons and
    27 billion cubic feet of natural gas at year-end 2005. For
    additional details regarding this transaction refer to the
    Subsequent Acquisitions and Divestiture section of this
    Item 7.



Canada

Egypt



•

On January 6, 2006, the Company completed the sale of its
    55 percent interest in the deepwater section of
    Egypt’s West Mediterranean Concession to Amerada Hess for
    $413 million. The gas sales agreement (the Memorandum of
    Understanding for which was previously announced on
    December 16, 2003) for the interests was assigned to
    Amerada Hess as a part of that sale. Apache first announced this
    transaction on October 13, 2005. For additional details
    regarding this transaction refer to the Subsequent Acquisitions
    and Divestiture section of this Item 7.

Australia

North Sea

•

The Company spent $489 million in the North Sea, including
    $198 million on facility upgrades to improve the operating
    efficiency of the platforms. We drilled 23 exploration and
    development wells during 2005 with a 65 percent success
    rate, adding 45.2 MMBoe of reserves. The North Sea
    accounted for 14 percent of our 2005 equivalent production
    and 9 percent of the Company’s estimated proved
    reserves at year-end 2005 compared to 12 percent and
    9 percent in 2004, respectively.

•

The Company acquired 22 North Sea blocks in the 2005 UK
    license bid round. Also, during 2005, Apache acquired interests
    in six additional North Sea blocks, one via a small
    acquisition and five earned through farm-ins on four prospects.
    We had oil discoveries in three of the four farm-in prospects.
    In 2004, Apache acquired 14 new blocks in the UK license
    bid round. At the end of 2005, Apache held interests in
    45 North Sea blocks.

•

During 2005, Apache shot three new 3D seismic surveys in
    the North Sea, and together with the purchase and reprocessing
    of various 3D data sets, currently have 3-D seismic
    coverage on 27 blocks of the total 45 Apache North Sea
    held blocks.



Other

Our year-end 2005 estimated reserves remained relatively
balanced with a 46 percent oil and 54 percent natural
gas mix. This compares to 48 percent oil and
52 percent natural gas at the end of 2004. Estimated proved
undeveloped reserves represented 30.4 percent of total
year-end 2005 estimated proved reserves compared to
32.7 percent at year-end 2004.

Apache was challenged in 2005 by steadily increasing service
costs resulting from increased demand with high commodity prices
and the major Gulf of Mexico hurricanes. The increases were
reflected in nearly all of our drilling and lease operating
costs, including; rig rates, drill pipe costs, chemical costs
and the costs of power and fuel. The Company reviews these costs
for each core area on a routine basis and pursues alternatives
in maintaining efficient levels of costs and expenses. While we
are encouraged by the current financial outlook for 2006, we
will continue to monitor costs, and depending on drilling costs
relative to market prices, we may act to reduce our drilling
expenditures as we did in 2001. This is particularly relevant in
the U.S. where reserve targets generally continue to
decrease in size. Acquisition costs also increased generally in
2005, and for that reason we were not very active during the
year, completing $39 million of acquisitions. However, in
early 2006, we closed an acquisition announced in late 2005.
Also, on January 17, 2006, the Company announced an
agreement with Pioneer Natural Resources (see Subsequent
Acquisitions and Divestiture section in this Item 7). We
believe we are well positioned to pursue future acquisitions
should the appropriate opportunities arise. The Company also
experienced unfavorable foreign exchange rate movements in
Canada in 2005 which impacted our lease operating and drilling
costs. We did see some favorable exchange rate movements in
Australia and the U.K., although the favorable impact on our
lease operating and drilling costs were much less than the
unfavorable impact in Canada. Refer to the “Costs”
section of this Item 7, Management Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, for further
discussion of items impacting costs in 2005.

In May 2005, the Company’s stockholders approved a new
targeted stock plan that provides incentives for employees to
double Apache’s share price to $108 by the end of 2008,
with an interim goal of $81 to be achieved by the end of 2007.
To achieve the trigger price, the Company’s stock price
must close at or above the stated threshold for 10 days out
of any 30 consecutive trading days by the end of the stated
period. Under the plan, if the first threshold is achieved,
approximately 1.3 million shares would be awarded for an
intrinsic cost of $106 million. Achieving the second
threshold would result in approximately 2.0 million shares
awarded for an intrinsic cost of $213 million.

In July 2004, the Company signed an amendment agreement with the
EGPC which, among other things, extended the term of the Khalda,
Khalda West and Salam development leases through 2024. These
development leases would have expired in 2011, 2012 and 2010,
respectively. Apache also received a five-year extension on the
Khalda Offset exploration acreage with an option for an
additional three-year extension. As part of this agreement and
in conjunction with the Qasr

25-year

Gas Sales
Agreement signed in April 2004, we agreed to re-price natural
gas volumes in excess of 100 MMcf/d produced from the
Khalda Concession development leases and future Khalda Offset
development leases. Under the new pricing formula, Apache
receives a price indexed to crude oil with a minimum of
$1.50 per MMBtu and a maximum of $2.65 per MMBtu.
Pricing for the first 100 MMcf/d remains subject to the
original contract price (which is indexed to oil pricing, but
without a minimum or maximum) until January 1, 2013, at
which time all Khalda area gas will be priced under the new
pricing formula. For 2005 and 2004, Apache’s prices, which
were a blend of the old and new contracts, averaged
$4.59 per Mcf and $4.35 per Mcf, respectively.

Results of Operations

This section includes a discussion of our 2005 and 2004 results
of operations and provides insight into unique events and
circumstances for each of the Company’s six reportable
segments. Apache’s geographic segments include the United
States, Canada, Egypt, Australia, the North Sea and Other
International. These segments are primarily in the business of
crude oil and natural gas exploration and production. Please

Acquisitions and Divestitures

Subsequent Acquisitions and Divestiture

Amerada Hess

On January 5, 2006, the Company completed its purchase of
Amerada Hess’s interest in eight fields located in the
Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico for
$269 million. Apache estimates that these fields had proved
reserves of 27 million barrels of liquid hydrocarbons and
27 billion cubic feet of natural gas as of year-end 2005.
The Company had previously announced on October 13, 2005
that it had agreed to purchase Amerada Hess’s interest for
$404 million. The price and number of properties involved
in this transaction were reduced as a result of third parties
exercising their preferential rights.

On January 6, 2006, the Company completed the sale of its
55 percent interest in the deepwater section of
Egypt’s West Mediterranean Concession to Amerada Hess for
$413 million. Apache did not have any oil and gas reserves
recorded for these properties. Apache first announced this
transaction on October 13, 2005.

Pioneer Natural Resources

On January 17, 2006, we announced plans to increase greatly
our holdings in Argentina by agreeing to buy Pioneer’s
Argentina operations. The transaction includes interest in 36
separate blocks on approximately 1.8 million gross acres
located in the Neuquen, Austral and San Jorge Basins. On
January 1, 2006, the properties were producing
approximately 9,000 barrels of liquids and 120 MMcf of
natural gas per day. The Pioneer transaction is expected to
close in late March 2006.

2005 Acquisitions

During 2005, Apache completed acquisitions for $39 million,
adding approximately 7.8 MMboe to the Company’s proved
reserves.

On May 5, 2005, Apache signed a farm-in agreement with
Exxon Mobil Corporation (ExxonMobil) covering approximately
650,000 acres of undeveloped properties in the Western
Canadian province of Alberta. Under the agreement, Apache is to
drill and operate 145 new wells over a

36-month

period with
upside potential for further drilling. ExxonMobil will retain a
37.5 percent royalty on fee lands and 35 percent of
its working interest on leasehold acreage. The agreement also
allows Apache to test additional horizons on approximately
140,000 acres of property covered in the 2004 farm-in
agreement with ExxonMobil.

2004 Acquisitions

ExxonMobil

During the third quarter of 2004, Apache entered into separate
arrangements with ExxonMobil that provided for property
transfers and joint operating and exploration activity across a
broad range of prospective and mature properties in
(1) Western Canada, (2) West Texas and New Mexico, and
(3) onshore Louisiana and on the Gulf of Mexico-Outer
Continental Shelf. Apache’s participation included cash
payments of approximately $347 million, subject to normal
post closing adjustments. The following summarizes these
transactions:

ExxonMobil — Western Canada

In
August 2004, Apache signed a farm-in agreement with ExxonMobil
covering approximately 380,000 gross acres of undeveloped
properties in the Western Canadian Province of Alberta. Under
the agreement, Apache has the right to earn acreage sections by
drilling an initial well on each such section. By drilling at
least 250 wells during the initial two-year earning period
under the agreement, Apache will receive a one-year extension in
which to earn additional sections. As to any sections earned by
Apache, ExxonMobil will retain a 37.5 percent royalty on
fee lands and 35 percent of its working interest on
leasehold acreage. Under certain circumstances, ExxonMobil has
the right to convert its retained 35 percent working
interest into a 12.5 percent overriding royalty. In
addition, during the terms of this agreement, Apache is required
to carry ExxonMobil’s retained working interest with
respect to certain drilling, capping, completion, equipping and
tie-in costs associated with wells drilled on leasehold acreage.



ExxonMobil — West Texas and New
Mexico

In September 2004, Apache acquired
interests from ExxonMobil in 23 mature producing oil and gas
fields in West Texas and New Mexico for $318 million.
Apache separately contributed approximately $29 million
into a partnership to obtain additional interests in the
properties. ExxonMobil will retain interests in the properties
through the partnership, including the right to receive, on
certain fields, 60 percent of the oil proceeds above
$30 per barrel in 2004, $29 per barrel in 2005 and
$28 per barrel during the period from 2006 thru 2009.

ExxonMobil — Louisiana and Gulf of Mexico-Outer
Continental Shelf

Also in September 2004, Apache
and ExxonMobil entered into joint exploration agreements to
explore Apache’s acreage in South Louisiana and the Gulf of
Mexico-Outer Continental Shelf. The agreements provide for an
initial term of five years, with the potential for an additional
five years based on expenditures by ExxonMobil. Pursuant to the
agreement covering South Louisiana, Apache leased
50 percent of its interests below certain producing or
productive formations in the acreage to ExxonMobil, subject to
retention of a 20 percent royalty interest. Pursuant to the
agreement covering the Gulf of Mexico-Outer Continental Shelf,
no assignments will be made until a prospect has been proposed
and the initial well has been drilled. Apache will retain all
rights in each prospect above certain producing or productive
formations and further will retain a three percent overriding
royalty interest in any property assigned to ExxonMobil. See
Note 2, Acquisitions and Divestitures of Item 15 in
this Form

10-K

for
a complete discussion of those transactions.

Anadarko

On August 20, 2004, Apache signed a definitive agreement to
acquire all of Anadarko’s Gulf of Mexico-Outer Continental
Shelf properties (excluding certain deepwater properties) for
$537 million, subject to normal post-closing adjustments,
including preferential rights. The transaction was effective as
of October 1, 2004, and included interests in 74 fields
covering 232 offshore blocks (approximately 664,000 acres)
and 104 platforms. Eighty-nine of the blocks were undeveloped at
the time of the acquisition. Apache operates 49 of the fields
comprising approximately 70 percent of the production.

Prior to Apache’s purchase from Anadarko, Morgan Stanley
paid Anadarko $646 million to acquire an overriding royalty
interest in these properties. Anadarko’s sale of an
overriding royalty interest to Morgan Stanley is commonly known
in the industry as a volumetric production payment (VPP), the
obligations of which Apache assumed along with its subsequent
purchase. Under the terms of the VPP, Morgan Stanley is to
receive a fixed volume of oil and natural gas production
(20 MMboe) over four years beginning in October 2004. The
VPP represents a non-operating interest in the properties that
is free of all costs of operations and production. Morgan
Stanley is entitled to first production and may receive up to
90 percent of the production from the assets encumbered by
the VPP in any given month to satisfy these deliverables.
However, Morgan Stanley has no right to look to other assets or
production of Apache. The VPP is scheduled to terminate on
August 31, 2008, but may be extended if all scheduled VPP
volumes have not been delivered to Morgan Stanley and the
properties are still producing. The VPP includes restrictions on
the Company’s ability to sell the properties subject to the
VPP or resign as operator of VPP properties it currently
operates. Upon termination of the VPP, all rights, titles and
interests revert back to Apache. Apache does not record the
reserves and production volumes attributable to the VPP.

The strategic rationale for Apache buying these assets burdened
by a volumetric production payment is several fold. First,
because Morgan Stanley gets their production first and Apache
receives the remainder, Morgan Stanley is paying substantially
more per boe, thereby significantly reducing Apache’s cost
per unit. Second, although Morgan Stanley’s priority call
on production leaves Apache with more risk, in exchange we
retain all the upside associated with finding more reserves on
the acquired properties than anticipated at the time of the
acquisition. This is a risk/reward scenario with which we are
comfortable and that plays to our long history of adding value
to numerous acquired properties through proactive operations.
Third, our experience is that invariably we earn higher rates of
return from drilling and related activities than we do from
acquisitions, yet acquisitions bring an inventory of drilling
and exploitation opportunities. Because Morgan Stanley paid
Anadarko more than Apache for proved reserves, a higher
percentage of Apache’s investment will be concentrated in
the higher risk, but generally higher reward, future drilling
activity. As a final note, Morgan Stanley, while having less
risk, is not risk free. In the event that the properties
purchased by Apache are



insufficient to deliver the volumes sold to Morgan Stanley,
there is no recourse to any properties other than those acquired
from Anadarko. See the Capital Resources and Liquidity section
of this Item 7 for further discussion of VPPs.

The $537 million purchase price agreed to in the definitive
agreement was subsequently adjusted for the exercise of
preferential rights by third parties and other normal
post-closing adjustments. After adjusting for these items,
Apache paid $532 million for the properties and recorded
estimated proved reserves of 60 MMboe, of which
50 percent is natural gas. In addition, an $84 million
liability for the future cost to produce and deliver the VPP
volumes was recorded by the Company. This liability will be
settled through a reduction of lease operating expense as the
volumes are produced and delivered to Morgan Stanley. Apache
also recorded abandonment obligations for the properties of
approximately $134 million and other obligations assumed
from Anadarko in the amount of $27 million. Apache
allocated $122 million of the purchase price to unproved
property. The purchase price was funded by borrowings under the
Company’s commercial paper program.

We routinely evaluate our property portfolio and divest those
that are marginal or no longer fit into our strategic growth
program. We divested $80 million, $4 million and
$59 million of properties during 2005, 2004 and 2003,
respectively.

Revenues

Our revenues are sensitive to changes in prices received for our
products. A substantial portion of our production is sold at
prevailing market prices which fluctuate in response to many
factors that are outside of our control. Given the current
tightly balanced supply-demand market, small variations in
either supply or demand, or both, can have dramatic effects on
prices we receive for our oil and natural gas production.
Political instability and availability of alternative fuels
could impact worldwide supply, while other economic factors
could impact demand.

Oil and Natural Gas Prices

While the market price received for crude oil and natural gas
varies among geographic areas, crude oil trades in a world-wide
market, whereas natural gas, which has a limited global
transportation system, is subject to local supply and demand
conditions. Consequently, price movements for all types and
grades of crude oil generally move in the same direction, while
natural gas price movements generally follow local market
conditions. However, throughout 2005, the price differentials
related to crude oil qualities were volatile, and the prices we
received for our North American sour crude oil compared to the
NYMEX Domestic Sweet index widened beyond historical averages.
This price differential was exacerbated by Hurricanes Katrina
and Rita which caused extensive damage to the refining complex
along the U.S. Gulf Coast. These quality differentials,
which impacted approximately one-third of our
U.S. production, occurred largely because OPEC produced
more sour crude to satisfy rising world demand, while
U.S. sour crude refining capacity was hindered by the
damage caused by the hurricanes. This excess in sour crude
supply over the refining capacity created competition among
producers driving a deeper discount for sour crude. During the
fourth quarter of 2005, the sweet to sour crude oil quality
differential averaged $6.50 per barrel.

Apache primarily sells its natural gas into three markets:

1)

North America, which has a common market and where supply and
    demand are currently tightly balanced, creating a volatile
    pricing environment;

2)

Australia, which has a local market with limited demand relative
    to available supply and long-term fixed price contracts; and

3)

Egypt, which has a local market where the price received for our
    production is indexed to a weighted-average Dated-Brent crude
    oil price, a portion of which is subject to a minimum of
    $1.50 per MMBtu and a maximum of $2.65 per MMBtu.



The current outlook for 2006 indicates that the sour crude
quality differentials, while narrowing somewhat, will remain
above historical averages.

Revenues

The table below presents oil and gas production revenues,
production and average prices received from sales of natural
gas, oil and natural gas liquids.



Contributions to Oil and Natural Gas Revenues

As with production and reserves, a consequence of geographic
diversification is a shifting geographic mix of our oil revenues
and natural gas revenues. For the reasons discussed in the Oil
and Natural Gas Prices section above, contributions to oil
revenues and gas revenues should be viewed separately.

The following table presents each segment’s oil revenues
and gas revenues as a percentage of total oil revenues and gas
revenues, respectively.

Crude Oil Contribution

In 2005, oil revenue contributions from outside the
U.S. rose six percent to 74 percent
($3.3 billion) of our total 2005 consolidated oil revenues.
Production growth and significantly higher price realizations
drove the North Sea’s oil revenue contributions to
29 percent of consolidated oil revenues and were largely
responsible for the growth of

non-U.S.

oil
revenues. In 2004, the North Sea’s contribution totaled
16 percent. U.S. oil revenues, which have historically
been the predominate contributor, made up 26 percent of
2005 oil revenues, partly a consequence of the
U.S. hurricanes (including Hurricane Ivan whose effects
were felt in 2005) which reduced 2005 oil revenues
$221 million. Australia’s contribution to 2005
consolidated oil revenues fell to seven percent from
13 percent on a 39 percent decrease in production
compared to 2004.

In 2004, oil revenues from areas outside the U.S. rose
slightly to 68 percent of consolidated oil revenues, up
from 67 percent in 2003. Lack of production growth reduced
the U.S. overall contribution one percent to
32 percent of consolidated oil revenues. Canada’s
contribution also declined one percent to 12 percent on
lower relative production growth. Egypt’s share rose one
percent to 24 percent as it saw both price gains and
production growth. The North Sea’s contribution increased
three percent on both an increase in average daily production
and a full year of revenues versus nine months in 2003.
Australia’s contribution fell three percent on lower
production.



Crude Oil Revenues

Crude oil revenues increased $1.4 billion, or
48 percent to $4.4 billion, in 2005 from 2004 on a
$16.42 per barrel increase in average realized oil price
and a one percent increase in production. All segments saw a
significant increase in realized crude oil price, with the North
Sea and Egypt also benefiting from production growth compared to
2004.

The North Sea’s 2005 crude oil revenues were
$798 million higher than 2004, reflecting significantly
higher price realizations and a 24 percent increase in
production. The higher price realizations generated additional
revenues of $557 million when compared to 2004, while the
higher production added $242 million. Oil price
realizations in 2004 were impacted by a lower fixed-price
physical contract that expired in December 2004. The production
growth reflects the benefits of the North Sea’s active
drilling, workover and repair programs.

U.S. crude oil revenues for 2005 increased
$198 million compared to 2004. This increase was the result
of a 24 percent increase in crude oil price, as production
decreased two percent. The 2005 U.S. average realized price
includes a $2.39 per barrel hedge loss. (See Note 3,
Hedging and Derivative Instruments, of this
Form

10-K.)

A full
year of production from the ExxonMobil and Anadarko properties,
which were acquired in the second half of 2004, and successful
drilling and re-completion efforts partially offset natural
production declines and approximately 11 Mbbls per day of
downtime resulting from hurricanes.

Egypt contributed additional revenues of $367 million in
2005 compared to 2004. This increase in revenue was primarily
attributable to a 44 percent increase in crude oil price. A
six percent increase in production generated an additional
$55 million of revenues. The production increase was
related to drilling and recompletion activity on Egypt’s
Western Mediterranean Concession, particularly completion of the

Tanzanite-2

well
and recompletion of the

Tanzanite-1

well.

Canada’s 2005 revenues increased $79 million over 2004
on a 38 percent increase in price, which more than offset
the impact of an 11 percent, or 2,806 b/d, decline in oil
production. Canada’s production was impacted by natural
decline in the Zama, Midale, Virginia Hills and Consort operated
areas, as well as natural decline on non-operated Karr Simonette
and Nevis areas.

China’s 2005 revenues were $40 million higher than
2004 on a 35 percent increase in crude oil price and a
seven percent increase in net volumes. The higher realized price
and volumes generated an additional $31 million and
$9 million of revenues, respectively. China’s 2005
production outpaced 2004 primarily because production was
ramping up during the first half of 2004.

Australia’s 2005 crude oil revenues were $63 million
less than 2004. This decrease reflects a 39 percent decline
in production resulting from natural decline, particularly in
the Legendre field, and loss of liquids from East Spar, which
ceased production early in 2005. These declines were partially
offset by a 37 percent increase in realized price and a
full year of production from the Mohave and Artreus fields,
which commenced production during the third quarter of 2005.

Apache manages a small portion of its exposure to fluctuations
in crude oil prices using financial derivatives. Approximately
six percent of our worldwide crude oil production was subject to
financial derivative hedging for 2005 compared to four percent
in 2004. (See Note 3, Hedging and Derivative Instruments,
of this Form

10-K

for a summary of the current derivative positions and terms.)
These financial derivative instruments reduced our 2005 and 2004
worldwide realized prices $.68 and $.21 per barrel,
respectively.

Natural Gas Contribution

Our North America operations contributed 88 percent of 2005
consolidated natural gas revenues, up one percent from 2004. The
U.S. contributed 54 percent of 2005 consolidated
natural gas revenues, a four percent decline from 2004, a
consequence of the U.S. hurricanes (which reduced
U.S. natural gas revenues approximately $229 million).
Canada’s natural gas revenue contribution increased to
34 percent, reflecting both a 14 percent production
growth and a slightly higher relative increase in realized
price. While Egypt’s gas



production increased 20 percent, its contribution to 2005
gas revenues decreased slightly to nine percent as they only had
marginal price improvement, a result of the new pricing formula
enacted in 2004. Australia’s contribution to our total gas
revenues was unchanged at three percent.

In 2004, 87 percent of Apache’s natural gas revenues
came from North America of which 58 percent was from the
U.S. and 29 percent was from Canada. The
U.S. contribution decreased four percent from 2003,
primarily because of production declines, the impact Hurricane
Ivan had on U.S. Gulf of Mexico revenues, and the
additional revenues generated by Canada and Egypt. Our
U.S. Gulf Coast region, which contributed 69 percent
of Apache’s U.S. 2004 production, down two percent
from 2003, is characterized by reservoirs which demonstrate high
initial production rates followed by steep declines when
compared to most other U.S. producing areas. Canada’s
contribution was up two percent from 2003 resulting from three
percent production growth and higher price gains relative to
other areas. Egypt’s contribution to total gas revenues
increased to 10 percent from eight percent in 2003, on
21 percent production growth. Australia’s contribution
to 2004 natural gas revenues remained the same as 2003 at three
percent.

Natural Gas Revenues

Our 2005 natural gas revenues increased $711 million from
the prior-year on a 29 percent increase in realized natural
gas price and a two percent increase in production. The higher
prices generated an additional $652 million in gas
revenues, while the production increase added another
$59 million to 2005 revenues, relative to the prior year.
While all of our reportable segments realized increased natural
gas prices, the increases in the U.S. and Canada had the most
significant impact on 2005 revenues, given their price advantage
and the magnitude of their volumes, relative to the other
countries. Canada, Egypt and Australia also contributed
increased gas revenues from higher production, while the
additional price-driven revenues generated in the U.S. were
partially offset by an eight percent decline in production.

2005 U.S. natural gas revenues were $286 million
higher than 2004. U.S. natural gas prices, which were up
32 percent, contributed $420 million of additional
revenues, while an eight percent production decline lowered
revenues $134 million when compared to 2004. While
U.S. production was down year-over-year because of the
hurricanes in our Gulf Coast region, an 11 percent gain in
the Central region offset some of the hurricane impact. The
Central region was up on active drilling and recompletion
programs and acquisitions.

Canada’s 2005 natural gas revenues increased
$356 million from 2004. Two-thirds of the increase related
to a 38 percent increase in price, with the balance
generated by a 14 percent increase in production.
Production increased 45 MMcf/d, a result of successful
drilling efforts at the Nevis, Zama, Hatton and Consort areas
and the ExxonMobil acreage, which more than offset natural
declines in the Ladyfern and other Northeast British Columbia
areas.

Egypt contributed an additional $58 million to 2005
consolidated natural gas revenues compared to 2004. This
increase is attributable to a six percent price improvement and
a 20 percent increase in production. The year-over-year
production growth came from development of the Khalda Concession
Imhoptep and Atoun wells, development of the Qasr field, and
first sales from the Northeast Abu Gharadig concession, which
commenced in January 2005.

Australia’s 2005 natural gas revenues were $6 million
higher than 2004. While Australia’s natural gas production
and price were each up four percent over 2004, the impact on
revenues was minimal given the relatively low natural gas price.
The additional production was attributable to the Rose, John
Brookes and Bambra fields.

Our 2004 natural gas revenues increased $171 million with a
$.30 per Mcf increase in our average natural gas price
realizations generating an additional $133 million of
revenues. Higher production added the remaining
$38 million. While all of our operating segments reported
an increase in natural gas price realizations, most of the
additional revenues attributable to price came from the U.S. and
Canada. The additional revenues attributable to production were
primarily generated in Egypt, where natural gas production
increased 21 percent, reflecting the success of our
drilling program. Canada and Australia also contributed to the
increase in production revenues with production growth of three
percent and six percent, respectively.



Canada’s increase is from new wells while Australia’s
increase was driven by higher customer demand and new
contractual sales. Partially offsetting these additional
production revenues was a three percent decrease in
U.S. production. The lower U.S. production was focused
in the Gulf Coast region and is related to the impact of
Hurricane Ivan and natural decline in mature fields.

Apache uses a variety of strategies to manage its exposure to
fluctuations in natural gas prices, including fixed-price
physical contracts and derivatives. The majority of our
worldwide gas sales contracts are indexed to prevailing market
prices; however, during 2005 and 2004, approximately ten percent
and nine percent of our U.S. natural gas production,
respectively, was subject to long-term, fixed-price physical
contracts. The long-term, fixed-price physical contracts apply
to a small portion of our future U.S. natural gas
production and provide a measure of protection to the Company in
the event of decreasing natural gas prices. These fixed-priced
contracts reduced our 2005 and 2004 worldwide realized natural
gas prices by $.19 per Mcf and $.10 per Mcf,
respectively. Additionally, nearly all of our Australian natural
gas production is subject to long-term, fixed-price supply
contracts that are periodically adjusted for changes in
Australia’s consumer price index. Since these contracts are
denominated in Australian dollars, the resulting revenues are
impacted by changes in the value of the Australian dollar
relative to the U.S. dollar.

Approximately nine percent and 16 percent of our worldwide
natural gas production was subject to financial derivative
hedges for 2005 and 2004, respectively. Currently, all of our
natural gas derivative positions have been designated against
Gulf of Mexico production. These derivative financial
instruments reduced our 2005 and 2004 consolidated realized
prices $.15 per Mcf and $.20 per Mcf, respectively.
(See Note 3, Hedging and Derivative Instruments of
Item 15 in this
Form

10-K

for a
summary of current derivative positions and terms.) Also during
2004, we amortized specific unrealized gains and losses related
to derivative positions closed in October and November 2001.
This amortization, which terminated in July 2004, had a
negligible impact on 2005 average realized prices.

Costs

The tables below compare our costs on an absolute dollar basis
and an equivalent unit of production (boe) basis. Our
discussion may reference either expenses on a boe basis or
expenses on an absolute dollar basis, or both, depending on
their relevance.

Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization

Apache’s Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization
(DD&A) of oil and gas properties is calculated using the
Units of Production Method (UOP). The UOP calculation in
simplest terms multiplies the percentage of estimated proved
reserves produced each quarter times the costs of those
reserves. The result is to recognize expense at the same pace
that the reservoirs are actually depleting. The costs in the UOP
calculation include both the net capitalized amounts on the
balance sheet, and the estimated future costs to



access and develop reserves needing additional facilities,
equipment or downhole work in order to produce. Under the
full-cost method of accounting, the DD&A calculation is
prepared separately for each country in which Apache operates.
Absolute DD&A determines the expense reported each period,
while the cost per unit of production (DD&A rate) provides
insight into the overall costs of the company’s reserves
growth. Current costs incurred to drill or acquire additional
reserves that are higher than the historical cost level raises
the overall DD&A rate. Conversely, if reserves are added in
the current period at a rate per unit less than existing levels,
they average down the company’s DD&A rate. Changes from
period to period in absolute DD&A expense are determined by
production levels, the mix of production (high cost country
versus a low cost country) and the impact of recent spending
(higher or lower DD&A rates).

Our 2005 full-cost DD&A expense totaled $1.3 billion,
$176 million more than 2004. Our 2005 full-cost DD&A
rate of $7.99 per boe was $.98 per boe more than 2004,
driven by rising industry-wide drilling costs, especially in the
U.S., Canada, the North Sea and Egypt. The higher commodity
prices experienced over the past year, as well as the affect of
the U.S. hurricanes, led to increased demand for drilling
services and thus higher current drilling costs and higher
estimated future development costs. The increase in North
Sea’s rates per boe also reflects the continuation of
facility upgrades to increase the overall efficiency of the
platforms.

Full-cost DD&A expense of $1.1 billion in 2004,
increased $146 million compared to 2003. Approximately
59 percent of the increase in absolute costs was related to
higher production levels, mainly in the North Sea, Egypt and
China. The balance was primarily attributable to higher drilling
costs, as our 2004 DD&A rate increased $.42 to
$7.01 per boe. The increase in per unit costs is primarily
attributable to our North American operations where high
commodity prices have led to increased demand for drilling
services and thus higher drilling costs. A full year’s
production from China, which carries the second highest DD&A
rate in the Company, also contributed to the increase in the
worldwide rate. These increases were partially offset by a
decrease in the DD&A rate in Egypt from a successful
exploration and development program which added significant
reserves through drilling at lower costs.

Depreciation of other assets increased $18 million in 2005,
reflecting new infrastructure built in Canada to accommodate
development on acreage acquired from ExxonMobil in 2004 and new
Qasr natural gas facilities in Egypt.

Depreciation of other assets increased $3 million in 2004,
in line with our overall growth.

Impairments

We assess all of our unproved properties for possible impairment
on a quarterly basis based on geological trend analysis, dry
holes or relinquishment of acreage. When an impairment occurs,
costs associated with these properties are generally transferred
to our proved property base where they become subject to
amortization. Impairments in international areas without proved
reserves are charged to earnings upon determination that
impairment has occurred. In 2003, we impaired the final
$13 million ($8 million after-tax) of unproved
property costs in Poland.

Goodwill is subject to a periodic fair-value-based impairment
assessment. Goodwill totaled $189 million on
December 31, 2005, and no impairment was recorded in 2005,
2004 or 2003. For further discussion, see Note 1, Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies of Item 15 in this
Form

10-K.

Lease Operating Costs

Lease operating costs (LOE) are generally comprised of
several components: direct operating costs, repair and
maintenance, workover costs and ad valorem taxes. LOE is driven
in part by the type of commodity produced, the level of workover
activity and the geographical location of the properties. Oil is
inherently more expensive to produce than natural gas. Repair
and maintenance costs are higher on offshore properties and in
areas with remote plants and facilities. Workovers continue to
be an important part of our strategy enabling us to exploit our
existing reserve base by accelerating production and taking
advantage of high commodity prices. Commodity prices and
exchange rates also impact LOE. Historically, electricity, fuel
and other service costs have risen in high commodity price
environments, leading to an increase in industry-wide LOE.
Rising per



unit operating costs remained a challenge in 2005, especially in
North America. The Company reviews production costs in each of
its core areas on a monthly basis and pursues alternatives to
maintain efficient levels of costs. Fluctuations in exchange
rates also impact the Company’s LOE, with a weakening
U.S. dollar adding to per unit costs and a stronger
U.S. dollar lowering per unit costs. The U.S. dollar,
which weakened against the Canadian dollar throughout 2005,
strengthened marginally against the Australian dollar and
British pound. Acquisitions increase absolute LOE costs, but
they do not necessarily increase per unit costs or reduce
margins. The following discussion will focus on per unit
operating costs as this is the most informative method of
analyzing LOE trends.

On a per unit/boe produced basis, 2005 LOE averaged
$6.27 per boe, $1.00 per boe higher than 2004.
Production shut-ins and additional insurance costs associated
with the 2005 hurricanes added $.41 to the 2005 rate. The
remaining increase reflects higher service costs associated with
rising commodity prices and the associated increase in demand
for services, an increase in workover activity, higher repair
and maintenance costs and the impact a weaker U.S. dollar
had on Canadian LOE. The slight strengthening against the
Australian dollar and British pound had less impact on LOE.

Regionally, 2005 costs were up as follows:

U.S.

— The U.S. added $.77 per boe to
the 2005 consolidated rate with nearly one-third of the impact
attributed to the additional insurance costs and production
shut-ins caused by the 2005 hurricanes. Higher contract labor
costs, workover activity, repair and maintenance, and various
other commodity-price driven service costs accounted for the
remaining impact.

Australia

— Australia added $.15 per boe
to the 2005 consolidated rate on a 20 percent drop in
equivalent production. Australia also saw a rise in insurance
cost. The lower production added $.13 per boe to the 2005
consolidated rate, while additional costs added $.02 per
boe.

Canada

— Canada added $.21 per boe to the
2005 consolidated rate increase, with costs adding $.27 per boe,
partially offset by the impact of higher volumes, which reduced
the rate $.06 per boe. 2005 costs were up $44 million
from 2004, with 42 percent attributable to the
strengthening Canadian dollar. The balance related to various
other costs associated with an increase in activity and the
general rise in costs, including higher contract labor, power
and fuel, repair and maintenance and workover costs.

Egypt

— Egypt’s 2005 costs were
$23 million higher than 2004 on higher diesel fuel costs,
an increase in workover activity, higher labor costs and
insurance costs. The diesel fuel costs were previously
subsidized by the Egyptian government. Egypt added $.04 per
boe to the consolidated rate increase, with higher costs adding
$.14 per boe and increased volumes lowering the rate
$.10 per boe.

North Sea

— The North Sea reduced the 2005
consolidated rate $.16 per boe on a 24 percent
increase in production, partially offset by a two percent
increase in costs. North Sea costs were up on increased repair
and maintenance activity.

On a per unit produced basis, 2004 LOE increased $.68 to
$5.27 per boe. The increase was primarily attributable to
an increase in industry-wide service costs in North America with
higher commodity prices, an increase in currency exchange rates
in Canada, the North Sea and Australia, and higher expense
resulting from our incentive programs, primarily stock-based
programs which we began expensing in 2003. Per unit costs were
also negatively impacted by the combined impact of lost
production and additional costs related to Hurricane Ivan in the
Gulf of Mexico and higher repair and maintenance costs in
Australia. These increases offset the impact of a $2.75 decline
in the unit cost in the North Sea, where our investments to
increase production (and lower operating costs per unit) over
the long-term began to pay off.

Gathering and Transportation Costs

Apache generally sells oil and natural gas under two types of
agreements, typical in our industry. Both types of agreements
include a transportation charge. One is a netback arrangement,
under which Apache sells oil or natural gas at the wellhead and
collects a price, net of transportation incurred by the
purchaser. In this case, the Company records sales at the price
received from the purchaser, which is net of transportation
costs.



Under the other arrangement, Apache sells oil or natural gas at
a specific delivery point, pays transportation to a third-party
carrier and receives from the purchaser a price with no
transportation deduction. In this case, the Company records the
transportation cost as gathering and transportation costs. The
Company’s treatment of transportation costs is pursuant to
Emerging Issues Task Force
Issue

00-10,

“Accounting for Shipping and Handling Fees and Costs”
and as a result a portion of our transporting costs is reflected
in sales prices and a portion is reflected as Gathering and
Transportation Costs rendering the separately identified
transportation costs incomplete.

In both the U.S. and Canada, Apache sells oil and natural gas
under both types of arrangements. In the North Sea, Apache pays
transportation to a third-party carrier and receives a purchase
price with no transportation deduction. In Australia, oil and
natural gas are sold under netback arrangements. In China, we
incur costs for barges to transport crude oil to onshore
terminal facilities. In Egypt, our oil and natural gas
production has historically been sold to EGPC under netback
arrangements. During 2005, Apache exported a portion of its
Egyptian crude oil under both types of arrangements. Future
export cargoes may be sold under netback arrangements or Apache
may arrange shipping and receive prices without transportation
deductions. The following table presents gathering and
transportation costs paid directly by Apache to third-party
carriers for each of the periods presented.

These costs are primarily related to the transportation of
natural gas in our North American operations, North Sea crude
oil sales and Egyptian crude oil exports. The 22 percent
increase in costs for 2005 was driven primarily by North
Sea’s production growth and Egyptian crude exports. Apache
began exporting Egyptian crude in the second half of 2004 and
first incurred third-party transportation charges in early 2005.

Transportation costs in 2004 increased 37 percent from 2003
primarily because of production growth and a full year of
production in the North Sea and an increase in volumes
transported under third-party transportation contracts in the
U.S., Canada’s 2004 costs were 11 percent higher than
2003 because of an increase in third-party transportation rates
and the impact of a weaker U.S. dollar.

Severance and Other Taxes

Severance and other taxes are primarily comprised of severance
taxes on properties onshore and in state or provincial waters in
the U.S. and Australia, and the United Kingdom (U.K.) Petroleum
Revenue Tax (PRT). Severance taxes are generally based on a
percentage of oil and gas production revenues, while the U.K.
PRT is assessed on net receipts (revenues less qualifying
operating costs and capital spending) from subject fields in the
U.K. North Sea. We are also subject to the Australian Petroleum
Resources Rent Tax (PRRT), and various Canadian taxes including
the Canadian Large Corporation Tax, Saskatchewan Capital



Tax, Saskatchewan Resource Surtax and Freehold Mineral Tax. The
table below presents a comparison of these expenses.

Severance and other taxes totaled $453 million in 2005,
$359 million greater than 2004. The U.K. PRT increased
$346 million in 2005 on significantly higher oil price
realizations and higher production. U.S. severance taxes
increased $36 million on higher oil and gas prices.
Australia’s severance taxes decreased $24 million,
reflecting lower excise tax on production from Legendre, a
result of declining production.

In 2004, severance and other taxes decreased 23 percent, or
$28 million, with severance taxes representing the majority
of these taxes. U.S. severance and other taxes increased
$15 million, in line with higher production revenues.
Australia’s taxes increased $36 million as production
from the Legendre field crossed a cumulative threshold,
triggering an excise tax. In 2004 Apache’s U.K. PRT was in
a credit position as deductible capital spending exceeded
taxable cash flows from the North Sea Forties field. Canadian
taxes increased $3 million on an increase in Freehold
Mineral Taxes.

General and Administrative Expenses

General and administrative expenses (G&A) of $1.20 per
boe for 2005 increased $.14 per boe over 2004. Absolute
costs increased $25 million or 14 percent. Nearly
three-fourths of the increase in year-over-year costs related to
the impact of Apache’s stock-based compensation programs.
Stock-based compensation costs increased relative to the
prior-year because of new stock option grants issued in 2005, a
new targeted stock plan approved by stockholders in May 2005,
and the impact Apache’s rising common stock price had on
stock-based compensation expense. The balance of the G&A
increase was primarily attributed to the increased cost of
insurance, a consequence of the hurricanes, higher charitable
contributions and higher Sarbanes-Oxley compliance audit fees.

G&A of $1.06 per boe in 2004 increased $.15 per
boe over 2003. Absolute costs increased $35 million, or
25 percent. Over $21 million, or 61 percent, of
the additional expense was related to the impact Apache’s
rising stock price had on stock-based compensation programs and
incremental incentive compensation. The impact from the higher
stock price stems from Apache’s decision, effective
January 1, 2003, to expense stock-based compensation plans
(see Note 8, Capital Stock of Item 15 in this
Form

10-K).

Approximately $3 million, or 8 percent, of the
increase is related to our North Sea operations, with the first
full year of operations in 2004. The balance of the increase was
related to higher audit and tax fees, increased insurance
premiums, and expansion of the Company’s gas marketing
group.

Financing Costs, Net

The major components of financing costs, net, include interest
expense and capitalized interest.

Net financing costs for 2005 were slightly lower than 2004.
While gross interest expense increased $7 million in 2005
on a higher average debt balance, it was mostly offset by a
$6 million increase in the amount of interest capitalized,
a result of a higher average unproved property balance. Our
weighted-average cost of borrowing on December 31, 2005 was
6.7 percent and 2004 was 6.1 percent.

2004 net financing costs were slightly higher than 2003.
Gross interest expense decreased $1 million in 2004, a
result of a lower average debt balance. This decrease was offset
by a $2 million decrease in the amount



of interest capitalized, a result of a lower average unproved
property balance. Our weighted-average cost of borrowing on
December 31, 2004 was 6.1 percent compared to
6.4 percent on December 31, 2003.

Provision for Income Taxes

2005 income tax expense of $1.6 billion was
$590 million higher than 2004. The additional income tax
expense was driven by higher taxable income related to the
increased oil and gas revenues in 2005, compared to 2004. Our
effective tax rate was 37.62 percent in 2005 compared to
37.29 percent in 2004. Currency fluctuations added
$13 million of additional deferred tax expense to 2005 and
$58 million to 2004.

Income tax expense in 2004 of $993 million was
$166 million or 20 percent higher than 2003. The
higher taxes were primarily associated with higher income driven
by higher oil and gas production revenues in 2004 compared to
2003. Our effective tax rate was 37.29 percent in 2004
compared to 43.02 percent in 2003. The 2003 effective tax
rate included $172 million of additional deferred tax
expense because of currency fluctuations compared to
$58 million in 2004. For a discussion of Apache’s
sensitivity to foreign currency fluctuations, please refer to

Overview

Apache’s primary uses of cash are exploration, development
and acquisition of oil and gas properties, costs and expenses
necessary to maintain continued operations, repayment of
principal and interest on outstanding debt and payment of
dividends.

Our business, as with other extractive industries, is a
depleting one in which each barrel produced must be replaced or
the Company, and a critical source of our future liquidity, will
shrink. Cash investments are continuously required to fund
exploration and development projects and acquisitions which are
necessary to offset the inherent declines in production and
proven reserves. See Item 1 and 2, Business and
Properties, “Risks Factors,” in this
Form

10-K.

Future
success in maintaining and growing reserves and production will
be highly dependent on having adequate capital resources
available, on our success in both exploration and development
activities and on acquiring additional reserves.

Our year-end reserve life index indicates an average decline of
7.8 percent per year. This projection is based on prices at
year-end, except in those instances where future natural gas and
oil sales are covered by physical contract terms providing for
higher or lower prices, estimates of investments required to
develop estimated proved undeveloped reserves, costs and taxes
reflected in our standardized measure in Note 14,
Supplemental Oil and Gas Disclosures (Unaudited) of Item 15
in this Form

10-K.

The Company funds its exploration and development activities
primarily through net cash provided by operating activities
(cash flow) and budgets capital expenditures based on projected
cash flow. Our cash flow, both in the short and long-term, is
impacted by highly volatile oil and natural gas prices,
production levels, industry trends impacting operating expenses
and our ability to continue to acquire or find high-margin
reserves at competitive prices. For these reasons, we only
forecast, for internal use by management, an annual



cash flow. Longer-term cash flow and capital spending
projections are not used by management to operate our business.
The annual cash flow forecasts are revised monthly in response
to changing market conditions and production projections. Apache
routinely adjusts capital expenditure budgets in response to the
adjusted cash flow forecasts and market trends in drilling and
acquisitions costs.

The Company has historically utilized internally generated cash
flow, committed and uncommitted credit facilities and access to
both debt and equity capital markets for all other liquidity and
capital resources needs. Apache’s ability to access the
debt capital market is supported by its investment grade credit
ratings. Because of the liquidity and capital resources
alternatives available to Apache, including internally generated
cash flows, Apache’s management believes that its
short-term and long-term liquidity is adequate to fund
operations, including its capital spending program, repayment of
debt maturities and any amounts that may ultimately be paid in
connection with contingencies.

Apache’s senior unsecured debt is currently rated
investment grade by Moody’s, Standard and Poor’s and
Fitch with ratings of A3, A- and A, respectively.

The Company’s ratio of current assets to current
liabilities was .99 on December 31, 2005 compared to 1.05
at the end of 2004. Current liabilities increased
70 percent ($904 million) in 2005 versus a
60 percent ($813 million) increase in current assets.
While virtually all meaningful current asset and current
liability categories increased in 2005, changes in the North Sea
PRT liability, our current portion of derivative liabilities,
and current ARO liabilities particularly impacted the ratio. The
North Sea PRT liability, which is a component of
“Other” current liabilities, increased approximately
$171 million compared to the prior year. The current
portion of FMV of derivatives increased nearly
$235 million, which is eleven times the 2004 amount. Both
the PRT and derivative liabilities reflect the impact of higher
commodity prices. The current ARO liability of $94 million
was established in 2005 because of damage caused by Hurricanes
Katrina and Rita. Collectively, the increases in liabilities
more than offset the higher current asset balances. Current
receivables were up $505 million, or 54 percent, most
of which related to oil and gas receivables impacted by
commodity prices. Cash more than doubled to $229 million.
Drilling advances, up 76 percent, and prepaid assets and
other, up 130 percent, were other asset categories that
also increased substantially. The drilling advance amount is in
line with increased drilling activity in 2005 compared to 2004.
The change in prepaid assets and other relates to higher taxes
and other deposits.

Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities

Apache’s net cash provided by operating activities during
2005 totaled $4.3 billion, up from $3.2 billion in
2004. The increase in 2005 cash flow was attributed primarily to
the significant increase in commodity prices. The Company’s
average realized oil and natural gas prices increased
47 percent and 29 percent, respectively; a reflection
of higher worldwide commodity prices. Higher production also
added to our 2005 cash flow relative to 2004, albeit to a much
less extent. These increases in cash flow were partially offset
by higher production costs attributable to the effect of
increased commodity prices, costs related to Hurricanes Katrina
and Rita and an increase in exchange rates in Canada. The
Company reviews production costs for each core area on a monthly
basis and pursues alternatives in maintaining efficient levels
of costs and expenses. For a more detailed discussion of
commodity prices, production, costs and expenses, please refer
to the Results of Operations section of this Item 7,
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations.

Apache’s net cash provided by operating activities during
2004 totaled $3.2 billion, up from $2.7 billion in
2003. The increase in 2004 cash flow was primarily attributed to
the significant increase in commodity prices. The Company’s
averaged realized oil and natural gas prices increased 27 and
7 percent, respectively; a reflection of higher worldwide
commodity prices. Higher production also increased our 2004 cash
flow on a 13 percent and one percent increase in oil and
natural gas production, respectively. These increases were
partially offset by higher production costs attributable to the
effect of increased commodity prices, an increase in exchange
rates in Canada, North Sea and Australia, costs related to
Hurricane Ivan and increases in costs from our stock-based
employee incentive programs.



Historically, fluctuations in commodity prices have been the
primary reason for the Company’s short-term changes in cash
flow from operating activities. Sales volume changes have also
impacted cash flow in the short-term, but have not been as
volatile as commodity prices in the past. Apache’s
long-term cash flow from operating activities is dependent on
commodity prices, reserve replacement and the level of costs and
expenses required for continued operations.

Debt

During 2005, we continued to strengthen our financial
flexibility and to build on the solid financial positions of
previous years. We exited 2005 with a

debt-to

-capitalization
ratio of 17 percent, a decrease of seven percent from
year-end 2004, with lower debt and increases in equity resulting
from earnings. At year-end 2005 the Company had long-term debt
of $2.2 billion, $396 million lower than year-end
2004, as the Company’s capital spending was less than
internally generated cash flow. The Company’s outstanding
debt consisted of notes and debentures maturing in the years
2006 through 2096. Approximately $.3 million,
$173 million, $.4 million, $100 million and
$1.9 billion mature in 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009 and
thereafter, respectively. During 2005, the Company maintained
its senior unsecured long-term debt ratings of A3 from
Moody’s, A- from Standard and Poor’s and A from Fitch.

The Company has a $1.2 billion commercial paper program
which enables Apache to borrow funds for up to 270 days at
competitive interest rates. There was no commercial paper
outstanding as of December 31, 2005. The commercial paper
balance of $392 million on December 31, 2004 was
classified as long-term debt in the accompanying consolidated
balance sheet as the Company had the ability and intent to
refinance such amount on a long-term basis through either the
rollover of commercial paper or available borrowing capacity
under its U.S. credit facilities. The weighted-average
interest rate for commercial paper was 3.03 percent in 2005
and 1.79 percent in 2004.

As of December 31, 2005, available borrowing capacity under
our credit facilities was $1.5 billion. We had
$229 million in cash and cash equivalents on hand on
December 31, 2005, compared to $111 million on
December 31, 2004.

On May 12, 2005, the Company entered into a new
$450 million revolving bank credit facility for the U.S., a
$150 million revolving bank credit facility for Australia
and a $150 million revolving bank credit facility for
Canada. These new facilities replaced the Company’s
existing credit facilities in the same amounts which were
scheduled to mature in June 2007. These new facilities are
scheduled to mature on May 12, 2010. There were no changes
to the Company’s $750 million U.S. credit
facility which matures in May 2009.

The financial covenants of the credit facilities require the
Company to maintain a

debt-to

-capitalization
ratio of not greater than 60 percent at the end of any
fiscal quarter. The negative covenants include restrictions on
the Company’s ability to create liens and security
interests on our assets, with exceptions for liens typically
arising in the oil and gas industry, purchase money liens and
liens arising as a matter of law, such as tax and mechanics
liens. The Company may incur liens on assets located in the
U.S., Canada and Australia of up to five percent of the
Company’s consolidated assets, which approximated
$964 million on December 31, 2005. There are no
restrictions on incurring liens in countries other than the
U.S., Canada and Australia. There are also restrictions on
Apache’s ability to merge with another entity, unless the
Company is the surviving entity, and a restriction on our
ability to guarantee debt of entities not within our
consolidated group.

There are no clauses in the facilities that permit the lenders
to accelerate payments or refuse to lend based on unspecified
material adverse changes (MAC clauses). The credit facility
agreements do not have drawdown restrictions or prepayment
obligations in the event of a decline in credit ratings.
However, the agreements allow the lenders to accelerate payments
and terminate lending commitments if Apache Corporation, or any
of its U.S., Canadian and Australian subsidiaries, defaults on
any direct payment obligation in excess of $100 million or
has any unpaid, non-appealable judgment against it in excess of
$100 million. The Company was in compliance with the terms
of the credit facilities as of December 31, 2005.



Stock Transactions

The Company periodically uses access to equity capital markets
to fund significant acquisitions. On January 22, 2003, in
conjunction with the BP transaction, we completed a public
offering of approximately 19.8 million shares of common
stock, including 2.6 million shares for the
underwriters’ over-allotment option, for net proceeds of
$554 million. The Company currently has no plans to access
equity capital markets.

On December 18, 2003, we announced that holders of our
common stock approved an increase in the number of authorized
common shares to 430 million from 215 million in order
to complete a previously announced two-for-one stock split. The
record date for the stock split was December 31, 2003 and
the additional shares were distributed on January 14, 2004.

Oil and Gas Capital Expenditures

The Company funded its exploration and production (E&D)
capital expenditures, including Gathering, Transportation and
Marketing (GTM) facilities, of $3.8 billion,
$2.5 billion and $1.5 billion in 2005, 2004 and 2003,
respectively, primarily with internally generated cash flow of
$4.3 billion, $3.2 billion and $2.7 billion.

The Company uses a combination of internally generated cash
flow, borrowings under the Company’s lines of credit and
commercial paper program and, from time to time, issues of
public debt or common stock to fund its significant
acquisitions. During the three-year period presented, the
Company primarily used internally generated cash flow or its
lines of credit and commercial paper program; which were
subsequently paid down with internally generated cash flow.
However, in 2003, in conjunction with the BP acquisition, the
Company completed a public offering of approximately
19.8 million shares of common stock, including
2.6 million shares for the underwriters’
over-allotment option, for net proceeds of $554 million.

The following table presents a summary of the Company’s
Capital Expenditures for each of our reportable segments for the
past three years.

The Company completed its most active year to-date, drilling
2,383 wells throughout 2005 and spending nearly
$400 million on oil and gas processing facilities and
pipelines. Approximately two-thirds of our 2005 exploration and
development expenditures were invested in Canada and the U.S.,
where nearly 69 percent of Apache’s 2005 year-end
estimated proved reserves reside. Once again, Canada was our
most active region, drilling 1,674 wells with a
93 percent success rate. Approximately 82 percent of
Canada’s 2005 wells were shallow development wells.
Canada was also very active in the North Grant Lands,
undeveloped acreage Apache obtained through two farm-in
agreements with ExxonMobil. Canada spent nearly $180 million



constructing 11 gas processing plants, six of which were
completed by the end of 2005. In the Gulf Coast region, even
with the disruptions caused by the Gulf of Mexico hurricanes, we
drilled 114 wells, including 66 offshore.
Seventy-seven percent of our Gulf Coast wells were productive.
Our focus in the Gulf Coast region remained the same as 2004,
development and exploitation of our existing asset base
including the Gulf of Mexico properties acquired from Anadarko
in the second half of 2004. The Central region was the second
most active region, drilling 364 wells, with a
97 percent success rate. In the North Sea, we drilled a
total of 23 wells, 18 Forties Field wells, and
invested approximately $198 million of maintenance capital
to continue to improve the operating efficiency of the Forties
Field. We expect to complete the Forties power generation and
gas ring by the summer of 2006, which will greatly reduce fuel
oil generating costs and improve production reliability. In
Egypt, we had another active and successful exploration and
development program, drilling 121 wells of which
86 percent were productive. We also continued development
of the Qasr field, where gross production
average 128 MMcf/d in December 2005. In Australia, we
participated in drilling 36 wells; 26 exploration
wells and 10 development wells. China’s capital
expenditures were flat compared to 2004 as they continued their
development drilling program. The Company spent $39 million
on acquisitions in 2005 compared to $1.1 billion in 2004,
as the high-price commodity market in 2005 limited the number of
attractive acquisition opportunities. Those that were pursued
were slated to close in the first quarter of 2006. Acquisition
expenditures typically vary year to year based on the
availability of opportunities that fit Apache’s overall
strategy.

In 2004, Apache drilled 1,735 wells and completed two
significant acquisitions. In the Gulf of Mexico, the majority of
our activity focused in and around our existing asset base,
including continued exploitation of the properties purchased
from BP and Shell in 2003 and the Anadarko properties purchased
in 2004. In the Central region, where Apache got its start,
estimated proved reserves increased 20 percent in 2004
through a combination of the ExxonMobil acquisition and an
active drilling year, completing 268 of 283 wells in the
region. Canada was our most active area in 2004 with over
1,300 wells drilled, three-fourths of which were shallow
development wells, with over 92 percent completed as
producers. At the Forties Field, an experienced workforce began
tackling projects to extend the life of the largest field
discovered in the United Kingdom sector of the North Sea.
Production increases at Forties — the anchor of
Apache’s newest core area — were driven by
Apache’s first drilling program since acquiring the field
and a maintenance program aimed at improving efficiency of the
field. During 2004, Apache completed 12 of 17 wells drilled
as part of a $362 million capital program, including
$150 million of maintenance and operations capital
expenditures. In Egypt and Australia, Apache continued its
successful exploration programs with several new discoveries.
Our continuing development program in Egypt increased gross
production to over 100,000 b/d for the first time. Capital
expenditures in China decreased in 2004 with the completion of
production facilities and first production in the second half of
2003. In 2004, Apache added 444.7 MMboe of estimated proved
reserves through acquisitions, drilling and revisions. During
2004, GTM expenditures included additional gathering system
pipelines in Egypt and a gas plant expansion on Varanus Island
in Australia.

For 2006, we plan another active year of drilling. Because we
revise our estimates of exploration and development capital
expenditures frequently throughout the year based on industry
conditions and results to date, accurately projecting future
expenditures is difficult at best. However, our 2006 preliminary
estimate of exploration and development capital and oil and gas
processing facilities and pipelines is in excess of
$3.7 billion. We generally do not project estimates for
acquisitions because their timing is unpredictable; however, in
early 2006 we closed an acquisition announced in late 2005.
Also, on January 17, 2006, the Company announced an
agreement with Pioneer Natural Resources. Please refer to the
Subsequent Acquisitions and Divestiture section of this
Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations. We continually
look for properties which we believe will add value and earn
adequate rates of return and will take advantage of those
opportunities as they arise.

Cash Dividend Payments

The Company has paid cash dividends on its common stock for 41
consecutive years through 2005. Future dividend payments will
depend on the Company’s level of earnings, financial
requirements and other relevant factors. Common dividends paid
during 2005 rose 32 percent to $112 million,
reflecting the increase



in common shares outstanding and the higher common stock
dividend rate. The Company increased its quarterly cash dividend
25 percent, to 10 cents per share from eight cents per
share, effective with the November 2005 dividend payment.

During 2005 and 2004, Apache paid a total of $6 million in
dividends each year on its Series B Preferred Stock issued
in August 1998. See Note 8, Capital Stock of Item 15
in this Form

10-K.

Common dividends paid during 2004 rose 26 percent to
$85 million, reflecting the increase in common shares
outstanding and the higher common stock dividend rate.

Contractual Obligations

We are subject to various financial obligations and commitments
in the normal course of operations. These contractual
obligations represent known future cash payments that we are
required to make and relate primarily to long-term debt,
operating leases, pipeline transportation commitments and
international commitments. The Company expects to fund these
contractual obligations with cash generated from operating
activities. The following table summarizes the Company’s
contractual obligations as of December 31, 2005. See
Note 10, Commitments and Contingencies of Item 15 in
this Form

Apache is also subject to various contingent obligations that
become payable only if certain events or rulings were to occur.
The inherent uncertainty surrounding the timing of and monetary
impact associated with these events or rulings prevents any
meaningful accurate measurement, which is necessary to assess
any impact on future liquidity. Such obligations include
environmental contingencies and potential settlements resulting
from litigation. Apache’s management feels that it has
adequately reserved for its contingent obligations. The Company
has reserved approximately $11 million for environmental
remediation. The Company has also reserved approximately
$12 million for various legal liabilities, in addition to
the $71 million, plus interest, we accrued for the Texaco
China B.V. litigation. See Note 10, Commitments and
Contingencies of Item 15 in this
Form

10-K

for a
detailed discussion of the Company’s environmental and
legal contingencies.

The Company accrued approximately $22 million as of
December 31, 2005, for an insurance contingency because of
our involvement with Oil Insurance Limited (OIL). Apache is a
member of this insurance pool which insures specific property,
pollution liability and other catastrophic risks of the Company.
As part of its membership, the Company is contractually
committed to pay termination fees were we to elect to withdraw
from OIL. Apache does not anticipate withdrawal from the
insurance pool; however, the potential termination



fee is calculated annually based on past losses and the
liability reflecting this potential charge has been accrued as
required.

As discussed under Note 2, Acquisitions and Divestitures of
Item 15 in this
Form

10-K,

Apache
assumed obligations for pre-existing VPPs in the 2004
acquisition of properties from Anadarko and the 2003 acquisition
of properties from Shell. Under the terms of the VPP agreements,
Apache is scheduled to deliver a total of 7.8 MMboe in
2006, 4.7 MMboe in 2007 and 1.6 MMboe in 2008 to
Morgan Stanley as owner of the VPP interests. Morgan Stanley is
entitled to the first production and may demand up to
90 percent of the production from the assets encumbered by
each VPP in any given month to satisfy the VPP interests.
However, they have no right to look to other assets or
production of Apache. Apache does not record the reserves and
production volumes attributable to the VPPs. As of
December 31, 2005, Apache has booked a total of
93.5 MMboe of reserves attributable to the Anadarko and
Shell transactions. The VPPs are non-operating interests, free
of costs incurred for operations and production. Apache provided
a liability for these costs as reflected in the preceding table.

Upon closing of our 2003 acquisition of the North Sea
properties, Apache assumed BP’s abandonment obligation for
those properties and such costs were considered in determining
the purchase price. The purchase of the properties, however, did
not relieve BP of its liabilities if Apache fails to satisfy the
abandonment obligation. Although not currently required, to
ensure Apache’s payment of these costs, Apache agreed to
deliver a letter of credit to BP if the rating of our senior
unsecured debt is lowered by both Moody’s and Standard and
Poor’s from the Company’s current ratings of A3 and
A-, respectively. Any such letter of credit would be in an
amount equal to the net present value of future abandonment
costs of the North Sea properties as of the date of any such
ratings change. If Apache is required to provide a letter of
credit, it will expire if either rating agency restores its
rating to the present level. The letter of credit amount would
be 127 million British pounds, an amount that represents
the letter of credit requirement through March 2006, and will be
negotiated annually based on Apache’s future abandonment
obligation estimates.

The Company’s future liquidity could be impacted by a
significant downgrade of its credit ratings by Standard and
Poor’s and Moody’s; however, we do not believe that
such a sharp downgrade is reasonably likely. The Company’s
credit facilities do not require the Company to maintain a
minimum credit rating. The negative covenants associated with
our debt are outlined in greater detail under “Capital
Resources and Liquidity, Debt” in this section of this
Form

10-K.

In
addition, generally under our commodity hedge agreements, Apache
may be required to post margin or terminate outstanding
positions if the Company’s credit ratings decline
significantly.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

Apache does not currently utilize any off-balance sheet
arrangements with unconsolidated entities to enhance liquidity
and capital resource positions. Apache entered into a
partnership with ExxonMobil to obtain additional interests in
specific West Texas and New Mexico oil & gas properties
acquired from ExxonMobil in September 2004. As discussed in
Note 2, Acquisitions and Divestitures of Item 15 in
this Form

10-K,

Apache contributed $29 million into this partnership which
was determined to be a variable interest entity as defined by
Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation
No. 46 “Variable Interest Entities.” Apache
concluded that they were not the primary beneficiary of the
partnership and, therefore, proportionately consolidated only
the Company’s portion of the oil and gas properties.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Full-Cost Method of Accounting for Oil and Gas Operations

The accounting for our business is subject to special accounting
rules that are unique to the oil and gas industry. There are two
allowable methods of accounting for oil and gas business
activities: the successful-efforts method and the full-cost
method. There are several significant differences between these
methods. Under the successful-efforts method, costs such as
geological and geophysical (G&G), exploratory dry holes and
delay rentals are expensed as incurred, where under the
full-cost method these types of charges would be capitalized to
their respective full-cost pool. In the measurement of
impairment of oil and gas properties, the



successful-efforts method of accounting follows the guidance
provided in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
(SFAS) No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or
Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,” where the first measurement
for impairment is to compare the net book value of the related
asset to its undiscounted future cash flows using commodity
prices consistent with management expectations. Under the
full-cost method, the net book value (full-cost pool) is
compared to the future net cash flows discounted at
10 percent using commodity prices in effect on the last day
of the reporting period (ceiling limitation). If the full-cost
pool is in excess of the ceiling limitation, the excess amount
is charged through income.

We have elected to use the full-cost method to account for our
investment in oil and gas properties. Under this method, the
Company capitalizes all acquisition, exploration and development
costs for the purpose of finding oil and gas reserves, including
salaries, benefits and other internal costs directly
attributable to these finding activities. Although some of these
costs will ultimately result in no additional reserves, we
expect the benefits of successful wells to more than offset the
costs of any unsuccessful ones. In addition, gains or losses on
the sale or other disposition of oil and gas properties are not
recognized unless the gain or loss would significantly alter the
relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves of
oil and natural gas attributable to a country. As a result, we
believe that the full-cost method of accounting better reflects
the true economics of exploring for and developing oil and gas
reserves. Our financial position and results of operations would
have been significantly different had we used the
successful-efforts method of accounting for our oil and gas
investments. Generally, the application of the full-cost method
of accounting for oil and gas property results in higher
capitalized costs and higher DD&A rates compared to similar
companies applying the successful efforts methods of accounting.

Reserve Estimates

Our estimate of proved reserves is based on the quantities of
oil and gas which geological and engineering data demonstrate,
with reasonable certainty, to be recoverable in future years
from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating
conditions. The accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function
of the quality of available data, engineering and geological
interpretation, and judgment. For example, we must estimate the
amount and timing of future operating costs, severance taxes,
development costs, and workover costs, all of which may in fact
vary considerably from actual results. In addition, as prices
and cost levels change from year to year, the estimate of proved
reserves also changes. Any significant variance in these
assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantity and
value of our reserves. As such, our reserve engineers review and
revise the Company’s reserve estimates at least annually.

Despite the inherent imprecision in these engineering estimates,
our reserves are used throughout our financial statements. For
example, since we use the

units-of

-production
method to amortize our oil and gas properties, the quantity of
reserves could significantly impact our DD&A expense. Our
oil and gas properties are also subject to a “ceiling”
limitation based in part on the quantity of our proved reserves.
Finally, these reserves are the basis for our supplemental oil
and gas disclosures.

We engage an independent petroleum engineering firm to review
our estimates of proved hydrocarbon liquid and gas reserves.
During 2005, 2004 and 2003, their review covered 74, 79 and
78 percent of the reserve value, respectively.

Costs Excluded

Under the full-cost method of accounting, oil and gas properties
include costs that are excluded from capitalized costs being
amortized. These amounts represent investments in unproved
properties and major development projects. Apache excludes these
costs on a country-by-country basis until proved reserves are
found or until it is determined that the costs are impaired. All
costs excluded are reviewed at least quarterly by the
Company’s accounting, exploration and engineering staffs to
determine if impairment has occurred. Nonproducing leases are
evaluated based on the progress of the Company’s
exploration program to date. Exploration costs are transferred
to the DD&A pool upon completion of drilling individual
wells. If geological and geophysical (G&G) costs cannot be
associated with specific properties, they are included in the
amortization base as incurred. The amount of any impairment is
transferred to the capitalized costs being



amortized (the DD&A pool) or a charge is made against
earnings for those international operations where a proved
reserve base has not yet been established. Impairments
transferred to the DD&A pool increase the DD&A rate for
that country. For international operations where a reserve base
has not yet been established, all costs associated with a
prospect or play would be considered quarterly for impairment
upon full evaluation of such prospect or play. This evaluation
considers among other factors, seismic data, requirements to
relinquish acreage, drilling results, remaining time in the
commitment period, remaining capital plans, and political,
economic, and market conditions.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

We routinely assess the recoverability of all material trade and
other receivables to determine their collectibility. Many of our
receivables are from joint interest owners on properties we
operate. Thus, we may have the ability to withhold future
revenue disbursements to recover any non-payment of joint
interest billings. Our crude oil and natural gas receivables are
typically collected within two months. We accrue a reserve on a
receivable when, based on the judgment of management, it is
probable that a receivable will not be collected and the amount
of any reserve may be reasonably estimated.

Beginning in 2001, we experienced a gradual decline in the
timeliness of receipts from EGPC for our Egyptian oil and gas
sales. Deteriorating economic conditions in Egypt lessened the
availability of U.S. dollars, resulting in a one to two
month delay in receipts from EGPC. During 2005, we experienced
wide variability in the timing of cash receipts, but our past
due balance improved as of December 31, 2005. We have not
established a reserve for these Egyptian receivables because we
continue to get paid, albeit late, and have no indication that
we will not be able to collect our receivable.

Asset Retirement Obligation

The Company has significant obligations to remove tangible
equipment and restore land or seabed at the end of oil and gas
production operations. Apache’s removal and restoration
obligations are primarily associated with plugging and
abandoning wells and removing and disposing of offshore oil and
gas platforms. Estimating the future restoration and removal
costs is difficult and requires management to make estimates and
judgments because most of the removal obligations are many years
in the future and contracts and regulations often have vague
descriptions of what constitutes removal. Asset removal
technologies and costs are constantly changing, as are
regulatory, political, environmental, safety and public
relations considerations. Prior to 2003, under the full-cost
method of accounting, as described in the preceding critical
accounting policy sections, the estimated undiscounted costs of
the abandonment obligations, net of the value of salvage, were
included as a component of our depletion base and expensed over
the production life of the oil and gas properties.

In 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143,
“Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations.” Apache
adopted this statement effective January 1, 2003, as
discussed in Note 4, Asset Retirement Obligation of
Item 15 of this
Form

10-K.

SFAS No. 143 significantly changed the method of
accruing for costs an entity is legally obligated to incur
related to the retirement of fixed assets (“asset
retirement obligations” or “ARO”). Primarily, the
new statement requires the Company to record a separate
liability for the discounted present value of the Company’s
asset retirement obligations, with an offsetting increase to the
related oil and gas properties on the balance sheet. As such,
beginning in 2003 our depletion expense is reduced since we will
deplete a discounted ARO rather than the undiscounted value
previously depleted in our oil and gas property base. The lower
depletion expense under SFAS No. 143 is offset,
however, by accretion expense, which reflects increases in the
discounted asset retirement obligation over time.

Inherent in the present value calculation are numerous
assumptions and judgments including the ultimate settlement
amounts, inflation factors, credit adjusted discount rates,
timing of settlement, and changes in the legal, regulatory,
environmental and political environments. To the extent future
revisions to these assumptions impact the present value of the
existing Asset Retirement Obligation liability, a corresponding
adjustment is made to the oil and gas property balance.



Income Taxes

Our oil and gas exploration and production operations are
currently located in seven countries. As a result, we are
subject to taxation on our income in numerous jurisdictions. We
record deferred tax assets and liabilities to account for the
expected future tax consequences of events that have been
recognized in our financial statements and our tax returns. We
routinely assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets.
If we conclude that it is more likely than not that some portion
or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized under
accounting standards, the tax asset would be reduced by a
valuation allowance. We consider future taxable income in making
such assessments. Numerous judgments and assumptions are
inherent in the determination of future taxable income,
including factors such as future operating conditions
(particularly as related to prevailing oil and gas prices).

The Company regularly assesses and, if required, establishes
accruals for tax contingencies that could result from
assessments of additional tax by taxing jurisdictions in
countries where the Company operates. Tax reserves have been
established, and include any related interest, despite the
belief by the Company that certain tax positions have been fully
documented in the Company’s tax returns. These reserves are
subject to a significant amount of judgment and are reviewed and
adjusted on a periodic basis in light of changing facts and
circumstances considering the progress of ongoing tax audits,
case law and any new legislation. The Company believes that the
reserves established are adequate in relation to the potential
for any additional tax assessments.

Derivatives

Apache uses derivative contracts on a limited basis to manage
its exposure to oil and gas price volatility and foreign
currency volatility. The Company accounts for the contracts in
accordance with SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.” The
estimated fair values of Apache’s derivative contracts
within the scope of this statement are carried on the
Company’s consolidated balance sheet. For oil and gas
derivative contracts designated and qualifying as cash flow
hedges, realized gains and losses are recognized in oil and gas
production revenues when the forecasted transaction occurs. For
foreign currency forward contracts designated as qualifying as
cash flow hedges, realized gains and losses are generally
recognized in lease operating expense when the forecasted
transaction occurs. SFAS No. 133 requires that gains
and losses from the change in fair value of derivative
instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting be

“marked-to

-market”
and reported in current period income, rather than in the period
in which the hedged transaction is settled. Realized gains and
losses on derivative contracts not qualifying as cash flow
hedges are reported in “Other” under “Revenues
and Other” of the Statement of Consolidated Operations.

The fair value estimate of Apache’s derivative contracts
requires judgment; however, the Company’s derivative
contracts are either exchange traded or valued by reference to
commodities and currencies that are traded in highly liquid
markets. As such, the ultimate fair value is determined by
references to readily available public data. Option valuations
are verified against independent third-party quotations. See
Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about
Market Risk, “Commodity Risk” in this
Form

10-K

for
commodity price sensitivity information and the Company’s
policies related to the use of derivatives.

Stock-Based Compensation

During 2002, Apache began modifying its stock compensation plans
in order to reflect the cost of these plans in the Statement of
Consolidated Operations. As part of this effort, Apache began
issuing stock appreciation rights and restricted stock and,
effective January 1, 2003, adopted the expense provisions
of SFAS No. 123 “Accounting for Stock Based
Compensation,” as amended, on a prospective basis for all
stock options granted under the Company’s existing option
plans. Consistent with the Company’s desire to reflect the
ultimate cost of stock compensation plans on the income
statement, Apache early adopted the provisions of
SFAS No. 123-R “Share-Based Payment” upon
the FASB’s issuance of the revised statement in the fourth
quarter 2004.

Upon adoption of SFAS No. 123-R, all stock based
compensation awards that vested during 2004 are now reflected in
the Company’s net income for the year. Awards that vested
in prior years continue to be



reflected in the income statement under the accounting
guidelines in place for the applicable year. Awards granted in
future periods will be valued on the date of grant and expensed
using a straight-line basis over the required service period.
Pro-forma income statement presentations have been provided for
in Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of
Item 15 in this
Form

10-K

to
present a comparative basis of all plans outstanding during the
reported periods.

The Company chose to adopt the statement under the
“Modified Retrospective” approach as prescribed under
SFAS No. 123-R. Under this approach, the Company is
required to expense all options and stock-based compensation
that vested during the year of adoption based on the fair value
of the stock compensation determined on the date of grant. Had
the Company not early adopted SFAS No. 123-R under
this transition approach, 2004 net income would have been
lower by $89 million ($56 million after tax) or
$.17 per diluted share. Normally, net income would be
negatively impacted by adopting SFAS No. 123-R under
this transition method. However, the Company’s Share
Appreciation Plan, which triggered in 2004, has a fair market
value-based expense recorded under the provisions of
SFAS No. 123-R that is substantially less than the
intrinsic value cost that would have been recorded under the
provisions of APB Opinion No. 25. Please refer to
Note 8, Capital Stock of Item 15 of this
Form

10-K

for a
detailed description of the Share Appreciation Plan and costs
associated with our stock compensation plans.

Also, inherent in expensing stock options and other stock-based
compensation under SFAS No. 123-R are several
judgments and estimates that must be made. These include
determining the underlying valuation methodology for stock
compensation awards and the related inputs utilized in each
valuation, such as the Company’s expected stock price
volatility, expected term of the employee option, expected
dividend yield, the expected risk-free interest rate, the
underlying stock price and the exercise price of the option.
Changes to these assumptions could result in different
valuations for individual share awards and will be carefully
scrutinized for each material grant. For option valuations,
Apache utilizes the Black-Scholes option pricing model, however,
the Company does run lattice models to verify that the
assumptions used are reasonable. For valuing the Share
Appreciation Awards, the Company utilizes a Monte Carlo
simulation model developed by a third party.

ITEM 7A.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Commodity Risk

The major market risk exposure is in the pricing applicable to
our oil and gas production. Realized pricing is primarily driven
by the prevailing worldwide price for crude oil and spot prices
applicable to our United States and Canadian natural gas
production. Prices received for oil and gas production have been
and remain volatile and unpredictable. Monthly oil price
realizations, including the impact of fixed-price contracts and
hedges, ranged from a low of $42.63 per barrel to a high of
$61.31 per barrel during 2005. Average gas price
realizations, including the impact of fixed-price contracts and
hedges, ranged from a monthly low of $5.16 per Mcf to a
monthly high of $8.02 per Mcf during the same period. Based
on the Company’s 2005 worldwide oil production levels, a
$1.00 per barrel change in the weighted-average realized
price of oil would increase or decrease revenues by
$85 million. Based on the Company’s 2005 worldwide gas
production levels, a $.10 per Mcf change in the
weighted-average realized price of gas would increase or
decrease revenues by $46 million.

If oil and gas prices decline significantly, even if only for a
short period of time, it is possible that non-cash write-downs
of our oil and gas properties could occur under the full-cost
accounting method allowed by the Securities Exchange Commission
(SEC). Under these rules, we review the carrying value of our
proved oil and gas properties each quarter on a
country-by-country basis to ensure that capitalized costs of
proved oil and gas properties, net of accumulated depreciation,
depletion and amortization, and deferred income taxes do not
exceed the “ceiling.” This ceiling is the present
value of estimated future net cash flows from proved oil and gas
reserves, discounted at 10 percent, plus the lower of cost
or fair value of unproved properties included in the costs being
amortized, net of related tax effects. If capitalized costs
exceed this ceiling, the excess is charged to additional
DD&A expense. The calculation of estimated future net cash
flows is based on the prices for crude oil and natural gas in
effect on the last day of each fiscal quarter except for volumes
sold under



long-term contracts. Write-downs required by these rules do not
impact cash flow from operating activities; however, as
discussed above, sustained low prices would have a material
adverse effect on future cash flows.

We periodically enter into hedging activities on a portion of
our projected oil and natural gas production through a variety
of financial and physical arrangements intended to support oil
and natural gas prices at targeted levels and to manage our
overall exposure to oil and gas price fluctuations. Apache may
use futures contracts, swaps, options and fixed-price physical
contracts to hedge its commodity prices. Realized gains or
losses from the Company’s price risk management activities
are recognized in oil and gas production revenues when the
associated production occurs. Apache does not generally hold or
issue derivative instruments for trading purposes. As indicated
in Note 3, Hedging and Derivative Instruments of
Item 15 in this
Form

10-K,

the
Company entered into several derivative positions in conjunction
with our 2003 and 2004 acquisitions. These positions were
entered into to preserve our strong financial position in a
period of cyclically high oil and gas prices and were designated
as cash flow hedges of anticipated production.

Apache has historically only hedged long-term oil and gas prices
related to a portion of its expected production associated with
acquisitions. As such, the Company’s use of hedging
activity remains at a correspondingly low level. In 2005,
financial derivative hedges represented approximately nine
percent of the total worldwide natural gas production and six
percent of the total worldwide crude oil production. Heading
into 2006, hedges in place are entirely related to
U.S. production and will represent approximately seven
percent of worldwide production for natural gas and crude oil.

On December 31, 2005, the Company had open natural gas
derivative positions with a fair value of $(260) million. A
10 percent increase in natural gas prices would reduce the
fair value by approximately $64 million, while a
10 percent decrease in prices would increase the fair value
by approximately $63 million. The Company also had open
crude oil derivative positions with a fair value of
$(148) million. A 10 percent change in oil prices
would change the fair value by plus or minus $37 million.
These fair value changes assume volatility based on prevailing
market parameters at December 31, 2005. See Note 3,
Hedging and Derivative Instruments of Item 15 in this
Form

10-K

for
notional volumes and terms associated with the Company’s
derivative contracts.

Apache conducts its risk management activities for its
commodities under the controls and governance of its risk
management policy. The Risk Management Committee, comprising the
Chief Financial Officer, Controller, Treasurer and other key
members of Apache’s management, approve and oversee these
controls, which have been implemented by designated members of
the treasury department. The treasury and accounting departments
also provide separate checks and reviews on the results of
hedging activities. Controls for our commodity risk management
activities include limits on credit, limits on volume,
segregation of duties, delegation of authority and a number of
other policy and procedural controls.

Governmental Risk

Apache’s U.S. and international operations have been, and
at times in the future may be, affected by political
developments and by federal, state and local laws and
regulations impacting production levels, taxes, environmental
requirements and other assessments including a potential
Windfall Profits Tax.

The Company anticipates that announced changes to the taxation
scheme in the North Sea will impact that region’s results.
Primarily, the corporate tax rate in the North Sea is expected
to increase 10 percent to an effective rate of
50 percent. Once the announcement is ratified, the new rate
change will be effective as of January 1, 2006.

Weather and Climate Risk

Demand for oil and natural gas are, to a significant degree,
dependent on weather and climate, which impacts the price we
receive for the commodities we produce. In addition, our
exploration and development activities and equipment can be
adversely affected by severe weather, such as hurricanes in the
Gulf of Mexico, which may cause a loss of production from
temporary cessation of activity or lost or damaged



equipment. While our planning for normal climatic variation,
insurance program, and emergency recovery plans mitigate the
effects of the weather, not all such effects can be predicted,
eliminated or insured against.

In response to large underwriting losses caused by Hurricanes
Katrina and Rita, the insurance industry has reduced capacity
for windstorm damage and substantially increased premium rates.
As a result, there is no assurance that Apache will be able to
arrange insurance to cover fully its Gulf of Mexico exposures at
a reasonable cost when the current policies expire.

Foreign Currency Risk

The Company’s cash flow stream relating to certain
international operations is based on the U.S. dollar
equivalent of cash flows measured in foreign currencies. In
Australia, oil production is sold under U.S. dollar
contracts and gas production is sold under fixed-price
Australian dollar contracts. Over half the costs incurred for
Australian operations are paid in Australian dollars. In Canada,
the majority of oil and gas production is sold under Canadian
dollar contracts. The majority of the costs incurred are paid in
Canadian dollars. The North Sea production is sold under
U.S. dollar contracts and the majority of costs incurred
are paid in British pounds. In contrast, all oil and gas
production in Egypt is sold for U.S. dollars and the
majority of the costs incurred are denominated in
U.S. dollars. Revenue and disbursement transactions
denominated in Australian dollars, Canadian dollars and British
pounds are converted to U.S. dollar equivalents based on
the exchange rate as of the transaction date.

A 10 percent strengthening of the Australian and Canadian
dollars and the British pound as of December 31, 2005 would
result in a foreign currency net loss of approximately
$128 million. This is primarily driven from foreign
currency effects on the Company’s deferred tax liability
positions in Canada and Australia. The Company began hedging a
portion of its foreign exchange risk associated with lease
operating expenditures in 2004. The Company’s treasury
department administers this hedging program. The Company did not
have any open hedging positions associated with lease operating
expenditures as of December 31, 2005. For information on
open derivative contracts, please see Note 3, Hedging and
Derivative Instruments of Item 15 in this
Form

10-K.

Interest Rate Risk

As of December 31, 2005, the Company had no interest rate
risk exposure since the Company did not have any floating-rate
debt.

Forward-Looking Statements and Risk

Certain statements in this report, including statements of the
future plans, objectives, and expected performance of the
Company, are forward-looking statements that are dependent upon
certain events, risks and uncertainties that may be outside the
Company’s control, and which could cause actual results to
differ materially from those anticipated. Some of these include,
but are not limited to, capital expenditure projections, the
market prices of oil and gas, economic and competitive
conditions, inflation rates, legislative and regulatory changes,
financial market conditions, political and economic
uncertainties of foreign governments, future business decisions
and other uncertainties, all of which are difficult to predict.

There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating
quantities of proved oil and gas reserves and in projecting
future rates of production and the timing of development
expenditures. The total amount or timing of actual future
production may vary significantly from reserve and production
estimates. The drilling of exploratory wells can involve
significant risks, including those related to timing, success
rates and cost overruns. Lease and rig availability, complex
geology and other factors can affect these risks. Although
Apache makes use of futures contracts, swaps, options and
fixed-price physical contracts to mitigate risk, fluctuations in
oil and gas prices, or a prolonged continuation of low prices
may substantially adversely affect the Company’s financial
position, results of operations and cash flows.

REPORT OF MANAGEMENT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL
REPORTING

Management of the Company is responsible for the preparation and
integrity of the consolidated financial statements appearing in
this annual report on
Form

10-K.

The
financial statements were prepared in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States and include
amounts that are based on management’s best estimates and
judgments.

Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and
maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting
as such term is defined in
Rule

13a-15(f)

under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange
Act”). The Company’s internal control over financial
reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
the consolidated financial statements. Our internal control over
financial reporting is supported by a program of internal audits
and appropriate reviews by management, written policies and
guidelines, careful selection and training of qualified
personnel and a written code of business conduct adopted by our
Company’s Board of Directors, applicable to all Company
Directors and all officers and employees of our Company and
subsidiaries.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements and
even when determined to be effective, can only provide
reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement
preparation and presentation. Also, projections of any
evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the
risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in
conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or
procedures may deteriorate.

Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2005. In making this assessment, management
used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework.

Based
on our assessment, management believes that the Company
maintained effective internal control over financial reporting
as of December 31, 2005.

The Company’s independent auditors, Ernst & Young
LLP, a registered public accounting firm, are appointed by the
Audit Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors.
Ernst & Young LLP have audited and reported on the
consolidated financial statements of Apache Corporation and
subsidiaries, management’s assessment of the effectiveness
of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting
and the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control
over financial reporting. The reports of the independent
auditors follow this report on pages

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Apache Corporation:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
Apache Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2005
and 2004, and the related consolidated statements of operations,
shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended December 31, 2005. These
consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the
Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our
audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
financial position of Apache Corporation and subsidiaries as of
December 31, 2005 and 2004 and the consolidated results of
their operations and their cash flows for each of the three
years ended December 31, 2005, in conformity with
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

As described in Note 8 to the consolidated financial
statements, during 2004, the Company adopted the modified
prospective provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards (“SFAS”) No. 123(revised),
“Share-Based Payment.” In addition, as described in
Notes 1 and 4, effective January 1, 2003, the
Company adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 143,
“Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations” and the
prospective provisions of SFAS No. 148,
“Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation —
Transition and Disclosure.”

We also have audited in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
effectiveness of Apache Corporation and subsidiaries’
internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2005, based on criteria established in
Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
and our report dated March 10, 2006 expressed an
unqualified opinion thereon.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Apache Corporation:

We have audited management’s assessment, included in the
accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over
Financial Reporting, that Apache Corporation and subsidiaries
maintained effective internal control over financial reporting
as of December 31, 2005, based on criteria established in
Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
(the COSO criteria). Apache Corporation’s management is
responsible for maintaining effective internal control over
financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness
of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an
opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal
control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design
and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that Apache
Corporation and subsidiaries maintained effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005,
is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on the COSO
criteria. Also, in our opinion, Apache Corporation and
subsidiaries maintained, in all material respects, effective
internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2005, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
consolidated balance sheets of Apache Corporation and
subsidiaries as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the
related consolidated statements of operations,
shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended December 31, 2005 and our report
dated March 10, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion
thereon.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Nature of Operations —

Apache
Corporation (Apache or the Company) is an independent energy
company that explores for, develops and produces natural gas,
crude oil and natural gas liquids. The Company’s North
American exploration and production activities are divided into
two U.S. operating regions (Central and Gulf Coast) and a
Canadian region. Approximately 69 percent of the
Company’s proved reserves are located in North America.
Outside of North America, Apache has exploration and production
interests in Egypt, offshore Western Australia, offshore the
United Kingdom in the North Sea (North Sea), offshore The
People’s Republic of China (China) and in Argentina. In
2003, we ceased operations in Poland.

The Company’s future financial condition and results of
operations will depend upon prices received for its oil and
natural gas production and the costs of finding, acquiring,
developing and producing reserves. The vast majority of the
Company’s production is sold under market-sensitive
contracts. Prices for oil and natural gas are subject to
fluctuations in response to changes in supply, market
uncertainty and a variety of other factors beyond the
Company’s control. These factors include worldwide
political instability (especially in the Middle East), the
foreign supply of oil and natural gas, the price of foreign
imports, the level of consumer demand, and the price and
availability of alternative fuels.

All share and per share information in these financial
statements and notes thereto has been restated to reflect the
two-for-one stock split in 2003. See Note 8, Capital Stock,
for further discussion.

Principles of Consolidation —

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of Apache and its subsidiaries after elimination of
intercompany balances and transactions. The Company consolidates
all investments in which the Company, either through direct or
indirect ownership, has more than a 50 percent voting
interest. In addition, Apache consolidates all variable interest
entities where it is the primary beneficiary. The Company’s
interests in oil and gas exploration and production ventures and
partnerships are proportionately consolidated.

Cash Equivalents —

The Company considers
all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with an original
maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. These
investments are carried at cost, which approximates fair value.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts —

The
Company routinely assesses the recoverability of all material
trade and other receivables to determine their collectibility.
Many of Apache’s receivables are from joint interest owners
on properties which Apache operates. Thus, Apache may have the
ability to withhold future revenue disbursements to recover any
non-payment of joint interest billings. Generally, the
Company’s crude oil and natural gas receivables are
collected within two months. However, beginning in 2001, the
Company experienced a gradual decline in the timeliness of
receipts from the Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation (EGPC).
Deteriorating economic conditions in Egypt lessened the
availability of U.S. dollars, resulting in an additional
one to two month delay in receipts from EGPC. During 2005, we
experienced wide variability in the timing of cash receipts, but
our past due balance improved at year-end. We have not
established a reserve for these Egyptian receivables because we
continue to get paid, albeit late, and we have no indication
that we will not be able to collect our receivable.

The Company accrues a reserve on a receivable when, based on the
judgment of management, it is probable that a receivable will
not be collected and the amount of any reserve may be reasonably
estimated. As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, the Company
had an allowance for doubtful accounts of $22 million.

Marketable Securities —

The Company
accounts for investments in debt and equity securities in
accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
(SFAS) No. 115, “Accounting for Certain
Investments in Debt and Equity Securities.” Investments in
debt securities classified as “held to maturity” are
recorded at amortized cost. Investments in debt and equity
securities classified as “available for sale” are
recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses
recognized in other comprehensive income, net of

APACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

income taxes. The Company utilizes the average-cost method in
computing realized gains and losses, which are included in
Revenues and Other in the consolidated statements of operations.

Inventories —

Inventories consist
principally of tubular goods and production equipment, stated at
the lower of weighted-average cost or market, and oil produced
but not sold, stated at the lower of cost (a combination of
production costs and depreciation, depletion and amortization
(DD&A) expense) or market.

Property and Equipment —

The Company
uses the full-cost method of accounting for its investment in
oil and gas properties. Under this method, the Company
capitalizes all acquisition, exploration and development costs
incurred for the purpose of finding oil and gas reserves,
including salaries, benefits and other internal costs directly
attributable to these activities. Historically, total
capitalized internal costs in any given year have not been
material to total oil and gas costs capitalized in such year.
Apache capitalized $141 million, $107 million and
$65 million of these internal costs in 2005, 2004 and 2003,
respectively. Costs associated with production and general
corporate activities, however, are expensed in the period
incurred. Interest costs related to unproved properties and
properties under development are also capitalized to oil and gas
properties. The Company also includes the present value of its
dismantlement, restoration and abandonment costs within the
capitalized oil and gas property balance (see Note 4, Asset
Retirement Obligation). Unless a significant portion of the
Company’s proved reserve quantities in a particular country
are sold (greater than 25 percent), proceeds from the sale
of oil and gas properties are accounted for as a reduction to
capitalized costs, and gains and losses are not recognized.

Apache computes the DD&A of oil and gas properties on a
quarterly basis using the

unit-of

-production
method based upon production and estimates of proved reserve
quantities. Unproved properties are excluded from the
amortizable base until evaluated. The cost of exploratory dry
wells is transferred to proved properties and thus subject to
amortization immediately upon determination that a well is dry
in those countries where proved reserves exist. In countries
where the Company has not booked proved reserves, all costs
associated with a prospect or play are considered quarterly for
impairment upon full evaluation of such prospect or play. This
evaluation considers among other factors, seismic data,
requirements to relinquish acreage, drilling results, remaining
time in the commitment period, remaining capital plans, and
political, economic, and market conditions. If geological and
geophysical (G&G) costs cannot be associated with specific
properties, they are included in the amortization base as
incurred.

In performing its quarterly ceiling test, the Company limits, on
a country-by-country basis, the capitalized costs of proved oil
and gas properties, net of accumulated DD&A and deferred
income taxes, to the estimated future net cash flows from proved
oil and gas reserves discounted at 10 percent, net of
related tax effects, plus the lower of cost or fair value of
unproved properties included in the costs being amortized. If
capitalized costs exceed this limit, the excess is charged as
additional DD&A expense. The Company calculates future net
cash flows by applying

end-of

-the-period
prices except in those instances where future natural gas or oil
sales are covered by physical contract terms providing for
higher or lower amounts. Also, included in the estimated future
net cash flows are Canadian provincial tax credits expected to
be realized beyond the date at which the legislation, under its
provisions, could be repealed. To date, the Canadian provincial
governments have not indicated an intention to repeal this
legislation. See Note 14, Supplemental Oil and Gas
Disclosures (Unaudited) “Future Net Cash Flows” for a
discussion on calculation of estimated future net cash flows.

In September 2004, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin
(SAB) No. 106 to provide guidance on how asset
retirement obligations should impact the calculation of the
ceiling test limitation on the amount of properties that can be
capitalized. The guidance states that because asset retirement
obligation costs are reflected in the property balance, the
future net cash flow calculation should omit the expected
abandonment costs to provide for a comparable basis. Apache
previously included abandonment costs in its future net cash
flow calculation, but adjusted the capitalized amounts by the
accrued abandonment obligation. The Company’s adoption of
SAB No. 106 did not have a material impact on
financial results.

APACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Given the volatility of oil and gas prices, it is reasonably
possible that the Company’s estimate of discounted future
net cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves could change in
the near term. If oil and gas prices decline significantly, even
if only for a short period of time, it is possible that
write-downs of oil and gas properties could occur.

Unproved properties are assessed quarterly for possible
impairments or reductions in value. If a reduction in value has
occurred, the impairment is transferred to proved properties.
For international operations where a reserve base has not yet
been established, the impairment is charged to earnings. Apache
began impairing its unproved property costs in Poland in 2001,
impairing $20 million ($12 million after tax) in 2002
and the remaining $13 million ($8 million after tax)
in 2003.

Buildings, equipment and gas gathering, transmission and
processing facilities are depreciated on a straight-line basis
over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from
three to 20 years. Accumulated depreciation for these
assets totaled $467 million and $380 million at
December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Goodwill —

Goodwill totaled
$189 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004,
representing the excess of the purchase price over the estimated
fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the
Fletcher Challenge Energy (Fletcher) and Repsol YPF (Repsol)
2001 acquisitions. Approximately $103 million and
$86 million of goodwill remain in Canada and Egypt,
respectively. Apache deemed the geographic areas to be the
reporting unit. Goodwill of each reporting unit is tested for
impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if an event
occurs or circumstances change that would reduce the fair value
of the reporting unit below its carrying amount. No impairment
of goodwill was recognized during 2005, 2004 and 2003.

Accounts Payable —

Included in accounts
payable at December 31, 2005 and 2004, are liabilities of
approximately $125 million and $116 million,
respectively, representing the amount by which checks issued,
but not presented to the Company’s banks for collection,
exceeded balances in applicable bank accounts.

Revenue Recognition —

Oil and gas
revenues are recognized when production is sold to a purchaser
at a fixed or determinable price, when delivery has occurred and
title has transferred, and if collectibility of the revenue is
probable. Cash received relating to future revenues is deferred
and recognized when all revenue recognition criteria are met.

Apache uses the sales method of accounting for gas production
imbalances. The volumes of gas sold may differ from the volumes
to which Apache is entitled based on its interests in the
properties. These differences create imbalances that are
recognized as a liability only when the properties’
estimated remaining reserves net to Apache will not be
sufficient to enable the underproduced owner to recoup its
entitled share through production. The Company’s recorded
liability is reflected in other non-current liabilities. No
receivables are recorded for those wells where Apache has taken
less than its share of production. Gas imbalances are reflected
as adjustments to proved gas reserves and future cash flows in
the unaudited supplemental oil and gas disclosures.

The Company’s Egyptian operations are conducted pursuant to
production sharing contracts under which contractor partners pay
all operating and capital costs for exploring and developing the
concessions. A percentage of the production, usually up to
40 percent, is available to the contractor partners to
recover all operating and capital costs. The balance of the
production is split among the contractor partners and EGPC on a
contractually defined basis.

Apache began marketing its U.S. natural gas production in
July 2003. As the Company’s production fluctuates because
of operational issues, it is occasionally necessary for the
Company to purchase gas (“third party gas”) to fulfill
its sales obligations and commitments. Both the costs and sales
proceeds of this third-party gas are reported on a net basis in
oil and gas production revenues. The costs of third-party gas
netted

APACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

against the related sales proceeds totaled $158 million,
$107 million and $41 million, for 2005, 2004 and 2003,
respectively.

Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities —

Apache periodically enters into derivative contracts to
manage its exposure to foreign currency risk and commodity price
risk. These derivative contracts, which are generally placed
with major financial institutions that the Company believes are
minimal credit risks, may take the form of forward contracts,
futures contracts, swaps or options. The oil and gas reference
prices upon which the commodity derivative contracts are based,
reflect various market indices that have a high degree of
historical correlation with actual prices received by the
Company for its oil and gas production.

Apache accounts for its derivative instruments in accordance
with SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities,” as amended.
SFAS No. 133 establishes accounting and reporting
standards requiring that all derivative instruments, other than
those that meet the normal purchases and sales exception, be
recorded on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability
measured at fair value (which is generally based on information
obtained from independent parties). SFAS No. 133 also
requires that changes in fair value be recognized currently in
earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met.
Hedge accounting treatment allows unrealized gains and losses on
cash flow hedges to be deferred in other comprehensive income.
Realized gains and losses from the Company’s oil and gas
cash flow hedges, including terminated contracts, are generally
recognized in oil and gas production revenues when the
forecasted transaction occurs. Realized gains and losses on
foreign currency cash flow hedges are generally recognized in
lease operating expense when the forecasted transaction occurs.
Gains and losses from the change in fair value of derivative
instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are
reported in current period income as “other.” If at
any time the likelihood of occurrence of a hedged forecasted
transaction ceases to be “probable,” hedge accounting
under SFAS No. 133 will cease on a prospective basis
and all future changes in the fair value of the derivative will
be recognized directly in earnings. Amounts recorded in other
comprehensive income prior to the change in the likelihood of
occurrence of the forecasted transaction will remain in other
comprehensive income until such time as the forecasted
transaction impacts earnings. If it becomes probable that the
original forecasted production will not occur, then the
derivative gain or loss would be reclassified from accumulated
other comprehensive income into earnings immediately. Hedge
effectiveness is measured at least quarterly based on the
relative changes in fair value between the derivative contract
and the hedged item over time, and any ineffectiveness is
immediately reported under Revenues and Other in the statement
of consolidated operations.

Income Taxes —

We record deferred tax
assets and liabilities to account for the expected future tax
consequences of events that have been recognized in our
financial statements and our tax returns. We routinely assess
the realizability of our deferred tax assets. If we conclude
that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the
deferred tax assets will not be realized under accounting
standards, the tax asset is reduced by a valuation allowance. We
consider future taxable income in making such assessments.
Numerous judgments and assumptions are inherent in the
determination of future taxable income, including factors such
as future operating conditions (particularly as related to
prevailing oil and gas prices).

Earnings from Apache’s international operations are
permanently reinvested; therefore, the Company does not
recognize U.S. deferred taxes on the unremitted earnings of
its international subsidiaries. If it becomes apparent that some
or all of the unremitted earnings will be remitted, the Company
would then reflect taxes on those earnings.

Foreign Currency Translation —

The
U.S. dollar has been determined to be the functional
currency for each of Apache’s international operations. The
functional currency is determined country-by-country based on
relevant facts and circumstances of the cash flows, commodity
pricing environment, and financing arrangements in each country.

F-11


APACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The Company accounts for foreign currency gains and losses in
accordance with SFAS No. 52 “Foreign Currency
Translation.” Foreign currency translation gains and losses
related to deferred taxes are recorded as a component of its
provision for income taxes, while all other foreign currency
gains and losses are reflected in Revenues and Other. The
Company recorded additional deferred tax expense of
$13 million, $58 million and $172 million in
2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively (see Note 6, Income
Taxes). Other foreign currency gains and losses in Revenues and
Other netted to a gain of $11 million in 2005, and losses
of $5 million and $2 million in 2004 and 2003,
respectively.

Prior to October 1, 2002, the Company’s Canadian
subsidiaries’ functional currency was the Canadian dollar.
Translation adjustments resulting from translating the Canadian
subsidiaries’ financial statements into U.S. dollar
equivalents were reported separately and accumulated in other
comprehensive income. Currency translation adjustment held in
other comprehensive income on the balance sheet will remain
there indefinitely unless there is a substantially complete
liquidation of the Company’s Canadian operations.

Insurance Coverage —

The Company carries
property damage insurance of $250 million per insurable
event subject to a $7.5 million deductible per event. The
policy is prorated down if total claims received by the insurer
for a single event exceed $1 billion. As of
December 31, 2005, the Company was advised by its insurance
carrier that total claims for Hurricane Katrina would exceed the
$1 billion limit, reducing the Company’s ultimate
recoveries by approximately 50 percent, or
$125 million. The Company was also advised that as of
December 31, 2005, total estimated claims for Hurricane
Rita would exceed the $1 billion limit, reducing the
Company’s claims for Rita by approximately 20 percent.
Based on current assessments by OIL, the Company expects to
recover from OIL between $225 million and $250 million
for both storms combined. The Company also carries another
$100 million of casualty insurance under a separate
commercial policy. The Company expects to recover the full
$100 million on the commercial policy.

The Company also carries business interruption insurance to
cover deferred and lost oil and natural gas production revenues.
The business interruption insurance begins 60 days after
the occurrence of an insurable event, subject to a daily limit
of $750,000 per event and an aggregate limit of
$150 million. Coverage is based on current market prices
and began October 28, 2005 for shut-in production caused by
Hurricane Katrina and November 22, 2005 for Hurricane Rita.
The Company accrued claims in 2005 totaling $79 million,
with the remainder of the aggregate $150 million limit
available for 2006. Proceeds received from the Business
Interruption Insurance are reflected in “Other” under
“Revenues and Other” on the “Statement of
Consolidated Operations” and are included in cash flows
from operating activities.

Net Income Per Common Share —

The
Company’s basic earnings per share (EPS) amounts have
been computed based on the average number of shares of common
stock outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS reflects the
potential dilution, using the treasury stock method, that could
occur if options were exercised and if restricted stock were
fully vested.

Diluted EPS also includes the impact of unvested Share
Appreciation Plans. For awards in which the share price goals
have already been achieved, shares are included in diluted EPS
using the treasury stock method. For those awards in which the
share price goals have not been achieved, the number of
contingently issuable shares included in the diluted EPS is
based on the number of shares, if any, using the treasury stock
method, that would be issuable if the market price of the
Company’s stock at the end of the reporting period exceeded
the share price goals under the terms of the plan.

Stock-Based Compensation —

On
December 31, 2005, the Company had several stock-based
employee compensation plans, which include the Stock Option
Plans, the Performance Plan, the Share Appreciation Plans and
restricted stock. These plans are defined and described more
fully in Note 8, Capital Stock. The Company accounts for
these plans under the fair value recognition provisions of
SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation,” as amended and revised. Stock compensation
awards granted are valued on the date of grant and are expensed
using a straight-line basis over the required service period.

F-12


APACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

During the fourth quarter of 2004, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 123-R, a
revision to SFAS No. 123, which requires all companies
to expense stock-based compensation. The rule is effective for
the first fiscal year that begins after June 15, 2005.
Apache early adopted this statement in 2004 electing to
transition under the “Modified Retrospective Approach”
as allowed under SFAS No. 123-R. Under this approach,
the Company is required to expense all options and stock-based
compensation that vested in the year of adoption based on the
fair value of the stock compensation determined at the date of
grant. Stock vesting in years prior to 2004 was expensed in
accordance with the rules applied by the Company during such
period. Had the Company not early adopted
SFAS No.

123-R,

net income would have been lower by $89 million
($56 million after tax), or $.17 per share on both a
basic and diluted per share basis. Normally, net income would be
negatively impacted by adopting
SFAS No.

123-R.

However, the Company’s Share Appreciation Plan, which
certain awards were triggered in 2004, has a
fair-market-value-based expense recorded under the provisions of
SFAS No.

123-R

that is substantially less than the intrinsic-value base cost of
approximately $175 million that would have been recorded
under the old APB No. 25 accounting.

In addition to the expensing provisions discussed above,

123-R

requires the Company to begin estimating expected future
forfeitures under each stock compensation plan and to start
valuing the Company’s liability-based compensation plan
(Stock Appreciation Rights) under a fair value approach instead
of the previously applied intrinsic valuation. The effects of
changing the forfeiture estimates on existing stock plans and
the valuation methodology for the Company’s liability plans
resulted in Apache recording a Cumulative Effect of Change in
Accounting Principle of $2.1 million ($1.3 million
after tax).
SFAS No.

123-R

also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of
recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash
flow rather than as an operating cash flow as historically
reported. The Company classified $27 million and
$32 million as financing cash inflows in 2005 and 2004,
respectively, that would have been classified as operating cash
inflows had the Company not adopted the Statement.

For 2003, the Company applied the fair value recognition
provisions of SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock
Based Compensation”, as amended by SFAS No. 148
prospectively to all awards granted, modified, or settled after
January 1, 2003. Therefore, the cost related to stock-based
employee compensation included in the determination of net
income for 2003 is less than that which would have been
recognized if the fair value based method had been applied to
all awards since the original effective date of
SFAS No. 123. The following table illustrates the

been applied to all stock-based compensation.

The stock appreciation rights, described in Note 8, Capital
Stock, are not included in the table above because it is a
cash-based liability plan already reflected in net income
attributable to common stock. Similar to cash-based salaries and
benefits, stock-based compensation directly attributable to
acquisition, exploration and development activities are
capitalized.

Use of Estimates —

The preparation of
financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the U.S., requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities and related disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements,
and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Certain accounting policies involve judgments
and uncertainties to such an extent that there is reasonable
likelihood that materially different amounts could have been
reported under different conditions, or if different assumptions
had been used. Apache evaluates its estimates and assumptions on
a regular basis. The Company bases its estimates on historical
experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be
reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form
the basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets
and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other
sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates and
assumptions used in preparation of its financial statements.
Significant estimates with regard to these financial statements
include the estimate of proved oil and gas reserve quantities
and the related present value of estimated future net cash flows
therefrom. See Note 14, Supplemental Oil and Gas Disclosure
(Unaudited).

Treasury Stock —

The Company follows the
weighted-average-cost method of accounting for treasury stock
transactions.

Impact of Recently Issued Accounting Standards —

On December 21, 2004, the FASB issued Staff
Position

109-1

(FSP
No. 109-1), Application of FASB Statement No. 109
(SFAS No. 109) “Accounting for Income
Taxes,” to the Tax Deduction on Qualified Production
Activities Provided by the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004
(the Act). FSP No. 109-1 clarifies guidance that applies to
the new tax deduction for qualified domestic production
activities. When fully phased-in, the deduction will be up to
nine percent of the lesser of “qualified production
activities income” or taxable income. FSP
No.

109-1

clarifies that the deduction should be accounted for as a
special deduction under SFAS No. 109 and will reduce
tax expense in the period or periods that the amounts are
deductible on the tax return because the deduction is contingent
on performing activities identified in the Act. As a result,
companies qualifying for the special deduction will not have a
one-time adjustment to deferred tax assets and liabilities in
the period the Act is enacted. Tax benefits resulting from the
new deduction are effective for the Company’s fiscal year
ending December 31, 2005. The adoption of FSP
No. 109-1 did not have a material impact on the
Company’s financial statements.

In March 2005, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation
Number 47 (FIN No. 47), “Accounting for
Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations”. The
interpretation clarifies the requirement to record abandonment
liabilities stemming from legal obligations when the retirement
depends on a conditional future event. FIN No. 47
requires that the uncertainty about the timing or method of
settlement of a conditional retirement obligation be factored
into the measurement of the liability when sufficient
information exists. FIN No. 47 is effective for fiscal
years ending after December 15, 2005 and application of the
interpretation did not change how abandonment obligations are
currently calculated by the Company.

In June 2005, the FASB ratified the consensus in Emerging Issue
Task Force (EITF) Issue
Number

04-5,

“Determining Whether a General Partner, or the General
Partners as a Group, Controls a Limited Partnership or Similar
Entity When the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights”. EITF
Issue
Number

states
that the general partner in a limited partnership is presumed to
control the partnership and must consolidate the entity on its
financial statements. The presumption of control and
consolidation requirement may be overcome if the limited
partners have substantive participating rights or have the
ability to effectively liquidate the partnership. Application of
this statement did not impact the Company’s consolidated
financial statements.

In September 2005, the EITF reached a consensus on Issue
No.

04-13,

“Accounting for Purchases and Sales of Inventory with the
Same Counterparty,” concluding that purchases and sales of
inventory with the same party in the same line of business
should be accounted for as a single non-monetary exchange, if
entered into in contemplation of one another. Apache presents
such purchase and sale activities related to its marketing
activities on a net basis in its Statement of Consolidated
Operations. The consensus reached on EITF Issue No. 04-13
did not have any impact on the Company’s consolidated
financial statements.

ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES

Subsequent Acquisitions

Amerada Hess

On January 5, 2006 the Company completed its purchase of
Amerada Hess’s interest in eight fields located in the
Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico for
$269 million. Apache estimates that these fields had proved
reserves of 27 million barrels of liquid hydrocarbons and
27 billion cubic feet of natural gas as of year-end 2005.
The Company had previously announced on October 13, 2005
that it had agreed to purchase Amerada Hess’s interest for
$404 million. The number of properties involved and price
were reduced as a result of third parties exercising their
preferential rights.

F-15


APACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

On January 6, 2006 the Company completed the sale of its
55 percent interest in the deepwater section of
Egypt’s West Mediterranean Concession to Amerada Hess for
$413 million. Apache first announced this transaction on
October 13, 2005. Apache did not have any oil and gas
reserves recorded for these properties at year-end 2005.

Pioneer Natural Resources

On January 17, 2006, we announced plans to increase greatly
our holdings in Argentina by agreeing to buy Pioneer’s
Argentina operations. The transaction includes interest in 36
separate blocks on approximately 1.8 million gross acres
located in the Neuquen, Austral and San Jorge Basins. On
January 1, 2006, the properties were producing
approximately 9,000 barrels of liquids and 120 MMcf of
natural gas per day. The Pioneer transaction is expected to
close in late March 2006.

2005 Acquisitions

During 2005, Apache completed numerous minor acquisitions
totaling $39 million. These acquisitions added
approximately 7.8 MMboe to the Company’s proved
reserves.

On May 5, 2005, Apache signed a farm-in agreement with
Exxon Mobil Corporation (ExxonMobil) covering approximately
650,000 acres of undeveloped properties in the Western
Canadian province of Alberta. Under the agreement, Apache is to
drill and operate 145 new wells over a

36-month

period with
upside potential for further drilling. ExxonMobil will retain a
37.5 percent royalty on fee lands and 35 percent of
its working interest on leasehold acreage. The agreement also
allows Apache to test additional horizons on approximately
140,000 acres of property covered in the 2004 farm-in
agreement with ExxonMobil.

2004 Acquisitions

ExxonMobil

During the third quarter of 2004, Apache entered into separate
arrangements with Exxon Mobil Corporation and its affiliates
(ExxonMobil) that provided for property transfers and joint
operating and exploration activity across a broad range of
prospective and mature properties in (1) Western Canada,
(2) West Texas and New Mexico, and (3) onshore
Louisiana and the Gulf of Mexico-Outer Continental Shelf.
Apache’s participation included cash payments of
approximately $347 million, subject to normal post closing
adjustments. The following details these transactions:

ExxonMobil — Western Canada

In August 2004,
Apache signed a farm-in agreement with ExxonMobil covering
approximately 380,000 gross acres of undeveloped properties
in the Western Canadian Province of Alberta. Under the
agreement, Apache has the right to earn acreage sections by
drilling an initial well on each such section. By drilling at
least 250 wells during the initial two year earning period
under the agreement, Apache will receive a one-year extension in
which to earn additional sections. As to any sections earned by
Apache, ExxonMobil will retain a 37.5 percent royalty on
fee lands and 35 percent of its working interest on
leasehold acreage. Under certain circumstances, ExxonMobil has
the right to convert its retained 35 percent working
interest into a 12.5 percent overriding royalty. In
addition, during the term of this agreement, Apache is required
to carry ExxonMobil’s retained working interest with
respect to certain drilling, capping, completion, equipping and
tie-in costs associated with wells drilled on leasehold acreage.

ExxonMobil — West Texas and New Mexico

In
September 2004, Apache acquired interests from ExxonMobil in 23
mature producing oil and gas fields in West Texas and New Mexico
for $318 million. Apache separately contributed
approximately $29 million into a partnership to obtain
additional interests in the properties. ExxonMobil will retain
interests in the properties through the partnership, including
the right to receive, on certain fields, 60 percent of the
oil proceeds above $30 per barrel in 2004, $29 per
barrel in 2005 and $28 per barrel during the period from
2006 thru 2009.

F-16


APACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The partnership is subject to the provisions of FASB
Interpretation 46 “variable interest entities”
(FIN 46). Apache has concluded that it is not the primary
beneficiary of the partnership as defined in that interpretation
and will proportionately consolidate its partnership portion of
the oil and gas properties. Apache’s maximum exposure to
loss as a result of its involvement with the partnership was
$55 million at December 31, 2005. Under the
partnership agreement, the Company’s subsidiaries are also
subject to environmental and legal claims that could arise in
the ordinary course of business. Apache will operate the oil and
gas properties under contract for the partnership.

ExxonMobil — Louisiana and Gulf of Mexico-Outer
Continental Shelf

Also in September 2004, Apache and
ExxonMobil entered into joint exploration agreements to explore
Apache’s acreage in South Louisiana and the Gulf of
Mexico-Outer Continental Shelf. The agreements provide for an
initial term of five years, with the potential for an additional
five years based on expenditures by ExxonMobil. Pursuant to the
agreement covering South Louisiana, Apache leased
50 percent of its interests below certain producing or
productive formations in the acreage to ExxonMobil, subject to
retention of a 20 percent royalty interest. Pursuant to the
agreement covering the Gulf of Mexico-Outer Continental Shelf,
no assignments will be made until a prospect has been proposed
and the initial well has been drilled. Apache will retain all
rights in each prospect above certain producing or productive
formations and further will retain a three percent overriding
royalty interest in any property assigned to ExxonMobil.

Anadarko Petroleum

On August 20, 2004, Apache signed a definitive agreement to
acquire all of Anadarko Petroleum Corporation’s (Anadarko)
Gulf of Mexico-Outer Continental Shelf properties (excluding
certain deepwater properties) for $537 million, subject to
normal post-closing adjustments, including preferential rights.
The transaction was effective as of October 1, 2004, and
included interests in 74 fields covering 232 offshore blocks
(approximately 664,000 acres) and 104 platforms.
Eighty-nine of the blocks were undeveloped at the time of the
acquisition. Apache operates 49 of the fields with approximately
70 percent of the production.

Prior to Apache’s purchase from Anadarko, Morgan Stanley
Capital Group, Inc. (Morgan Stanley) paid Anadarko
$646 million to acquire an overriding royalty interest in
these properties. Anadarko’s sale of an overriding royalty
interest to Morgan Stanley is commonly known in the industry as
a volumetric production payment (VPP), the obligations of which
Apache assumed along with its purchase. Under the terms of the
VPP, Morgan Stanley is to receive a fixed volume of oil and
natural gas production (20 MMboe) over four years beginning
in October 2004. The VPP represents a non-operating interest
that is free of costs incurred for operations and production.
Morgan Stanley is entitled to first production and may receive
up to 90 percent of the production from the assets
encumbered by the VPP, but Morgan Stanley may look only to the
acquired properties for delivery of the scheduled volumes. The
VPP is scheduled to terminate on August 31, 2008, but may
be extended if all scheduled VPP volumes have not been delivered
to Morgan Stanley and the properties are still producing. The
VPP includes restrictions on the Company’s ability to sell
the properties subject to the VPP or resign as operator of VPP
properties it currently operates. Upon termination of the VPP,
all rights, titles and interests revert back to Apache. The
Company does not record the reserves and production volumes
attributable to the VPP.

The $537 million purchase price agreed to in the definitive
agreement was subsequently adjusted for the exercise of
preferential rights by third parties and other normal
post-closing adjustments. After adjusting for these items,
Apache paid $532 million for the properties and recorded
estimated proved reserves of 60 million barrels of oil
equivalent (boe), of which 50 percent was natural gas. In
addition, an $84 million liability for the future cost to
produce and deliver the VPP volumes was recorded by the Company.
This liability will be settled through a reduction of lease
operating expenses as the volumes are produced and delivered to
Morgan Stanley. Apache also recorded abandonment obligations for
the properties of approximately $134 million and other
obligations assumed from Anadarko in the amount of
$27 million. Apache allocated $122 million of the

STATEMENTS — (Continued)

purchase price to unproved property. The purchase price was
funded by borrowings under the Company’s lines of credit
and commercial paper program.

In 2004, the Company also completed other acquisitions for
$73 million. These acquisitions added approximately
11 MMboe to the Company’s proved reserves.

2003 Acquisitions

On January 13, 2003, Apache announced that it had entered
into agreements to purchase producing properties in the North
Sea and Gulf of Mexico from subsidiaries of BP p.l.c.
(BP) for $1.3 billion, with $670 million
allocated to the Gulf of Mexico properties and $630 million
allocated to properties in the North Sea. The properties
included estimated proved reserves of 233.2 million barrels
of oil equivalent (MMboe), 147.6 MMboe located in the North
Sea with the balance in the Gulf of Mexico. Both purchase
agreements were effective as of January 1, 2003. The
exercise of preferential rights by third parties reduced the
purchase price by $73 million and estimated reserves by
9.6 MMboe.

On July 3, 2003, Apache announced that it had completed the
acquisition of producing properties on the outer Continental
Shelf of the Gulf of Mexico from Shell Exploration and
Production Company (Shell) for $200 million, subject to
normal post-closing adjustments, including preferential rights.
The acquisition included interests in 26 fields and interest in
two onshore gas plants, and was effective July 1, 2003.
Apache became operator of 15 of the fields with 91 percent
of the production. At the time of the acquisition, Apache
recorded estimated proved recoverable reserves of
124.6 billion cubic feet (Bcf) of natural gas and
6.6 million barrels of oil. Apache may be required to issue
a letter of credit to BP to cover the present value of related
asset retirement obligations if the rating of the Company’s
senior unsecured debt is lowered by both Moody’s and
Standard and Poor’s from its current ratings of A3 and A-,
respectively. Should this occur, the letter of credit amount
would be 127 million British pounds.

Prior to Apache’s transaction with Shell, Morgan Stanley
paid Shell $300 million to acquire an overriding royalty
interest in a portion of the reserves to be produced and
delivered under a VPP agreement. Under the terms of the VPP
obligation which Apache assumed, Morgan Stanley is to receive a
total of 11.4 MMboe of production from the properties over
the period from August 2003 through October 2007. Morgan Stanley
may receive up to 90 percent of production associated with
Apache’s interest, but may look only to the properties for
delivery of the scheduled volumes. The VPP may be extended
beyond October 2007 if all scheduled VPP volumes have not been
delivered to Morgan Stanley and the acquired properties are
still producing. The VPP represents a non-operating interest
that is free of all costs related to operations and production.
As a result of this VPP obligation, Apache assumed and recorded
a $60 million liability for the future cost to produce and
deliver volumes subject to the VPP. This liability is being
settled through a reduction of lease operating expenses as the
volumes are produced and delivered to Morgan Stanley. Apache
does not record the reserves or production attributable to the
VPP volumes. Apache’s purchase price was funded by
borrowings under the Company’s lines of credit and
commercial paper program.

In 2003, the Company also completed other acquisitions for
$126 million. These acquisitions added approximately
28 MMboe to the Company’s proved reserves.

The following unaudited pro forma information shows the effect
on the Company’s consolidated results of operations as if
the acquisition from BP occurred on January 1, 2003. The
pro forma information includes numerous assumptions, and is not
necessarily indicative of future results of operations:

Pro forma shares assume the issuance of 19.8 million common
    shares as of January 1, 2003.

Each transaction described above has been accounted for using
the purchase method of accounting and has been included in the
consolidated financial statements of Apache since the date of
acquisition.

Divestitures

During 2005, Apache also sold marginal properties containing
11.8 MMboe of proved reserves, for $80 million. Apache
used the sales proceeds to reduce bank debt.

During 2004, Apache sold marginal properties containing
..5 MMboe of proved reserves, for $4 million. Apache
used the sales proceeds to reduce bank debt.

During 2003, Apache sold marginal properties containing
6.9 MMboe of proved reserves, for $59 million. Apache
used the sales proceeds to reduce bank debt.

HEDGING AND DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

Apache uses a variety of strategies to manage its exposure to
fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas commodity prices. As
established by the Company’s hedging policy, Apache
primarily enters into cash flow hedges in connection with
selected acquisitions to protect against commodity price
volatility. The success of these acquisitions is significantly
influenced by Apache’s ability to achieve targeted
production at forecasted prices. These hedges effectively reduce
price risk on a portion of the production from the acquisitions.

Apache entered into, and designated as cash flow hedges, various
fixed-price swaps, option collars and puts in conjunction with
the Anadarko and ExxonMobil property acquisitions. These
positions were entered into in accordance with the
Company’s hedging policy and involved counterparties which
were rated A+ or

better. As of December 31, 2005, the outstanding positions
of our natural gas and crude oil cash flow hedges were as
follows:

The natural gas and crude oil positions shown in the above table
are based on the NYMEX index and have been valued using actively
quoted prices and quotes obtained from the counterparties to the
derivative agreements. The above prices represent a weighted
average of several contracts entered into and are on a per MMBtu
or per barrel basis for gas and oil derivatives, respectively.

Apache entered into a separate crude oil physical sales contract
with BP in February 2003, which ended December 31, 2004.
Under the terms of the agreement, Apache physically delivered
22.5 million barrels of crude oil at an average fixed Brent
index price of $23.38 per barrel. The contract was
designated as a normal purchase and sale under
SFAS No. 133 and, therefore, the Company accounted for
the contract under the accrual method.

Apache hedged a portion of its 2005 foreign currency exchange
risk associated with its forecasted Canadian, Australian and
North Sea lease operating expenditures by entering into forward
purchase contracts. The Company purchased a total of
$144 million Canadian dollars at an average exchange rate
of .840, $22 million Australian dollars at an average
exchange rate of .763 and 42 million British pounds at an
average exchange rate of 1.853. The forward contracts matured
from January through December 2005 and caused the Company to
recognize $3 million of increased lease operating expense
during the year.

A reconciliation of the components of accumulated other
comprehensive income (loss) in the statement of consolidated
shareholders’ equity related to Apache’s commodity and
foreign currency derivative activities is presented in the table
below:

Differences between the fair values and the unrealized loss on
derivatives before income taxes recognized in accumulated other
comprehensive income (loss) are primarily related to premiums,
recognition of unrealized gains and losses on certain
derivatives that did not qualify for hedge accounting and hedge
ineffectiveness. Based on applicable market prices as of
year-end 2005, the Company recorded an unrealized loss in other
comprehensive income (loss) of $398 million
($257 million after tax), representing oil and gas
derivative hedges. Any loss will be realized in future earnings
contemporaneously with the related sales of

hedges. Of the $398 million unrealized loss on derivatives
at December 31, 2005, approximately $247 million

materially as a result of changes in market conditions. The
contracts designated as hedges qualified and continue to qualify
for hedge accounting in accordance with SFAS No. 133,
as amended.

ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATION

In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143,
“Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations.”
SFAS No. 143 requires that an asset retirement
obligation (ARO) associated with the retirement of a
tangible long-lived asset be recognized as a liability in the
period in which a legal obligation is incurred and becomes
determinable, with an offsetting increase in the carrying amount
of the associated asset. The cost of the tangible asset,
including the initially recognized ARO, is depleted such that
the cost of the ARO is recognized over the useful life of the
asset. The ARO is recorded at fair value, and accretion expense
is recognized over time as the discounted liability is accreted
to its expected settlement value. The fair value of the ARO is
measured using expected future cash outflows discounted at the
company’s credit-adjusted risk-free interest rate.

The Company adopted SFAS No. 143 on January 1,
2003, and recorded an increase to net oil and gas properties of
$410 million and associated liabilities of
$369 million. These amounts reflect the ARO of the Company
had the provisions of SFAS No. 143 been applied since
inception and resulted in a non-cash cumulative effect increase
to earnings of $27 million ($41 million pre-tax).

Inherent in the fair value calculation of ARO are numerous
assumptions and judgments including the ultimate settlement
amounts, inflation factors, credit adjusted discount rates,
timing of settlement, and changes in the legal, regulatory,
environmental and political environments. To the extent future
revisions to these assumptions impact the fair value of the
existing ARO liability, a corresponding adjustment is made to
the oil and gas property balance.

The following table is a reconciliation of the asset retirement
obligation liability:

In accordance with SFAS No. 143, the Company records
an abandonment liability associated with its oil and gas wells,
facilities and platforms when those assets are placed in
service, which for 2005 and 2004 is reflected above in
liabilities incurred. Liabilities settled relate to individual
properties plugged and abandoned or sold during the period.
Revisions to the estimated liability normally result from annual
reassessments of the expected cash outflows and assumptions
inherent in the ARO calculation. However, during the third
quarter of 2005, nine of the Company’s offshore platforms
in the Gulf of Mexico were toppled, two platforms were severely
damaged and approximately 12 non-operated structures were also
destroyed as a result of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Upon
completing our assessment of hurricane related costs during the
fourth quarter, the Company increased the discounted ARO
liability on the affected properties to $492 million. The
revision reflects increased costs and acceleration in expected
timing to abandon these platforms. Approximately
$94 million has been classified as a current liability.

DEBT

Long-Term Debt

On May 12, 2005, the Company entered into a new
$450 million revolving bank credit facility for the U.S., a
$150 million revolving bank credit facility for Australia
and a $150 million revolving bank credit facility for
Canada. These new facilities replaced the Company’s
existing credit facilities in the same amounts which were
scheduled to mature in June 2007. These new facilities are
scheduled to mature on May 12, 2010. There were no changes
to the Company’s $750 million U.S. credit
facility which matures in May 2009.

As detailed above, the Company currently has $1.5 billion
of syndicated bank credit facilities. The financial covenants of
the credit facilities require the Company to maintain a

debt-to

-capitalization
ratio of not greater than 60 percent at the end of any
fiscal quarter. The negative covenants include restrictions on
the Company’s ability to create liens and security
interests on our assets, with exceptions for liens typically
arising in the oil and gas industry, purchase money liens and
liens arising as a matter of law, such as tax and mechanics
liens. The Company may incur liens on assets located in the
U.S., Canada and Australia of up to five percent of the
Company’s consolidated assets, which approximated
$964 million as of December 31, 2005. There are no
restrictions on incurring liens in countries other than the
U.S., Canada and Australia. There are also restrictions on
Apache’s ability to merge with another entity, unless the
Company is the surviving entity, and a restriction on our
ability to guarantee debt of entities not within our
consolidated group.

There are no clauses in the facilities that permit the lenders
to accelerate payments or refuse to lend based on unspecified
material adverse changes (MAC clauses). The credit facility
agreements do not have drawdown restrictions or prepayment
obligations in the event of a decline in credit ratings.
However, the agreements allow the lenders to accelerate payments
and terminate lending commitments if Apache Corporation, or any
of its U.S., Canadian and Australian subsidiaries, defaults on
any direct payment obligation in excess of $100 million or
has any unpaid, non-appealable judgment against it in excess of

$100 million. The Company was in compliance with the terms
of the credit facilities as of December 31, 2005. The
Company’s

debt-to

-capitalization
ratio as of December 31, 2005 was 17 percent.

At the Company’s option, the interest rate for the
facilities is based on (i) the greater of (a) The
JP Morgan Chase Bank prime rate or (b) the federal
funds rate plus one-half of one percent or (ii) the London
Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a margin determined by
the Company’s senior long-term debt rating. The
$750 million and the $450 million credit facilities
(U.S. credit facilities) also allow the Company to borrow
under competitive auctions.

At December 31, 2005, the margin over LIBOR for committed
loans was .27 percent on the $750 million facility and
..23 percent on the other three facilities. If the total
amount of the loans borrowed under the $750 million
facility equals or exceeds 50 percent of the total facility
commitments, then an additional .10 percent will be added
to the margins over LIBOR. If the total amount of the loans
borrowed under all of the other three facilities equals or
exceeds 50 percent of the total facility commitments, then
an additional .10 percent will be added to the margins over
LIBOR. The Company also pays quarterly facility fees of
..08 percent on the total amount of the $750 million
facility and .07 percent on the total amount of the other
three facilities. The facility fees vary based upon the
Company’s senior long-term debt rating. The
U.S. credit facilities are used to support Apache’s
commercial paper program. The available borrowing capacity under
the credit facilities at December 31, 2005 was
$1.5 billion.

The Company has certain uncommitted money market lines of credit
which are used from time to time for working capital purposes,
of which no balance was outstanding as of December 31, 2005.

The Company has a $1.2 billion commercial paper program
which enables Apache to borrow funds for up to 270 days at
competitive interest rates. There was no commercial paper
outstanding as of December 31, 2005. The commercial paper
balance at December 31, 2004 was classified as long-term
debt in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as the
Company had the ability and intent to refinance such amount on a
long-term basis through either the rollover of commercial paper
or available borrowing capacity under the U.S. credit
facilities. The weighted-average interest rate for commercial
paper was 3.03 percent in 2005 and 1.79 percent in
2004.

On May 15, 2003, Apache Finance Canada Corporation (Apache
Finance Canada) issued $350 million of 4.375 percent,

12-year,

senior
unsecured notes in a private placement. On March 4, 2004,
the Company completed an exchange offer with the holders of the
notes, issuing publicly traded, registered notes of the same
principal amount and with the same interest rates, payment terms
and maturity. The notes are irrevocably and unconditionally
guaranteed by Apache and are redeemable, as a whole or in part,
at Apache Finance Canada’s option, subject to a make-whole
premium. Interest is payable semi-annually on May 15 and
November 15 of each year commencing on November 15, 2003.
The proceeds of the original note offering were used to reduce
bank debt and outstanding commercial paper and for general
corporate purposes.

The Company does not have the right to redeem any of its notes
or debentures (other than the Apache Corporation 6.25-percent
notes due April 15, 2012, the Apache Finance Australia
6.5-percent notes due 2007 and the Apache Finance Canada
4.375-percent notes due 2015) prior to maturity. Under certain
conditions, the Company has the right to advance maturity on the
7.7-percent notes, 7.95-percent notes, 7.375-percent debentures
and 7.625-percent debentures.

The notes issued by Apache Finance Pty Ltd (Apache Finance
Australia) and Apache Finance Canada are irrevocably and
unconditionally guaranteed by Apache and, in the case of Apache
Finance Australia, by Apache North America, Inc., an indirect
wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. Under certain conditions
related to changes in relevant tax laws, Apache Finance
Australia and Apache Finance Canada have the right to redeem the
notes prior to maturity. The Apache Finance Australia
6.5-percent notes and the Apache Finance Canada 4.375-percent
notes may be redeemed at the Company’s option subject to a
make-whole premium (see Note 16. Supplemental Guarantor
Information).

A reconciliation of the U.S. federal statutory income tax
amounts to the effective amounts is shown below:

The net deferred tax liability is comprised of the following:

The Company has not recorded deferred income taxes on the
undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries as management
intends to permanently reinvest such earnings. As of
December 31, 2005, the undistributed earnings of the
foreign subsidiaries amounted to approximately
$7.4 billion. Upon distribution of these earnings in the
form of dividends or otherwise, the Company may be subject to
U.S. income taxes and foreign withholding taxes. It is not
practical, however, to estimate the amount of taxes that may be
payable on the eventual remittance of these earnings after
consideration of available foreign tax credits. Presently,
limited foreign tax credits are available to reduce the
U.S. taxes on such amounts if repatriated.

At December 31, 2005, the Company had state net operating
loss carryforwards of $267 million and foreign net
operating loss carryforwards of $18 million for Canada. The
state net operating losses will expire over the next

Stock Compensation Plans

During 2002, Apache began modifying its stock compensation plans
in order to reflect the cost of these plans in the Statement of
Consolidated Operations. As part of this effort, Apache began
issuing stock appreciation rights and restricted stock and,
effective January 1, 2003, adopted the expense provisions
of SFAS No. 123, as amended, on a prospective basis
for all stock options granted under the Company’s existing
option plans. Consistent with the Company’s desire to
expense stock compensation plans, Apache early adopted the
provisions of SFAS 123-R upon the FASBs issuance of the
statement in the fourth quarter of 2004. See Note 1,
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. A description of the
Company’s stock-based compensation plans and related costs
follows. Costs related to the plans are capitalized or expensed
based on the nature of the employee’s activities.

Stock Options

As of December 31, 2005, officers and employees held
options to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock
under one or more of the employee stock option plans adopted in
1995, 1998, 2000 and 2005 (collectively, the Stock Option
Plans). New shares of Company stock will be issued for employee
option exercises; however, under the 2000 Stock Option Plan,
shares of treasury stock are used for employee option exercises.
Under the Stock Option Plans, the exercise price of each option
equals the market price of Apache’s common stock on the
date of grant. Options generally become exercisable ratably over
a four-year period and

expire after 10 years. All of the Stock Option Plans,
except for the 2000 stock option plan, were submitted to and
approved by the Company’s stockholders.

On October 31, 1996, the Company also established the 1996
Performance Stock Option Plan (the Performance Plan) for
substantially all full-time employees, excluding officers and
certain key employees. Under the Performance Plan, the exercise
price of each option equals the market price of Apache common
stock on the date of grant. All options become exercisable after
nine and one-half years and expire 10 years from the date
of grant. Under the terms of the Performance Plan, no grants
were made after December 31, 1998.

A summary of the status of the Stock Option Plans and the 1996
Performance Stock Option Plan is presented in the table and

yield is based on historical yields on the date of grant. The
expected term of options granted represents the period of time
that the options are expected to be outstanding and is derived
from historical exercise behavior, current trends and values
derived from lattice-based models. The risk-free rate is based

The intrinsic value of options exercised during 2005 was
approximately $68 million and the Company realized an
additional tax benefit of approximately $16 million for the
amount of intrinsic value in excess of compensation cost
recognized. As of December 31, 2005, the total compensation
cost related to non-vested options not yet recognized was
$28 million, which will be recognized over the remaining
vesting period of the options.

Stock Appreciation Rights

During 2003 and 2004, the Company issued a total of 1,328,400
and 1,802,210, respectively, of stock appreciation rights (SARs)
to non-executive employees in lieu of stock options. None were
issued in 2005. SARs will be settled in cash upon exercise
throughout their

10-year

life. The
weighted-average exercise price of the SARs was $42.68 and
$28.78 for those issued in 2004 and 2003, respectively. The
number of SARs outstanding as of December 31, 2005 was
2,425,062, of which 745,715 were exercisable. The vesting period
is over four years and the Company records compensation expense
on the vested SARs outstanding based on the fair value of the
SARs at the end of each period. As of year-end, the
weighted-average fair value of SARs outstanding was $38.55 based
on the Black-Scholes valuation methodology using assumptions
comparable to those discussed above. During 2005, 279,600 SARs
were exercised and approximately 83,000 were forfeited. No
material cash payments were made to settle SARs that were
exercised.

Restricted Stock

On May 5, 2002, Apache’s board of directors approved
an executive restricted stock plan for all executive officers
and certain key employees. At the time of grant, participants in
the executive restricted stock plan may elect to defer income
from restricted stock vesting into the Deferred Delivery Plan.
The Company awarded 155,300, 87,500 and 121,000 restricted
shares at a per share market price of $55.90, $42.68 and $28.78
in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The value of the stock
issued was established by the market price on the date of grant
and will be recorded as compensation expense ratably over the
four-year vesting terms. During 2005, 2004 and 2003,
$4.3 million, $2.8 million and $2 million,
respectively, was charged to expense as shares vested. As of
December 31, 2005, there was $11 million of total
unrecognized compensation cost

In December 1998, the Company granted a conditional stock award
to an executive of the Company for a total 230,992 shares
(adjusted for subsequent stock dividends and a stock split) of
the Company’s common stock. The award was composed of five
annual installments, commencing on January 1, 1999 and each
successive January through January 1, 2003. Vesting occurs
on the fifth anniversary following each installment. Under the
terms of the award, forty percent of the conditional grants are
paid in cash at the market value of the Company’s stock on
the date of payment and the balance is issued in Apache common
stock. The first two periodic installments vested on
January 1, 2004 and January 1, 2005. The latter three
annual installments will vest on January 1, 2006, 2007 and
2008, respectively.

2005 Share Appreciation Plan

On May 5, 2005, the Company’s stockholders approved
the 2005 Share Appreciation Plan that provides incentives
for employees to double Apache’s share price to $108 by the
end of 2008, with an interim goal of $81 to be achieved by the
end of 2007. To achieve the trigger price, the Company’s
stock price must close at or above the stated threshold for
10 days out of any 30 consecutive trading days by the end
of the stated period. Under the plan, if the first threshold is
achieved, approximately 1.4 million shares would be awarded
for an intrinsic cost of $111 million. Achieving the second
threshold would result in approximately 2.1 million shares
awarded for an intrinsic cost of $223 million. Shares
ultimately issued would be reduced for any minimum tax
withholding requirements. Under the terms of this targeted stock
plan, awards are payable in four equal installments, beginning
with the date the trigger stock price is met and on each
succeeding anniversary date.

Current accounting practices dictate that, regardless of whether
these thresholds are ultimately achieved, the Company will
recognize the fair value cost at the grant date based on
numerous assumptions, including an estimate of the likelihood
that Apache’s stock price will achieve these thresholds and
the expected forfeiture rate. As a result, the Company will
recognize expense and capitalized costs of approximately
$76 million over the expected service life of the plan. For
2005, $6.6 million ($4.3 million after tax) was
expensed and $3.4 million was capitalized. No material
forfeitures occurred during 2005.

The weighted average fair value, based on the Monte Carlo
Simulation Model, was $25.11 per share, determined by using
expected volatility of 28.30 percent, an expected dividend
yield of 0.56 percent, and a risk free interest rate of
3.81 percent. The fair value determination was calculated
using assumptions similar to the option valuation discussed
above.

2000 Share Appreciation Plan

In October 2000, the Company adopted the 2000 Share
Appreciation Plan under which grants were made to substantially
all full-time employees, including officers. The Share
Appreciation Plan provided for issuance of up to an aggregate of
8.08 million shares of Apache common stock, based on
attainment of one or more of three share price goals (Share
Price Goals) and/or a separate production goal (Production
Goal). Generally, shares are issued in three installments over
24 months after achievement of each goal. The shares of
Apache

F-30


APACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

common stock contingently issuable under the Share Appreciation
Plan were excluded from the computation of income per common
share until the stated goals were met as described below.

The Share Price Goals were based on achieving a closing price of
$43.29, $51.95 and $77.92 per share on any 10 days out
of any 30 consecutive trading days prior to January 1,
2005. Apache’s share price exceeded the first threshold
($43.29) under this plan on April 28, 2004. As such, the
Company will issue approximately 900,000 shares of its
common stock, after minimum tax withholding requirements, which
will be distributed in three annual installments. The first and
second installments were issued in May 2004 and 2005,
respectively. The third installment will be issued in 2006 to
employees remaining with, or having retired from, the Company
during the period. Also, on October 26, 2004, Apache’s
share price exceeded the second threshold of $51.95.
Accordingly, Apache will issue approximately 2.2 million
additional shares of its common stock, after minimum tax
withholding requirements, in three equal installments. The first
and second installments were issued in November 2004 and 2005,
respectively. The third installment will be issued in 2006 to
employees remaining with, or having retired from, the Company
during the period. The third share-price threshold ($77.92) did
not trigger and the related shares were cancelled as of
December 31, 2004. A summary of the number of shares
contingently issued under the Share Price Goals as of
December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 is presented in the table
below:

The outstanding shares at the end of 2005 and 2004 represent

    the $43.29 and $51.95 per share price goals. These
    outstanding shares will be issued net of minimum tax withholding
    as employees fulfill the one-year remaining service period
    requirement. The outstanding shares shown at the end of 2003
    represent shares that would have been issued, had the $43.29,
    $51.95 and $77.92 been attained, 1,370,624 shares,

The fair value of each Share Price Goal conditional grant is
    estimated as of the date of grant using a Monte Carlo simulation
    with the following weighted-average assumptions used for grants
    in 2004 and 2003, respectively: (i) risk-free interest rate
    of 3.04 and 2.77 percent; (ii) expected volatility of
    35.97 and 36.69 percent; and (iii) expected dividend
    yield of .96 and .70 percent.

Timing of expense recognition under the 2000 Share
Appreciation Plan was based on the accounting policies in place
for each year the plan was outstanding and vesting (See
Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies). The
shares were initially granted in 2000 and were not expensed
under APB Opinion No. 25. In 2004, Apache adopted
SFAS

123-R

retrospectively, to January 1, 2004, and expensed stock
based compensation vesting during the year. Under
SFAS No.

123-R

expense amounts are determined based on the fair value of the
plan on the date of grant and for 2005 and 2004, respectively,
the Company recorded $6.3 million ($4.1 million

The Production Goal was not attained prior to January 1,
2005 and, therefore, no shares were issued under that goal.

Preferred Stock

The Company has five million shares of no par preferred stock
authorized, of which 25,000 shares have been designated as
Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock (the
Series A Preferred Stock) and 100,000 shares have been
designated as the 5.68 percent Series B Cumulative
Preferred Stock (the Series B Preferred Stock).

Rights to Purchase Series A Preferred Stock

In December 1995, the Company declared a dividend of one right
(a Right) for each 2.31 shares (adjusted for subsequent
stock dividends and a two-for-one stock split) of Apache common
stock outstanding on January 31, 1996. Each full Right
entitles the registered holder to purchase from the Company one
ten-thousandth (1/10,000) of a share of Series A Preferred
Stock at a price of $100 per one ten-thousandth of a share,
subject to adjustment. The Rights are exercisable 10 calendar
days following a public announcement that certain persons or
groups have acquired 20 percent or more of the outstanding
shares of Apache common stock or 10 business days following
commencement of an offer for 30 percent or more of the
outstanding shares of Apache common stock. In addition, if a
person or group becomes the beneficial owner of 20 percent
or more of Apache’s outstanding common stock (flip in
event), each Right will become exercisable for shares of
Apache’s common stock at 50 percent of the then market
price of the common stock. If a 20 percent shareholder of
Apache acquires Apache, by merger or otherwise, in a transaction
where Apache does not survive or in which Apache’s common
stock is changed or exchanged (flip over event), the Rights
become exercisable for shares of the common stock of the company
acquiring Apache at 50 percent of the then market price for
Apache common stock. Any Rights that are or were beneficially
owned by a person who has acquired 20 percent or more of
the outstanding shares of Apache common stock and who engages in
certain transactions or realizes the benefits of certain
transactions with the Company will become void. If an offer to
acquire all of the Company’s outstanding shares of common
stock is determined to be fair by Apache’s board of
directors, the transaction will not trigger a flip in event or a
flip over event. The Company may also redeem the Rights at
$.01 per Right at any time until 10 business days after
public announcement of a flip in event. These rights were
originally scheduled to expire on January 31, 2006.
Effective as of that date, the rights were reset to one right
per share of common stock and the expiration was extended to
January 31, 2016. Unless the Rights have been previously
redeemed, all shares of Apache common stock issued by the
Company after January 31, 1996 will include Rights. Unless
and until the Rights become exercisable, they will be
transferred with and only with the shares of Apache common stock.

Series B Preferred Stock

In August 1998, Apache issued 100,000 shares
($100 million) of Series B Preferred Stock in the form
of one million depositary shares, each representing one-tenth
(1/10) of a share of Series B Preferred Stock, for net
proceeds of $98 million. The Series B Preferred Stock
has no stated maturity, is not subject to a sinking fund and is
not convertible into Apache common stock or any other securities
of the Company. Apache has the option to redeem the
Series B Preferred Stock at $1,000 per preferred share
on or after August 25, 2008. Holders of the shares are
entitled to receive cumulative cash dividends at an annual rate
of $5.68 per depositary share when, and if, declared by
Apache’s board of directors.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The following table presents the carrying amounts and estimated
fair values of the Company’s financial instruments at
December 31, 2005 and 2004. See Note 3, Hedging and

derivative instruments.

The fair value of the notes and debentures is based upon an
estimate provided to the Company by an independent investment
banking firm. The carrying amount of the commercial paper and
money market lines of credit approximated fair value because the
interest rates are variable and reflective of market rates. The
Company’s trade receivables and trade payables are by their
very nature short-term. The carrying values included in the

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

Litigation

Texaco China B.V.

Apache recorded a reserve in the second quarter of 2004 to fully
reflect a pre-tax $71 million international arbitration
award to Texaco China B.V. (Texaco China). The arbitration award
was subject to interest at nine percent until May 6, 2005,
the date following the federal district court ruling discussed
below. On May 6, 2005, the interest rate dropped to
3.33 percent. Apache accrued $3.2 million of interest
expense in 2004 and an additional $3.8 million of interest
expense in 2005. In September 2001, Texaco China initiated an
arbitration proceeding against Apache China Corporation LDC
(Apache China), later adding Apache Bohai Corporation LDC
(Apache Bohai) to the arbitration. In the arbitration Texaco
China claimed damages, plus interest, arising from Apache
Bohai’s alleged failure to drill three wells, prior to
re-assignment of the interest to Texaco China. Apache believes
that the finding of the arbitrator is unsupported by the facts
and the law, and Apache filed an application to vacate the award
in federal court. Texaco China filed an application to confirm
the award in the same court. On May 5, 2005, the federal
district court ruled in favor of Texaco China. The Company has
appealed that decision to the circuit court of appeals. In
January 2005, while awaiting the decision of the
U.S. federal courts, Texaco China also filed a proceeding
against Apache China and Apache Bohai in the People’s
Republic of China to recognize the award, apparently seeking the
same relief as sought in U.S. federal court. The parties
subsequently agreed to stay enforcement of the arbitration award
in China and elsewhere pending the final, determinative outcome
of all possible appeals in the U.S. federal courts. A
hearing on the appeal has been set for April 2006.

Predator

In December 2000, certain subsidiaries of the Company and Murphy
Oil Corporation (Murphy) filed a lawsuit in Canada charging The
Predator Corporation Ltd. (Predator) and others with
misappropriation and misuse of confidential well data to obtain
acreage offsetting a significant natural gas discovery in the
Ladyfern area of northeast British Columbia made by Apache
Canada Ltd. (Apache Canada) and Murphy during 2000. In February
2001, Predator filed a counterclaim seeking more than
C$6 billion and later reduced this amount to approximately
C$3.6 billion. In September 2004, the Canadian court
granted Apache Canada’s motion for summary judgment on the
counterclaim, dismissing more than C$3 billion of
Predator’s claims against Apache Canada and Murphy, and
dismissing all claims against both Murphy’s president and
Apache Canada’s president. Predator has appealed the
summary judgment. On February 28, 2006, the Court of Appeal
of Alberta dismissed Predator’s appeal. Predator may seek
review by the Supreme Court of Canada. The trial court also
granted Apache Canada’s request for costs and disbursements
in the approximate amount of C$700,000, which Predator has paid.
The Canadian court has also granted Predator’s request to
add some new mismanagement of operations claims to its
counterclaim. At this time, Predator’s counterclaims
against Murphy and Apache Canada for mismanaging operations
still survive in the trial court and a trial is scheduled to
begin in April 2006 unless the appellate court has not, by
March 16, 2006, decided Predator’s appeal of the
summary judgment dismissing more than C$3 billion of
Predator’s claims against Apache Canada and Murphy. The
combined claims, for mismanagement of operations, total
approximately C$365 million, plus interest and
attorneys’ fees. While management believes Predator’s
counterclaim against Apache Canada is without merit, an adverse
judgment is possible. Exposure related to this lawsuit is not
currently determinable. Apache and Murphy’s claims against
Predator, filed in December 2000, are still pending.

Grynberg

In 1997, Jack J. Grynberg began filing lawsuits against other
natural gas producers, gatherers, and pipelines claiming that
the defendants have underpaid royalty to the federal government
and Indian tribes by mis-measurement of the volume and heating
content of natural gas and are responsible for acts of others who

F-34


APACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

mis-measured natural gas. In 2004, Grynberg filed suit against
Apache making the same claims he had made previously against
others in the industry. With the addition of Apache, there are
more than 300 defendants to these actions. Other plaintiffs have
made or may be expected to make similar claims. The Grynberg
lawsuits have, for the most part, been consolidated through a
federal Multi-District Litigation (MDL) action located in
Wyoming federal court for discovery and pre-trial purposes. The
defendants in the MDL, jointly and/or separately, filed motions
to dismiss based upon certain statutory requirements Grynberg is
required to prove to proceed with these qui tam lawsuits. These
motions were referred to a magistrate for recommendation for
decision. The magistrate has recommended some defendants be
dismissed. Subsequent motions are pending before the federal
district court by both sides on these recommendations for
confirmation and/or denial of the recommendation. It is unclear
from the Magistrate’s recommendation if there was a ruling
on Apache’s filing for dismissal; however, at this time,
Apache has not been dismissed. Apache has filed additional
pleadings to obtain rulings on its separate request for
dismissal. Although Grynberg purports to be acting on behalf of
the government, the federal government has declined to join in
the cases. While an adverse judgment against Apache is possible,
Apache does not believe the plaintiff’s claims have merit
and plans to vigorously pursue its defenses against these
claims. Exposure related to this lawsuit is not currently
determinable.

Egypt Tax Authority

As of the end of 2004, the Egyptian Tax Authority (ETA) had
issued claims for back taxes against various Apache subsidiaries
in Egypt totaling approximately $113.4 million (at current
exchange rates) relating to periods as far back as 1994. In July
2005, the ETA made a new claim for approximately
$85 million of additional taxes for the 1994-99 tax years.
On January 30, 2006, the Tax Authority cancelled the new
claim in its entirety, with no liability to Apache.

With respect to the remaining claims (those existing at the end
of 2004), while an adverse judgment against Apache is possible,
Egyptian concession agreements clearly provide that the Egyptian
General Petroleum Corporation is responsible for the payment of
all taxes related to the operation of the concessions. Apache
believes that the claims of the ETA are unsupported by either
the facts or the language of the concession agreements, which
have the force of law in Egypt. Apache’s subsidiaries have,
therefore, contested liability with respect to those claims by
filing actions in Egyptian civil court. In addition, pursuant to
a 2005 change in the Egyptian tax law, Apache has petitioned the
Committee for the Reconsideration of Final Assessment for
reconsideration of the original claims. The Committee for the
Reconsideration of Final Assessment, which is the final appeal
committee in the Tax Authority and is empowered to overrule Tax
Authority claims, has accepted Apache’s petition for
reconsideration. A decision by the Committee is expected
sometime during the first half of 2006. Apache plans to
vigorously pursue its remedies with respect to these claims.

Louisiana Restoration

Numerous surface owners have filed claims or sent demand letters
to various oil and gas companies, including Apache, claiming
that, under either expressed or implied lease terms or Louisiana
law, they are liable for damage measured by the cost of
restoration of leased premises to their original condition as
well as damages for contamination and cleanup. Many of these
lawsuits claim small amounts, while others assert claims in
excess of a million dollars. Also, some lawsuits or claims are
being settled or resolved, while others are still being filed.
Any exposure, therefore, related to these lawsuits and claims is
not currently determinable. While an adverse judgment against
Apache is possible, Apache intends to actively defend the cases.

Eastern District of Louisiana

, against all oil and gas
and pipeline companies that drilled or dredged in the marshes of
South Louisiana. The lawsuit claims defendants were negligent by
constructing canals and conducting oil and gas operations, which
plaintiffs contend is the sole and/or almost the sole cause of
the alleged destruction of the marshes in South Louisiana, which
plaintiffs blame for all and/or substantially all loss of life
and destruction of property which was incurred from Hurricane
Katrina. Apache was not named, but if a defendant class is
certified, would fall within the definition alleged. Apache
believes such claims are without merit, and if joined will
undertake an active defense to such claims.

General

The Company is involved in other litigation and is subject to
governmental and regulatory controls arising in the ordinary
course of business. The Company has an accrued liability of
approximately $2 million for other legal contingencies that
are probable of occurring and can be reasonably estimated. It is
management’s opinion that the loss for any such other
litigation matters and claims that are reasonably possible to
occur will not have a material adverse affect on the
Company’s financial position or results of operations.

Other Commitments and Contingencies

Environmental

The Company, as an owner or lessee and operator of oil and gas
properties, is subject to various federal, provincial, state,
local and foreign country laws and regulations relating to
discharge of materials into, and protection of, the environment.
These laws and regulations may, among other things, impose
liability on the lessee under an oil and gas lease for the cost
of pollution

clean-up

resulting from operations and subject the lessee to liability
for pollution damages. In some instances, the Company may be
directed to suspend or cease operations in the affected area. We
maintain insurance coverage, which we believe is customary in
the industry, although we are not fully insured against all
environmental risks.

Apache manages its exposure to environmental liabilities on
properties to be acquired by identifying existing problems and
assessing the potential liability. The Company also conducts
periodic reviews, on a company-wide basis, to identify changes
in its environmental risk profile. These reviews evaluate
whether there is a probable liability, its amount, and the
likelihood that the liability will be incurred. The amount of
any potential liability is determined by considering, among
other matters, incremental direct costs of any likely
remediation and the proportionate cost of employees who are
expected to devote a significant amount of time directly to any
possible remediation effort. As it relates to evaluations of
purchased properties, depending on the extent of an identified
environmental problem, the Company may exclude a property from
the acquisition, require the seller to remediate the property to
Apache’s satisfaction, or agree to assume liability for the
remediation of the property. The Company’s general policy
is to limit any reserve additions to any incidents or sites that
are considered probable to result in an expected remediation
cost exceeding $100,000. Any environmental costs and liabilities
that are not reserved for are treated as an expense when
actually incurred. In our estimation, neither these expenses nor
expenses related to training and compliance programs, are likely
to have a material impact on our financial condition. As of
December 31, 2005, the Company had an undiscounted reserve
for environmental remediation of approximately $11 million.
Apache is not aware of any environmental claims existing as of
December 31, 2005, which have not been provided for or
would otherwise have a material impact on its financial position
or results of operations. There can be no assurance, however,
that current regulatory requirements will not change, or past
non-compliance with environmental laws will not be discovered on
the Company’s properties.

International Lease Concessions

The Company, through its subsidiaries, has acquired or has been
conditionally or unconditionally granted exploration rights in
Australia, Egypt, China and the North Sea. In order to comply
with the contracts and

agreements granting these rights, the Company, through various
wholly-owned subsidiaries, is committed to expend approximately

The Company has leases for buildings, facilities and equipment
with varying expiration dates through 2035. Net rental expense
was $20 million for 2005, and $17 million for 2004 and
2003.

Retirement and Deferred Compensation Plans

The Company provides a 401(k) savings plan for employees which
allows participating employees to elect to contribute up to
25 percent of their salaries (50 percent effective
January 1, 2006), with Apache making matching contributions
up to a maximum of six percent of each employee’s salary.
In addition, the Company annually contributes six percent of
each participating employee’s compensation, as defined, to
a money purchase retirement plan. The 401(k) plan and the money
purchase retirement plan are subject to certain
annually-adjusted, government-mandated restrictions which limit
the amount of each employee’s contributions.

For certain eligible employees, the Company also provides a
non-qualified retirement/savings plan which allows the deferral
of up to 50 percent of each employee’s salary, and
which accepts employee contributions and the Company’s
matching contributions in excess of the above-referenced
restrictions on the 401(k) savings plan and money purchase
retirement plan. Additionally, Apache Energy Limited, Apache
Canada Ltd. and Apache North Sea Limited maintain separate
retirement plans, as required under the laws of Australia,
Canada and the United Kingdom, respectively.

Vesting in the Company’s contributions to the 401(k)
savings plan, the money purchase retirement plan and the
non-qualified retirement/savings plan occurs at the rate of
20 percent for every full-year of employment. Upon a change
in control of ownership, vesting is immediate. Total costs under
all plans were $39 million, $31 million and
$25 million for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Effective July 1, 2003, as part of the BP North Sea
acquisition, Apache assumed a funded noncontributory defined
benefit pension plan (U.K. Pension Plan) covering existing
BP North Sea employees hired by the Company as part of the
acquisition. Contributions made by Apache to BP’s plan were
immaterial prior to Apache’s plan becoming effective. The
pension plan provides defined benefits based on years of service
and final average salary. The plan is closed to newly hired
employees.

F-37


APACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Apache also has a postretirement benefit plan covering
substantially all of its U.S. employees. The postretirement
benefit plan provides for medical benefits up until the age of
65. The plan is contributory with participants’
contributions adjusted annually. The postretirement benefit plan
does not pay benefits once participants become eligible for
Medicare and is not affected by the Medicare Modernization Act
of 2003.

The following tables set forth the benefit obligation, fair
value of plan assets and funded status as of December 31,
2005 and 2004 and the underlying weighted average actuarial
assumptions used for the U.K. Pension Plan and
U.S. postretirement benefit plan. Apache uses a measurement
date of December 31 for its pension and postretirement
benefit plans.

As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, the accumulated benefit
obligation for the pension plan was $76 million and
$65 million, respectively.

PREFERRED INTERESTS OF SUBSIDIARIES

On September 26, 2003, Apache repurchased and retired
preferred interests in the Company for approximately
$443 million, plus an additional $1 million for
accrued dividends and distributions. The transaction involved
the purchase of preferred stock issued by two of the
Company’s subsidiaries for approximately $82 million
and the retirement of a limited partnership interest in a
partnership controlled by a subsidiary of the Company for
approximately $361 million. Apache funded the transactions
with available cash on hand and by issuing commercial paper
under its existing commercial paper facility.

Prior to the early repurchase, dividends paid on the preferred
stock and distributions made on the limited partner interests
were reflected as preferred interests of subsidiaries in the
statement of consolidated operations.

TRANSACTIONS WITH RELATED PARTIES AND MAJOR CUSTOMERS

Cinergy Corp.

In 1995, Apache and other natural gas producers formed Producers
Energy Marketing LLC (ProEnergy), to market substantially all of
its members’ domestic natural gas. In June 1998, Apache
sold its 57 percent interest in ProEnergy to Cinergy Corp.
and contracted with Cinergy Corp. to market substantially all
the Company’s natural gas production from the U.S. and
agreed to develop terms for the marketing of most of
Apache’s Canadian production under an amended and restated
gas purchase agreement effective July 1, 1998. Apache
received 771,258 shares of Cinergy Corp. common stock for
its interest, which the Company subsequently sold for
$26 million. In December 1998, Apache and Cinergy Corp.
agreed to postpone the negotiation of terms to market most of
Apache’s Canadian production. Under the terms of the
original gas purchase agreement, ProEnergy, renamed Cinergy
Marketing and Trading LLC (Cinergy), was to market Apache’s
North American natural gas production until June 30, 2008,
with an option, following prior notice, to terminate on
June 30, 2004. During this period, Apache was generally
obligated to deliver most of its U.S. gas production to
Cinergy and, under certain circumstances, reimburse Cinergy if
certain gas throughput thresholds were not met. The prices
received for its gas production under this agreement
approximated market prices.

In June 2003, Apache and Cinergy agreed to terminate their
agreement concerning marketing of Apache’s
U.S. natural gas production and to dismiss the arbitration
between them. The parties reached an amicable settlement, the
amounts of which were immaterial to Apache’s financial
position and results of operations. Consequently, the Company
began marketing its U.S. natural gas production previously
marketed by Cinergy beginning with July 2003 production.

Related Parties

In the ordinary course of business, Cimarex Energy, Co.
(Cimarex), formerly Key Production Company, Inc., paid to Apache
$7 million during 2005, $6 million during 2004 and
$4 million during 2003 for Cimarex’s proportionate
share of drilling and workover costs, mineral interests and
routine expenses relating to oil and gas wells in which Cimarex
owns interests and of which Apache is the operator. Cimarex was
paid approximately $5 million in 2005 and 2004, and
$6 million in 2003 directly by Apache or related entities
for its proportionate share of revenues from wells in which
Cimarex owns an interest and of which Apache is operator. Apache
paid to Cimarex approximately $1 million during 2005,
$5 million during 2004 and $1 million during 2003 for
Apache’s proportionate share of drilling and workover
costs, mineral interests and routine expenses relating to oil
and gas wells in which Apache owns interests and of which
Cimarex is the operator. Apache was paid approximately
$4 million in 2005, $3 million in 2004 and
$2 million in 2003 directly by Cimarex for its
proportionate share of revenues from wells in which Apache owns
an interest and of which Cimarex is operator. F. H. Merelli, a
member of Apache’s Board of Directors, is chairman of the
board, chief executive officer and president of Cimarex.

George D. Lawrence, a member of the Company’s board of
directors and the former President and Chief Executive Officer
of Phoenix Resource Companies, Inc. (Phoenix), joined
Apache’s board in conjunction with the Company’s
acquisition of Phoenix by a merger (the Merger) on May 20,
1996, through which Phoenix became a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Apache. Upon consummation of the Merger, Apache assumed Phoenix
stock options that remained outstanding on May 20, 1996,
including those granted to Mr. Lawrence pursuant to
Phoenix’s 1990 Employee Stock Option Plan. In March 2003,
Mr. Lawrence received 8,291 shares of Apache common
stock (16,582 shares after adjustment for the stock split)
as a result of the exercise of all of his remaining stock
options from the Phoenix 1990 Employee Stock Option Plan. Such
exercise was for 21,656 shares of Apache common stock at an
exercise price of $21.50 per share (43,312 shares of
Apache common stock at an exercise price of $10.75 per
share after adjustment for the stock split). Mr. Lawrence
paid the net exercise price of $466,000 and required taxes of
$345,000 by surrendering 13,365 shares of Apache common
stock valued at $60.65 per share (26,730 shares at
$30.33 after adjustment for the stock split).

In the ordinary course of business, Matador Petroleum
Corporation or related entities (Matador) paid to Apache
approximately $793,000 during 2003 for Matador’s
proportionate share of drilling and workover costs, mineral
interests and routine expenses relating to oil and gas wells in
which Matador owns interests and of which Apache is the
operator. Matador was paid approximately $1 million in 2003
directly by Apache for its proportionate share of revenues from
wells in which Matador marketed its revenues with Apache as
operator. Apache paid to Matador approximately $654,000 during
2003 for Apache’s proportionate share of drilling and
workover costs, mineral interests and routine expenses relating
to oil and gas wells in which Apache owns interests and of which
Matador is the operator. Apache was paid approximately $915,000
in 2003, directly by Matador for its proportionate share of
revenues from wells in which Apache marketed its revenues with
Matador as operator. Eugene C. Fiedorek, a member of

Hunt paid $200,000 to Apache to settle an indemnity claim for
the cleanup of oil pits on certain properties in Texas. Janice
K. Hartrick, vice president and associate general counsel of
Apache, married John W. Creecy, president and chief executive
officer of Hunt on January 1, 2006.

Apache and its subsidiaries made donations of $34,000, $103,000
and $201,000, in cash, property and services, to Ucross
Foundation in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Apache also
paid $13,000 and $22,000 during 2005 and 2004, respectively, to
Ucross Foundation for food, lodging and other expenses incurred
in connection with executive and board meetings held by Apache
at Ucross Foundation’s facilities. In February 2004, Apache
purchased Clear Creek Hunting Preserve, Inc. (CCHP) from
Ucross Foundation for a total purchase price of $77,000 and paid
$36,000 and $34,000 to Ucross Foundation during 2005 and 2004,
respectively, for the lease of land and other services utilized
by CCHP. In December 2005, Apache Foundation (a charitable
subsidiary of Apache) entered into a

30-year

lease with
Ucross Foundation, effective 2006, for the use of Ucross ranch
property, for an annual consideration of $110,000, indexed for
inflation, plus payment of certain other expenses related to the
ranch property. During 2005, Apache subsidiaries purchased from
Ucross Foundation land and buildings for $497,000. Also during
2005, Ucross Foundation donated $1.3 million to Apache
Foundation for conservation projects. Ucross Foundation was
founded in 1981 as a non-profit organization whose primary
objectives include the restoration of the historic Clear Fork
headquarters of the Pratt and Ferris Cattle Company of Wyoming,
the promotion of the preservation of other historical sites in
the area, pursuit of holistic ranching practices and
conservation, and the maintenance of an

artists-in

program for writers and other artists. To help ensure the
continuity of Ucross Foundation and its charitable purposes,
Apache’s board of directors approved a conditional
charitable contribution of $10 million to be made to Ucross
Foundation in the event of a change of control of Apache, as
defined in its income continuance plan. George D. Lawrence, a
director of Apache, is chairman of the board of trustees of
Ucross Foundation. Raymond Plank, chairman of Apache’s
board of directors, G. Steven Farris, a director and officer of
Apache, and Roger B. Plank, an officer of Apache, are each
trustees of Ucross Foundation.

During 2005, 2004 and 2003, Apache and its subsidiaries made
donations of $5,011,000, $5,033,000 and $500,000, in cash,
property and services, to The Fund for Teachers: A Foundation to
Recognize, Stimulate and Enhance (Fund for Teachers), a Texas
non-profit corporation. In addition, during 2005, Apache made a
pledge to Fund for Teachers for $5 million in cash,
property and services that will be paid in 2006. Fund for
Teachers seeks to provide resources directly to teachers to
support learning experiences of their own design to increase
effectiveness with students, and is currently focused on funding
summer sabbaticals for selected applicants. Frederick M. Bohen,
a director of Apache, is chairman of the board of Fund for
Teachers, and Patricia Albjerg Graham, a director of Apache, is
a director of Fund for Teachers. Raymond Plank, chairman of
Apache’s board of directors, is the founder and a director

Major Customers

In 2005, purchases by BP and Shell each accounted for
16 percent of the Company’s oil and gas production
revenues.

In 2004, purchases by EGPC and BP accounted for 17 percent
and 15 percent, respectively, of the Company’s oil and
gas production revenues.

In 2003, purchases by Cinergy, EGPC and BP accounted for
12 percent, 16 percent and 15 percent of the
Company’s oil and gas production revenues, respectively.

Concentration of Credit Risk

The Company’s revenues are derived principally from
uncollateralized sales to customers in the oil and gas industry;
therefore, customers may be similarly affected by changes in
economic and other conditions within the industry. Apache has
not experienced significant credit losses on such sales. Apache
sells a large portion of its Egyptian crude oil and natural gas
to EGPC for U.S. dollars. Beginning in 2001, we experienced
a gradual decline in timeliness of receipts from EGPC for our
Egyptian oil and gas sales. Deteriorating economic conditions
during 2001 in Egypt lessened the availability of
U.S. dollars, resulting in a one to two month delay in
receipts from EGPC. During 2005, we experienced variability in
the timing of cash receipts, but our past due balance improved
by year-end. We have not established a reserve for these
Egyptian receivables because we continue to get paid, albeit
late, and have no indication that we will not be able to collect
our receivable.

BUSINESS SEGMENT INFORMATION

Apache has six reportable segments which are primarily in the
business of crude oil and natural gas exploration and
production. The accounting policies of the segments are the same
as those described in the summary of significant accounting
policies. The Company evaluates performance based on profit or
loss from oil and gas operations before income and expense items
incidental to oil and gas operations and income taxes.

Oil and Gas Reserve
Information

Proved oil and gas reserve quantities are based on estimates
prepared by the Company’s engineers in accordance with
Rule 4-10 of
Regulation

S-X.

The Company engages Ryder Scott Company, L.P. Petroleum
Consultants as independent petroleum engineers, to review the
Company’s estimates of proved hydrocarbon liquid and gas
reserves and provide an opinion letter on the reasonableness of
Apache’s internal projections. During this review, they
prepare independent projections for each reviewed property and
determine if the Company’s estimates are within engineering
tolerance by geographical area. The independent reviews
typically cover a large percentage of major value fields,
international properties and new wells drilled during the year.
During 2005, 2004 and 2003, their review covered 74, 79 and
78 percent of the Apache’s estimated reserve value,
respectively.

There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating
quantities of proved reserves and projecting future rates of
production and timing of development expenditures. The following
reserve data only represent estimates and should not be
construed as being exact.

As of December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, on a barrel of
equivalent basis 30, 33 and 29 percent of our
estimated worldwide reserves, respectively, were classified as
proved undeveloped. Approximately 23 percent of our
year-end 2005 estimated proved developed reserves are classified
as proved not producing. These reserves relate to zones that are
either behind pipe, or that have been completed but not yet
produced, or zones that have been produced in the past, but are
not now producing because of mechanical reasons. These reserves
may be regarded as less certain than producing reserves because
they are frequently based on volumetric calculations rather than
performance data. Future production associated with behind pipe
reserves is scheduled to follow depletion of the currently
producing zones in the same wellbores. It should be noted that
additional capital may have to be spent to access these
reserves. The capital and economic impact of production timing
are reflected in this Note 14, under “Future Net Cash
Flows.”

F-51


APACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —

Future Net Cash Flows

Future cash inflows are based on year-end oil and gas prices
except in those instances where future natural gas or oil sales
are covered by physical contract terms providing for higher or
lower amounts. Operating costs, production and ad valorem taxes
and future development costs are based on current costs with no
escalation.

The following table sets forth unaudited information concerning
future net cash flows for oil and gas reserves, net of income
tax expense. Income tax expense has been computed using expected
future tax rates and giving effect to tax deductions and credits
available, under current laws, and which relate to oil and gas
producing activities. This information does not purport to
present the fair market value of the Company’s oil and gas
assets, but does present a standardized disclosure concerning
possible future net cash flows that would result under the
assumptions used.

F-52


APACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —

(1)

Included in the estimated future net cash flows are Canadian
    provincial tax credits expected to be realized beyond the date
    at which the legislation, under its provisions, could be
    repealed. To date, the Canadian provincial government has not
    indicated an intention to repeal this legislation.

(2)

Estimated future net cash flows before income tax expense,
    discounted at 10 percent per annum, totaled approximately
    $35.9 billion, $22.2 billion and $16.4 billion as
    of December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

F-53


APACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
(Continued)

The following table sets forth the principal sources of change
in the discounted future net cash flows:

Impact of Pricing

The estimates of cash flows and reserve quantities shown above
are based on year-end oil and gas prices, except in those cases
where future natural gas or oil sales are covered by physical
contracts at specified prices. Forward price volatility is
largely attributable to supply and demand perceptions for
natural gas and oil.

Under full-cost accounting rules, the Company reviews the
carrying value of its proved oil and gas properties each quarter
on a country-by-country basis. Under these rules, capitalized
costs of proved oil and gas properties, net of accumulated
DD&A and deferred income taxes, may not exceed the present
value of estimated future net cash flows from proved oil and gas
reserves, discounted at 10 percent, plus the lower of cost
or fair value of unproved properties included in the costs being
amortized, net of related tax effects (the “ceiling”).
These rules generally require pricing future oil and gas
production at the unescalated oil and gas prices at the end of
each fiscal quarter and require a write-down if the
“ceiling” is exceeded. Given the volatility of oil and
gas prices, it is reasonably possible that the Company’s
estimate of discounted future net cash flows from proved oil and
gas reserves could change in the near term. If oil and gas
prices decline significantly, even if only for a short period of
time, it is possible that write-downs of oil and gas properties
could occur in the future.

SUPPLEMENTAL GUARANTOR INFORMATION

Prior to 2001, Apache Finance Australia was a finance subsidiary
of Apache with no independent operations. In this capacity, it
issued approximately $270 million of publicly traded notes
that are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Apache and,
beginning in 2001, Apache North America, Inc. The guarantors of
Apache Finance Australia have joint and several liability.
Similarly, Apache Finance Canada was also a finance subsidiary
of Apache and had issued approximately $300 million of
publicly traded notes that were fully and unconditionally
guaranteed by Apache.

F-55


APACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
(Continued)

Generally, the issuance of publicly traded securities would
subject those subsidiaries to the reporting requirements of the
Securities and Exchange Commission. Since these subsidiaries had
no independent operations and qualified as “finance
subsidiaries,” they were exempted from these requirements.

During 2001, Apache contributed stock of its Australian and
Canadian operating subsidiaries to Apache Finance Australia and
Apache Finance Canada, respectively. As a result of these
contributions, they no longer qualify as finance subsidiaries.
As allowed by the SEC rules, the following condensed
consolidating financial statements are provided as an
alternative to filing separate financial statements.

Each of the companies presented in the condensed consolidating
financial statements is wholly owned and has been consolidated
in Apache Corporation’s consolidated financial statements
for all periods presented. As such, the condensed consolidating
financial statements should be read in conjunction with the
financial statements of Apache Corporation and subsidiaries and
