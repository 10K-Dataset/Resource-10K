BUSINESS AND PROPERTIES

General

Apache Corporation, a Delaware corporation formed in 1954, is an independent energy company that explores for, develops, and produces natural gas, crude oil, and natural gas liquids. Apache currently has exploration and production operations in three geographic areas: the U.S., Egypt, and offshore the U.K. in the North Sea (North Sea). Apache also has exploration interests in Suriname that may, over time, result in a reportable discovery and development opportunity.

Our common stock, par value $0.625 per share, has been listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) since 1969, on the Chicago Stock Exchange (CHX) since 1960, and on the NASDAQ Global Select Market (NASDAQ) since 2004.

Business Strategy

Our VISION is to be a premier exploration and production company.

Our MISSION is to grow in an innovative, safe, environmentally responsible, and profitable manner for the long-term benefit of our shareholders.

Our STRATEGY is to deliver top-tier returns by maximizing recovery and minimizing costs through continuous improvement. Apache’s long-term perspective is centered on the following core strategic components:

•

optimization of returns

•

disciplined financial structure

•

rigorous portfolio management

Over the past several years, Apache entered into a series of transactions that upgraded its portfolio of assets, enhanced its capital allocation process to further optimize returns and long-term shareholder value, and successfully completed a strategic shift from its historical acquisition and exploitation focus to one of internally generated exploration with full-cycle, returns-focused growth.

Rigorous management of the Company’s asset portfolio plays a key role in optimizing shareholder value over the long term. Specifically, we reduced capital investment in 2015 and 2016 to align with cash flow in a lower commodity price environment and allowed production to decline rather than pursue growth in an unfavorable service cost environment. Additionally, the Company monetized certain capital-intensive investments that were not accretive to earnings in the near term and other non-strategic assets. These divestitures included all of Apache’s operations in Australia and Canada, including LNG facility investments, its interest in the Scottish Area Gas Evacuation system (SAGE) and pipeline in the North Sea, and various non-core leasehold positions in North America. The Company made strategic decisions to allocate the proceeds of these asset divestitures to more impactful development opportunities, including development of our Alpine High discovery in the Delaware Basin. These actions have enabled us to focus


our investments on improving long-term returns, maintain our dividend, and reduce debt without diluting shareholders through issuing equity.

We now have a diversified portfolio that features strong free cash flow generating assets in Egypt and the North Sea, which benefit from premium Brent crude oil pricing, and top-tier assets in the Permian Basin, the combination of which are the Company’s foundation for returns-focused growth.

For a more in-depth discussion of the Company’s


results, divestitures, strategy, and its capital resources and liquidity, please see Part II, Item 7—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this Form 10-K.

Geographic Area Overviews

Apache has exploration and production operations in three geographic areas: the U.S., Egypt, and the North Sea. Apache also has exploration interests in Suriname that may, over time, result in a reportable discovery and development opportunity.

The following table sets out a brief comparative summary of certain key


data for each of Apache’s operating areas. Additional data and discussion is provided in Part II, Item 7—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this Form 10-K.

(1)

During the third quarter of 2017, Apache completed the sale of its Canadian operations.

(2)

Apache’s operations in Egypt, excluding a one-third noncontrolling interest, contributed

27 percent

of


production and accounted for

15 percent

of year-end estimated proved reserves.

(3)

Sales volumes from the North Sea for


were

21.2

MMboe. Sales volumes may vary from production volumes as a result of the timing of liftings in the Beryl field.

North America

In


, Apache’s North American operations contributed approximately 52 percent of production and 69 percent of estimated year-end proved reserves. Apache has access to significant liquid hydrocarbons across its 6.7 million gross acres in North America, 71 percent of which are undeveloped.

In North America, Apache has two onshore regions:

•

The Permian region located in west Texas and New Mexico includes the Permian sub-basins, the Midland Basin, Central Basin Platform/Northwest Shelf, and Delaware Basin. Examples of shale plays within this region include the Woodford, Barnett, Pennsylvanian, Cline, Wolfcamp, Bone Spring, and Spraberry.

•

The Midcontinent/Gulf Coast region includes the Granite Wash, Tonkawa, Marmaton, Cleveland, and other formations of the West Anadarko Basin, the Canyon Lime formation in the Texas panhandle, the Woodford-SCOOP and Stack plays located in central Oklahoma, and the Eagle Ford shale in east Texas.

Apache also has one offshore region in North America, the Gulf of Mexico region, which consists of both shallow and deep water exploration and production activities. Apache exited its Canadian operations in August 2017.


Permian Region

The Permian region is one of Apache’s core growth areas. Highlights of the Company’s operations in the region include:

•

Over 2.8 million gross acres with exposure to numerous plays focused primarily in the Midland Basin, the Central Basin Platform/Northwest Shelf, and the Delaware Basin.

•

Estimated proved reserves of 681 MMboe at year-end 2017, representing 58 percent of the Company’s worldwide proved reserves.

•

Annual production of

157.8

Mboe/d declined only

2 percent

from 2016. Fourth-quarter 2017 production increased 10 percent from the prior sequential quarter, a reflection of the success of the Midland Basin drilling program and the continued production ramp up at Alpine High, which first came online in May 2017.

•

In 2017, the Permian region averaged 16 rigs and drilled or participated in 215 wells, 158 of which were horizontal, with a 97 percent success rate.

In September 2016, Apache announced the discovery of a significant new resource play, “Alpine High.” Apache’s Alpine High acreage lies in the southern portion of the Delaware Basin, primarily in Reeves County, Texas. The Company has an acreage position in the play of approximately 340,000 net acres. Alpine High contains a vertical column up to 6,000 feet encompassing five geologic formations, with multiple target zones spanning the hydrocarbon phase window from dry gas to wet gas to oil. Apache has identified over 3,500 economic drilling locations in a wet gas play and over 1,000 locations in a dry gas play at Alpine High. The Company is also working to delineate an emerging oil play at Alpine High, with at least 500 locations already identified. During 2017, Apache drilled 45 wells at Alpine High with a 91 percent success rate, including many concept test wells drilled to verify our understanding of the play. Using data collected from strategic testing and delineation drilling, the Company is now optimizing wells drilled in Alpine High using customized targeting, larger fracs, and longer laterals. Combined with multi-well pad drilling and revenue uplift expected from oil and NGLs present in the wet gas play, Alpine High is anticipated to generate strong cash margins and a competitive recycle ratio when compared to other Permian operations. Apache began construction of infrastructure for Alpine High in November 2016 and delivered first gas sales from the field in May 2017. Through year-end 2017, the Company had invested $706 million on construction of these midstream assets. The Company will continue to expand gas processing capacity with new installations, including cryogenic processing units, and expansions at existing installations throughout 2018 and 2019. Apache continues to evaluate midstream monetization strategically, and multiple options are being considered.

In addition to activity in Alpine High, the Permian region drilled or participated in 170 wells in 2017, with a 99 percent success rate.

Apache plans to continue this elevated level of activity in the Permian region during 2018, while continuing to balance capital investments between its larger development project at Alpine High and focused exploration and development programs on other core assets in its Permian region. During 2018, the Company expects to average approximately 14 drilling rigs, which includes six to seven rigs at Alpine High focused on a combination of retention, development, and delineation drilling. Approximately $1.6 billion, or roughly two-thirds, of the Company’s 2018 capital upstream budget will be allocated to the Permian region. The Company anticipates investment of $500 million in the midstream development of Alpine High in 2018.

Midcontinent/Gulf Coast Region

Apache’s Midcontinent/Gulf Coast region includes 1.8 million gross acres and over 3,100 producing wells primarily in western Oklahoma, the Texas Panhandle and the Eagle Ford shale in east Texas. In 2017, the region accounted for 9 percent of the Company’s production and approximately 10 percent of the Company’s year-end estimated proved reserves.

In 2017, Apache reduced capital activity in the region and drilled only three operated wells during the year, which were all productive. The Company began allocating additional capital to the region in the fourth quarter, focusing on retaining acreage. In 2018, Apache plans to run a targeted program, drilling additional wells in the Woodford-SCOOP play. In addition, the region will continue its focus on high grading acreage and building its inventory of future drilling locations.

Gulf of Mexico Region

The Gulf of Mexico region comprises assets in the offshore waters of the Gulf of Mexico and onshore Louisiana. In addition to its interest in several deepwater exploration and development offshore leases, when the Company sold in 2013 substantially all of its offshore assets in water depths less than 1,000 feet, it retained a 50 percent ownership interest in all exploration blocks and in horizons below production in development blocks, and access to existing infrastructure. Apache’s offshore technical teams continue to focus on evaluating subsalt and other deeper exploration opportunities in water depths less than 1,000 feet, which have been relatively untested by the industry, where high-potential deep hydrocarbon plays may exist. During 2017, Apache’s Gulf of Mexico region contributed

6.1

Mboe/d to the Company’s total production.


Canada Region

On June 30, 2017, Apache completed the sale of its Canadian assets at Midale and House Mountain for cash proceeds of approximately $228 million. In August 2017, Apache completed the sale of its remaining Canadian operations for cash proceeds of approximately $478 million. The sale of Apache’s Canadian operations further streamlines its portfolio, enabling the Company to allocate a higher percentage of capital to the Permian Basin. In 2017, the region accounted for 7 percent of the Company’s production.

North America Marketing

In general, most of the Company’s North American gas is sold at either monthly or daily index based prices.  The tenor of the Company’s sales contracts span from daily to multi-year transactions. Natural gas is sold to a variety of customers that include local distribution, utility, and midstream companies as well as end-users, marketers, and integrated major oil companies. Apache strives to maintain a diverse client portfolio, which is intended to reduce the concentration of credit risk.  In 2017, Apache began selling gas that was consumed in Mexico and to the only operational LNG export facility in the US.

In December 2017, Apache announced it had secured 500 MMcf/d of natural gas transport capacity via the Gulf Coast Express Pipeline Project (GCX Project). The GCX Project will connect the Waha Hub near Coyanosa, Texas in the Permian Basin to Agua Dulce, Texas near the Texas Gulf Coast and will provide Apache access to domestic industrial and utility users as well as incremental demand for LNG exports and Mexico markets. As a significant shipper on the GCX line, Apache has also secured an option for up to a 15 percent equity stake in the pipeline. This takeaway capacity will allow greater flexibility and market optionality for Apache’s Permian production, including increasing volumes from Alpine High. The GCX pipeline is a joint project of Kinder Morgan Texas Pipeline LLC, a subsidiary of Kinder Morgan, Inc., DCP Midstream, LP, and an affiliate of Targa Resources Corp. The project is expected to be in service in October 2019, pending the receipt of necessary regulatory approvals.

Apache primarily markets its North American crude oil to integrated major oil companies, marketing and transportation companies, and refiners based on a West Texas Intermediate (WTI) price, adjusted for quality, transportation, and a market-reflective differential.

In the U.S., Apache’s objective is to maximize the value of crude oil sold by identifying the best markets and most economical transportation routes available to move the product. Sales contracts are generally 30-day evergreen contracts that renew automatically until canceled by either party. These contracts provide for sales that are priced daily at prevailing market prices. Also, from time to time, the Company will enter into physical term sales contracts for durations up to five years. These term contracts typically have a firm transportation commitment and often provide for the higher of prevailing market prices from multiple market hubs.

Apache’s NGL production is sold under contracts with prices based on local supply and demand conditions, less the costs for transportation and fractionation, or on a weighted-average sales price received by the purchaser.

International

In


, international assets contributed

48 percent

of Apache’s production and

57 percent

of oil and gas revenues. Approximately

31 percent

of estimated proved reserves at year-end were located outside North America.

Apache has two international regions:

•

The Egypt region includes onshore conventional assets in Egypt’s Western Desert.

•

The North Sea region includes offshore assets based in the United Kingdom.

The Company also has an offshore exploration program in Suriname.

Egypt

Apache’s Egypt operations are conducted pursuant to production sharing contracts (PSCs). Under the terms of the Company’s PSCs, the contractor partner (Contractor) bears the risk and cost of exploration, development, and production activities. In return, if exploration is successful, the Contractor receives entitlement to variable physical volumes of hydrocarbons, representing recovery of the costs incurred and a stipulated share of production after cost recovery. Additionally, the Contractor’s income taxes, which remain the liability of the Contractor under domestic law, are paid by Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation (EGPC) on behalf of the Contractor out of EGPC’s production entitlement. Income taxes paid to the Arab Republic of Egypt on behalf of the Contractor are recognized as oil and gas sales revenue and income tax expense and reflected as production and estimated reserves. Because Contractor cost recovery entitlement and income taxes paid on its behalf are determined as a monetary amount, the quantities of production entitlement and estimated reserves attributable to these monetary amounts will fluctuate with commodity prices. In addition, because the Contractor income taxes are paid by EGPC, the amount of the income tax has no economic impact on Apache’s Egypt operations despite impacting Apache’s production and reserves.


Apache has 22 years of exploration, development and operations experience in Egypt and is one of the largest acreage holders in Egypt’s Western Desert. At year-end 2017, the Company held 5.6 million gross acres in 25 separate concessions. Development leases within concessions currently have expiration dates ranging from 4 to 20 years, with extensions possible for additional commercial discoveries or on a negotiated basis. Approximately 69 percent of the Company’s gross acreage in Egypt is undeveloped, providing us with considerable exploration and development opportunities for the future. During 2017, Apache received final approval of the NW Razzak and South Alam El Shawish concession blocks. Combined, the two concessions added approximately 1.6 million net undeveloped acres in Egypt.

The Company’s estimated proved reserves in Egypt are reported under the economic interest method and exclude the host country’s share of reserves. In addition, Sinopec International Petroleum Exploration and Production Corporation (Sinopec) holds a one-third minority participation interest in Apache’s oil and gas operations in Egypt. The Egypt region, including the one-third noncontrolling interest, contributed

35 percent

of


production,

20 percent

of year-end estimated proved reserves, and

33 percent

of estimated discounted future net cash flows. Excluding the noncontrolling interest, Egypt contributed

27 percent

of


production,

15 percent

of year-end estimated proved reserves, and

25 percent

of estimated discounted future net cash flows.

In 2017, the region drilled 67 development and 27 exploration wells. Approximately 52 percent of the exploration wells were successful, further expanding Apache’s presence in the westernmost concessions and unlocking additional opportunities in existing plays. A key component of the region’s success has been the ability to acquire and evaluate 3-D seismic surveys that enable Apache’s technical teams to consistently high-grade existing prospects and identify new targets across multiple pay horizons in the Cretaceous, Jurassic, and deeper Paleozoic formations. In September 2017, Apache began shooting high-resolution 3-D seismic surveys in the West Kalabsha concession, the first of its kind in the Western Desert. The Company will ultimately expand the shoot to cover the majority of its acreage in Egypt. The program will provide newer vintage, higher resolution imaging of the substrata across Apache’s Western Desert position, allowing the Company to build and high-grade its drilling inventory.

Egypt Marketing

Apache’s gas production in Egypt is sold to EGPC primarily under an industry-pricing formula, a sliding scale based on Dated Brent crude oil with a minimum of $1.50 per MMBtu and a maximum of $2.65 per MMBtu, plus an upward adjustment for liquids content. The region averaged

$2.80

per Mcf in


.

Oil production is sold to third parties in the export market or to EGPC when called upon to supply domestic demand. Oil production sold to third parties is exported from or sold at one of two terminals on the northern coast of Egypt. Oil production sold to EGPC is sold at prices equivalent to the export market

.

North Sea

Apache has interests in approximately 362,000 gross acres in the U.K. North Sea. The region contributed

13 percent

of Apache’s 2017 production and approximately

11 percent

of year-end estimated proved reserves.

Apache entered the North Sea in 2003 after acquiring an approximate 97 percent working interest in the Forties field (Forties). Since acquiring Forties, Apache has actively invested in the region and has established a large inventory of drilling prospects through successful exploration programs and the interpretation of acquired 3-D and 4-D seismic data. Building upon its success in Forties, in 2011 Apache acquired Mobil North Sea Limited, providing the region with additional exploration and development opportunities across numerous fields, including operated interests in the Beryl, Nevis, Nevis South, Skene, and Buckland fields and a non-operated interest in the Maclure field. Apache also has a non-operated interest in the Nelson field. The Beryl field, which is a geologically complex area with multiple fields and stacked pay potential, provides for significant exploration opportunity. The North Sea region plays a strategic role in Apache’s portfolio by providing competitive investment opportunities and potential reserve upside with high-impact exploration potential.

During 2017, the region drilled 10 development wells with a 90 percent success rate: four at Forties, four at Beryl, and two at Callater. In addition, it drilled or participated in four exploration wells with a 25 percent success rate. Exploration success over the past three years has averaged 50 percent.

Apache progressed on the 2015 Callater exploration discovery in the Beryl area, with first production commencing in the second half of 2017. Apache currently has two highly productive wells at Callater, with a current oil cut of approximately 70 percent. Apache holds a 55 percent working interest in Callater and operates the field. Appraisal and development plans continue to be finalized on the Seagull and Corona discoveries, while the more recent Storr discovery continues to be evaluated. Apache holds a 35, 100, and 55 percent interest in the Seagull, Corona and Storr discoveries, respectively.

The Company plans to average three rigs in the North Sea for 2018, with two platform rigs (one at Forties and one at Beryl) and a semi-submersible rig.


North Sea Marketing

Apache has traditionally sold its North Sea crude oil under term contracts, with a market-based index price plus a premium, which reflects the higher market value for term arrangements.

Natural gas from the Beryl field is processed through the SAGE gas plant. The gas is sold to a third party at the St. Fergus entry point of the national grid on a National Balancing Point index price basis. The condensate mix from the SAGE plant is processed further downstream. The split streams of propane and butane are sold on a monthly entitlement basis, and condensate is sold on a spot basis at the Braefoot Bay terminal using index pricing less transportation. As a result of the recent SAGE divestiture, Apache expects to incur additional tariffs in its North Sea region ranging from

$7 million

to

$10 million

annually.

Australia

During the second quarter of 2015, Apache completed the sale of its Australian LNG business and oil and gas assets. Results of operations and consolidated cash flows for the divested Australia assets are reflected as discontinued operations in the Company’s financial statements for all periods presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Other Exploration

New Ventures

Apache’s global New Ventures team provides exposure to new growth opportunities by looking outside of the Company’s traditional core areas and targeting higher-risk, higher-reward exploration opportunities located in frontier basins as well as new plays in more mature basins. Apache drilled an exploration well in the first half of 2017 in offshore Suriname, which was unsuccessful. Plans for 2018 include continued analysis and review of the Company’s deepwater prospects offshore Suriname.

Delivery Commitments

Apache has certain long-term contracts with fixed minimum sales volume commitments for natural gas in the Permian Basin. These contracts require Apache to deliver approximately 144 bcf for the period from 2018 through 2020.

We expect to fulfill the majority of these delivery commitments with production from our proved reserves. Any remaining commitments may be fulfilled with production from continued development and/or spot market purchases as necessary. We have not experienced any significant constraints in satisfying the committed quantities required by our sales commitments.

Drilling Statistics

Worldwide in


, Apache participated in drilling 353 gross wells, with 323 (92 percent) completed as producers. Historically, Apache’s drilling activities in the U.S. have generally concentrated on exploitation and extension of existing producing fields rather than exploration. As a general matter, Apache’s operations outside of North America focus on a mix of exploration and development wells. In addition to Apache’s completed wells, at year-end a number of wells had not yet reached completion: 126 gross (95.8 net) in the U.S., 18 gross (15.7 net) in Egypt, and 1 gross (0.5 net) in the North Sea.

The following table shows the results of the oil and gas wells drilled and completed for each of the last three fiscal years:

Productive Oil and Gas Wells

The number of productive oil and gas wells, operated and non-operated, in which the Company had an interest as of

December 31, 2017

, is set forth below:

Gross natural gas and crude oil wells include 570 wells with multiple completions.


Production, Pricing, and Lease Operating Cost Data

The following table describes, for each of the last three fiscal years, oil, NGL, and gas production volumes, average lease operating costs per boe (including transportation costs but excluding severance and other taxes), and average sales prices for each of the countries where the Company has operations:

(1)

During the third quarter of 2017, Apache completed the sale of its Canadian operations.

(2)

Includes production volumes attributable to a one-third noncontrolling interest in Egypt.

(3)

Sales volumes from the North Sea for


and


were

21.2

MMboe and

24.5

MMboe, respectively. Sales volumes may vary from production volumes as a result of the timing of liftings in the Beryl field.

Gross and Net Undeveloped and Developed Acreage

The following table sets out Apache’s gross and net acreage position as of

December 31, 2017

, in each country where the Company has operations:

As of December 31, 2017, 39 percent of U.S. net undeveloped acreage was held by production.

As of

December 31, 2017

, Apache had 608,000 net undeveloped acres scheduled to expire by year-end


if production is not established or Apache takes no other action to extend the terms. Additionally, Apache has 806,000 and 2.1 million net undeveloped acres set to expire in


and


, respectively. The Company strives to extend the terms of many of these licenses


and concession areas through operational or administrative actions, but cannot assure that such extensions can be achieved on an economic basis or otherwise on terms agreeable to both the Company and third parties, including governments.

Exploration concessions in Apache’s Egypt region comprise a significant portion of Apache’s net undeveloped acreage expiring over the next three years. Apache has 354,000 net undeveloped acres expiring in Egypt during


. Approximately 615,000 and 118,000 net undeveloped acres are set to expire in


and


, respectively. There were no reserves recorded on this undeveloped acreage. Apache will continue to pursue acreage extensions and access to new concessions in areas in which it believes exploration opportunities exist. During 2017, Apache received final approval of the NW Razzak and South Alam El Shawish concession blocks. Combined, the two concessions added approximately 1.6 million net undeveloped acres in Egypt.

Additionally, Apache has exploration interests in Suriname consisting of 1.8 million net undeveloped acres in two offshore blocks. Apache has acquired 3-D seismic surveys over all the acreage. No reserves have been booked on this undeveloped acreage.

Estimated Proved Reserves and Future Net Cash Flows

Proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of natural gas, crude oil, condensate, and NGLs, which by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations. Estimated proved developed oil and gas reserves can be expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods. The Company reports all estimated proved reserves held under production-sharing arrangements utilizing the “economic interest” method, which excludes the host country’s share of reserves.

Estimated reserves that can be produced economically through application of improved recovery techniques are included in the “proved” classification when successful testing by a pilot project or the operation of an active, improved recovery program using reliable technology establishes the reasonable certainty for the engineering analysis on which the project or program is based. Economically producible means a resource that generates revenue that exceeds, or is reasonably expected to exceed, the costs of the operation. Reasonable certainty means a high degree of confidence that the quantities will be recovered. Reliable technology is a grouping of one or more technologies (including computational methods) that has been field-tested and has been demonstrated to provide reasonably certain results with consistency and repeatability in the formation being evaluated or in an analogous formation. In estimating its proved reserves, Apache uses several different traditional methods that can be classified in three general categories: (1) performance-based methods; (2) volumetric-based methods; and (3) analogy with similar properties. Apache will, at times, utilize additional technical analysis, such as computer reservoir models, petrophysical techniques, and proprietary 3-D seismic interpretation methods, to provide additional support for more complex reservoirs. Information from this additional analysis is combined with traditional methods outlined above to enhance the certainty of the Company’s reserve estimates.

Proved undeveloped reserves include those reserves that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion. Undeveloped reserves may be classified as proved reserves on undrilled acreage directly offsetting development areas that are reasonably certain of production when drilled, or where reliable technology provides reasonable certainty of economic producibility. Undrilled locations may be classified as having undeveloped reserves only if a development plan has been adopted indicating that they are scheduled to be drilled within five years, unless specific circumstances justify a longer time period.


The following table shows proved oil, NGL, and gas reserves as of

December 31, 2017

, based on average commodity prices in effect on the first day of each month in


, held flat for the life of the production, except where future oil and gas sales are covered by physical contract terms. This table shows reserves on a boe basis in which natural gas is converted to an equivalent barrel of oil based on a ratio of 6 Mcf to 1 bbl. This ratio is not reflective of the current price ratio between the two products.

(1)

Includes total proved developed and total proved undeveloped reserves of


MMboe and


MMboe, respectively, attributable to a one-third noncontrolling interest in Egypt.

As of

December 31, 2017

, Apache had total estimated proved reserves of


MMbbls of crude oil,


MMbbls of NGLs, and

2.3

Tcf of natural gas. Combined, these total estimated proved reserves are the volume equivalent of

1.2 billion

barrels of oil or 7.0 Tcf of natural gas, of which oil represents 50 percent. As of

December 31, 2017

, the Company’s proved developed reserves totaled

1,024

MMboe and estimated PUD reserves totaled


MMboe, or approximately 13 percent of worldwide total proved reserves. Apache has elected not to disclose probable or possible reserves in this filing.

During


, Apache added


MMboe of proved reserves through exploration and development activity and


MMboe through purchases of minerals in-place. Apache sold a combined


MMboe primarily through divestitures transactions in Canada. During


, Apache also had combined

upward

revisions of previously estimated reserves of


MMboe. Changes in product prices accounted for


MMboe, offset by engineering and performance downward revisions totaling


MMboe.

The Company’s estimates of proved reserves, proved developed reserves, and PUD reserves as of

December 31, 2017

,


, and


, changes in estimated proved reserves during the last three years, and estimates of future net cash flows from proved reserves are contained in Note 15—Supplemental Oil and Gas Disclosures in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part IV, Item 15 of this Form 10-K. Estimated future net cash flows were calculated using a discount rate of 10 percent per annum, end of period costs, and an unweighted arithmetic average of commodity prices in effect on the first day of each of the previous 12 months, held flat for the life of the production, except where prices are defined by contractual arrangements.

Proved Undeveloped Reserves

The Company’s total estimated PUD reserves of


MMboe as of

December 31, 2017

, increased by 14 MMboe from 137 MMboe of PUD reserves reported at the end of


. During the year, Apache converted 60 MMboe of PUD reserves to proved developed reserves through development drilling activity. In North America, Apache converted 39 MMboe, with the remaining 21 MMboe in Apache’s international areas. Apache sold 42 MMboe and acquired 1 MMboe of PUD reserves during the year. Apache added 126 MMboe of new PUD reserves through extensions and discoveries. Apache recognized a 17 MMboe downward engineering revision in proved undeveloped reserves during the year, a 3 MMboe upward revision associated with product prices, and a 3 MMboe upward revision associated with interest revisions.

During the year, a total of approximately $369 million was spent on projects associated with reserves that were carried as PUD reserves at the end of


. A portion of Apache’s costs incurred each year relate to development projects that will be converted to proved developed reserves in future years. Apache spent approximately $201 million on PUD reserve development activity in North America and $168 million in the international areas. As of

December 31, 2017

, Apache had no material amounts of proved undeveloped reserves scheduled to be developed beyond five years from initial disclosure.


Preparation of Oil and Gas Reserve Information

Apache’s reported reserves are reasonably certain estimates which, by their very nature, are subject to revision. These estimates are reviewed throughout the year and revised either upward or downward, as warranted.

Apache’s proved reserves are estimated at the property level and compiled for reporting purposes by a centralized group of experienced reservoir engineers that is independent of the operating groups. These engineers interact with engineering and geoscience personnel in each of Apache’s operating areas and with accounting and marketing employees to obtain the necessary data for projecting future production, costs, net revenues, and ultimate recoverable reserves. All relevant data is compiled in a computer database application, to which only authorized personnel are given security access rights consistent with their assigned job function. Reserves are reviewed internally with senior management and presented to Apache’s Board of Directors in summary form on a quarterly basis. Annually, each property is reviewed in detail by our corporate and operating region engineers to ensure forecasts of operating expenses, netback prices, production trends, and development timing are reasonable.

Apache’s Executive Vice President of Corporate Reservoir Engineering is the person primarily responsible for overseeing the preparation of our internal reserve estimates and for coordinating any reserves audits conducted by a third-party engineering firm. He has a Bachelor of Science degree in Petroleum Engineering and over 37 years of industry experience with positions of increasing responsibility within Apache’s corporate reservoir engineering department. The Executive Vice President of Corporate Reservoir Engineering reports directly to our Chief Executive Officer.

The estimate of reserves disclosed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K is prepared by the Company’s internal staff, and the Company is responsible for the adequacy and accuracy of those estimates. However, the Company engages Ryder Scott Company, L.P. Petroleum Consultants (Ryder Scott) to review our processes and the reasonableness of our estimates of proved hydrocarbon liquid and gas reserves. The Company selects the properties for review by Ryder Scott based primarily on relative reserve value. The Company also considers other factors such as geographic location, new wells drilled during the year and reserves volume. During


, the properties selected for each country ranged from 87 to 100 percent of the total future net cash flows discounted at 10 percent. These properties also accounted for over 98 percent of the reserves value of our international proved reserves and 88 percent of the new wells drilled in each country. In addition, all fields containing five percent or more of the Company’s total proved reserves volume were included in Ryder Scott’s review. The review covered 84 percent of total proved reserves by volume.

During


,


, and


, Ryder Scott’s review covered 92, 92, and 90 percent, respectively, of the Company’s worldwide estimated proved reserves value and 84, 83, and 83 percent, respectively, of the Company’s total proved reserves volume. Ryder Scott’s review of


covered 84 percent of U.S., 85 percent of Egypt, and 81 percent of the U.K.’s total proved reserves.

Ryder Scott’s review of 2016 covered 81 percent of U.S., 81 percent of Canada, 85 percent of Egypt, and 92 percent of the U.K.’s total proved reserves.

Ryder Scott’s review of 2015 covered 81 percent of U.S., 81 percent of Canada, 86 percent of Egypt, and 88 percent of the U.K.’s total proved reserves.

The Company has filed Ryder Scott’s independent report as an exhibit to this Form 10-K.

According to Ryder Scott’s opinion, based on their review, including the data, technical processes, and interpretations presented by Apache, the overall procedures and methodologies utilized by Apache in determining the proved reserves comply with the current SEC regulations, and the overall proved reserves for the reviewed properties as estimated by Apache are, in aggregate, reasonable within the established audit tolerance guidelines as set forth in the Society of Petroleum Engineers auditing standards.

Title to Interests

As is customary in our industry, a preliminary review of title records, which may include opinions or reports of appropriate professionals or counsel, is made at the time we acquire properties. We believe that our title to all of the various interests set forth above is satisfactory and consistent with the standards generally accepted in the oil and gas industry, subject only to immaterial exceptions that do not detract substantially from the value of the interests or materially interfere with their use in our operations. The interests owned by us may be subject to one or more royalty, overriding royalty, or other outstanding interests (including disputes related to such interests) customary in the industry. The interests may additionally be subject to obligations or duties under applicable laws, ordinances, rules, regulations, and orders of arbitral or governmental authorities. In addition, the interests may be subject to burdens such as production payments, net profits interests, liens incident to operating agreements and current taxes, development obligations under oil and gas leases, and other encumbrances, easements, and restrictions, none of which detract substantially from the value of the interests or materially interfere with their use in our operations.

Additional Information about Apache

Response Plans and Available Resources

Apache and its wholly owned subsidiary, Apache Deepwater LLC (ADW), developed Oil Spill Response Plans (the Plans) for their respective Gulf of Mexico operations and offshore operations in the North Sea and Suriname. These plans ensure rapid and effective responses to spill events that may occur on such entities’ operated properties. Annually, drills are conducted to measure and maintain the effectiveness of the Plans.

Apache is a member of Oil Spill Response Limited (OSRL), a large international oil spill response cooperative, which entitles any Apache entity worldwide to access OSRL’s services. Apache also has a contract for global response resources and services with National Response Corporation (NRC). NRC is the world’s largest commercial Oil Spill Response Organization and is the global leader in providing end-to-end environmental, industrial, and emergency response solutions with operating bases in 13 countries.

In the event of a spill in the Gulf of Mexico, Clean Gulf Associates (CGA) is the primary oil spill response association available to Apache and ADW. Both Apache and ADW are members of CGA, a not-for-profit association of producing and pipeline companies operating in the Gulf of Mexico. CGA was created to provide a means of effectively staging response equipment and providing immediate spill response for its member companies’ operations in the Gulf of Mexico. In the event of a spill, CGA’s equipment, which is positioned at various staging points around the Gulf, is ready to be mobilized. In addition, ADW is a member of Marine Spill Response Corporation (MSRC), and their equipment and resources are also available to ADW for its deepwater Gulf of Mexico and new venture operations.

An Apache subsidiary is also a member of the Marine Well Containment Company (MWCC) to help the Company fulfill the government’s permit requirements for containment and oil spill response plans in deepwater Gulf of Mexico operations. MWCC is a not-for-profit, stand-alone organization whose goal is to improve capabilities for containing an underwater well control incident in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. Members and their affiliates have access to MWCC’s extensive containment network and systems. As of

December 31, 2017

, Apache’s investment in MWCC totaled $150 million and is reflected in “Deferred charges and other” in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet.


Competitive Conditions

The oil and gas business is highly competitive in the exploration for and acquisitions of reserves, the acquisition of oil and gas leases, equipment and personnel required to find and produce reserves, and the gathering and marketing of oil, gas, and natural gas liquids. Our competitors include national oil companies, major integrated oil and gas companies, other independent oil and gas companies, and participants in other industries supplying energy and fuel to industrial, commercial, and individual consumers.

Certain of our competitors may possess financial or other resources substantially larger than we possess or have established strategic long-term positions and maintain strong governmental relationships in countries in which we may seek new entry. As a consequence, we may be at a competitive disadvantage in bidding for leases or drilling rights.

However, we believe our diversified portfolio of core assets, which comprises large acreage positions and well-established production bases across three geographic areas, our balanced production mix between oil and gas, our management and incentive systems, and our experienced personnel give us a strong competitive position relative to many of our competitors who do not possess similar geographic and production diversity. Our global position provides a large inventory of geologic and geographic opportunities in the geographic areas in which we have producing operations to which we can reallocate capital investments in response to changes in commodity prices, local business environments, and markets. It also reduces the risk that we will be materially impacted by an event in a specific area or country.

Environmental Compliance

As an owner or lessee and operator of oil and gas properties and facilities, we are subject to numerous federal, provincial, state, local, and foreign country laws and regulations relating to discharge of materials into, and protection of, the environment. These laws and regulations may, among other things, impose liability on the lessee under an oil and gas lease for the cost of pollution clean-up resulting from operations, subject the lessee to liability for pollution damages and require suspension or cessation of operations in affected areas. Although environmental requirements have a substantial impact upon the energy industry as a whole, we do not believe that these requirements affect us differently, to any material degree, than other companies in our industry.

We have made and will continue to make expenditures in our efforts to comply with these requirements, which we believe are necessary business costs in the oil and gas industry. We have established policies for continuing compliance with environmental laws and regulations, including regulations applicable to our operations in all countries in which we do business. We have established operating procedures and training programs designed to limit the environmental impact of our field facilities and identify and comply with changes in existing laws and regulations. The costs incurred under these policies and procedures are inextricably connected to normal operating expenses such that we are unable to separate expenses related to environmental matters; however, we do not believe expenses related to training and compliance with regulations and laws that have been adopted or enacted to regulate the discharge of materials into the environment will have a material impact on our capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position.


ITEM 1A.

RISK FACTORS

Our business activities and the value of our securities are subject to significant hazards and risks, including those described below. If any of such events should occur, our business, financial condition, liquidity, and/or results of operations could be materially harmed, and holders and purchasers of our securities could lose part or all of their investments. Additional risks relating to our securities may be included in the prospectuses for securities we issue in the future.

Crude oil, natural gas, and NGL price volatility could adversely affect our operating results and the price of our common stock.

Our revenues, operating results, and future rate of growth depend highly upon the prices we receive for our crude oil, natural gas, and NGL production. Historically, the markets for these commodities have been volatile and are likely to continue to be volatile in the future. For example, the NYMEX daily settlement price for the prompt month oil contract in


ranged from a high of $60.42 per barrel to a low of $42.53 per barrel. The NYMEX daily settlement price for the prompt month natural gas contract in


ranged from a high of $3.50 per MMBtu to a low of $2.56 per MMBtu. The market prices for crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs depend on factors beyond our control. These factors include demand, which fluctuates with changes in market and economic conditions, and other factors, including:

•

worldwide and domestic supplies of crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs;

•

actions taken by foreign oil and gas producing nations, including the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC);

•

political conditions and events (including instability, changes in governments, or armed conflict) in oil and gas producing regions;

•

the level of global crude oil and natural gas inventories;

•

the price and level of imported foreign crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs;

•

the price and availability of alternative fuels, including coal and biofuels;

•

the availability of pipeline capacity and infrastructure;

•

the availability of crude oil transportation and refining capacity;

•

weather conditions;

•

domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes; and

•

the overall economic environment.

Our results of operations, as well as the carrying value of our oil and gas properties, are substantially dependent upon the prices of oil and natural gas, which have declined significantly since June 2014. Despite slight increases in oil and natural gas prices in


, prices have remained significantly lower than levels seen in recent years, which has adversely affected our revenues, operating income, cash flow, and proved reserves. Continued low prices could have a material adverse impact on our operations and limit our ability to fund capital expenditures. Without the ability to fund capital expenditures, we would be unable to replace reserves and production. Sustained low prices of crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs may further adversely impact our business as follows:

•

limiting our financial condition, liquidity, and/or ability to fund planned capital expenditures and operations;

•

reducing the amount of crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs that we can produce economically;

•

causing us to delay or postpone some of our capital projects;

•

reducing our revenues, operating income, and cash flows;

•

limiting our access to sources of capital, such as equity and long-term debt;

•

reducing the carrying value of our oil and gas properties, resulting in additional non-cash impairments;

•

reducing the carrying value of our gathering, transmission, and processing facilities, resulting in additional impairments; or

•

reducing the carrying value of goodwill.


Our ability to sell crude oil, natural gas, or NGLs and/or receive market prices for these commodities may be adversely affected by pipeline and gathering system capacity constraints and various transportation interruptions.

A portion of our crude oil, natural gas, and NGL production in any region may be interrupted, limited, or shut in, from time to time for numerous reasons, including as a result of weather conditions, accidents, loss of pipeline or gathering system access, field labor issues or strikes, or capital constraints that limit the ability of third parties to construct gathering systems, processing facilities, or interstate pipelines to transport our production, or we might voluntarily curtail production in response to market conditions. If a substantial amount of our production is interrupted at the same time, it could temporarily adversely affect our cash flows.

Future economic conditions in the U.S. and certain international markets may materially adversely impact our operating results.

Current global market conditions, and uncertainty, including economic instability in Europe and certain emerging markets, is likely to have significant long-term effects. Global economic growth drives demand for energy from all sources, including fossil fuels. A lower future economic growth rate could result in decreased demand growth for our oil and gas production as well as lower commodity prices, which would reduce our cash flows from operations and our profitability.

Weather and climate may have a significant adverse impact on our revenues and production.

Demand for oil and gas are, to a degree, dependent on weather and climate, which impact the price we receive for the commodities we produce. In addition, our exploration and development activities and equipment can be adversely affected by severe weather, such as freezing temperatures, hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico or storms in the North Sea, which may cause a loss of production from temporary cessation of activity or lost or damaged equipment. Our planning for normal climatic variation, insurance programs, and emergency recovery plans may inadequately mitigate the effects of such weather conditions, and not all such effects can be predicted, eliminated, or insured against.

Our operations involve a high degree of operational risk, particularly risk of personal injury, damage, or loss of equipment, and environmental accidents.

Our operations are subject to hazards and risks inherent in the drilling, production, and transportation of crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs, including:

•

well blowouts, explosions, and cratering;

•

pipeline or other facility ruptures and spills;

•

fires;

•

formations with abnormal pressures;

•

equipment malfunctions;

•

hurricanes, storms, and/or cyclones, which could affect our operations in areas such as on and offshore the Gulf Coast and North Sea and other natural disasters and weather conditions; and

•

surface spillage and surface or ground water contamination from petroleum constituents, saltwater, or hydraulic fracturing chemical additives.

Failure or loss of equipment as the result of equipment malfunctions, cyber attacks, or natural disasters such as hurricanes, could result in property damages, personal injury, environmental pollution and other damages for which we could be liable. Litigation arising from a catastrophic occurrence, such as a well blowout, explosion, or fire at a location where our equipment and services are used, or ground water contamination from hydraulic fracturing chemical additives may result in substantial claims for damages. Ineffective containment of a drilling well blowout or pipeline rupture, or surface spillage and surface or ground water contamination from petroleum constituents or hydraulic fracturing chemical additives could result in extensive environmental pollution and substantial remediation expenses. If a significant amount of our production is interrupted, our containment efforts prove to be ineffective or litigation arises as the result of a catastrophic occurrence, our cash flows, and, in turn, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.


Cyber attacks targeting systems and infrastructure used by the oil and gas industry may adversely impact our operations.

Our business has become increasingly dependent on digital technologies to conduct certain exploration, development, and production activities. We depend on digital technology to estimate quantities of oil and gas reserves, process and record financial and operating data, analyze seismic and drilling information, communicate with our employees and third party partners, and conduct many of our activities. Unauthorized access to our digital technology could lead to operational disruption, data corruption or exposure, communication interruption, loss of intellectual property, loss of confidential and fiduciary data, and loss or corruption of reserves or other proprietary information. Also, external digital technologies control nearly all of the oil and gas distribution and refining systems in the United States and abroad, which are necessary to transport and market our production. A cyber attack directed at oil and gas distribution systems could damage critical distribution and storage assets or the environment, delay or prevent delivery of production to markets, and make it difficult or impossible to accurately account for production and settle transactions.

While we have experienced cyber attacks in the past, we have not suffered any material losses as a result of such attacks; however, there is no assurance that we will not suffer such losses in the future. Further, as cyber attacks continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any vulnerabilities to cyber attacks.

Our commodity price risk management and trading activities may prevent us from benefiting fully from price increases and may expose us to other risks.

To the extent that we engage in price risk management activities to protect ourselves from commodity price declines, we may be prevented from realizing the benefits of price increases above the levels of the derivative instruments used to manage price risk. In addition, our hedging arrangements may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances, including instances in which:

•

our production falls short of the hedged volumes;

•

there is a widening of price-basis differentials between delivery points for our production and the delivery point assumed in the hedge arrangement;

•

the counterparties to our hedging or other price risk management contracts fail to perform under those arrangements; or

•

an unexpected event materially impacts commodity prices.

The credit risk of financial institutions could adversely affect us.

We have exposure to different counterparties, and we have entered into transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including commercial banks, investment banks, insurance companies, other investment funds, and other institutions. These transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty. Deterioration in the credit or financial markets may impact the credit ratings of our current and potential counterparties and affect their ability to fulfill their existing obligations to us and their willingness to enter into future transactions with us. We may also have exposure to financial institutions in the form of derivative transactions in connection with any hedges. We also have exposure to insurance companies in the form of claims under our policies. In addition, if any lender under our credit facilities is unable to fund its commitment, our liquidity will be reduced by an amount up to the aggregate amount of such lender’s commitment under our credit facilities.

We are exposed to a risk of financial loss if a counterparty fails to perform under a derivative contract. This risk of counterparty non-performance is of particular concern given the recent volatility of the financial markets and significant decline in commodity prices, which could lead to sudden changes in a counterparty’s liquidity and impair its ability to perform under the terms of the derivative contract. We are unable to predict sudden changes in a counterparty’s creditworthiness or ability to perform. Even if we do accurately predict sudden changes, our ability to negate the risk may be limited depending upon market conditions. Furthermore, the bankruptcy of one or more of our hedge providers, or some other similar proceeding or liquidity constraint, might make it unlikely that we would be able to collect all or a significant portion of amounts owed to us by the distressed entity or entities. During periods of falling commodity prices our hedge receivable positions increase, which increases our exposure. If the creditworthiness of our counterparties deteriorates and results in their nonperformance, we could incur a significant loss.


The distressed financial conditions of our purchasers and partners could have an adverse impact on us in the event they are unable to pay us for the products or services we provide or to reimburse us for their share of costs.

Concerns about global economic conditions and the volatility of oil, natural gas, and NGL prices have had a significant adverse impact on the oil and gas industry. We are exposed to risk of financial loss from trade, joint venture, joint interest billing, and other receivables. We sell our crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs to a variety of purchasers. As operator, we pay expenses and bill our non-operating partners for their respective shares of costs. As a result of current economic conditions and the severe decline in commodity prices, some of our customers and non-operating partners may experience severe financial problems that may have a significant impact on their creditworthiness. We cannot provide assurance that one or more of our financially distressed customers or non-operating partners will not default on their obligations to us or that such a default or defaults will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, future results of operations, or future cash flows. Furthermore, the bankruptcy of one or more of our customers or non-operating partners, or some other similar proceeding or liquidity constraint, might make it unlikely that we would be able to collect all or a significant portion of amounts owed by the distressed entity or entities. Nonperformance by a trade creditor or non-operating partner could result in significant financial losses.

A downgrade in our credit rating could negatively impact our cost of and ability to access capital.

We receive debt ratings from the major credit rating agencies in the United States. Factors that may impact our credit ratings include debt levels, planned asset purchases or sales, and near-term and long-term production growth opportunities. Liquidity, asset quality, cost structure, product mix, and commodity pricing levels and others are also considered by the rating agencies. A ratings downgrade could adversely impact our ability to access debt markets in the future and increase the cost of future debt; past ratings downgrades have, and any future downgrades may require us to post letters of credit or other forms of collateral for certain obligations.  Throughout 2017, our credit rating remained unchanged by Moody’s at Baa3/Stable and Standard and Poor’s

at BBB/Stable. Any future downgrades could result in additional postings of collateral ranging from approximately $500 million to $1.4 billion, depending upon timing and availability of tax relief.

Market conditions may restrict our ability to obtain funds for future development and working capital needs, which may limit our financial flexibility.

The financial markets are subject to fluctuation and are vulnerable to unpredictable shocks. We have a significant development project inventory and an extensive exploration portfolio, which will require substantial future investment. We and/or our partners may need to seek financing in order to fund these or other future activities. Our future access to capital, as well as that of our partners and contractors, could be limited if the debt or equity markets are constrained. This could significantly delay development of our property interests.

Our ability to declare and pay dividends is subject to limitations.

The payment of future dividends on our capital stock is subject to the discretion of our board of directors, which considers, among other factors, our operating results, overall financial condition, credit-risk considerations, and capital requirements, as well as general business and market conditions. Our board of directors is not required to declare dividends on our common stock and may decide not to declare dividends.

Any indentures and other financing agreements that we enter into in the future may limit our ability to pay cash dividends on our capital stock, including common stock. In addition, under Delaware law, dividends on capital stock may only be paid from “surplus,” which is the amount by which the fair value of our total assets exceeds the sum of our total liabilities, including contingent liabilities, and the amount of our capital; if there is no surplus, cash dividends on capital stock may only be paid from our net profits for the then current and/or the preceding fiscal year. Further, even if we are permitted under our contractual obligations and Delaware law to pay cash dividends on common stock, we may not have sufficient cash to pay dividends in cash on our common stock.

Discoveries or acquisitions of additional reserves are needed to avoid a material decline in reserves and production.

The production rate from oil and gas properties generally declines as reserves are depleted, while related per-unit production costs generally increase as a result of decreasing reservoir pressures and other factors. Therefore, unless we add reserves through exploration and development activities or, through engineering studies, identify additional behind-pipe zones, secondary recovery reserves, or tertiary recovery reserves, or acquire additional properties containing proved reserves, our estimated proved reserves will decline materially as reserves are produced. Future oil and gas production is, therefore, highly dependent upon our level of success in acquiring or finding additional reserves on an economic basis. Furthermore, if oil or gas prices increase, our cost for additional reserves could also increase.


We may not realize an adequate return on wells that we drill.

Drilling for oil and gas involves numerous risks, including the risk that we will not encounter commercially productive oil or gas reservoirs. The wells we drill or participate in may not be productive, and we may not recover all or any portion of our investment in those wells. The seismic data and other technologies we use do not allow us to know conclusively prior to drilling a well that crude or natural gas is present or may be produced economically. The costs of drilling, completing, and operating wells are often uncertain, and drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed, or canceled as a result of a variety of factors including, but not limited to:

•

unexpected drilling conditions;

•

pressure or irregularities in formations;

•

equipment failures or accidents;

•

fires, explosions, blowouts, and surface cratering;

•

marine risks such as capsizing, collisions, and hurricanes;

•

other adverse weather conditions; and

•

increases in the cost of, or shortages or delays in the availability of, drilling rigs and equipment.

Future drilling activities may not be successful, and, if unsuccessful, this failure could have an adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial condition. While all drilling, whether developmental or exploratory, involves these risks, exploratory drilling involves greater risks of dry holes or failure to find commercial quantities of hydrocarbons.

Material differences between the estimated and actual timing of critical events or costs may affect the completion and commencement of production from development projects.

We are involved in several large development projects and the completion of these projects may be delayed beyond our anticipated completion dates. Our projects may be delayed by project approvals from joint venture partners, timely issuances of permits and licenses by governmental agencies, weather conditions, manufacturing and delivery schedules of critical equipment, and other unforeseen events. Delays and differences between estimated and actual timing of critical events may adversely affect our large development projects and our ability to participate in large-scale development projects in the future. In addition, our estimates of future development costs are based on current expectation of prices and other costs of equipment and personnel we will need to implement such projects. Our actual future development costs may be significantly higher than we currently estimate. If costs become too high, our development projects may become uneconomic to us, and we may be forced to abandon such development projects.

We may fail to fully identify potential problems related to acquired reserves or to properly estimate those reserves.

Although we perform a review of properties that we acquire that we believe is consistent with industry practices, such reviews are inherently incomplete. It generally is not feasible to review in-depth every individual property involved in each acquisition. Ordinarily, we will focus our review efforts on the higher-value properties and will sample the remainder. However, even a detailed review of records and properties may not necessarily reveal existing or potential problems, nor will it permit us as a buyer to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to assess fully and accurately their deficiencies and potential. Inspections may not always be performed on every well, and environmental problems, such as groundwater contamination, are not necessarily observable even when an inspection is undertaken. Even when problems are identified, we often assume certain environmental and other risks and liabilities in connection with acquired properties. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved oil and gas reserves and future production rates and costs with respect to acquired properties, and actual results may vary substantially from those assumed in the estimates. In addition, there can be no assurance that acquisitions will not have an adverse effect upon our operating results, particularly during the periods in which the operations of acquired businesses are being integrated into our ongoing operations.

Our liabilities could be adversely affected in the event one or more of our transaction counterparties become the subject of a bankruptcy case.

From time to time we have divested noncore or nonstrategic domestic and international assets. The agreements relating to these transactions contain provisions pursuant to which liabilities related to past and future operations have been allocated between the parties by means of liability assumptions, indemnities, escrows, trusts, and similar arrangements.  One of the most significant of these liabilities involves the decommissioning of wells and facilities previously owned by us. One or more of the counterparties


in these transactions could fail to perform its obligations under these agreements as a result of financial distress. In the event that any such counterparty were to become the subject of a case or proceeding under Title 11 of the United States Code or any other relevant insolvency law or similar law (which we collectively refer to as Insolvency Laws), the counterparty may not perform its obligations under the agreements related to these transactions. In that case, our remedy in the proceeding would be a claim for damages for the breach of the contractual arrangements, which may be either a secured claim or an unsecured claim depending on whether or not we have collateral from the counterparty for the performance of the obligations. Resolution of our claim for damages in such a proceeding may be delayed, and we may be forced to use available cash to cover the costs of the obligations assumed by the counterparties under such agreements should they arise.

Despite the provisions in our agreements requiring purchasers of our state or federal leasehold interests to assume certain liabilities and obligations related to such interests, if a purchaser of such interests becomes the subject of a case or proceeding under relevant Insolvency Laws or becomes unable financially to perform such liabilities or obligations, we would expect the relevant governmental authorities to require us to perform, and hold us responsible for, such liabilities and obligations. In such event, we may be forced to use available cash to cover the costs of such liabilities and obligations should they arise.

If a court or a governmental authority were to make any of the foregoing determinations or take any of the foregoing actions, or any similar determination or action, it could adversely impact our cash flows, operations, or financial condition.

Crude oil, natural gas, and NGL reserves are estimates, and actual recoveries may vary significantly.

There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating crude oil, natural gas, and NGL reserves and their value. Reservoir engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs that cannot be measured in an exact manner. Because of the high degree of judgment involved, the accuracy of any reserve estimate is inherently imprecise, and a function of the quality of available data and the engineering and geological interpretation. Our reserves estimates are based on 12-month average prices, except where contractual arrangements exist; therefore, reserves quantities will change when actual prices increase or decrease. In addition, results of drilling, testing, and production may substantially change the reserve estimates for a given reservoir over time. The estimates of our proved reserves and estimated future net revenues also depend on a number of factors and assumptions that may vary considerably from actual results, including:

•

historical production from the area compared with production from other areas;

•

the effects of regulations by governmental agencies, including changes to severance and excise taxes;

•

future operating costs and capital expenditures; and

•

workover and remediation costs.

For these reasons, estimates of the economically recoverable quantities of crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs attributable to any particular group of properties, classifications of those reserves and estimates of the future net cash flows expected from them prepared by different engineers or by the same engineers but at different times may vary substantially. Accordingly, reserves estimates may be subject to upward or downward adjustment, and actual production, revenue and expenditures with respect to our reserves likely will vary, possibly materially, from estimates.

Additionally, because some of our reserves estimates are calculated using volumetric analysis, those estimates are less reliable than the estimates based on a lengthy production history. Volumetric analysis involves estimating the volume of a reservoir based on the net feet of pay of the structure and an estimation of the area covered by the structure. In addition, realization or recognition of proved undeveloped reserves will depend on our development schedule and plans. A change in future development plans for proved undeveloped reserves could cause the discontinuation of the classification of these reserves as proved.

Certain of our undeveloped leasehold acreage is subject to leases that will expire over the next several years unless production is established on units containing the acreage.

A sizeable portion of our acreage is currently undeveloped. Unless production in paying quantities is established on units containing certain of these leases during their terms, the leases will expire. If our leases expire, we will lose our right to develop the related properties. Our drilling plans for these areas are subject to change based upon various factors, including drilling results, commodity prices, the availability and cost of capital, drilling, and production costs, availability of drilling services and equipment, gathering system and pipeline transportation constraints, and regulatory approvals.


We may incur significant costs related to environmental matters.

As an owner or lessee and operator of oil and gas properties, we are subject to various federal, provincial, state, local, and foreign country laws and regulations relating to discharge of materials into, and protection of, the environment. These laws and regulations may, among other things, impose liability on the lessee under an oil and gas lease for the cost of pollution clean-up and other remediation activities resulting from operations, subject the lessee to liability for pollution and other damages, limit or constrain operations in affected areas, and require suspension or cessation of operations in affected areas. Our efforts to limit our exposure to such liability and cost may prove inadequate and result in significant adverse effects to our results of operations. In addition, it is possible that the increasingly strict requirements imposed by environmental laws and enforcement policies could require us to make significant capital expenditures. Such capital expenditures could adversely impact our cash flows and our financial condition.

Our North American operations are subject to governmental risks.

Our North American operations have been, and at times in the future may be, affected by political developments and by federal, state, and local laws and regulations such as restrictions on production, changes in taxes, royalties and other amounts payable to governments or governmental agencies, price or gathering rate controls, and environmental protection laws and regulations.

In response to the Deepwater Horizon incident in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico in April 2010, and as directed by the Secretary of the U.S. Department of the Interior, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) and the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) issued guidelines and regulations regarding safety, environmental matters, drilling equipment, and decommissioning applicable to drilling in the Gulf of Mexico. These regulations imposed additional requirements and caused delays with respect to development and production activities in the Gulf of Mexico.

With respect to oil and gas operations in the Gulf of Mexico, the BOEM has issued a Notice to Lessees (NTL No. 2016-N01) significantly revising the obligations of companies operating in the Gulf of Mexico to provide supplemental assurances of performance with respect to plugging, abandonment, and decommissioning obligations associated with wells, platforms, structures, and facilities located upon or used in connection with such companies’ oil and gas leases. While requirements under the NTL have not yet been fully implemented by BOEM, the NTL will likely require that Apache provide additional security to BOEM with respect to plugging, abandonment, and decommissioning obligations relating to Apache’s current ownership interests in various Gulf of Mexico leases. We are working closely with BOEM to make arrangements for the provision of such additional required security, if such security becomes necessary under the NTL. Additionally, we are not able to predict the effect that these changes might have on counterparties to which Apache has sold Gulf of Mexico assets or with whom Apache has joint ownership. Such changes could cause the bonding obligations of such parties to increase substantially, thereby causing a significant impact on the counterparties’ solvency and ability to continue as a going concern.

New political developments, laws, and the enactment of new or stricter regulations in the Gulf of Mexico or otherwise impacting our North American operations, and increased liability for companies operating in this sector may adversely impact our results of operations.

Changes to existing regulations related to emissions and the impact of any changes in climate could adversely impact our business.

Certain countries where we operate, including the United Kingdom, either tax or assess some form of greenhouse gas (GHG) related fees on our operations. Exposure has not been material to date, although a change in existing regulations could adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations.

In the event the predictions for rising temperatures and sea levels suggested by reports of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change do transpire, we do not believe those events by themselves are likely to impact our assets or operations. However, any increase in severe weather could have a material adverse effect on our assets and operations.

The present U.S. federal and state income tax laws affecting oil and gas exploration, development, and extraction may be modified by administrative, legislative, or judicial interpretation at any time. Future legislation may result in the elimination of certain U.S. federal income tax deductions currently available with respect to oil and gas exploration and development.

On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Act) was signed into law. In addition to reducing the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent effective January 1, 2018, certain provisions in the Act move the U.S. away from a worldwide tax system and closer to a territorial system for earnings of foreign corporations, establishing a participation exemption


system for taxation of foreign income. The new law includes a transition rule to effect this participation exemption regime. The Act also includes provisions which could impact or limit the Company’s ability to deduct interest expense or utilize net operating losses beginning in 2018. The Company continues to assess other provisions of the Act including, among other items, the interaction between the deemed repatriation of foreign earnings and 2017 net operating losses as well as the applicability of new taxes on certain future foreign earnings.

The U.S. federal and state income tax laws affecting oil and gas exploration, development, and extraction may be further modified by administrative, legislative, or judicial interpretation at any time. Previous legislative proposals, if enacted into law, could make significant changes to such laws, including the elimination of certain key U.S. federal income tax incentives currently available to oil and gas exploration and production companies. These changes include, but are not limited to, (i) the repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for oil and gas properties, (ii) the elimination of current deductions for intangible drilling and development costs, and (iii) an extension of the amortization period for certain geological and geophysical expenditures. The passage or adoption of these changes, or similar changes, could eliminate or postpone certain tax deductions that are currently available with respect to oil and gas exploration and development. We are unable to predict whether any of these changes or other proposals will be enacted. Any such changes could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

Proposed federal, state, or local regulation regarding hydraulic fracturing could increase our operating and capital costs.

Several proposals are before the U.S. Congress that, if implemented, would either prohibit or restrict the practice of hydraulic fracturing or subject the process to regulation under the Safe Drinking Water Act. Several states are considering legislation to regulate hydraulic fracturing practices that could impose more stringent permitting, transparency, and well construction requirements on hydraulic-fracturing operations or otherwise seek to ban fracturing activities altogether. Hydraulic fracturing of wells and subsurface water disposal are also under public and governmental scrutiny due to potential environmental and physical impacts, including possible contamination of groundwater and drinking water and possible links to earthquakes. In addition, some municipalities have significantly limited or prohibited drilling activities and/or hydraulic fracturing, or are considering doing so. We routinely use fracturing techniques in the U.S. and other regions to expand the available space for natural gas and oil to migrate toward the wellbore. It is typically done at substantial depths in formations with low permeability.

Although it is not possible at this time to predict the final outcome of the legislation regarding hydraulic fracturing, any new federal, state, or local restrictions on hydraulic fracturing that may be imposed in areas in which we conduct business could result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions in the U.S.

International operations have uncertain political, economic, and other risks.

Our operations outside North America are based primarily in Egypt and the United Kingdom. On a barrel equivalent basis, approximately

48 percent

of our


production was outside North America, and approximately

31 percent

of our estimated proved oil and gas reserves on

December 31, 2017

, were located outside North America. As a result, a significant portion of our production and resources are subject to the increased political and economic risks and other factors associated with international operations including, but not limited to:

•

general strikes and civil unrest;

•

the risk of war, acts of terrorism, expropriation and resource nationalization, forced renegotiation or modification of existing contracts;

•

import and export regulations;

•

taxation policies, including royalty and tax increases and retroactive tax claims, and investment restrictions;

•

price control;

•

transportation regulations and tariffs;

•

constrained natural gas markets dependent on demand in a single or limited geographical area;

•

exchange controls, currency fluctuations, devaluation, or other activities that limit or disrupt markets and restrict payments or the movement of funds;

•

laws and policies of the United States affecting foreign trade, including trade sanctions;

•

the possibility of being subject to exclusive jurisdiction of foreign courts in connection with legal disputes relating to licenses to operate and concession rights in countries where we currently operate;


•

the possible inability to subject foreign persons, especially foreign oil ministries and national oil companies, to the jurisdiction of courts in the United States; and

•

difficulties in enforcing our rights against a governmental agency because of the doctrine of sovereign immunity and foreign sovereignty over international operations.

Foreign countries have occasionally asserted rights to oil and gas properties through border disputes. If a country claims superior rights to oil and gas leases or concessions granted to us by another country, our interests could decrease in value or be lost. Even our smaller international assets may affect our overall business and results of operations by distracting management’s attention from our more significant assets. Certain regions of the world in which we operate have a history of political and economic instability. This instability could result in new governments or the adoption of new policies that might result in a substantially more hostile attitude toward foreign investments such as ours. In an extreme case, such a change could result in termination of contract rights and expropriation of our assets. This could adversely affect our interests and our future profitability.

The impact that future terrorist attacks or regional hostilities as have occurred in Egypt and Libya may have on the oil and gas industry in general, and on our operations in particular, is not known at this time. Uncertainty surrounding military strikes or a sustained military campaign may affect operations in unpredictable ways, including disruptions of fuel supplies and markets, particularly oil, and the possibility that infrastructure facilities, including pipelines, production facilities, processing plants, and refineries, could be direct targets of, or indirect casualties of, an act of terror or war. We may be required to incur significant costs in the future to safeguard our assets against terrorist activities.

A deterioration of conditions in Egypt or changes in the economic and political environment in Egypt could have an adverse impact on our business.

Deterioration in the political, economic, and social conditions or other relevant policies of the Egyptian government, such as changes in laws or regulations, export restrictions, expropriation of our assets or resource nationalization, and/or forced renegotiation or modification of our existing contracts with EGPC, or threats or acts of terrorism, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Our operations in Egypt, excluding a one-third noncontrolling interest, contributed

27 percent

of our


production and accounted for

15 percent

of our year-end estimated proved reserves and

25 percent

of our estimated discounted future net cash flows.

Our operations are sensitive to currency rate fluctuations.

Our operations are sensitive to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly between the U.S. dollar and the British pound. Our financial statements, presented in U.S. dollars, may be affected by foreign currency fluctuations through both translation risk and transaction risk. Volatility in exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations, particularly through the weakening of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies.

We do not always control decisions made under joint operating agreements and the parties under such agreements may fail to meet their obligations.

We conduct many of our E&P operations through joint operating agreements with other parties under which we may not control decisions, either because we do not have a controlling interest or are not operator under the agreement. There is risk that these parties may at any time have economic, business, or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours, and therefore decisions may be made which are not what we believe is in our best interest. Moreover, parties to these agreements may be unable to meet their economic or other obligations and we may be required to fulfill those obligations alone. In either case, the value of our investment may be adversely affected.

We face strong industry competition that may have a significant negative impact on our results of operations.

Strong competition exists in all sectors of the oil and gas E&P industry. We compete with major integrated and other independent oil and gas companies for acquisitions of oil and gas leases, properties, and reserves, equipment, and labor required to explore, develop, and operate those properties, and marketing of crude oil, natural gas, and NGL production. Crude oil, natural gas, and NGL prices impact the costs of properties available for acquisition and the number of companies with the financial resources to pursue acquisition opportunities. Many of our competitors have financial and other resources substantially larger than we possess and have established strategic long-term positions and maintain strong governmental relationships in countries in which we may seek new entry. As a consequence, we may be at a competitive disadvantage in bidding for drilling rights. In addition, many of our larger competitors may have a competitive advantage when responding to factors that affect demand for oil and gas production, such as fluctuating worldwide commodity prices and levels of production, the cost and availability of alternative fuels, and the application of government regulations. We also compete in attracting and retaining personnel, including geologists,


geophysicists, engineers, and other specialists. These competitive pressures may have a significant negative impact on our results of operations.

Our insurance policies do not cover all of the risks we face, which could result in significant financial exposure.

Exploration for and production of crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs can be hazardous, involving natural disasters and other events such as blowouts, cratering, fire and explosion and loss of well control, which can result in damage to or destruction of wells or production facilities, injury to persons, loss of life, or damage to property and the environment. Our international operations are also subject to political risk. The insurance coverage that we maintain against certain losses or liabilities arising from our operations may be inadequate to cover any such resulting liability; moreover, insurance is not available to us against all operational risks.

Certain anti-takeover provisions in our charter and Delaware law could delay or prevent a hostile takeover.

Our charter authorizes our board of directors to issue preferred stock in one or more series and to determine the voting rights and dividend rights, dividend rates, liquidation preferences, conversion rights, redemption rights, including sinking fund provisions and redemption prices, and other terms and rights of each series of preferred stock. In addition, Delaware law imposes restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of 15 percent or more of our outstanding common stock. These provisions may deter hostile takeover attempts that could result in an acquisition of us that would have been financially beneficial to our shareholders.

ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Apache Corporation, a Delaware corporation formed in 1954, is an independent energy company that explores for, develops, and produces natural gas, crude oil, and natural gas liquids. Apache currently has exploration and production operations in three geographic areas: the U.S., Egypt, and offshore the U.K. in the North Sea (North Sea). Apache also has exploration interests in Suriname that may, over time, result in a reportable discovery and development opportunity.

During 2015, Apache sold its Australia LNG business and oil and gas assets. Results of operations and cash flows from operations for Australia are reflected as discontinued operations in the Company’s financial statements for all periods presented.

The following discussion should be read together with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part IV, Item 15 of this Form 10-K, and the risk factors and related information set forth in Part I, Item 1A and Part II, Item 7A of this Form 10-K.

Overview of 2017 Results

Throughout 2017, Apache remained dedicated to its mission to grow the Company for the long-term benefit of its shareholders, with a focus on rigorous portfolio management, disciplined financial structure, and optimization of returns. The Company focused its capital program on development at Alpine High, which commenced production in May, building associated Alpine High infrastructure, and increasing production and performance in its other Permian Basin plays. Apache’s U.S. assets are complemented by its international assets in Egypt and the North Sea, each of which adds to the Company’s deep inventory of exploration and development opportunities and generate cash flows in excess of current capital investments, facilitating the Company’s ability to develop Alpine High while maintaining financial flexibility. Additionally, Apache monetized certain non-strategic assets that were not accretive to earnings in the near term, including its operations in Canada, its interests in the Scottish Area Gas Evacuation system (SAGE) in the North Sea, and various non-core leasehold positions in the Permian.

Daily production in 2017 averaged


Mboe/d, a decrease of

12 percent

from 2016 reflecting the sale of the Company’s Canadian operations. Excluding production from Canada, Apache’s worldwide equivalent daily production decreased

8 percent

primarily due to natural decline. The production decline was driven by strategic decisions to curtail capital investments in the two preceding years in order to allow costs to re-align with the lower commodity price environment and to allocate a significant portion of capital investments to the development of the Alpine High field and infrastructure.

During 2017, Apache reported net income attributable to common stock of

$1.3 billion

, or

$3.41

per diluted common share, compared to a loss of $1.4 billion, or

$3.71

per share in 2016. Results for 2017 reflect an increase in commodity prices, which resulted in higher revenues and lower impairment charges compared with the prior year, as well as gains on divestitures and tax benefits recognized upon enactment of U.S. tax reform. Revenue gains from significant increases in realized commodity prices mitigated the impact of production declines and loss of production in connection with the sale of our Canadian operations.

Apache generated

$2.4 billion

in cash from operating activities in 2017, flat with the prior year, and an additional

$1.4 billion

of cash proceeds from non-core asset divestments. Apache ended the year with

$1.7 billion

of cash and cash equivalents, an increase of

$291 million

from year-end 2016. In addition, the Company reduced debt from prior-year levels, fully maintained its $3.5 billion of available committed borrowing capacity, returned $380 million of capital to shareholders through dividends, and eliminated over $800 million of future asset retirement obligations with the sale of our Canadian operations. In response to continued commodity price volatility, in 2017 the Company entered into commodity derivatives to secure the pace of its strategically important capital program at Alpine High without compromising its financial strength or flexibility. We continuously monitor changes in our operating environment and have the ability, with our dynamic capital allocation process, to adjust our capital investment program to levels that maximize value for our shareholders over the long-term.

Outlook

Apache currently plans to invest $7.5 billion in its upstream oil and gas activities from 2018 to 2020, with just under $2.5 billion planned for 2018 and slight increases to annual capital spending through 2019 and 2020. Additionally, the Company anticipates investment of $1.0 billion in the midstream development of Alpine High over the next three years. This will include approximately $500 million in 2018, with the remainder split between 2019 and 2020. At current pricing, 2018 projected cash flow from operations are estimated to be cash flow neutral based on the upstream capital program, inclusive of the current company dividend of $380 million. Midstream development and infrastructure build-out will operate at a cash deficit. Any cash deficits for 2018 are anticipated to be funded through our existing cash balances; however, the Company continues discussions on strategic midstream monetization and value optimization that could significantly reduce, or even eliminate, the deficit.


The results of this planned capital investment are projected to achieve a compound annual production growth rate of 11 to 13 percent for Apache’s worldwide operations and 19 to 22 percent in the U.S. over the three-year period. For 2018, Apache’s worldwide adjusted production is anticipated to increase by 7 to 13 percent. Projected growth rates will be driven by the Permian Basin. Egypt and the North Sea operations are anticipated to continue generating cash flow in excess of capital investments. Forecasts show a shallow decline rate for the international regions given planned investment levels; however, the Company anticipates improved capital efficiency in the North Sea with lower day rate contracts by mid-year and fewer obligation wells expected to be drilled.

Approximately two-thirds of Apache’s capital upstream spending from 2018 to 2020 will be allocated to the Permian Basin. Outside of Alpine High, capital investment will be focused on horizontal oil drilling in the Midland and Delaware basins and on moderating the Central Basin Platform decline through continued improved recovery projects. Investment levels could be significantly increased to provide short-term oil growth; however, a deeper understanding of multi-zone reservoir dynamics on a section level will lead to more economic full-field development decisions over the long-term. The Company’s current rig and completion pace allows for sufficient time to collect and analyze complex inter-well and inter-zone data and design optimal spacing and pattern configurations. With most of the Company’s key Midland basin acreage held-by-production, we have time available to ensure long-term value and returns before accelerating our development pace in the context of available cash flow.

The upstream capital investment program for Alpine High will continue to transition from delineation and testing to full development mode, while infrastructure build-out will progress through 2018 and into 2019. During 2018, approximately 50 percent of the drilling program will focus on completing the primary phase of delineation and testing. The remaining capital included in the three-year plan will be split evenly between retention drilling and development drilling. The Alpine High program is expected to progress at a steady and increasingly efficient pace with continued well optimization and a greater proportion of future drilling on multi-well pads. Combined with minimal water handling costs and revenue uplift expected from oil and NGLs present in the wet gas portion of the play, Alpine High investments are anticipated to generate strong cash margins with a competitive recycle ratio compared to other Permian operations.

Operational Highlights

Apache’s deliberate focus on strategic testing and targeted development drilling during the price downturn, in addition to the Alpine High discovery, significantly impacted results in its Permian Basin plays, Egypt, and the North Sea.

Key operational highlights for the year include:

North America

•

North America onshore production averaged 231 Mboe/d, down

16 percent

relative to 2016, reflecting Apache’s exit from Canada. Excluding Canada, Apache’s onshore equivalent production decreased

8 percent

, in line with the Company’s expectations given the significant reduction in capital investments over the preceding two years and the allocation of a significant portion of our 2017 capital investments to infrastructure at Alpine High.

•

The Permian region averaged 16 operated rigs during the year, drilling 215 gross wells, 145 net wells. Approximately half of the region’s production is crude oil and 23 percent is NGLs. Combined, this represents more than a third of Apache’s worldwide liquids production for 2017. The region averaged


Mboe/d and contributed $1.8 billion of revenues during 2017. Fourth-quarter 2017 production increased 19 percent from the comparative 2016 quarter, a reflection of the success of the Midland Basin drilling program and the continued production ramp at Alpine High.

•

Drilling and infrastructure development activities continue at Alpine High; specifically:

◦

First production from the Alpine High play was achieved in early May 2017. Net production averaged approximately 19.8 Mboe/d during the fourth quarter of 2017 and achieved a rate of 25 Mboe/d in December prior to shutting down a facility at year-end for capacity expansion.

◦

Five processing facilities are currently operating with a combined gross inlet capacity of 330 million cubic feet of natural gas per day (MMcf/d).

◦

During 2017, Apache invested $550 million in midstream facilities at Alpine High, with development ongoing.  Inception-to-date midstream investment as of year-end was $706 million.


International and Offshore

•

The Egypt region averaged 12 rigs and drilled 94 gross wells. During 2017, Egypt’s gross production and net equivalent production averaged


Mboe/d and


Mboe/d, respectively. Egypt’s gross production and net equivalent production decreased

4 percent

and

5 percent

, respectively, from 2016, primarily the result of natural well decline. In August 2017, the Company received final award of two new concessions totaling 1.6 million net acres, increasing Apache’s acreage position in the Western Desert by 40 percent. Subsequently, the Company began acquiring high resolution 3-D seismic program across its new and existing acreage, which will provide significantly enhanced imaging of deeper formations.

•

The North Sea region averaged 3 rigs during 2017, drilling 14 gross wells, 10 net wells. During the year, the region averaged production of


Mboe/d and contributed $1.1 billion of revenues. Production declined

16 percent

from 2016,

primarily the result of extended turnaround activities, a third-party pipeline system outage at the Forties field and natural well decline impacted by exploration dry holes on long-standing obligation wells. The overall decline has been partially offset by the Callater discovery, which came online in late May 2017.

Acquisition and Divestiture Activity

Over Apache’s 60-year history, it has repeatedly demonstrated its ability to capitalize quickly and decisively on changes in its industry and economic conditions. A key component of this strategy is to continuously review and optimize Apache’s portfolio of assets in response to these changes. Most recently, Apache has completed a series of divestitures designed to monetize nonstrategic assets and enhance Apache’s portfolio in order to allocate resources to more impactful exploration and development opportunities. These divestments comprised primarily capital intensive projects and assets that were not accretive to earnings in the near-term, and included all of Apache’s operations in Canada and Australia. These divestments include:

•

Canadian Operations

On June 30, 2017, Apache completed the sale of its Canadian assets at Midale and House Mountain for total cash proceeds of approximately $228 million. In August of 2017, Apache completed the sale of its remaining Canadian operations for cash proceeds of approximately $478 million.

•

U.S. Divestitures

During 2017, Apache completed the sale of certain non-core assets, primarily leasehold acreage in the Permian and Midcontinent/Gulf Coast regions, in multiple transactions for total cash proceeds of

$798 million

.

•

North Sea Gathering Transportation and Processing (GTP) Facility

In November 2017, Apache completed the sale of its 30.28 percent interest in the SAGE gas plant and its 60.56 percent interest in the Beryl pipeline in the North Sea to Ancala Midstream Acquisitions Limited. A refundable deposit of

$134 million

was received in the fourth quarter of 2016 in connection with this transaction, and was recorded in “Other current liabilities” on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2016. In November 2017, Apache completed the sale and the liability related to the refundable deposit was released. No additional proceeds were received.

•

Australia Operations

On June 5, 2015, Apache’s subsidiaries completed the sale of the Company’s Australian subsidiary Apache Energy Limited (AEL) to a consortium of private equity funds managed by Macquarie Capital Group Limited and Brookfield Asset Management Inc. for total proceeds of $1.9 billion. Additionally, in October 2015, Apache’s subsidiaries completed the sale of its 49 percent interest in Yara Pilbara Holdings Pty Ltd (YPHPL), to Yara International for total proceeds of $391 million.

•

LNG Projects

On April 2, 2015 and April 10, 2015, Apache subsidiaries completed the sale of its interest in the Wheatstone LNG and Kitimat LNG projects, respectively, along with accompanying upstream oil and gas reserves to Woodside Petroleum Limited (Woodside) for a total cash consideration of $3.7 billion.

Average sales volumes from the North Sea were

58,177

boe/d and

66,872

boe/d for


and


, respectively. Sales volumes may vary from production volumes as a result of the timing of liftings in the Beryl field.


Pricing

The following table presents pricing information by region:

Crude Oil Prices

A substantial portion of our crude oil production is sold at prevailing market prices, which fluctuate in response to many factors that are outside of the Company’s control. Average realized crude oil prices for


were

up

24 percent

compared to


, a direct result of the rising benchmark oil prices over the past year. Crude oil prices realized in


averaged

$51.46

per barrel.

Continued volatility in the commodity price environment reinforces the importance of our asset portfolio. While the market price received for natural gas varies among geographic areas, crude oil tends to trade within a global market. Price movements for all types and grades of crude oil generally move in the same direction.

Natural Gas Prices

Natural gas, which currently has a limited global transportation system, is subject to price variances based on local supply and demand conditions. Our primary markets include North America, Egypt, and the U.K. An overview of the market conditions in our primary gas-producing regions follows:

•

North America has a common market; most of our gas is sold on a monthly or daily basis at either monthly or daily market prices. Our North American regions averaged

$2.46

per Mcf in


,

up

from

$1.97

per Mcf in


.


•

In Egypt, our gas is sold to Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation (EGPC), primarily under an industry pricing formula indexed to Dated Brent crude oil with a minimum gas price of $1.50 per MMBtu and a maximum gas price of $2.65 per MMBtu, plus an upward adjustment for liquids content. Overall, the region averaged

$2.80

per Mcf in


,

up

3 percent

from the prior year.

•

Natural gas from the North Sea Beryl field is processed through the SAGE gas plant. The gas is sold to a third party at the St. Fergus entry point of the national grid on a National Balancing Point index price basis. The region averaged

$5.54

per Mcf in


, a

23 percent

increase

from an average of

$4.51

per Mcf in


.

NGL Prices

Apache’s NGL production is sold under contracts with prices at market indices based on local supply and demand conditions, less the costs for transportation and fractionation, or on a weighted-average sales price received by the purchaser.

Operating Expenses

The table below presents a comparison of the Company’s expenses on an absolute dollar basis and an equivalent unit of production (boe) basis. The Company’s discussion may reference expenses on a boe basis, on an absolute dollar basis or both, depending on context. All operating expenses include costs attributable to a noncontrolling interest in Egypt. Operating expenses for all periods exclude discontinued operations in Australia.

(1) For expenses impacted by the timing of


and 2016 liftings in the North Sea, per-boe calculations are based on sales volumes rather than production volumes.

Lease Operating Expenses (LOE)

LOE includes several key components, such as direct operating costs, repair and maintenance, and workover costs. Direct operating costs generally trend with commodity prices and are impacted by the type of commodity produced and the location of properties (i.e., offshore, onshore, remote locations, etc.). Fluctuations in commodity prices impact operating cost elements both directly and indirectly. They directly impact costs such as power, fuel, and chemicals, which are commodity price based. Commodity prices also affect industry activity and demand, thus indirectly impacting the cost of items such as rig rates, labor, boats, helicopters, materials, and supplies. Oil, which contributed more than half of Apache’s


production, is inherently more expensive to produce than natural gas. Repair and maintenance costs are typically higher on offshore properties.

During


, LOE

decreased

$94 million

, or

6 percent

, on an absolute dollar basis compared to


. On a per-unit basis, LOE

increased

$0.53

, or

7 percent

compared to


. During


, LOE

decreased

$360 million

, or

19 percent

, on an absolute dollar basis compared to


. On a per-unit basis, LOE

decreased

$1.50

, or

16 percent

, compared to


. The per-barrel increase during 2017 is primarily the result of declines in production combined with generally rising costs commensurate with higher commodity prices realized during 2017.

Gathering and Transportation

Gathering and transportation expenses include transportation costs paid to a third-party carrier and costs associated with gas processing. As a result of the recent SAGE divestiture, Apache expects to incur additional tariffs ranging from

$7 million

to

$10 million

annually on the North Sea Beryl field production.


vs.


Gathering and transportation costs

decreased

$21 million

from


. The decrease was directly related to the Canadian divestitures that closed in August 2017.



vs.


Gathering and transportation costs decreased $11 million from 2015. The decrease was driven primarily by a decrease in volumes and rate changes in Canada, partially offset by rate changes in the Permian Basin.

Taxes Other Than Income

Taxes other than income primarily consist of U.K. Petroleum Revenue Tax (PRT), severance taxes on properties onshore and in state waters off the coast of the U.S., and ad valorem taxes on properties in the U.S. Severance taxes are generally based on a percentage of oil and gas production revenues, while the U.K. PRT was assessed on net receipts from qualifying fields in the U.K. North Sea. The rate of U.K. PRT was reduced to zero percent effective January 2016. We are subject to a variety of other taxes, including U.S. franchise taxes.


vs.


Taxes other than income totaled

$151 million

, an

increase

of

$25 million

from


. The increase is primarily a result of higher commodity prices during 2017 compared to 2016.


vs.


Taxes other than income in 2016 were $156 million lower than


. During the third quarter of 2016, the rate of U.K. PRT, historically assessed on qualifying fields in the U.K. North Sea, was reduced to zero percent, effective as of January 1, 2016. As a result, U.K. PRT decreased $92 million over the comparable 2015 period. Severance tax decreased $25 million as a result of the decline in oil and gas production and lower prices. Ad valorem taxes decreased $21 million as a result of a decrease in property values in 2016.

Exploration Expense

Exploration expense includes unproved leasehold impairments, exploration dry hole expense, geological and geophysical expense, and the costs of maintaining and retaining unproved leasehold properties. The following table presents a summary of these expenses:


vs.


Unproved leasehold impairments

decreased

$26 million

compared to 2016, primarily a result of stabilizing commodity and leasehold prices. Dry hole expense

increased

$102 million

compared to 2016, primarily related to unsuccessful international offshore exploration.


vs.


Exploration expenses in


decreased

$2.3 billion

, or

83 percent

, compared to


, primarily a result of stabilizing commodity and leasehold prices reducing unproved leasehold impairments during 2016 in all key geographic areas. Dry hole expense decreased $52 million primarily as a result of reduced capital spending during 2016. Geological and geophysical expense decreased by $45 million during 2016 compared to 2015 as a result of reduced capital spending.

General and Administrative (G&A) Expenses


vs.


G&A expenses

decreased

$15 million

, or

4 percent

, from


. The decrease in G&A expense was primarily related to lower incentive compensation in 2017 compared to 2016, and the Canadian divestitures.


vs.


G&A expenses

increased

$30 million

, or

8 percent

, from


. On a per-unit basis, G&A expenses

increased

$0.23

to

$2.15

per boe. The increase in G&A expense was primarily related to non-cash stock-based compensation expense.

Transaction, Reorganization, and Separation Costs

Apache recorded

$16 million

,

$39 million

and

$132 million

of expenses during


,


, and


, respectively, primarily related to company reorganization, including separation costs, investment banking fees and other associated costs. The charges for


include $11 million for consulting fees related to divestitures and $5 million related to employee separation, consolidation of office space, and other reorganization efforts.


Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization (DD&A)


vs.


Oil and gas property DD&A expense of

$2.1 billion

in


decreased

$324 million

compared to


. The Company’s oil and gas property DD&A rate

decreased

$0.14

per boe in


compared to


. The primary factor driving lower absolute dollar expense was a decrease in production volumes from the comparative prior-year periods. Other asset depreciation

decreased

$14 million

compared to


primarily related to the Canadian divestitures.


vs.


Oil and gas property DD&A expense of $2.5 billion in 2016 decreased

$516 million

compared to


. The Company’s oil and gas property DD&A rate decreased

$2.09

to

$12.92

per boe in


compared to


. The primary factor driving both lower absolute dollar expense and lower DD&A per boe rates was the reduction in the carrying value of the Company’s oil and gas properties as a result of impairments to proved properties in 2015 and 2016. Other asset depreciation

decreased

$166 million

compared to


primarily related to a reduction in the Company

’

s gas gathering, transmission, and processing (GTP) assets as a result of impairments to GTP assets during 2015.

Impairments

During 2017, the Company recorded asset impairments in connection with fair value assessments totaling

$8 million

for a U.K. PRT decommissioning asset that is no longer expected to be realizable from future abandonment activities in the North Sea.

During 2016, the Company recorded asset impairments totaling

$1.1 billion

in connection with fair value assessments, including

$486 million

for the impairment of the recoverable value of the PRT decommissioning asset,

$427 million

impairments of oil and gas proved properties in the U.S. and Canada,

$135 million

impairments of certain GTP facilities in the North Sea, and

$55 million

for inventory write-downs.

During 2015, the Company recorded asset impairments totaling $9.5 billion, including $7.4 billion impairments of oil and gas proved properties, $1.7 billion impairments of GTP facilities, a $148 million impairment of its YPHPL equity method investment, $163 million impairment of goodwill in its North Sea reporting unit, and $55 million for inventory write-downs. Oil and gas proved property impairments resulted from lower commodity prices and downward revisions of reserves resulting from changes to the Company’s development plans in certain areas. GTP impairments included $555 million for facilities in Canada, $102 million in the U.S., and $1.1 billion in Egypt.

Provision for Income Taxes

The 2017 income tax benefit totaled

$585 million

. During 2017, Apache’s effective tax rate was impacted primarily by the decrease in deferred taxes associated with its investments in foreign subsidiaries, gains on the sale of oil and gas properties, the increase in the Company’s valuation allowance, and a decrease in the U.S. corporate income tax rate causing a remeasurement of the Company’s deferred tax asset.

On December 22, 2017 the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Act) was signed into law.  In addition to reducing the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent effective January 1, 2018, certain provisions in the Act move the U.S. away from a worldwide tax system and closer to a territorial system for earnings of foreign corporations, establishing a participation exemption system for taxation of foreign income.  The new law includes a transition rule to effect this participation exemption regime.  As a result of the enacted legislation in the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company is required to include in its taxable income for the tax year ending December 31, 2017, its pro rata share of deferred income of each specified foreign corporation with respect to which the Company is a U.S. shareholder.  In 2017, the Company recorded a provisional net deferred tax benefit of $822 million to reverse a previously recorded deferred tax liability for unrepatriated earnings and to account for the transition rule under the new law.  In addition, and as a result of the decrease in the corporate income tax rate, the Company recorded a provisional $516 million deferred tax expense in 2017 related to the remeasurement of the Company’s December 31, 2017 deferred tax asset.

The 2016 income tax benefit from continuing operations totaled

$442 million

. During 2016, Apache’s effective tax rate was impacted primarily by non-cash impairments of the carrying value of the Company’s oil and gas properties, non-cash impairments of the Company’s PRT decommissioning asset, the impact of the change in U.K. statutory income tax rate, and an increase in the amount of valuation allowances on U.S. and Canadian deferred tax assets.

In 2016, the U.K. government enacted Finance Bill 2016 which provides income tax relief to Exploration and Production (E&P) companies operating in the North Sea through a reduction of Supplementary Charge from 20 percent to 10 percent, effective January 1, 2016. As a result of the enacted legislation in the third quarter of 2016, the Company recorded a deferred tax benefit of $238 million related to the remeasurement of the Company’s December 31, 2015 U.K. deferred income tax liability.

In 2015, Apache repatriated the sales proceeds from the divestment of its interest in LNG projects and Australian upstream assets. Upon the repatriation of these proceeds, Apache recognized a U.S. current income tax liability of $560 million.


The 2015 income tax benefit from continuing operations totaled $1.0 billion. The 2015 effective tax rate reflects the tax benefit from $11.9 billion of asset impairments, the recognition of $2.1 billion of deferred tax assets related to foreign tax credit carryforwards, and an increase in valuation allowance against the Canadian region’s net deferred tax assets. Separately, the U.K. government enacted Finance Bill 2015, which provided income tax relief to E&P companies operating in the North Sea through a reduction of Supplementary Charge from 32 percent to 20 percent, effective January 1, 2015. As a result of the enacted legislation, in 2015, Apache recorded a deferred tax benefit of $414 million related to the remeasurement of the Company’s December 31, 2014 U.K. deferred income tax liability.

For additional information regarding income taxes, please refer to Note 8—Income Taxes in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part IV, Item 15 of this Form 10-K.


Capital Resources and Liquidity

Operating cash flows are the Company’s primary source of liquidity. We may also elect to utilize available cash on hand, committed borrowing capacity, access to both debt and equity capital markets, or proceeds from the sale of nonstrategic assets for all other liquidity and capital resource needs.

Apache’s operating cash flows, both in the short-term and the long-term, are impacted by highly volatile oil and natural gas prices, as well as costs and sales volumes. Significant changes in commodity prices impact Apache’s revenues, earnings and cash flows. These changes potentially impact Apache’s liquidity if costs do not trend with changes in commodity prices. Historically, costs have trended with commodity prices, albeit on a lag. Sales volumes also impact cash flows; however, they have a less volatile impact in the short-term.

Apache’s long-term operating cash flows are dependent on reserve replacement and the level of costs required for ongoing operations. Cash investments are required to fund activity necessary to offset the inherent declines in production and proved crude oil and natural gas reserves. Future success in maintaining and growing reserves and production is highly dependent on the success of Apache’s drilling program and our ability to add reserves economically. Changes in commodity prices also impact estimated quantities of proved reserves. During 2017, the Company recognized positive reserve revisions of approximately 2 percent of its year-end 2016 estimated proved reserves as a result of higher prices.

Apache currently plans to invest $7.5 billion in its upstream oil and gas activities from 2018 to 2020, with just under $2.5 billion planned for 2018 and slight increases to annual capital spending through 2019 and 2020. Additionally, the Company anticipates investment of $1.0 billion in the midstream development of Alpine High over the next three years. This will include approximately $500 million in 2018, with the remainder split between 2019 and 2020. At current pricing, 2018 projected cash flow from operations are estimated to be cash flow neutral based on the upstream capital program, inclusive of the current company dividend of $380 million. Midstream development and infrastructure build-out will operate at a cash deficit. Any cash deficits for 2018 are anticipated to be funded through our existing cash balances; however, the Company continues discussions on strategic midstream monetization and value optimization that could significantly reduce, or even eliminate, the deficit. Additionally, to mitigate the downside risk of price volatility and protect our cash flow exposure related to infrastructure costs, the Company has entered into, throughout 2018, put option contracts, fixed price swaps, and option collars over a significant portion of projected crude oil and natural gas sales volumes.

Apache believes the liquidity and capital resource alternatives available to the Company, combined with proactive measures to adjust its capital budget to reflect volatile commodity prices and anticipated operating cash flows, will be adequate to fund short-term and long-term operations, including Apache’s capital spending program, repayment of debt maturities, payment of dividends, and any amount that may ultimately be paid in connection with commitments and contingencies.

Sources and Uses of Cash

The following table presents the sources and uses of the Company’s cash and cash equivalents for the years presented:

(1)

The table presents capital expenditures on a cash basis; therefore, the amounts may differ from those discussed elsewhere in this document, which include accruals.

Net Cash Provided by Continuing Operating Activities

Operating cash flows are the Company’s primary source of capital and liquidity and are impacted, both in the short-term and the long-term, by volatile oil and natural gas prices. The factors that determine operating cash flows are largely the same as those that affect net earnings, with the exception of non-cash expenses such as DD&A, asset retirement obligation (ARO) accretion, exploratory dry hole expense, asset impairments, and deferred income tax expense.

Net cash provided by continuing operating activities for

For additional detail on the changes in operating assets and liabilities and the non-cash expenses that do not impact net cash provided by operating activities, please see the Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows in the Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part IV, Item 15 of this Form 10-K.

Australia Discontinued Operations

During 2015, Apache completed the sale of its Wheatstone LNG project and associated upstream assets to Woodside for total proceeds of $2.8 billion. During 2015, Apache also completed the sale of its Australian subsidiary AEL to a consortium of private equity funds managed by Macquarie Capital Group Limited and Brookfield Asset Management Inc. for total proceeds of $1.9 billion. The results of operations for the divested Australian assets, asset impairments, and losses on disposal are classified as discontinued operations in all periods presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Liquidity

Cash and Cash Equivalents

At

December 31, 2017

, Apache had

$1.7 billion

in cash and cash equivalents, of which approximately $494 million of cash and cash equivalents were held by foreign subsidiaries, and approximately $1.2 billion was held by Apache Corporation and U.S. subsidiaries. The cash held by foreign subsidiaries will not be subject to additional U.S. income taxes if repatriated. The majority of the cash is invested in highly liquid, investment-grade instruments with maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase.

Debt

At

December 31, 2017

, outstanding debt, which consisted of notes and debentures, totaled

$8.5 billion

. The Company has

$550 million

maturing in 2018,

$150 million

maturing in 2019,

$493 million

maturing in


,

$814 million

maturing in


, and the remaining maturing in years 2023 through 2096. At

December 31, 2017

, $150 million of 7.0% senior notes due February 1, 2018 and $400 million of 6.9% senior notes due September 15, 2018 are classified as current debt on the consolidated balance sheet. On February 1, 2018, Apache’s 7.0% notes in original principal amount of $150 million matured and were repaid.


In November 2016, the Company initiated a program to purchase in the open market up to $250 million in aggregate principal amount of senior notes issued under its indentures. In the fourth quarter of 2016, Apache purchased and canceled $181 million aggregate principal amount of its senior notes through open market repurchases for $182 million in cash, including accrued interest and $0.5 million of premium. These repurchases resulted in a $1 million net loss on extinguishment of debt, which is included in “Financing costs, net” in our statement of consolidated operations. The net loss includes an acceleration of related discount and deferred financing costs.

In January 2017, Apache purchased and canceled an additional $69 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes for $71 million in cash, including accrued interest and $1 million of premium, which completed the open market repurchase program. These repurchases resulted in a $1 million net loss on extinguishment of debt, which is included in “Financing costs, net” in the Company’s consolidated statement of operations. The net loss includes an acceleration of related discount and deferred financing costs.

In August 2017, the Company assumed the obligations of Apache Finance Canada Corporation (AFCC) in respect of $300 million 7.75% notes due in 2029 which AFCC issued and the Company guaranteed pursuant to the governing indenture. The assumption was permitted by the indenture and effected pursuant to a supplemental indenture thereto.  As a result of the assumption, the Company is the obligor under the notes and indenture, and AFCC is released from its obligations thereunder.  The $300 million 7.75% notes historically have been included in the Company’s long-term debt; accordingly, the assumption did not change the Company’s long-term debt or total debt.

Available Credit Facilities

In June 2015, the Company entered into a five-year revolving credit facility which matures in June 2020, subject to Apache’s two, one-year extension options. The facility provides for aggregate commitments of $3.5 billion (including a $750 million letter of credit subfacility), with rights to increase commitments up to an aggregate $4.5 billion. Proceeds from borrowings may be used for general corporate purposes. Apache’s available borrowing capacity under this facility supports its commercial paper program. As of

December 31, 2017

, there were no borrowings under this credit facility, leaving aggregate available borrowing capacity at $3.5 billion.

At the Company’s option, the interest rate per annum for borrowings under the 2015 facility is either a base rate, as defined, plus a margin, or the London Inter-bank Offered Rate (LIBOR), plus a margin. The Company also pays quarterly a facility fee at a per annum rate on total commitments. The margins and the facility fee vary based upon the Company’s senior long-term debt rating. At

December 31, 2017

, the base rate margin was 0.075 percent, the LIBOR margin was 1.075 percent, and the facility fee was 0.175 percent.

The financial covenants of the 2015 credit facility require the Company to maintain an adjusted debt-to-capital ratio of not greater than 60 percent at the end of any fiscal quarter. For purposes of this calculation, capital excludes the effects of non-cash write-downs, impairments, and related charges occurring after June 30, 2015. At

December 31, 2017

, the Company’s debt-to-capital ratio as calculated under the credit facility was 31 percent.

The 2015 facility’s negative covenants restrict the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to create liens securing debt on its hydrocarbon-related assets, with exceptions for liens typically arising in the oil and gas industry, purchase money liens, liens on subsidiary assets located outside of the United States and Canada, and liens arising as a matter of law, such as tax and mechanics’ liens. The Company also may incur liens on assets if debt secured thereby does not exceed 5 percent of the Company’s consolidated assets, or approximately $1.1 billion as of

December 31, 2017

. Negative covenants also restrict Apache’s ability to merge with another entity unless it is the surviving entity, dispose of substantially all of its assets, and guarantee debt of non-consolidated entities in excess of the stated threshold.

In February 2016, Apache entered into a letter of credit facility providing £900 million in commitments, and rights to increase commitments to £1.075 billion. The facility matures in February 2020 and is available for letters of credit denominated in pounds sterling, U.S. dollars, Canadian dollars, and any other foreign currency consented to by an issuing bank. The facility also is available for loans in pounds sterling, U.S. dollars, and Canadian dollars to cash collateralize letters of credit or obligations to provide letters of credit, in each case, to the extent letters of credit are unavailable under the facility. The facility’s representations and warranties, covenants, and events of default are substantially similar to those in Apache’s 2015 $3.5 billion revolving credit facility.

Commissions are payable on letters of credit outstanding under the 2016 facility at a per annum rate equal to a LIBOR margin. Borrowings bear interest per annum at a base rate or LIBOR, plus a margin. A facility fee at a per annum rate on aggregate commitments also is payable. Letter of credit commissions, the interest margin, and the facility fee vary depending on Apache’s senior unsecured long-term debt rating. At

December 31, 2017

, the LIBOR margin was 1.075 percent, the base rate margin was 0.075 percent, and the facility fee was 0.175 percent.


The 2016 facility is available for the Company’s letter of credit needs, particularly those which may arise in respect of abandonment obligations assumed in various North Sea acquisitions. As of

December 31, 2017

, three letters of credit aggregating approximately £129.1 million and no borrowings were outstanding under this facility.

There are no clauses in the 2015 $3.5 billion or 2016 £900 million credit facilities that permit the lenders to accelerate payments or refuse to lend based on unspecified material adverse changes. The agreements for these facilities do not have drawdown restrictions or prepayment obligations in the event of a decline in credit ratings. However, the agreements allow the lenders to accelerate payment maturity and terminate lending and issuance commitments for nonpayment and other breaches, and if the Company or any of its subsidiaries defaults on other indebtedness in excess of the stated threshold, is insolvent, or has any unpaid, non-appealable judgment against it for payment of money in excess of the stated threshold. Lenders may also accelerate payment maturity and terminate lending and issuance commitments if the Company undergoes a specified change in control or any borrower has specified pension plan liabilities in excess of the stated threshold. The Company was in compliance with the terms of these credit facilities as of

December 31, 2017

.

There is no assurance that the financial condition of banks with lending commitments to the Company will not deteriorate. We closely monitor the ratings of the banks in our bank groups. Having large bank groups allows the Company to mitigate the potential impact of any bank’s failure to honor its lending commitment.

Commercial Paper Program

As of

December 31, 2017

, the Company has available a $3.5 billion commercial paper program which, subject to market availability, facilitates Apache borrowing funds for up to 270 days at competitive interest rates. The commercial paper program is fully supported by available borrowing capacity under the Company’s 2015 $3.5 billion committed credit facility. If the Company is unable to issue commercial paper following a significant credit downgrade or dislocation in the market, the Company’s 2015 committed credit facility, which matures in 2020, is available as a 100 percent backstop. As of

December 31, 2017

, the Company had no borrowings under its commercial paper program.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

Apache enters into customary agreements in the oil and gas industry for drilling rig commitments, firm transportation agreements, and other obligations as described below in “Contractual Obligations” in this Item 7. Other than the off-balance sheet arrangements described herein, Apache does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements with unconsolidated entities that are reasonably likely to materially affect our liquidity or capital resource positions.

Contractual Obligations

The following table summarizes the Company’s contractual obligations as of

December 31, 2017

. For additional information regarding these obligations, please see Note 7—Debt and Note 9—Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part IV, Item 15 of this Form 10-K.

(1)

This table does not include the Company’s liability for dismantlement, abandonment, and restoration costs of oil and gas properties or pension or postretirement benefit obligations. For additional information regarding these liabilities, please see Notes 6 and 10, respectively, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part IV, Item 15 of this Form 10-K.

(2)

This represents our capital lease obligation related to our Midland, Texas office building. The imputed interest rate necessary to reduce the net minimum lease payments to present value of the lease term is

4.4 percent

or

$18 million

as of December 31, 2017.

(3)

Payments associated with the drilling of exploratory wells and development wells net of amounts billed to partners will be capitalized as a component of oil and gas properties, and either depreciated, impaired, or written off as exploration expense.


(4)

Amounts represent any agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms. These include minimum commitments associated with take-or-pay contracts, NGL processing agreements, drilling work program commitments, and agreements to secure capacity rights on third-party pipelines. Includes amounts related to firm transportation capacity on the Gulf Coast Express Pipeline Project (GCX Project), expected to be in service in October 2019. Amounts exclude certain product purchase obligations related to marketing and trading activities for which there are no minimum purchase requirements or the amounts are not fixed or determinable.

(5)

Amounts include long-term lease payments for office space, aircraft, supply and standby vessels, land leases, and equipment related to exploration, development, and production activities. The Company expects to receive

$1 million

in sublease income associated with these leases.

Apache is also subject to various contingent obligations that become payable only if certain events or rulings were to occur. The inherent uncertainty surrounding the timing of and monetary impact associated with these events or rulings prevents any meaningful accurate measurement, which is necessary to assess settlements resulting from litigation. Apache’s management believes that it has adequately reserved for its contingent obligations, including approximately

$4 million

for environmental remediation and approximately

$37 million

for various contingent legal liabilities. For a detailed discussion of the Company’s environmental and legal contingencies, please see Note 9—Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part IV, Item 15 of this Form 10-K.

In addition to our recorded environmental and legal liabilities, we have potential exposure to future obligations related to divested properties. Apache has divested various leases, wells, and facilities located in the Gulf of Mexico where the purchasers typically assume all obligations to plug, abandon, and decommission the associated wells, structures, and facilities acquired. One or more of the counterparties in these transactions could, either as a result of the severe decline in oil and natural gas prices or other factors related to the historical or future operations of their respective businesses, face financial problems that may have a significant impact on their solvency and ability to continue as a going concern. If a purchaser of our Gulf of Mexico assets becomes the subject of a case or proceeding under relevant insolvency laws or otherwise fails to perform required abandonment obligations, Apache could be required to perform such actions under applicable federal laws and regulations. In such event, we may be forced to use available cash to cover the costs of such liabilities and obligations should they arise.

With respect to our retained oil and gas operations in the Gulf of Mexico, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) has issued Notice to Lessees (NTL) No. 2016-N01 pertaining to the obligations of companies to provide supplemental assurances for performance with respect to plugging, abandonment, decommissioning, and site clearance obligations associated with wells, platforms, structures, and facilities located upon or used in connection with such companies’ oil and gas leases. Under this NTL, the Company will likely be required to provide additional security to BOEM with respect to plugging, abandonment, and decommissioning obligations relating to the Company’s current ownership interests in various Gulf of Mexico leases. We are working closely with the BOEM to make arrangements for the provision of such additional required security, if such security becomes necessary under the NTL. Additionally, we are not able to predict the effect that these changes might have on counterparties to which Apache has sold Gulf of Mexico assets. Such changes could cause the bonding obligations of such parties to increase substantially, thereby causing a significant impact on the counterparties’ solvency and ability to continue as a going concern.


Insurance Program

We maintain insurance policies that include coverage for physical damage to our assets, general liabilities, workers’ compensation, employers’ liability, sudden and accidental pollution, and other risks. Our insurance coverage is subject to deductibles or retentions that we must satisfy prior to recovering on insurance. Additionally, our insurance is subject to policy exclusions and limitations. There is no assurance that our insurance will adequately protect us against liability from all potential consequences and damages.

Our current insurance policies covering physical damage to our assets provide up to $1 billion in coverage per occurrence. These policies also provide sudden and accidental pollution coverage. Coverage for Gulf of Mexico named windstorms is excluded from this coverage.

Our current insurance policies covering general liabilities provide approximately $500 million in coverage, scaled to Apache’s interest. Our service agreements, including drilling contracts, generally indemnify Apache for injuries and death of the service provider’s employees as well as subcontractors hired by the service provider.

Apache purchases multi-year political risk insurance from the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) and highly-rated insurers covering a portion of its investments in Egypt for losses arising from confiscation, nationalization, and expropriation risks. The Islamic Corporation for the Insurance of Investment and Export Credit (ICIEC, an agency of the Islamic Development Bank) reinsures OPIC. In the aggregate, these insurance policies provide up to $750 million of coverage to Apache, subject to policy terms and conditions and a retention of approximately $1 billion.

Apache has an additional insurance policy with OPIC, which, subject to policy terms and conditions, provides up to $300 million of coverage through 2024 for losses arising from (1) non-payment by EGPC of arbitral awards covering amounts owed Apache on past due invoices and (2) expropriation of exportable petroleum in the event that actions taken by the government of Egypt prevent Apache from exporting our share of production. The Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA), a member of the World Bank Group, provides $150 million in reinsurance to OPIC.

Future insurance coverage for our industry could increase in cost and may include higher deductibles or retentions. In addition, some forms of insurance may become unavailable.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Apache prepares its financial statements and the accompanying notes in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which require management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. Apache identifies certain accounting policies as critical based on, among other things, their impact on the portrayal of Apache’s financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity and the degree of difficulty, subjectivity, and complexity in their deployment. Critical accounting policies cover accounting matters that are inherently uncertain because the future resolution of such matters is unknown. Management routinely discusses the development, selection, and disclosure of each of the critical accounting policies. The following is a discussion of Apache’s most critical accounting policies.

Reserves Estimates

Proved oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities of natural gas, crude oil, condensate, and NGLs that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing conditions, operating conditions, and government regulations.

Proved undeveloped reserves include those reserves that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion. Undeveloped reserves may be classified as proved reserves on undrilled acreage directly offsetting development areas that are reasonably certain of production when drilled, or where reliable technology provides reasonable certainty of economic producibility. Undrilled locations may be classified as having undeveloped reserves only if a development plan has been adopted indicating that they are scheduled to be drilled within five years, unless specific circumstances justify a longer time.

Despite the inherent imprecision in these engineering estimates, our reserves are used throughout our financial statements. For example, since we use the units-of-production method to amortize our oil and gas properties, the quantity of reserves could significantly impact our DD&A expense. A material adverse change in the estimated volumes of reserves could result in property impairments. Finally, these reserves are the basis for our supplemental oil and gas disclosures.


Reserves are calculated using an unweighted arithmetic average of commodity prices in effect on the first day of each of the previous 12 months, held flat for the life of the production, except where prices are defined by contractual arrangements. Operating costs, production and ad valorem taxes and future development costs are based on current costs with no escalation.

Apache has elected not to disclose probable and possible reserves or reserve estimates in this filing.

Purchase Price Allocation

Accounting for the acquisition of a business requires the allocation of the purchase price to the various assets and liabilities of the acquired business and recording deferred taxes for any differences between the allocated values and tax basis of assets and liabilities. Any excess of the purchase price over the amounts assigned to assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill.

The purchase price allocation is accomplished by recording each asset and liability at its estimated fair value. Estimated deferred taxes are based on available information concerning the tax basis of the acquired company’s assets and liabilities and tax-related carryforwards at the merger date, although such estimates may change in the future as additional information becomes known. The amount of goodwill recorded in any particular business combination can vary significantly depending upon the values attributed to assets acquired and liabilities assumed relative to the total acquisition cost.

When estimating the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, the Company must apply various assumptions. The most significant assumptions relate to the estimated fair values assigned to proved and unproved crude oil and natural gas properties. To estimate the fair values of these properties, the Company prepares estimates of crude oil and natural gas reserves as described above in “Reserve Estimates” of this Item 7. Estimated fair values assigned to assets acquired can have a significant effect on results of operations in the future.

Oil and Gas Exploration Costs

Apache accounts for its exploration and production activities using the successful efforts method of accounting. Costs of acquiring unproved and proved oil and gas leasehold acreage are capitalized. Costs of drilling and equipping productive wells, including development dry holes, and related production facilities are also capitalized. Oil and gas exploration costs, other than the costs of drilling exploratory wells, are charged to expense as incurred. Costs associated with drilling an exploratory well are initially capitalized, or suspended, pending a determination as to whether proved reserves have been found. On a quarterly basis, management reviews the status of all suspended exploratory drilling costs in light of ongoing exploration activities and determines whether the Company is making sufficient progress in its ongoing exploration and appraisal efforts. If management determines that future appraisal drilling or development activities are unlikely to occur, associated suspended exploratory well costs are recorded as dry hole expense and reported in exploration expense in the statement of consolidated operations. Otherwise, the costs of exploratory wells remain capitalized.

Long-Lived Assets

Long-lived assets used in operations, including proved oil and gas properties, are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate a possible significant deterioration in future cash flows expected to be generated by an asset group. Individual assets are grouped for impairment purposes based on a judgmental assessment of the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets. If there is an indication the carrying amount of an asset may not be recovered, the asset is assessed by management through an established process in which changes to significant assumptions such as prices, volumes, and future development plans are reviewed. If, upon review, the sum of the undiscounted pre-tax cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset group, the carrying value is written down to estimated fair value. Because there usually is a lack of quoted market prices for long-lived assets, the fair value of impaired assets is assessed by management using the income approach.

Under the income approach, the fair value of each asset group is estimated based on the present value of expected future cash flows. The income approach is dependent on a number of factors including estimates of forecasted revenue and operating costs, proved reserves, the success of future exploration for and development of unproved reserves, discount rates, and other variables. Key assumptions used in developing a discounted cash flow model described above include estimated quantities of crude oil and natural gas reserves; estimates of market prices considering forward commodity price curves as of the measurement date; and estimates of operating, administrative, and capital costs adjusted for inflation. We discount the resulting future cash flows using a discount rate believed to be consistent with those applied by market participants.

To assess the reasonableness of our fair value estimate, when available we use a market approach to compare the fair value to similar assets. This requires management to make certain judgments about the selection of comparable assets, recent comparable asset transactions, and transaction premiums.


Although we base the fair value estimate of each asset group on assumptions we believe to be reasonable, those assumptions are inherently unpredictable and uncertain, and actual results could differ from the estimate. Negative revisions of estimated reserves quantities, increases in future cost estimates, divestiture of a significant component of the asset group, or sustained decreases in crude oil or natural gas prices could lead to a reduction in expected future cash flows and possibly an additional impairment of long-lived assets in future periods.

Over the past three years, the Company has experienced a substantial decline in commodity prices, which impacted our future development plans and operating cash flows. As such, we recorded impairments of certain proved oil and gas properties and gathering, transmission, and processing facilities in 2015 and 2016. For discussion of these impairments, see “Fair Value Measurements” of Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Asset Retirement Obligation (ARO)

The Company has significant obligations to remove tangible equipment and restore land or seabed at the end of oil and gas production operations. Apache’s removal and restoration obligations are primarily associated with plugging and abandoning wells and removing and disposing of offshore oil and gas platforms in the North Sea and Gulf of Mexico. Estimating the future restoration and removal costs is difficult and requires management to make estimates and judgments. Asset removal technologies and costs are constantly changing, as are regulatory, political, environmental, safety, and public relations considerations.

ARO associated with retiring tangible long-lived assets is recognized as a liability in the period in which the legal obligation is incurred and becomes determinable. The liability is offset by a corresponding increase in the underlying asset. The ARO liability reflects the estimated present value of the amount of dismantlement, removal, site reclamation, and similar activities associated with Apache’s oil and gas properties. The Company utilizes current retirement costs to estimate the expected cash outflows for retirement obligations. Inherent in the present value calculation are numerous assumptions and judgments including the ultimate settlement amounts, inflation factors, credit-adjusted discount rates, timing of settlement, and changes in the legal, regulatory, environmental, and political environments. Accretion expense is recognized over time as the discounted liability is accreted to its expected settlement value.

Goodwill

As of

December 31, 2017

, the Company’s consolidated balance sheet included

$87 million

of goodwill, all of which has been assigned to the Egypt reporting unit. Goodwill is assessed at least annually for impairment at the reporting unit level. We conduct a qualitative goodwill impairment assessment as of July 1 of each year, and whenever impairment indicators arise, by examining relevant events and circumstances that could have a negative impact on our goodwill such as macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, cost factors that have a negative effect on earnings and cash flows, overall financial performance, acquisitions and divestitures, and other relevant entity-specific events.

If it is necessary to determine the fair value of the reporting unit for impairment, we use a combination of the income approach and the market approach. Although we base the fair value estimate of the reporting unit on assumptions we believe to be reasonable, those assumptions are inherently unpredictable and uncertain, and actual results could differ from the estimate. In the event of a prolonged global recession, commodity prices may stay depressed or decline further, thereby causing the fair value of the reporting unit to decline, which could result in an impairment of goodwill.

Income Taxes

Our oil and gas exploration and production operations are subject to taxation on income in numerous jurisdictions worldwide. We record deferred tax assets and liabilities to account for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements and our tax returns. We routinely assess the ability to realize our deferred tax assets. If we conclude that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized under accounting standards, the tax asset would be reduced by a valuation allowance. Numerous judgments and assumptions are inherent in the determination of future taxable income, including factors such as future operating conditions (particularly as related to prevailing oil and gas prices).

The Company regularly assesses and, if required, establishes accruals for uncertain tax positions that could result from assessments of additional tax by taxing jurisdictions in countries where the Company operates. The Company recognizes a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, based on the technical merits of the position. These accruals for uncertain tax positions are subject to a significant amount of judgment and are reviewed and adjusted on a periodic basis in light of changing facts and circumstances considering the progress of ongoing tax audits, case law, and any new legislation. The Company believes that its accruals for uncertain tax positions are adequate in relation to the potential for any additional tax assessments.


ITEM 7A.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

The primary objective of the following information is to provide forward-looking quantitative and qualitative information about our exposure to market risk. The term market risk relates to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in oil, gas, and NGL prices, interest rates, or foreign currency and adverse governmental actions. The disclosures are not meant to be precise indicators of expected future losses, but rather indicators of reasonably possible losses. The forward-looking information provides indicators of how we view and manage our ongoing market risk exposures.

Commodity Risk

The Company’s revenues, earnings, cash flow, capital investments and, ultimately, future rate of growth are highly dependent on the prices we receive for our crude oil, natural gas and NGLs, which have historically been very volatile because of unpredictable events such as economic growth or retraction, weather and political climate. The Company’s average crude oil realizations have

increased

24 percent

to

$51.46

per barrel in


from

$41.63

per barrel in


. The Company’s average natural gas price realizations have

increased

14 percent

to

$2.74

per Mcf in


from

$2.40

per Mcf in


. Based on average daily production for


, a $1.00 per barrel change in the weighted average realized oil price would have increased or decreased revenues for the year by approximately $89 million, and a $0.10 per Mcf change in the weighted average realized price of natural gas would have increased or decreased revenues for the year by approximately $35 million.

Apache periodically enters into derivative positions on a portion of its projected oil and natural gas production through a variety of financial and physical arrangements intended to manage fluctuations in cash flows resulting from changes in commodity prices. Apache periodically uses futures contracts, swaps, and options to mitigate commodity price risk. Apache does not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes. As of December 31, 2017, the Company had open natural gas derivatives not designated as cash flow hedges in an asset position with a fair value of $46 million. A 10 percent increase in gas prices would decrease the asset by approximately $44 million, while a 10 percent decrease in prices would increase the asset by approximately $44 million. As of December 31, 2017, the Company had open oil derivatives not designated as cash flow hedges in a liability position with a fair value of $86 million. A 10 percent increase in oil prices would increase the liability by approximately $66 million, while a 10 percent decrease in prices would decrease the liability by approximately $67 million. These fair value changes assume volatility based on prevailing market parameters at December 31, 2017.  See Note 4—Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part IV, Item 15 of this Form 10-K.

Foreign Currency Risk

The Company’s cash flow stream relating to certain international operations is based on the U.S. dollar equivalent of cash flows measured in foreign currencies. Our North Sea production is sold under U.S. dollar contracts, and the majority of costs incurred are paid in British pounds. In Egypt, substantially all oil and gas production is sold under U.S. dollar contracts, and the majority of the costs incurred are denominated in U.S. dollars. Revenue and disbursement transactions denominated in British pounds are converted to U.S. dollar equivalents based on the average exchange rates during the period.

Foreign currency gains and losses also arise when monetary assets and monetary liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the end of each month. Currency gains and losses are included as either a component of “Other” under “Revenues and Other” or, as is the case when we re-measure our foreign tax liabilities, as a component of the Company’s provision for income tax expense on the statement of consolidated operations. A 10 percent strengthening or weakening of the British pound against the U.S. dollar as of

December 31, 2017

, would result in a foreign currency net loss or gain, respectively, of approximately $4 million.

REPORT OF MANAGEMENT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

Management of the Company is responsible for the preparation and integrity of the consolidated financial statements appearing in this annual report on Form 10-K. The financial statements were prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and include amounts that are based on management’s best estimates and judgments.

Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. Our internal control over financial reporting is supported by a program of internal audits and appropriate reviews by management, written policies and guidelines, careful selection and training of qualified personnel and a written code of business conduct adopted by our Company’s board of directors, applicable to all Company directors and all officers and employees of our Company and subsidiaries.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements and even when determined to be effective, can only provide reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2017

. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013).

Based on our assessment, management believes that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2017

.

The Company’s independent auditors, Ernst & Young LLP, a registered public accounting firm, are appointed by the Audit Committee of the Company’s board of directors. Ernst & Young LLP have audited and reported on the consolidated financial statements of Apache Corporation and subsidiaries and the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. The reports of the independent auditors follow this report on pages F-2 and F-3.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Apache Corporation:

Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

We have audited Apache Corporation and subsidiaries’ internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2017

, based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Apache Corporation and subsidiaries (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2017

, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of

December 31, 2017

and


, the related statements of consolidated operations, comprehensive income (loss), cash flows and changes in equity for each of the three years in the period ended

December 31, 2017

, and the related notes and our report dated

February 22, 2018

expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Basis for Opinion

The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Report of Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Nature of Operations

Apache Corporation (Apache or the Company) is an independent energy company that explores for, develops, and produces natural gas, crude oil, and natural gas liquids. The Company has exploration and production operations in

three

geographic areas: the United States (U.S.), Egypt, and offshore the U.K. in the North Sea (North Sea). Apache also has exploration interests in Suriname that may, over time, result in a reportable discovery and development opportunity.

1.   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Accounting policies used by Apache and its subsidiaries reflect industry practices and conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (GAAP). The Company’s financial statements for prior periods include reclassifications that were made to conform to the current-year presentation. During the second quarter of 2015, Apache completed the sale of its Australian LNG business and oil and gas assets. Results of operations and cash flows for the divested Australia assets are reflected as discontinued operations in the Company’s financial statements for all periods presented. Significant accounting policies are discussed below.

Principles of Consolidation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Apache and its subsidiaries after elimination of intercompany balances and transactions. The Company’s undivided interests in oil and gas exploration and production ventures and partnerships are proportionately consolidated. The Company consolidates all other investments in which, either through direct or indirect ownership, Apache has more than a

50 percent

voting interest or controls the financial and operating decisions. Noncontrolling interests represent third-party ownership in the net assets of a consolidated Apache subsidiary and are reflected separately in the Company’s financial statements. Sinopec International Petroleum Exploration and Production Corporation (Sinopec) owns a one-third minority participation in Apache’s Egypt oil and gas business as a noncontrolling interest, which is reflected as a separate component of equity in Apache’s consolidated balance sheet. Investments in which Apache holds less than

50 percent

of the voting interest are typically accounted for under the equity method of accounting, with the balance recorded as a component of “Deferred charges and other” in Apache’s consolidated balance sheet and results of operations recorded as a component of “Other” under “Revenues and Other” in the Company’s statement of consolidated operations.

Use of Estimates

Preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Apache evaluates its estimates and assumptions on a regular basis. Actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions used in preparation of its financial statements and changes in these estimates are recorded when known. Significant estimates with regard to these financial statements include the fair value determination of acquired assets and liabilities (see Note 2—Acquisitions and Divestitures), the estimate of proved oil and gas reserves and related present value estimates of future net cash flows therefrom (see Note 15—Supplemental Oil and Gas Disclosures), the assessment of asset retirement obligations (see Note 6—Asset Retirement Obligation), the estimates of fair value for long-lived assets and goodwill (see “Fair Value Measurements,” “Property and Equipment,” and “Goodwill” sections in this Note 1 below), and the estimate of income taxes (see Note 8—Income Taxes).

F-9

APACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)

Fair Value Measurements

Certain assets and liabilities are reported at fair value on a recurring basis in Apache’s consolidated balance sheet. Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 820-10-35, “Fair Value Measurement” (ASC 820), provides a hierarchy that prioritizes and defines the types of inputs used to measure fair value. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to Level 1 inputs, which consist of unadjusted quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets. Level 2 inputs consist of quoted prices for similar instruments. Level 3 valuations are derived from inputs that are significant and unobservable; hence, these valuations have the lowest priority.

The valuation techniques that may be used to measure fair value include a market approach, an income approach, and a cost approach. A market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities. An income approach uses valuation techniques to convert future amounts to a single present amount based on current market expectations, including present value techniques, option-pricing models, and the excess earnings method. The cost approach is based on the amount that currently would be required to replace the service capacity of an asset (replacement cost).

Recurring fair value measurements are presented in further detail in Note 4—Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, Note 7—Debt, and Note 10—Retirement and Deferred Compensation Plans.

Apache also uses fair value measurements on a nonrecurring basis when certain qualitative assessments of its assets indicate a potential impairment. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company recorded asset impairments totaling

$8 million

in connection with fair value assessments.

In 2016, the U.K. government enacted Finance Bill 2016, providing tax relief to exploration and production (E&P) companies operating in the U.K. North Sea. Under the enacted legislation, the U.K. Petroleum Revenue Tax (PRT) rate was reduced to

zero

from the previously enacted

35 percent

rate in effect from January 1, 2016. PRT expense ceased prospectively from that date. During 2017, the Company fully impaired the aggregate remaining value of the recoverable PRT decommissioning asset of

$8 million

that would have been realized from future abandonment activities. The recoverable value of the PRT decommissioning asset was estimated using the income approach. The expected future cash flows used in the determination were based on anticipated spending and timing of planned future abandonment activities for applicable fields, considering all available information at the date of review. Apache has classified this fair value measurement as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.

For the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company recorded asset impairments totaling

$1.1 billion

in connection with fair value assessments in the current low commodity price environment. Impairments totaling

$427 million

and

$135 million

were recorded for proved properties and gathering, transmission, and processing (GTP) facilities, respectively, which were written down to their fair values. These impairments are discussed in further detail below in “Property and Equipment.” Also in 2016, the Company recorded

$486 million

for the impairment of the recoverable value of the PRT decommissioning asset and

$55 million

for inventory write-downs.

For the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company recorded asset impairments totaling

$9.5 billion

in connection with fair value assessments. Impairments totaling

$7.4 billion

and

$1.7 billion

were recorded for proved properties and GTP facilities, respectively, which were written down to their fair values. These impairments are discussed in further detail below in “Property and Equipment.” Also in 2015, the Company recorded

$163 million

for the impairment of goodwill,

$148 million

for the impairment of an equity method investment sold in the fourth quarter, and

$55 million

for inventory write-downs. For a discussion of the equity method investment impairment, see Note 2—Acquisitions and Divestitures.

Restricted Cash and Cash Equivalents

In November 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU 2016-18, “Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash.” ASU 2016-18 requires amounts generally described as restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the total beginning and ending amounts for the periods shown on the statement of cash flows. The guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and is required to be adopted using a retrospective approach, with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted ASU 2016-18 in the third quarter of 2017, and it did not have an impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. As of

December 31, 2017

, and


, the Company had

no

restricted cash.

The Company considers all highly liquid short-term investments with a maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents. These investments are carried at cost, which approximates fair value. As of

December 31, 2017

and


, Apache had

$1.7 billion

and

$1.4 billion

, respectively, of cash and cash equivalents.

Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

Accounts receivable are stated at the historical carrying amount net of write-offs and an allowance for doubtful accounts. The carrying amount of Apache’s accounts receivable approximates fair value because of the short-term nature of the instruments. The Company routinely assesses the collectability of all material trade and other receivables. Many of Apache’s receivables are from joint interest owners on properties Apache operates. The Company may have the ability to withhold future revenue disbursements to recover any non-payment of these joint interest billings. The Company accrues a reserve on a receivable when, based on the judgment of management, it is probable that a receivable will not be collected and the amount of any reserve may be reasonably estimated. As of

December 31, 2017

,


, and


, the Company had an allowance for doubtful accounts of

$84 million

,

$93 million

, and

$103 million

, respectively.

The following table describes changes to the Company’s allowance for doubtful accounts for


,


, and


:

Inventories

Inventories consist principally of tubular goods and equipment, stated at weighted-average cost, and oil produced but not sold, stated at the lower of cost or market.

Property and Equipment

The carrying value of Apache’s property and equipment represents the cost incurred to acquire the property and equipment, including capitalized interest, net of any impairments. For business combinations, property and equipment cost is based on the fair values at the acquisition date.

Oil and Gas Property

The Company follows the successful efforts method of accounting for its oil and gas property. Under this method of accounting, exploration costs such as exploratory geological and geophysical costs, delay rentals, and exploration overhead are expensed as incurred. All costs related to production, general corporate overhead, and similar activities are expensed as incurred. If an exploratory well provides evidence to justify potential development of reserves, drilling costs associated with the well are initially capitalized, or suspended, pending a determination as to whether a commercially sufficient quantity of proved reserves can be attributed to the area as a result of drilling. This determination may take longer than one year in certain areas depending on, among other things, the amount of hydrocarbons discovered, the outcome of planned geological and engineering studies, the need for additional appraisal drilling activities to determine whether the discovery is sufficient to support an economic development plan, and government sanctioning of development activities in certain international locations. At the end of each quarter, management reviews the status of all suspended exploratory well costs in light of ongoing exploration activities; in particular, whether the Company is making sufficient progress in its ongoing exploration and appraisal efforts or, in the case of discoveries requiring government sanctioning, whether development negotiations are underway and proceeding as planned. If management determines that future appraisal drilling or development activities are unlikely to occur, associated suspended exploratory well costs are expensed.

Acquisition costs of unproved properties are assessed for impairment at least annually and are transferred to proved oil and gas properties to the extent the costs are associated with successful exploration activities. Significant undeveloped leases are assessed individually for impairment based on the Company’s current exploration plans. Unproved oil and gas properties with individually insignificant lease acquisition costs are amortized on a group basis over the average lease term at rates that provide for full amortization of unsuccessful leases upon lease expiration or abandonment. Costs of expired or abandoned leases are charged to exploration expense, while costs of productive leases are transferred to proved oil and gas properties. Costs of maintaining and retaining unproved properties, as well as amortization of individually insignificant leases and impairment of unsuccessful leases, are included in exploration costs in the statement of consolidated operations.

Costs to develop proved reserves, including the costs of all development wells and related equipment used in the production of crude oil and natural gas, are capitalized. Depreciation of the cost of proved oil and gas properties is calculated using the unit-of-production (UOP) method. The UOP calculation multiplies the percentage of estimated proved reserves produced each quarter

F-11

APACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)

by the carrying value of those reserves. The reserve base used to calculate depreciation for leasehold acquisition costs and the cost to acquire proved properties is the sum of proved developed reserves and proved undeveloped reserves. The reserve base used to calculate the depreciation for capitalized costs for exploratory and development wells is the sum of proved developed reserves only. Estimated future dismantlement, restoration and abandonment costs, net of salvage values, are included in the depreciable cost.

Oil and gas properties are grouped for depreciation in accordance with ASC 932 “Extractive Activities—Oil and Gas.” The basis for grouping is a reasonable aggregation of properties with a common geological structural feature or stratigraphic condition, such as a reservoir or field.

When circumstances indicate that proved oil and gas properties may be impaired, the Company compares unamortized capitalized costs to the expected undiscounted pre-tax future cash flows for the associated assets grouped at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are independent of cash flows of other assets. If the expected undiscounted pre-tax future cash flows, based on Apache’s estimate of future crude oil and natural gas prices, operating costs, anticipated production from proved reserves and other relevant data, are lower than the unamortized capitalized cost, the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value. Fair value is generally estimated using the income approach described in the ASC 820. If applicable, the Company utilizes prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving assets and liabilities that are identical or comparable to the item being measured as the basis for determining fair value. The expected future cash flows used for impairment reviews and related fair value calculations are typically based on judgmental assessments of future production volumes, commodity prices, operating costs, and capital investment plans, considering all available information at the date of review. These assumptions are applied to develop future cash flow projections that are then discounted to estimated fair value, using a discount rate believed to be consistent with those applied by market participants. Apache has classified these fair value measurements as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.

The following table represents non-cash impairments of the carrying value of the Company’s proved and unproved property and equipment for


,


, and


:

Proved properties impaired had aggregate fair values as of the most recent date of impairment of

$306 million

and

$3.9 billion

for


and


, respectively.

On the statement of consolidated operations, unproved impairments are recorded in exploration expense, and proved impairments are recorded in impairments.

Gains and losses on significant divestitures are recognized in the statement of consolidated operations. See Note 2—Acquisitions and Divestitures for more detail.

Gathering, Transmission, and Processing Facilities

GTP facilities totaled

$1.4 billion

and

$976 million

at

December 31, 2017

and


, respectively, with accumulated depreciation for these assets totaling

$194 million

and

$130 million

for the respective periods. GTP facilities are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The estimation of useful life takes into consideration anticipated production lives from the fields serviced by the GTP assets, whether Apache-operated or third party, as well as potential development plans by Apache for undeveloped acreage within or in close proximity to those fields.

The Company assesses the carrying amount of its GTP facilities whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. If the carrying amount of these facilities is more than the sum of the undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss is recognized for the excess of the carrying value over its fair value. During 2017, the Company recorded

no

impairments on GTP assets. During 2016, the Company recorded impairments of

$135 million

on certain GTP assets in the North Sea, which were written down to their fair values of

$142 million

. During 2015, the Company recorded impairments of

$1.7 billion

on certain GTP assets, including

$1.1 billion

in Egypt,

$555 million

in Canada, and

$103 million

in the U.S., which were written down to their fair values of

$306 million

in aggregate. The fair values of the impaired assets were determined using a combination of the income approach and the market approach. The income approach considers internal estimates of future

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)

throughput volumes, processing rates, and costs. These assumptions were applied to develop future cash flow projections that were then discounted to estimated fair value, using a discount rate believed to be consistent with those applied by market participants. Apache has classified these non-recurring fair value measurements as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.

The costs of GTP facilities retired or otherwise disposed of and associated accumulated depreciation are removed from Apache’s consolidated financial statements, and the resulting gain or loss is reflected in “Gain on divestitures” under “Revenues and Other” in the Company’s statement of consolidated operations. During 2017, Apache recorded a gain totaling

$6 million

associated with the Company’s divestiture of its

30.28 percent

interest in the Scottish Area Gas Evacuation system (SAGE) and its

60.56 percent

interest in the Beryl pipeline in the North Sea. For more information regarding this transaction, please refer to Note 2—Acquisitions and Divestitures.

No

gain or loss on the sales of GTP facilities was recognized during 2016. During 2015, Apache recorded a gain on the sale of GTP facilities totaling

$59 million

associated with the Company’s divestitures of certain Permian Basin assets.

Other Property and Equipment

Other property and equipment includes computer software and equipment, buildings, vehicles, furniture and fixtures, land, and other equipment. These assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from


to


years. Accumulated depreciation for these assets totaled

$739 million

and

$780 million

at

December 31, 2017

and


, respectively.

Asset Retirement Costs and Obligations

The initial estimated asset retirement obligation related to property and equipment and subsequent revisions are recorded as a liability at fair value, with an offsetting asset retirement cost recorded as an increase to the associated property and equipment on the consolidated balance sheet. Revisions in estimated liabilities can result from changes in estimated inflation rates, changes in service and equipment costs and changes in the estimated timing of an asset’s retirement. Asset retirement costs are depreciated using a systematic and rational method similar to that used for the associated property and equipment. Accretion expense on the liability is recognized over the estimated productive life of the related assets.

Capitalized

Interest

For significant projects, interest is capitalized as part of the historical cost of developing and constructing assets. Significant oil and gas investments in unproved properties actively being explored, significant exploration and development projects that have not commenced production, significant midstream development activities that are in progress, and investments in equity method affiliates that are undergoing the construction of assets that have not commenced principal operations qualify for interest capitalization. Interest is capitalized until the asset is ready for service. Capitalized interest is determined by multiplying the Company’s weighted-average borrowing cost on debt by the average amount of qualifying costs incurred. Once an asset subject to interest capitalization is completed and placed in service, the associated capitalized interest is expensed through depreciation or impairment.

Goodwill

Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of an entity over the estimated fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, and it is recorded in “Deferred charges and other” in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet. The Company assesses the carrying amount of goodwill by testing for impairment annually and when impairment indicators arise. The impairment test requires allocating goodwill and all other assets and liabilities to assigned reporting units. As of

December 31, 2017

, Apache assesses each country as a reporting unit, with Egypt being the only reporting unit to have associated goodwill. The fair value of the reporting unit is determined and compared to the book value of the reporting unit. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the book value, including goodwill, then goodwill is written down to the implied fair value of the goodwill through a charge to expense.

F-13

APACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)

In order to determine the fair value of the reporting unit, the Company uses a combination of the income approach and the market approach. The income approach considers management views on current operating measures as well as assumptions pertaining to market forces in the oil and gas industry, such as future production, future commodity prices, and costs. These assumptions are applied to develop future cash flow projections that are then discounted to estimate fair value, using a discount rate similar to those used by the Company in the valuation of acquisitions and divestitures. To assess the reasonableness of its fair value estimate, the Company uses a market approach to compare the fair value to similar businesses whose securities are actively traded in the public market. This requires management to make certain judgments about the selection of comparable companies, recent comparable asset transactions, and transaction premiums. Associated market multiples are applied to various financial metrics of the reporting unit to estimate fair value. Apache has classified this reporting unit estimation as a non-recurring Level 3 fair value measurement.

When there is a disposal of a reporting unit or a portion of a reporting unit that constitutes a business, goodwill associated with that business is included in the carrying amount to determine the gain or loss on disposal. The amount of goodwill allocated to the carrying amount of a business can significantly impact the amount of gain or loss recognized on the sale of that business. The amount of goodwill to be included in that carrying amount is based on the relative fair value of the business to be disposed of and the portion of the reporting unit that will be retained.

The following presents the changes to goodwill for the years ended


,


, and


:

Reductions in estimated net present value of expected future cash flows from oil and gas properties resulted in implied fair values below the carrying values of Apache’s North Sea reporting unit. This goodwill impairment has been recorded in “Impairments” in the Company’s statement of consolidated operations.

Accounts Payable

Included in accounts payable at

December 31, 2017

and


, are liabilities of approximately

$76 million

and

$86 million

, respectively, representing the amount by which checks issued but not presented to the Company’s banks for collection exceeded balances in applicable bank accounts.

Commitments and Contingencies

Accruals for loss contingencies arising from claims, assessments, litigation, environmental and other sources are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. These accruals are adjusted as additional information becomes available or circumstances change.

Revenue Recognition and Imbalances

Oil and gas revenues are recognized when production is sold to a purchaser at a fixed or determinable price, when delivery has occurred and title has transferred, and if collectability of the revenue is probable. Cash received relating to future revenues is deferred and recognized when all revenue recognition criteria are met.

Apache uses the sales method of accounting for gas production imbalances. The volumes of gas sold may differ from the volumes to which Apache is entitled based on its interests in the properties. These differences create imbalances that are recognized as a liability only when the properties’ estimated remaining reserves net to Apache will not be sufficient to enable the under-produced owner to recoup its entitled share through production. The Company’s recorded liability is generally reflected in other non-current liabilities. No receivables are recorded for those wells where Apache has taken less than its share of production. Gas imbalances are reflected as adjustments to estimates of proved gas reserves and future cash flows in the unaudited supplemental oil and gas disclosures.

F-14

APACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)

Apache markets its own North American natural gas production. Since the Company’s production fluctuates because of operational issues, it is occasionally necessary to purchase third-party oil and gas to fulfill sales obligations and commitments. The costs of third-party oil and gas purchases totaled

$254 million

,

$159 million

, and

$105 million

, for


,


, and


, respectively, which offset the related sales proceeds recorded as “Other” under “Revenues and Other” in the statement of consolidated operations.

The Company’s Egyptian operations are conducted pursuant to production sharing contracts under which contractor partners pay all operating and capital costs for exploring and developing the concessions. A percentage of the production, generally up to

40 percent

, is available to contractor partners to recover these operating and capital costs over contractually defined periods. Cost recovery is reflected in revenue. The balance of the production is split among the contractor partners and the Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation on a contractually defined basis.

Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

Apache periodically enters into derivative contracts to manage its exposure to commodity price risk. These derivative contracts, which are generally placed with major financial institutions, may take the form of forward contracts, futures contracts, swaps, or options. The oil and gas reference prices upon which the commodity derivative contracts are based reflect various market indices that have a high degree of historical correlation with actual prices received by the Company for its oil and gas production.

Apache records all derivative instruments, other than those that meet the normal purchases and sales exception, on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at fair value. Changes in fair value are recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met. Gains and losses from the change in fair value of derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are reported in current-period income as “Derivative instrument gains (losses), net” under “Revenues and Other” in the statement of consolidated operations. Hedge accounting treatment allows unrealized gains and losses on cash flow hedges to be deferred in other comprehensive income. For more information, please refer to Note 4—Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.

Income Taxes

Apache records deferred tax assets and liabilities to account for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the financial statements and tax returns. The Company routinely assesses the ability to realize its deferred tax assets. If the Company concludes that it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized, the tax asset is reduced by a valuation allowance. Numerous judgments and assumptions are inherent in the determination of future taxable income, including factors such as future operating conditions (particularly as related to prevailing oil and gas prices) and changing tax laws.

Foreign Currency Transaction Gains and Losses

The U.S. dollar is the functional currency for each of Apache’s international operations. The functional currency is determined country-by-country based on relevant facts and circumstances of the cash flows, commodity pricing environment and financing arrangements in each country. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses arise when monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are remeasured to their U.S. dollar equivalent at the exchange rate in effect at the end of each reporting period. Foreign currency gains and losses also arise when revenue and disbursement transactions denominated in a country’s local currency are converted to a U.S. dollar equivalent based on the average exchange rates during the reporting period.

Foreign currency transaction gains and losses related to current taxes payable and deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded as components of the provision for income taxes. For further discussion, please refer to Note 8—Income Taxes. All other foreign currency transaction gains and losses are reflected in “Other” under “Revenues and Other” in the statement of consolidated operations. The Company’s other foreign currency gains and losses netted to losses of

$11 million

,

$25 million

, and

$11 million

in 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.

Insurance Coverage

The Company recognizes an insurance receivable when collection of the receivable is deemed probable. Any recognition of an insurance receivable is recorded by crediting and offsetting the original charge. Any differential arising between insurance recoveries and insurance receivables is recorded as a capitalized cost or as an expense, consistent with its original treatment.

F-15

APACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)

Earnings Per Share

The Company’s basic earnings per share (EPS) amounts have been computed based on the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS reflects potential dilution, using the treasury stock method, which assumes that options were exercised and restricted stock was fully vested.

Stock-Based Compensation

The Company accounts for stock-based compensation under the fair value recognition provisions of ASC Topic 718, “Compensation—Stock Compensation.” The Company grants various types of stock-based awards including stock options, nonvested restricted stock units, and performance-based awards. Stock compensation awards granted are valued on the date of grant and are expensed over the required service period. These plans and related accounting policies are defined and described more fully in Note 11—Capital Stock.

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, “Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.” ASU 2016-09 simplifies several aspects of accounting for share-based payment transactions including income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and the classification on the statement of cash flows. The guidance was effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016. The Company adopted ASU 2016-09 effective January 1, 2017.

Upon adoption, the Company elected to account for forfeitures as they occur rather than estimate expected forfeitures using a modified retrospective transition method. As a result of this election, the Company recorded a cumulative-effect adjustment of

$11 million

, representing an increase in accumulated deficit, with the offset to paid-in capital. During the first quarter of 2017, the Company recorded a

$4 million

deferred tax asset related to this adjustment, with the offset to accumulated deficit.

ASU 2016-09 requires excess tax benefits and deficiencies to be recognized prospectively as part of the provision for income taxes rather than paid-in capital. The adoption did not have a material impact on the Company’s accounting of provision for income taxes. ASU 2016-09 also requires excess tax benefits to be presented as a component of operating cash flows rather than financing cash flows. The Company has adopted this requirement prospectively and accordingly, prior periods have not been adjusted. Excess tax benefits were not material for all periods presented.

Additionally, ASU 2016-09 requires that employee taxes paid when an employer withholds shares for tax-withholding purposes be reported as financing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows, which is how the Company has historically classified these amounts.

Treasury Stock

The Company follows the weighted-average-cost method of accounting for treasury stock transactions.

New Pronouncements Issued But Not Yet Adopted

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, “Financial Instruments—Credit Losses.” The standard changes the impairment model for most financial assets and certain other instruments, including trade and other receivables, held-to-maturity debt securities and loans, and requires entities to use a new forward-looking expected loss model that will result in the earlier recognition of allowance for losses. This update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted for a fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within that fiscal year. The Company does not expect to adopt the guidance early. Entities will apply the standard’s provisions as a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is adopted. The Company is evaluating the new guidance and does not believe this standard will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842),” requiring lessees to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities for most leases classified as operating leases under previous GAAP. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and the Company will be required to use a modified retrospective approach for leases that exist or are entered into after the beginning of the earliest comparative period in the financial statements. Early adoption is permitted; however, the Company does not intend to early adopt. In the normal course of business, the Company enters into various lease agreements for real estate, aircraft, and equipment related to its exploration and development activities that are currently accounted for as operating leases. At this time, the Company cannot reasonably estimate the financial impact this will have on its consolidated financial statements; however, the Company believes adoption and implementation of this ASU will significantly impact its balance sheet, resulting in an increase in both assets and liabilities relating to its leasing activities. As part of the assessment to date, the

F-16

APACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)

Company has formed an implementation work team, developed a project plan, educated departments affected by the standard, and continues to evaluate contracts to determine the impact this ASU will have on its consolidated financial statements.

In May 2014, the FASB and the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) issued a joint revenue recognition standard, ASU 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606).” The new standard removes inconsistencies in existing standards, changes the way companies recognize revenue from contracts with customers, and increases disclosure requirements. The codification was amended through additional ASUs and, as amended, requires companies to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in amounts that reflect the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company adopted the new standard on January 1, 2018, utilizing the modified retrospective approach. Adoption of this ASU is not expected to have a material impact on net earnings. Certain items netted in revenue prior to adoption are recorded to expense based on the requirements of the new ASU. The Company developed an accounting policy, implemented changes to the relevant business processes and the control activities within them, and continues to evaluate the disclosure requirements as a result of the provisions of this ASU.

The following provides an aging of capitalized exploratory well costs and the number of projects for which exploratory well costs have been capitalized for a period greater than one year since the completion of drilling:

The following summarizes a further aging by geographic area of those exploratory well costs that have been capitalized for a period greater than one year since the completion of drilling at

December 31, 2017

:

Projects with suspended exploratory well costs capitalized for a period greater than one year since the completion of drilling are those identified by management as exhibiting sufficient quantities of hydrocarbons to justify potential development.  Management is actively pursuing efforts to assess whether reserves can be attributed to these projects.

Suspended exploratory well costs capitalized at December 31, 2017 for a period greater than one year since the completion of drilling primarily relate to the Seagull, Corona, and Storr discoveries in the North Sea. The Seagull joint venture partnership has selected the host facility and expects to complete the field development plan in late 2018 and achieve the final investment decision by 2019. The suspended exploratory well costs related to the Corona discovery are pending development plan approval. In December 2016, the Company submitted the full field development plan to the Oil and Gas Authority in the U.K. which has been conditionally approved and awaits the U.K. Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy environmental approvals expected by the second quarter of 2018. The final investment decision will be approved in 2018. Storr was a more recent discovery in the North Sea and development plans are actively being evaluated to bring forth a Storr field development plan during 2018 with final investment decision expected to take place in 2019.

The remaining capitalized well costs in excess of one year relate to exploratory drilling in Suriname. Well costs have been suspended pending ongoing activities, including analysis of well results and geologic and geophysical studies of nearby blocks. Remaining activities required to classify the associated reserves as proved include additional exploratory and appraisal drilling,

geologic and geophysical studies, reservoir modeling and simulation, economic modeling, pre-development studies, approval of development plans, and project sanctioning.

4.    DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES

Objectives and Strategies

The Company is exposed to fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas prices on the majority of its worldwide production. Apache manages the variability in its cash flows by occasionally entering into derivative transactions on a portion of its crude oil and natural gas production. The Company utilizes various types of derivative financial instruments to manage fluctuations in cash flows resulting from changes in commodity prices.

Counterparty Risk

The use of derivative instruments exposes the Company to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparty. To reduce the concentration of exposure to any individual counterparty, Apache utilizes a diversified group of investment-grade rated counterparties, primarily financial institutions, for its derivative transactions. As of

December 31, 2017

, Apache had derivative positions with


counterparties. The Company monitors counterparty creditworthiness on an ongoing basis; however, it cannot predict sudden changes in counterparties’ creditworthiness. In addition, even if such changes are not sudden, the Company may be limited in its ability to mitigate an increase in counterparty credit risk. Should one of these counterparties not perform, Apache may not realize the benefit of some of its derivative instruments resulting from lower commodity prices.

Derivative Instruments

As of

December 31, 2017

Fair Value Measurements

Apache’s commodity derivative instruments consist of variable-to-fixed price commodity swaps, options, and collars. The fair values of the Company’s derivatives are not actively quoted in the open market. The Company uses a market approach to estimate the fair values of its derivative instruments on a recurring basis, utilizing commodity futures pricing for the underlying commodities provided by a reputable third party, a Level 2 fair value measurement.

The following table presents the Company’s derivative assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis:

The derivative fair values are based on analysis of each contract on a gross basis, excluding the impact of netting agreements with counterparties.

F-23

APACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)

All derivative instruments are reflected as either assets or liabilities at fair value in the consolidated balance sheet. These fair values are recorded by netting asset and liability positions where counterparty master netting arrangements contain provisions for net settlement. The carrying value of the Company’s derivative assets and liabilities and their locations on the consolidated balance sheet are as follows:

Derivative Activity Recorded in the Statement of Consolidated Operations

The following table summarizes the effect of derivative instruments on the Company’s statement of consolidated operations:

6.    ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATION

The following table describes changes to the Company’s asset retirement obligation (ARO) liability for the years ended

December 31, 2017

and


:

The ARO liability reflects the estimated present value of the amount of dismantlement, removal, site reclamation, and similar activities associated with Apache’s oil and gas properties. The Company utilizes current retirement costs to estimate the expected cash outflows for retirement obligations. The Company estimates the ultimate productive life of the properties, a risk-adjusted discount rate, and an inflation factor in order to determine the current present value of this obligation. To the extent future revisions to these assumptions impact the present value of the existing ARO liability, a corresponding adjustment is made to the oil and gas property balance.

During


and


, the Company recorded

$58 million

and

$41 million

, respectively, in abandonment liabilities resulting from Apache’s exploration and development capital program. Liabilities divested primarily relate to Canada. Liabilities settled primarily relate to individual properties, platforms, and facilities plugged and abandoned during the period. During


, approximately

$12 million

of abandonment costs were revised upward to reflect changes in estimates of timing and costs in the U.S. and North Sea. During


, approximately

$233 million

of abandonment costs were revised downward, primarily in the North Sea.

7.    DEBT

Overview

All of the Company’s debt is senior unsecured debt and has equal priority with respect to the payment of both principal and interest. The indentures for the notes described below place certain restrictions on the Company, including limits on Apache’s ability to incur debt secured by certain liens and its ability to enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions. Upon certain changes in control, all of these debt instruments would be subject to mandatory repurchase, at the option of the holders. None of the indentures for the notes contain prepayment obligations in the event of a decline in credit ratings.

In November 2016, the Company initiated a program to purchase in the open market up to

$250 million

in aggregate principal amount of senior notes issued under its indentures. In the fourth quarter of 2016, Apache purchased and canceled

$181 million

aggregate principal amount of its senior notes through open market repurchases for

$182 million

APACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)

In August 2017, Apache Corporation assumed the obligations of Apache Finance Canada Corporation (AFCC) in respect of

$300 million

7.75%

notes due in 2029 which AFCC issued and the Company guaranteed pursuant to the governing indenture. The assumption was permitted by the indenture and effected pursuant to a supplemental indenture thereto. As a result of the assumption, the Company is the obligor under the notes and indenture, and AFCC is released from its obligations thereunder. The

$300 million

7.75%

notes historically have been included in the Company’s long-term debt; accordingly, the assumption did not change the Company’s long-term debt or total debt.

The following table presents the carrying value of the Company’s debt at December 31,

These notes are redeemable, as a whole or in part, at Apache’s option, subject to a make-whole premium. The remaining notes and debentures are not redeemable.

notes due 2018 in original principal amount of

$150 million

matured and were repaid.

December 31, 2017

, excluding discounts and deferred loan costs, are as follows:

Fair Value

Apache’s debt is recorded at the carrying amount, net of unamortized discount and deferred loan costs, on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet. The carrying amount, if any, of the Company’s commercial paper and uncommitted credit facilities and overdraft lines approximate fair value because the interest rates are variable and reflective of market rates. Apache uses a market approach to determine the fair value of its fixed-rate debt using estimates provided by an independent investment financial data services firm (a Level 2 fair value measurement).

Money Market and Overdraft Lines of Credit

The Company has certain uncommitted money market and overdraft lines of credit that are used from time to time for working capital purposes. As of

December 31, 2017

and


, there were

no

outstanding balances on Apache’s lines of credit.

Unsecured Committed Bank Credit Facilities

In June 2015, the Company entered into a

five

-year revolving credit facility which matures in

June 2020

, subject to Apache’s

two

,

one

-year extension options. The facility provides for aggregate commitments of

$3.5 billion

(including a

$750 million

letter of credit subfacility), with rights to increase commitments up to an aggregate

$4.5 billion

. Proceeds from borrowings may be used for general corporate purposes. Apache’s available borrowing capacity under this facility supports its commercial paper program. As of

December 31, 2017

, there were no borrowings under this credit facility, leaving aggregate available borrowing capacity at

$3.5 billion

.

At the Company’s option, the interest rate per annum for borrowings under the 2015 facility is either a base rate, as defined, plus a margin or the London Inter-bank Offered Rate (LIBOR), plus a margin. The Company also pays quarterly a facility fee at a per annum rate on total commitments. The margins and the facility fee vary based upon the Company’s senior long-term debt rating. At

December 31, 2017

, the base rate margin was

0.075 percent

, the LIBOR margin was

1.075 percent

, and the facility fee was

0.175 percent

.

The financial covenants of the 2015 credit facility require the Company to maintain an adjusted debt-to-capital ratio of not greater than

60 percent

at the end of any fiscal quarter. For purposes of this calculation, capital excludes the effects of non-cash write-downs, impairments, and related charges occurring after June 30, 2015.

The 2015 facility’s negative covenants restrict the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to create liens securing debt on its hydrocarbon-related assets, with exceptions for liens typically arising in the oil and gas industry, purchase money liens, liens on subsidiary assets located outside of the United States and Canada, and liens arising as a matter of law, such as tax and mechanics’ liens. The Company also may incur liens on assets if debt secured thereby does not exceed

5 percent

of the Company’s consolidated assets, or approximately

$1.1 billion

as of

December 31, 2017

. Negative covenants also restrict Apache’s ability to merge with another entity unless it is the surviving entity, dispose of substantially all of its assets, and guarantee debt of non-consolidated entities in excess of the stated threshold.

In February 2016, Apache entered into a letter of credit facility providing

£900 million

in commitments and rights to increase commitments to

£1.075 billion

. The facility matures in February 2020 and is available for letters of credit denominated in pounds sterling, U.S. Dollars, Canadian Dollars, and any other foreign currency consented to by an issuing bank. The facility also is available for loans in pounds sterling, U.S. Dollars, and Canadian Dollars to cash collateralize letters of credit or obligations to provide letters of credit, in each case, to the extent letters of credit are unavailable under the facility. The facility’s representations and warranties, covenants, and events of default are substantially similar to those in Apache’s 2015

$3.5 billion

revolving credit facility.

Commissions are payable on letters of credit outstanding under the 2016 facility at a per annum rate equal to a LIBOR margin.  Borrowings bear interest per annum at a base rate or LIBOR, plus a margin. A facility fee at a per annum rate on aggregate commitments also is payable.  Letter of credit commissions, the interest margin, and the facility fee vary depending on Apache’s

December 31, 2017

, the LIBOR margin was

, and the facility fee was

The 2016 facility is available for the Company’s letter of credit needs, particularly those which may arise in respect of abandonment obligations assumed in various North Sea acquisitions.  As of

December 31, 2017

,

three

letters of credit aggregating approximately

£129.1 million

and no borrowings were outstanding under this facility.

There are no clauses in the 2015

$3.5 billion

or 2016

£900 million

credit facilities that permit the lenders to accelerate payments or refuse to lend based on unspecified material adverse changes. The agreements for these facilities do not have drawdown restrictions or prepayment obligations in the event of a decline in credit ratings. However, the agreements allow the lenders to accelerate payment maturity and terminate lending and issuance commitments for nonpayment and other breaches, and if the Company or any of its subsidiaries defaults on other indebtedness in excess of the stated threshold, is insolvent, or has any unpaid, non-appealable judgment against it for payment of money in excess of the stated threshold. Lenders may also accelerate payment maturity and terminate lending and issuance commitments if the Company undergoes a specified change in control or any borrower has specified pension plan liabilities in excess of the stated threshold. The Company was in compliance with the terms of these credit facilities as of

December 31, 2017

.

Commercial Paper Program

The Company has available a

$3.5 billion

commercial paper program which, subject to market availability, facilitates Apache borrowing funds for up to


days at competitive interest rates. The commercial paper program is fully supported by available borrowing capacity under the Company’s 2015 committed credit facility. At

On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Act) was signed into law. In addition to reducing the corporate income tax rate from

35 percent

to

21 percent

effective January 1, 2018, certain provisions in the Act move the U.S. away from a worldwide tax system and closer to a territorial system for earnings of foreign corporations, establishing a participation exemption system for taxation of foreign income. The new law includes a transition rule to effect this participation exemption regime. As a result of the enacted legislation, taxpayers are required to include in taxable income for the tax year ending December 31, 2017, the pro rata share of deferred income of each specified foreign corporation with respect to which the taxpayer is a U.S. shareholder. In 2017, the Company recorded a provisional net deferred tax benefit of

$822 million

to reverse a previously recorded deferred tax liability for unrepatriated earnings and to account for the transition rule under the new law.

In addition and as a result of the decrease in the corporate income tax rate, the Company recorded a provisional

$516 million

deferred tax expense in 2017 related to the remeasurement of the Company’s December 31, 2017 deferred tax asset.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)

The Company continues to assess other provisions of the Act including, among other items, the interaction between the deemed repatriation of foreign earnings and 2017 net operating losses as well as the applicability of new taxes on certain future foreign earnings. Provisional amounts for the income tax effects of the Act have been recorded as of December 31, 2017 and are subject to change during 2018.

In 2016, the U.K. government enacted Finance Bill 2016, which provides tax relief to E&P companies operating in the North Sea through a reduction of Supplementary Charge from

20 percent

to

10 percent

, effective January 1, 2016. As a result of the enacted legislation, in 2016, Apache recorded a deferred tax benefit of

$238 million

related to the remeasurement of the Company’s December 31, 2015 U.K. deferred income tax liability.

In 2015, Apache repatriated the sales proceeds from the divestment of its interest in LNG projects and Australian upstream assets. Upon the repatriation of these proceeds, Apache recognized a U.S. current income tax liability of

$560 million

. Also in 2015, the U.K. government enacted Finance Bill 2015, which provided a reduction of Supplementary Charge from

32 percent

to

20 percent

, effective January 1, 2015. As a result of the enacted legislation, in 2015, Apache recorded a deferred tax benefit of

$414 million

related to the remeasurement of the Company’s December 31, 2014 U.K. deferred income tax liability.

The Company has recorded an increase in valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets, primarily driven by asset impairments. The Company has assessed the future potential to realize these deferred tax assets and has concluded that it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will not be realized based on current economic conditions and expectations for the future.

9.    COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

Legal Matters

Apache is party to various legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business, including litigation and governmental and regulatory controls. The Company has an accrued liability of approximately

$37 million

for all legal contingencies that are deemed to be probable of occurring and can be reasonably estimated. Apache’s estimates are based on information known about the matters and its experience in contesting, litigating, and settling similar matters. Although actual amounts could differ from management’s estimate, none of the actions are believed by management to involve future amounts that would be material to Apache’s financial position, results of operations, or liquidity after consideration of recorded accruals. For material matters that Apache believes an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible, the Company has disclosed the nature of the matter and a range of potential exposure, unless an estimate cannot be made at this time. It is management’s opinion that the loss for any other litigation matters and claims that are reasonably possible to occur will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.

Argentine Claims

On March 12, 2014, the Company and its subsidiaries completed the sale of all of the Company’s subsidiaries’ operations and properties in Argentina to YPF Sociedad Anonima (YPF). As part of that sale, YPF assumed responsibility for all of the past, present, and future litigation in Argentina involving Company subsidiaries, except that Company subsidiaries have agreed to indemnify YPF for certain environmental, tax, and royalty obligations capped at an aggregate of

$100 million

. The indemnity is subject to specific agreed conditions precedent, thresholds, contingencies, limitations, claim deadlines, loss sharing, and other terms and conditions. On April 11, 2014, YPF provided its first notice of claims pursuant to the indemnity. Company subsidiaries have not paid any amounts under the indemnity but will continue to review and consider claims presented by YPF. Further, Company subsidiaries retain the right to enforce certain Argentina-related indemnification obligations against Pioneer Natural Resources Company (Pioneer) in an amount up to

$67.5 million

pursuant to the terms and conditions of stock purchase agreements entered in 2006 between Company subsidiaries and subsidiaries of Pioneer.

Louisiana Restoration

Louisiana surface owners often file lawsuits or assert claims against oil and gas companies, including Apache, claiming that operators and working interest owners in the chain of title are liable for environmental damages on the leased premises, including damages measured by the cost of restoration of the leased premises to its original condition, regardless of the value of the underlying property. From time to time restoration lawsuits and claims are resolved by the Company for amounts that are not material to the Company, while new lawsuits and claims are asserted against the Company. With respect to each of the pending lawsuits and claims, the amount claimed is not currently determinable or is not material, except as noted. Further, the overall exposure related to these lawsuits and claims is not currently determinable. While an adverse judgment against Apache is possible, Apache intends to actively defend these lawsuits and claims.

On July 24, 2013, a lawsuit captioned

Board of Commissioners of the Southeast Louisiana Flood Protection Authority – East v. Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company et al.

, Case No. 2013-6911 was filed in the Civil District Court for the Parish of Orleans, State of Louisiana, in which plaintiff on behalf of itself and as the board governing the levee districts of Orleans, Lake Borgne Basin, and East Jefferson alleged that Louisiana coastal lands have been damaged as a result of oil and gas industry activity, including a network of canals for access and pipelines. The defendants removed the case from state court to federal court and, on February 13, 2015, the federal court entered judgment in favor of defendants dismissing all of plaintiff’s claims with prejudice. Plaintiff appealed the lower court’s dismissal to the 5

th

Circuit Court of Appeals and additionally challenged the defendants’ right to remove the case to federal court. On March 3, 2017, the 5

th

Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the propriety of federal jurisdiction based in part on Apache’s argument that plaintiff’s state-based claims required a resolution of substantial questions of federal law and also affirmed the dismissal of the action. The Plaintiff filed a Petition for a Writ of Certiorari with the United States Supreme Court and that Petition was denied.

Starting in November of 2013 and continuing into 2017, several parishes in Louisiana have pending lawsuits against many oil and gas producers, including Apache. These cases are pending in federal and state courts in Louisiana. In these cases, the Parishes, as plaintiffs, allege that defendants’ oil and gas exploration, production, and transportation operations in specified fields were conducted in violation of the State and Local Coastal Resources Management Act of 1978, as amended, and applicable regulations, rules, orders, and ordinances promulgated or adopted thereunder by the Parish or the State of Louisiana. Plaintiffs allege that defendants caused substantial damage to land and water bodies located in the coastal zone of Louisiana. Plaintiffs seek, among other things, unspecified damages for alleged violations of applicable state law within the coastal zone, the payment of costs necessary to clear, re-vegetate, detoxify, and otherwise restore the subject coastal zone as near as practicable to its original condition, and actual restoration of the coastal zone to its original condition. While an adverse judgment against Apache might be possible, Apache intends to vigorously oppose these claims.

Apollo Exploration Lawsuit

In a case captioned

Apollo Exploration, LLC, Cogent Exploration, Ltd. Co. & SellmoCo, LLC v. Apache Corporation

, Cause No. CV50538 in the 385t

h

Judicial District Court, Midland County, Texas, plaintiffs allege damages in excess of

$200 million

(having previously claimed in excess of

$1.1 billion

) relating to purchase and sale agreements, mineral leases, and areas of mutual interest agreements concerning properties located in Hartley, Moore, Potter, and Oldham Counties, Texas. Apache believes that plaintiffs’ claims lack merit, and further that plaintiffs’ alleged damages are grossly inflated. Apache will vigorously oppose the claims.

Escheat Audits

In September 2010, the State of Delaware, Department of Finance, Division of Revenue (Unclaimed Property) (Delaware), notified Apache Corporation that Delaware’s consultant, Kelmar Associates, would examine Apache’s books and records and those of its subsidiaries and related entities to determine compliance with Delaware Escheat Laws. Delaware has notified the Company that its audit is complete and the matter has been resolved for an amount that is not material to the Company.

Australian Operations Divestiture Dispute

By a Sale and Purchase Agreement dated April 9, 2015 (SPA), the Company and its subsidiaries divested their remaining Australian operations to Quadrant Energy Pty Ltd (Quadrant). Closing occurred on June 5, 2015. In April 2017, Apache filed suit against Quadrant for breach of the SPA. In its suit, Apache seeks approximately

$80 million

. In December 2017, Quadrant filed a defense of equitable set-off to Apache’s claim and a counterclaim seeking approximately

$200 million

in the aggregate. The Company believes that Quadrant’s claims lack merit and will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operation, or liquidity.

California Litigation

On July 17, 2017, in three separate actions, San Mateo County, California, Marin County, California, and the City of Imperial Beach, California, all filed suit individually and on behalf of the people of the state of California against over 30 oil, gas, and coal companies alleging damages as a result of global warming. Plaintiffs seek unspecified damages and abatement under various tort theories. On December 20, 2017, in two separate actions, the City of Santa Cruz and Santa Cruz County and in a separate action on January 22, 2018, the City of Richmond, filed similar lawsuits against many of the same defendants. Apache believes that the claims made against it are baseless and intends to vigorously defend these lawsuits.

Environmental Matters

The Company, as an owner or lessee and operator of oil and gas properties, is subject to various federal, state, local, and foreign country laws and regulations relating to discharge of materials into, and protection of, the environment. These laws and regulations may, among other things, impose liability on the lessee under an oil and gas lease for the cost of pollution clean-up resulting from operations and subject the lessee to liability for pollution damages. In some instances, the Company may be directed to suspend or cease operations in the affected area. The Company maintains insurance coverage, which it believes is customary in the industry, although the Company is not fully insured against all environmental risks.

Apache manages its exposure to environmental liabilities on properties to be acquired by identifying existing problems and assessing the potential liability. The Company also conducts periodic reviews, on a Company-wide basis, to identify changes in its environmental risk profile. These reviews evaluate whether there is a probable liability, the amount, and the likelihood that the liability will be incurred. The amount of any potential liability is determined by considering, among other matters, incremental direct costs of any likely remediation and the proportionate cost of employees who are expected to devote a significant amount of

F-35

APACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)

time directly to any possible remediation effort. As it relates to evaluations of purchased properties, depending on the extent of an identified environmental problem, the Company may exclude a property from the acquisition, require the seller to remediate the property to Apache’s satisfaction, or agree to assume liability for the remediation of the property. The Company’s general policy is to limit any reserve additions to any incidents or sites that are considered probable to result in an expected remediation cost exceeding

$300,000

. Any environmental costs and liabilities that are not reserved for are treated as an expense when actually incurred. In Apache’s estimation, neither these expenses nor expenses related to training and compliance programs are likely to have a material impact on its financial condition.

As of

December 31, 2017

, the Company had an undiscounted reserve for environmental remediation of approximately

$4 million

. Apache is not aware of any environmental claims existing as of

December 31, 2017

that have not been provided for or would otherwise have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations. There can be no assurance however, that current regulatory requirements will not change or past non-compliance with environmental laws will not be discovered on the Company’s properties.

ACL, a former subsidiary of the Company, previously reported produced water spills in a remote area of the Bellow Field and a hydrogen sulfide and oil emulsion leak in the Zama area. The Company sold ACL in a transaction that was completed in the third quarter of 2017. The Canadian environmental litigation and liabilities remained with ACL and are now the responsibility of the acquirer.

Contractual Obligations

At

December 31, 2017

, contractual obligations for long-term operating leases, capital leases, and purchase obligations are as follows:

(1)

Payments associated with the drilling of exploratory wells and development wells net of amounts billed to partners will be capitalized as a component of oil and gas properties, and either depreciated, impaired, or written off as exploration expense.

(2)

Amounts represent any agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms. These include minimum commitments associated with take-or-pay contracts, NGL processing agreements, drilling work program commitments, and agreements to secure capacity rights on third-party pipelines. Includes amounts related to firm transportation capacity on the Gulf Coast Express Pipeline Project (GCX Project), expected to be in service in October 2019. Amounts exclude certain product purchase obligations related to marketing and trading activities for which there are no minimum purchase requirements or the amounts are not fixed or determinable.

(3)

Amounts include long-term lease payments for office space, aircraft, supply and standby vessels, land leases, and equipment related to exploration, development, and production activities. The Company expects to receive

10.    RETIREMENT AND DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLANS

Apache Corporation provides retirement benefits to its U.S. employees through the use of multiple plans: a 401(k) savings plan, a money purchase retirement plan, a non-qualified retirement/savings plan, and a non-qualified restorative retirement savings plan. The 401(k) savings plan provides participating employees the ability to elect to contribute up to

50 percent

of eligible compensation, as defined, to the plan with the Company making matching contributions up to a maximum of

8 percent

of each employee’s annual eligible compensation. In addition, the Company annually contributes

6 percent

of each participating employee’s annual eligible compensation to a money purchase retirement plan. The 401(k) savings plan and the money purchase retirement plan are subject to certain annually-adjusted, government-mandated restrictions that limit the amount of employee and Company contributions. For certain eligible employees, the Company also provides a non-qualified retirement/savings plan or a non-qualified restorative retirement savings plan. These plans allow the deferral of up to

50 percent

of each employee’s base salary, up to

75 percent

of each employee’s annual bonus (that accepts employee contributions) and the Company’s matching contributions in excess of the government mandated limitations imposed in the 401(k) savings plan and money purchase retirement plan.

Vesting in the Company’s contributions in the 401(k) savings plan, the money purchase retirement plan, the non-qualified retirement savings plan and the non-qualified restorative retirement savings plan occurs at the rate of

20 percent

for every completed year of employment. Upon a change in control of ownership of Apache Corporation, immediate and full vesting occurs.

Additionally, Apache North Sea Limited maintains a separate retirement plan, as required under the laws of the U.K.

The aggregate annual cost to Apache of all U.S. and international

savings plans, the money purchase retirement plan, non-qualified retirement/savings plan, and non-qualified restorative retirement savings plan was

$55 million

,

$52 million

, and

$59 million

, and


, respectively.

Apache also provides a funded noncontributory defined benefit pension plan (U.K. Pension Plan) covering certain employees of the Company’s North Sea operations in the U.K. The plan provides defined pension benefits based on years of service and final salary. The plan applies only to employees who were part of BP North Sea’s pension plan as of April 2, 2003, prior to the acquisition of BP North Sea by the Company effective July 1, 2003.

Additionally, the Company offers postretirement medical benefits to U.S. employees who meet certain eligibility requirements. Eligible participants receive medical benefits up until the age of


or at the date they become eligible for Medicare, provided the participant remits the required portion of the cost of coverage. The plan is contributory with participants’ contributions adjusted annually. The postretirement benefit plan does not cover benefit expenses once a covered participant becomes eligible for Medicare.

Stock Compensation Plans

The Company has several stock-based compensation plans, which include stock options, restricted stock, and conditional restricted stock unit plans. On May 12, 2016, the Company’s shareholders approved the 2016 Omnibus Compensation Plan (the 2016 Plan), which is intended to provide eligible employees with equity-based incentives. The 2016 Plan provides for the granting of Incentive Stock Options, Non-Qualified Stock Options, Performance Awards, Restricted Stock Awards, Restricted Stock Units, Stock Appreciation Rights, Cash Awards, or any combination of the foregoing. A total of

16.9 million

shares were authorized and available for grant under the 2016 Plan as of

December 31, 2017

. Previously approved plans remain in effect solely for the purpose of governing grants still outstanding that were issued prior to approval of the 2016 Plan. All new grants are issued from the 2016 Plan.

For


,


, and


, stock-based compensation expensed was

$142 million

,

$131 million

, and

$100 million

, respectively. Costs related to the plans are capitalized or expensed based on the nature of each employee’s activities. A description of the Company’s stock-based compensation plans and related costs follows:

Stock Options

As of

December 31, 2017

, the Company had issued options to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock under the 2007 Omnibus Equity Compensation Plan, the 2011 Omnibus Equity Compensation Plan (2011 Plan), and the 2016 Plan (together, the Omnibus Plans). New shares of Company stock will be issued for employee stock option exercises. Under the Omnibus Plans, the exercise price of each option equals the closing price of Apache’s common stock on the date of grant. Options issued prior to 2016 generally become exercisable ratably over a

four

-year period and expire


years after granted. Options granted in or after 2016 become exercisable ratably over a

three

-year period and expire

10 years

after granted. The Omnibus Plans were submitted to and approved by the Company’s shareholders.

A summary of stock options issued and outstanding under the Omnibus Plans is presented in the table and narrative below:

(1)

As of

December 31, 2017

, options outstanding had a weighted average remaining contractual life of

4.7

years and aggregate intrinsic value of

$0.7 million

As of

December 31, 2017

, options expected to vest had a weighted average remaining contractual life of

.

(3)

As of

December 31, 2017

, options exercisable had a weighted average remaining contractual life of

3.7

years and aggregate intrinsic value of

$0.2 million

.

The fair value of each stock option award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Assumptions used in the valuation are disclosed in the following table. Expected volatilities are based on historical volatility of the Company’s common stock and other factors. The expected dividend yield is based on historical yields on the date of grant. The expected term of stock options granted represents the period of time that the stock options are expected to be outstanding and is derived from historical exercise behavior, current trends, and values derived from lattice-based models. The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.

restricted stock units and

1,954,474

cash-settled awards (phantom units) at a weighted-average per-share market price of

$46.27

under the 2016 Plan to eligible employees. The phantom units represent a hypothetical interest in the Company’s stock and, once vested, are settled in cash. Total compensation cost for restricted stock units and phantom units absent any forfeitures, is estimated to be

$23 million

and

$90 million

, respectively, and was calculated based on the fair market value of a share of the Company’s common stock as of the grant date. Compensation cost will be recognized over a

three

-year vesting period for both plans. The phantom units will be classified as a liability and remeasured at the end of each reporting period based on the change in fair value of one share of the Company’s common stock.

Performance Program

To provide long-term incentives for Apache employees to deliver competitive returns to the Company’s stockholders, the Company has granted conditional restricted stock units to eligible employees. Apache has a performance program for certain eligible employees with payout for

50 percent

of the shares based upon measurement of total shareholder return (TSR) of Apache common stock as compared to a designated peer group during a three-year performance period. Payout for the remaining

50 percent

of the shares is based on performance and financial objectives as defined in the plan. The overall results of the objectives are calculated at the end of the award’s stated performance period and, if a payout is warranted, applied to the target number of restricted

stock units awarded. The performance shares will immediately vest

50 percent

at the end of the

three

-year performance period, with the remaining

50 percent

vesting at the end of the following year. Grants from the performance programs outstanding at

December 31, 2017

, are as described below:

•

In February 2015, the Company’s Board of Directors approved the 2015 Performance Program, pursuant to the 2011 Plan. Eligible employees received initial conditional restricted stock unit awards totaling

602,304

units. The results for the performance period ending December 31, 2017, yielded a payout of

100 percent

of target. A total of

384,967

units were outstanding as of

December 31, 2017

.

•

In January 2016, the Company’s Board of Directors approved the 2016 Performance Program, pursuant to the 2011 Plan. Eligible employees received initial conditional restricted stock unit awards totaling

871,369

. The actual amount of shares awarded will be between

zero

and

200 percent

of target. A total of

749,334

units were outstanding as of

December 31, 2017

, from which a minimum of

zero

and a maximum of

1,498,668

units could be awarded.

•

In January 2017, the Company’s Board of Directors approved the 2017 Performance Program, pursuant to the 2016 Plan. Eligible employees received initial conditional restricted stock unit awards totaling

620,885

units. The actual amount of shares awarded will be between

559,336

units were outstanding as of

December 31, 2017

, from which a minimum of

of total unrecognized compensation cost related to

1,693,637

unvested conditional restricted stock units. The weighted-average remaining life of the unvested conditional restricted stock units is approximately

1.6

years.

(1)

The fair value of each conditional restricted stock unit award is estimated as of the date of grant using a Monte Carlo simulation with the following assumptions used for all grants made under the plan: (i) a three-year continuous risk-free interest rate; (ii) a constant volatility assumption based on the historical realized stock price volatility of the Company and the designated peer group; and (iii) the historical stock prices and expected dividends of the common stock of the Company and its designated peer group.

In January 2018, the Company’s Board of Directors approved the 2018 Performance Program, pursuant to the 2016 Plan, with terms similar to the 2017 Performance Program described above. Eligible employees received the initial conditional phantom units totaling

872,030

units, with the ultimate number of phantom units to be awarded ranging from

zero

to a maximum of

1,744,060

units. These phantom units represent a hypothetical interest in the Company’s stock, and, once vested, are settled in cash. The TSR component of the award had a grant date fair value per award of

$54.70

based on a Monte Carlo simulation. The grant date fair value per award for the remaining

50 percent

was

$46.27

based on the fair market value of a share of common stock of the Company as of the grant date. These phantom units will be classified as a liability and remeasured at the end of each reporting period.

The following table sets forth the capitalized costs and associated accumulated depreciation, depletion, and amortization relating to the Company’s oil and gas acquisition, exploration, and development activities:

Oil and Gas Reserve Information

Proved oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities of natural gas, crude oil, condensate, and natural gas liquids (NGLs) that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing conditions, operating conditions, and government regulations. Estimated proved developed oil and gas reserves can be expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods. The Company reports all estimated proved reserves held under production-sharing arrangements utilizing the “economic interest” method, which excludes the host country’s share of reserves.

Estimated reserves that can be produced economically through application of improved recovery techniques are included in the “proved” classification when successful testing by a pilot project or the operation of an active, improved recovery program using reliable technology establishes the reasonable certainty for the engineering analysis on which the project or program is based. Economically producible means a resource which generates revenue that exceeds, or is reasonably expected to exceed, the costs of the operation. Reasonable certainty means a high degree of confidence that the quantities will be recovered. Reliable technology is a grouping of one or more technologies (including computational methods) that has been field-tested and has been demonstrated to provide reasonably certain results with consistency and repeatability in the formation being evaluated or in an analogous formation. In estimating its proved reserves, Apache uses several different traditional methods that can be classified in three general categories: 1) performance-based methods; 2) volumetric-based methods; and 3) analogy with similar properties. Apache will, at times, utilize additional technical analysis such as computer reservoir models, petrophysical techniques, and proprietary 3-D seismic interpretation methods to provide additional support for more complex reservoirs. Information from this additional analysis is combined with traditional methods outlined above to enhance the certainty of Apache’s reserve estimates.

There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves and projecting future rates of production and timing of development expenditures. The reserve data in the following tables only represent estimates and should not be construed as being exact.

Approximately

9 percent

of Apache’s year-end


estimated proved developed reserves are classified as proved not producing. These reserves relate to zones that are either behind pipe, or that have been completed but not yet produced, or zones that have been produced in the past, but are not now producing because of mechanical reasons. These reserves are considered to be a lower tier of reserves than producing reserves because they are frequently based on volumetric calculations rather than performance data. Future production associated with behind pipe reserves is scheduled to follow depletion of the currently producing zones in the same wellbores. Additional capital may have to be spent to access these reserves. The capital and economic impact of production timing are reflected in this Note 15, under “Future Net Cash Flows.”

Future Net Cash Flows

Future cash inflows as of

December 31, 2017

and


were calculated using an unweighted arithmetic average of oil and gas prices in effect on the first day of each month in the respective year, except where prices are defined by contractual arrangements. Operating costs, production and ad valorem taxes and future development costs are based on current costs with no escalation.

The following table sets forth unaudited information concerning future net cash flows for proved oil and gas reserves, net of income tax expense. Income tax expense has been computed using expected future tax rates and giving effect to tax deductions and credits available, under current laws, and which relate to oil and gas producing activities. This information does not purport to present the fair market value of the Company’s oil and gas assets, but does present a standardized disclosure concerning possible future net cash flows that would result under the assumptions used.
