PART I

ITEMS 1 and 2.

BUSINESS AND PROPERTIES

General

Apache Corporation, a Delaware corporation formed in 1954, is an independent energy company that explores for, develops, and produces natural gas, crude oil, and natural gas liquids. Apache currently has exploration and production operations in four geographic areas: the United States (U.S.), Canada, Egypt, and offshore the United Kingdom (U.K.) in the North Sea. Apache also has exploration interests in Suriname that may, over time, result in a reportable discovery and development opportunity.

Our common stock, par value $0.625 per share, has been listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) since 1969, on the Chicago Stock Exchange (CHX) since 1960, and on the NASDAQ Global Select Market (NASDAQ) since 2004. On May 31, 2016, we filed certifications of our compliance with the listing standards of the NYSE and the NASDAQ, including our principal executive officer’s certification of compliance with the NYSE standards.

Properties to which we refer in this document may be held by subsidiaries of Apache Corporation. References to “Apache” or the “Company” include Apache Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries unless otherwise specifically stated.

During the second quarter of 2016, Apache changed its method of accounting for its oil and gas exploration and development activities from the full cost method to the successful efforts method of accounting. Financial information for all periods has been recast to reflect retrospective application of the successful efforts method of accounting. See Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Part IV, Item 15 of this Form 10-K.

During 2015, Apache sold its Australia LNG business and oil and gas assets. During 2014, Apache sold its operations in Argentina. Results of operations and cash flows from operations for Argentina and Australia are reflected as discontinued operations in the Company’s financial statements for all periods presented. Certain historical information has been recast to reflect the results of operations for Argentina and Australia as discontinued operations.

Business Strategy

Apache’s mission is to grow a profitable exploration and production company in a safe and environmentally responsible manner for the long-term benefit of our shareholders. Apache’s long-term perspective has many dimensions, which are centered on the following core strategic components:

•

rigorous portfolio management

•

conservative capital structure

•

optimization of returns

Rigorous management of the Company’s asset portfolio plays a key role in optimizing shareholder value over the long-term. The Company has monetized certain capital intensive projects that were not accretive to earnings in the near-term and other non-strategic assets. These divestitures over the past few years included selling Apache’s interest in LNG projects in Australia and Canada, all of its exploration and production operations in Australia and Argentina, mature assets offshore in the Gulf of Mexico, and various leasehold areas in North America onshore plays where the Company made strategic decisions to allocate resources to other, more impactful development opportunities.


Preserving financial flexibility is also key to the Company’s business philosophy. In response to the significant decline in commodity prices that began in 2014, Apache immediately took proactive measures to reduce activity levels and bring costs in alignment with activity levels, while taking concrete steps to cut overhead, operating, and drilling costs. The Company allocated a portion of its reduced overall capital spend in North America for strategic testing and completion optimization, which resulted in significant expansion of our economic drilling inventory and improved well performance. In addition, the Company completed confirmation testing and initiated a delineation program that confirmed a significant exploration discovery in the Delaware Basin, “Alpine High.”

For a more in-depth discussion of the Company’s

Alpine High discovery, please refer to the Permian region discussion. For a more in-depth discussion of the Company’s

divestitures, strategy, 2016 results, and its capital resources and liquidity, please see Part II, Item 7—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this Form 10-K.

Geographic Area Overviews

Apache has exploration and production interests in four geographic areas: the United States (U.S.), Canada, Egypt, and the United Kingdom (U.K.) North Sea. Apache also has exploration interests in Suriname that may, over time, result in a reportable discovery and development opportunity.

The following table sets out a brief comparative summary of certain key


data for each of Apache’s operating areas. Additional data and discussion is provided in Part II, Item 7—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this Form 10-K.

(1)

Apache's operations in Egypt, excluding a one-third noncontrolling interest, contributed

24 percent

of


production and accounted for

15 percent

of year-end estimated proved reserves and

28 percent

of estimated discounted future net cash flows.

(2)

Average sales volumes from the North Sea for 2016 were

24.5

MMboe. Sales volumes may vary from production volumes as a result of the timing of liftings in the Beryl field.

North America

In 2016, Apache’s North American operations contributed approximately 54 percent of production and 69 percent of estimated year-end proved reserves. Apache has access to significant liquid hydrocarbons across its 11.3 million gross acres in North America, 59 percent of which is undeveloped.


In North America Apache has three onshore regions:

•

The Permian region located in West Texas and New Mexico includes the Permian sub-basins, the Midland Basin, Central Basin Platform/Northwest Shelf, and Delaware Basin. Examples of shale plays within this region include the Woodford, Barnett, Pennsylvanian, Cline, Wolfcamp, Bone Spring, and Spraberry.

•

The Midcontinent/Gulf Coast region (formerly Gulf Coast and Central regions) includes the Granite Wash, Tonkawa, Canyon Lime, Marmaton, and Cleveland formations of the West Anadarko Basin, the Woodford-SCOOP and Stack plays located in Central Oklahoma, and the Eagle Ford shale in South East Texas.

•

The Canada region has exploration and production operations in the provinces of British Columbia, Alberta, and Saskatchewan. Current drilling activities are primarily focused in the Duvernay and Montney shale plays.

Apache also has one offshore region in North America, the Gulf of Mexico region, which consists of both shallow and deep water exploration and production activities.

Permian Region

The Permian region is one of Apache’s core growth areas. Highlights of the Company’s operations in the region include:

•

Over 3.1 million gross acres with exposure to numerous plays focused primarily in the Midland Basin, the Central Basin Platform/Northwest Shelf, and the Delaware Basin.

•

Estimated proved reserves of 611 MMboe at year-end 2016, representing 47 percent of the Company’s worldwide reserves.

•

Annual production decline of only

4 percent

, despite operating an average rig count of 5, down from 12 rigs in 2015 and 40 rigs in 2014. The reduced rig count reflected the Company’s decisive action to curtail capital spending in response to continued weakness in commodity prices until commodity prices and costs come into better equilibrium.

•

In 2016, the Permian region drilled or participated in 132 wells, 96 of which were horizontal, with a 96 percent success rate.

In September 2016, after more than two years of extensive geological and geophysical work, methodical acreage accumulation, and strategic testing and delineation drilling, Apache announced the discovery of a significant new resource play, “Alpine High.” Apache’s Alpine High acreage lies in the southern portion of the Delaware Basin, primarily in Reeves County, Texas. The Company has established an acreage position of over 320,000 contiguous net acres, which it acquired at an attractive average cost of approximately $1,300 per acre. Since first announcing the Alpine High last September, the Company has made substantial progress further delineating the opportunity. The Company has confirmed an extensive play fairway which spans 55 miles and a 5,000-foot vertical column encompassing five geologic formations, with multiple target zones spanning the hydrocarbon phase window from dry gas to wet gas to oil. We have recently identified an additional landing zone in the Woodford formation, and confirmed production from the Pennsylvanian. Based on these results, Apache now believes the drilling locations at Alpine High will exceed the 2,000 to 3,000 previously announced. During 2017, we expect to average 4 to 6 drilling rigs at Alpine High. A second hydraulic fracturing crew was added at the start of the year to accelerate completions and data collection. Using data collected from strategic testing and delineation drilling, the Company is now beginning to optimize wells drilled in Alpine High using customized targeting, larger fracs, and longer laterals. Combined with multi-well pad drilling, the Company believes these measures contribute to the optimized development of the area to maximize economic value. The field is expected to have low levels of water production which will also have a positive impact on long-term economics. We are currently installing the infrastructure, which will allow gas sales from the field around mid-year 2017.

In addition to activity in Alpine High, the Permian region drilled or participated in over 110 wells in 2016, with a 100 percent success rate. In the Midland Basin, where Apache holds approximately 443,000 net acres, activity was focused on stratigraphic and development pad drilling of the Wolfcamp and Spraberry shale formations in the Wildfire, Powell, and Azalea areas. Activity in Midland Basin has been significantly increased in 2017: the region has increased the rig count to five, compared to an average of one in 2016. The additional rigs will be dedicated to long-term pad development drilling. The Company’s assets in the Central Basin Platform/Northwest Shelf span 739,000 net acres. The Yeso play was the primary focus of 2016 development activities in this area. In the Delaware Basin, Apache holds approximately 392,000 net acres. In addition to drilling and development activities at Alpine High, the Company targeted plays in the Bone Spring and Wolfcamp plays.


Apache plans to significantly increase activity in the Permian region during 2017, while continuing to balance capital investments between its larger development project at Alpine High and focused exploration and development programs on other core assets in its Permian region. During 2017, the Company expects to average 15 drilling rigs in the Permian Basin and drill approximately 250 wells, which includes a four to six rig delineation drilling program at Alpine High. The Company plans to allocate approximately two-thirds of its 2017 capital budget to the Permian region.

Midcontinent/Gulf Coast Region

As part of Apache’s 2015 strategic efforts to reduce its operating cost structure, the Company combined the Midcontinent (formerly Central region) and Gulf Coast regions. Apache’s Midcontinent/Gulf Coast region includes 2.6 million gross acres and over 3,200 producing wells primarily in western Oklahoma, the Texas Panhandle and south Texas. In 2016, the region accounted for 11 percent of the Company’s production and approximately 9 percent of the Company’s year-end estimated proved reserves.

In


, Apache drilled or participated in drilling 35 wells with a 94 percent success rate. Activity was focused primarily in the Woodford-SCOOP and Canyon Lime formations. In 2017, Apache plans to run a targeted program, drilling four wells in the Woodford-SCOOP play. In addition, the region will continue its focus on high grading acreage and building its inventory of future drilling locations.

Canada Region

Apache holds 3.5 million gross acres across the provinces of British Columbia, Alberta, and Saskatchewan. The region’s large acreage position provides significant drilling opportunities and portfolio diversification with exposure to oil, gas, and liquids rich fairways. The Canadian region provided approximately

11 percent

of Apache’s


worldwide production and 175 MMboe of estimated proved reserves at year-end.

In


, Apache drilled or participated in drilling 17 wells in the region with an 88 percent success rate. Drilling operations primarily focused on the Wapiti Montney, Ante Creek Montney, Duvernay, and Glauconite plays. In 2017, the Company expects to drill 10 wells: a six-well pad in the Duvernay play, three wells in the Wapiti Montney play, and one exploratory well in the East Shale Basin.

Gulf of Mexico Region

The Gulf of Mexico region comprises assets in the offshore waters of the Gulf of Mexico and onshore Louisiana. In addition to its interest in several deepwater exploration and development offshore leases, when the Company sold substantially all of its offshore assets in water depths less than 1,000 feet, it retained a 50 percent ownership interest in all exploration blocks and in horizons below production in development blocks, and access to existing infrastructure. Apache’s offshore technical teams continue to focus on evaluating subsalt and other deeper exploration opportunities in water depths less than 1,000 feet, which have been relatively untested by the industry, where high-potential deep hydrocarbon plays may exist. During 2016, Apache’s Gulf of Mexico region contributed 7.7 Mboe/d to the Company’s total production. During 2017, the Company expects to participate in one non-operated exploration well.

North America Marketing

In general, most of the Company’s North American gas is sold at either monthly or daily market prices. The Company also occasionally enters into fixed physical sales contracts for durations of up to one year. These physical sales volumes are typically sold at fixed prices over the term of the contract. Natural gas is sold primarily to local distribution companies (LDCs), utilities, end-users, marketers, and integrated major oil companies. Apache strives to maintain a diverse client portfolio, which is intended to reduce the concentration of credit risk.

Apache primarily markets its North American crude oil to integrated major oil companies, marketing and transportation companies, and refiners based on a West Texas Intermediate (WTI) price, adjusted for quality, transportation, and a market-reflective differential.

In the U.S., Apache’s objective is to maximize the value of crude oil sold by identifying the best markets and most economical transportation routes available to move the product. Sales contracts are generally 30-day evergreen contracts that renew automatically until canceled by either party. These contracts provide for sales that are priced daily at prevailing market prices. Also, from time to time, the Company will enter into physical term sales contracts for durations up to five years. These term contracts typically have a firm transport commitment and often provide for the higher of prevailing market prices from multiple market hubs.

In Canada, crude is transported by pipeline or truck within Western Canada to market hubs in Alberta and Manitoba where it is sold, allowing for a more diversified group of purchasers and a higher netback price. The Company evaluates its transport options monthly to maximize its netback prices.

Apache’s NGL production is sold under contracts with prices based on local supply and demand conditions, less the costs for transportation and fractionation, or on a weighted-average sales price received by the purchaser.


International

In


, international assets contributed

46 percent

of Apache’s production and

56 percent

of oil and gas revenues. Approximately

31 percent

of estimated proved reserves at year-end were located outside North America.

Apache has two international regions:

•

The Egypt region includes onshore conventional assets in Egypt’s Western Desert.

•

The North Sea region includes offshore assets based in the United Kingdom.

The Company also has an offshore exploration program in Suriname.

Egypt

Apache’s Egypt operations are conducted pursuant to production sharing contracts (PSCs). Under the terms of the Company’s PSCs, the contractor partners (Contractor) bears the risk and cost of exploration, development, and production activities. In return, if exploration is successful, the Contractor receives entitlement to variable physical volumes of hydrocarbons, representing recovery of the costs incurred and a stipulated share of production after cost recovery. Additionally, the Contractor’s income taxes, which remain the liability of the Contractor under domestic law, are paid by Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation (EGPC) on behalf of the Contractor out of EGPC’s production entitlement. Income taxes paid to the Arab Republic of Egypt on behalf of the Contractor are recognized as oil and gas sales revenue and income tax expense and reflected as production and estimated reserves. Because Contractor cost recovery entitlement and income taxes paid on its behalf are determined as a monetary amount, the quantities of production entitlement and estimated reserves attributable to these monetary amounts will fluctuate with commodity prices. In addition, because the Contractor income taxes are paid by EGPC, the amount of the income tax has no economic impact on Apache’s Egypt operations despite impacting Apache’s production and reserves. Sinopec International Petroleum Exploration and Production Corporation (Sinopec) holds a one-third minority participation interest in Apache’s oil and gas operations in Egypt.

Apache has 21 years of exploration, development and operations experience in Egypt and is one of the largest acreage holders in Egypt’s Western Desert. At year-end 2016, the Company held 4.8 million gross acres in 23 separate concessions. Development leases within concessions currently have expiration dates ranging from 4 to 20 years, with extensions possible for additional commercial discoveries or on a negotiated basis. Approximately 63 percent of the Company’s acreage in Egypt is undeveloped, providing us with considerable exploration and development opportunities for the future. In December 2016, the Company was notified by the Egyptian Ministry that it was the successful bidder in two new concessions, which will add an additional 1.6 million gross undeveloped acres to its portfolio. Apache anticipates these concessions will be signed into law mid-2017.

The Company’s estimated proved reserves in Egypt are reported under the economic interest method and exclude the host country’s share of reserves. The Egypt region, including the one-third noncontrolling interest, contributed

33 percent

of


production,

21 percent

of year-end estimated proved reserves, and

37 percent

of estimated discounted future net cash flows. Excluding the noncontrolling interest, Egypt contributed

24 percent

of


production,

15 percent

of year-end estimated proved reserves, and

28 percent

of estimated discounted future net cash flows.

While Apache has historically been one of the most active drillers in the Western Desert, activity has been curtailed for the past several years in response to weak oil prices. In 2016, the region drilled 47 development and 14 exploration wells. Approximately 57 percent of the exploration wells were successful, further expanding Apache’s presence in the westernmost concessions and unlocking additional opportunities in existing plays. A key component of the region’s success has been the ability to acquire and evaluate 3-D seismic surveys that enable Apache’s technical teams to consistently high-grade existing prospects and identify new targets across multiple pay horizons in the Cretaceous, Jurassic, and deeper Paleozoic formations.

In 2017, Apache plans to operate 8 to 10 drilling rigs and drill approximately 90 to 100 wells. In addition, Apache will initiate a large, continuous 3-D seismic survey program to support development on its existing acreage and exploration on its new concessions. The program will provide newer vintage, higher resolution imaging of the substrata across Apache’s Western Desert position, allowing Apache to build and high-grade its drilling inventory.

Egypt Marketing

Apache’s gas production in Egypt is sold to EGPC primarily under an industry-pricing formula, a sliding scale based on Dated Brent crude oil with a minimum of $1.50 per MMBtu and a maximum of $2.65 per MMBtu, plus an upward adjustment for liquids content. The region averaged

$2.71

per Mcf in


.

Oil production is sold to third parties in the export market or to EGPC when called upon to supply domestic demand. Oil production sold to third parties is exported from or sold at one of two terminals on the northern coast of Egypt. Oil production sold to EGPC is sold at prices equivalent to the export market

.


North Sea

Apache has interests in approximately 380,000 gross acres in the U.K. North Sea. The region contributed 13 percent of Apache’s 2016 production and approximately 10 percent of year-end estimated proved reserves.

Apache entered the North Sea in 2003 after acquiring an approximate 97 percent working interest in the Forties field (Forties). Since acquiring Forties, Apache has actively invested in the region and has established a large inventory of drilling prospects through successful exploration programs and the interpretation of acquired 3-D and 4-D seismic data. Building upon its success in Forties, in 2011 Apache acquired Mobil North Sea Limited, providing the region with additional exploration and development opportunities across numerous fields, including operated interests in the Beryl, Nevis, Nevis South, Skene, and Buckland fields and non-operated interests in the Maclure and Nelson field. The Beryl field, which is a geologically complex area with multiple fields and stacked pay potential, provides for significant exploration opportunity. The North Sea region plays a strategic role in Apache’s portfolio by providing competitive investment opportunities and potential reserve upside with high-impact exploration potential.

During the year, the region drilled 12 development wells with an 83 percent success rate: six at Forties, five at Beryl, and one at Aviat. In addition, it drilled or participated in three exploration wells with a 33 percent success rate. The Storr discovery, an exploration prospect targeting the Beryl and Nansen sands, encountered hydrocarbons in two separate fault blocks. The region is evaluating a development plan for the Storr discovery. Apache holds a 55 percent working interest in the prospect.

Apache progressed the development of the 2015 Callater (formerly K) exploration discovery in the Beryl area, with first production projected in the second half of 2017. Initial production is expected at 20,000 boe/d on a gross basis. Apache plans to drill two additional wells in the second half of the year. Apache holds a 55 percent working interest in Callater, and operates the field. The region also continued to assess development plans for two earlier exploration discoveries, Seagull and Corona, in which Apache holds 35 and 100 percent interests, respectively.

Also during the year, Apache completed the Aviat gas-for-power project at Forties. This project enables a switch from diesel to natural gas to power the Forties field. The use of natural gas to power the field will extend the economic life, lower operating costs, and reduce certain reliability and safety risks associated with bunkering diesel. Annual fuel and other savings are projected at $15 million.

In 2017, Apache currently plans to operate an average of three rigs in the North Sea region, two platform rigs (one at Forties and one at Beryl) and two semi-submersible rigs on rig-sharing agreements, and drill 15 to 16 wells.

North Sea Marketing

Apache has traditionally sold its North Sea crude oil under term contracts, with a market-based index price plus a premium, which reflects the higher market value for term arrangements.

Natural gas from the Beryl field is processed through the SAGE gas plant operated by Apache. The gas is sold to a third party at the St. Fergus entry point of the national grid on a National Balancing Point index price basis. The condensate mix from the SAGE plant is processed further downstream. The split streams of propane and butane are sold on a monthly entitlement basis, and condensate is sold on a spot basis at the Braefoot Bay terminal using index pricing less transportation.

Australia/Argentina

During the second quarter of 2015, Apache completed the sale of its Australian LNG business and oil and gas assets. In March 2014, Apache completed the sale of all of its operations in Argentina. Results of operations and consolidated cash flows for the divested Australia assets and Argentina operations are reflected as discontinued operations in the Company’s financial statements for all periods presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Other Exploration

New Ventures

Apache’s global New Ventures team provides exposure to new growth opportunities by looking outside of the Company’s traditional core areas and targeting higher-risk, higher-reward exploration opportunities located in frontier basins as well as new plays in more mature basins. Plans for 2017 include continued analysis and review of the Company’s deepwater prospects in offshore Suriname, including fully processing the data set from its 3-D seismic shoot completed in the third quarter of 2016.

Drilling Statistics

Worldwide in


, Apache participated in drilling 260 gross wells, with 240 (92 percent) completed as producers. Historically, Apache’s drilling activities in the U.S. have generally concentrated on exploitation and extension of existing producing fields rather than exploration. As a general matter, Apache’s operations outside of North America focus on a mix of exploration and development wells. In addition to Apache’s completed wells, at year-end a number of wells had not yet reached completion: 70 gross (33.7 net) in the U.S., 14 gross (14 net) in Egypt, and 5 gross (3.1 net) in the North Sea.

The following table shows the results of the oil and gas wells drilled and completed for each of the last three fiscal years:

Productive Oil and Gas Wells

The number of productive oil and gas wells, operated and non-operated, in which the Company had an interest as of

December 31, 2016

, is set forth below:

Gross natural gas and crude oil wells include 640 wells with multiple completions.


Production, Pricing, and Lease Operating Cost Data

The following table describes, for each of the last three fiscal years, oil, NGL, and gas production volumes, average lease operating costs per boe (including transportation costs but excluding severance and other taxes), and average sales prices for each of the countries where the Company has operations:

(1)

Includes production volumes attributable to a one-third noncontrolling interest in Egypt.

(2)

Average sales volumes from the North Sea for 2016 were

24.5

MMboe. Sales volumes may vary from production volumes as a result of the timing of liftings in the Beryl field.

Gross and Net Undeveloped and Developed Acreage

The following table sets out Apache’s gross and net acreage position as of

December 31, 2016

, in each country where the Company has operations:

As of

December 31, 2016

, Apache had 1.2 million net undeveloped acres scheduled to expire by year-end 2017 if production is not established or Apache takes no other action to extend the terms. Additionally, Apache has 668,000 and 854,000 net undeveloped acres set to expire in 2018 and 2019, respectively. The Company strives to extend the terms of many of these licenses and concession areas through operational or administrative actions, but cannot assure that such extensions can be achieved on an economic basis or otherwise on terms agreeable to both the Company and third parties, including governments.


Exploration concessions in Apache’s Egypt region comprise a significant portion of Apache’s net undeveloped acreage expiring over the next three years. Apache has 0.7 million, 0.4 million, and 0.6 million net undeveloped acres set to expire in 2017, 2018, and 2019, respectively. Apache will continue to pursue acreage extensions in areas in which it believes exploration opportunities exist. There were no reserves recorded on this undeveloped acreage. Separately, Apache was awarded the NW Razzak and South Alam El Shawish concession blocks in December 2016. The agreements are currently progressing and formal approval and signing of the agreements by Apache, EGPC, and the Ministry of Petroleum is expected to occur by the summer of 2017. Combined, the two concessions are expected to add approximately 1.6 million of undeveloped gross acres in Egypt in 2017.

As of

December 31, 2016

, 34 percent of U.S. net undeveloped acreage and 44 percent of Canadian net undeveloped acreage was held by production.

In addition, Apache has exploration interests in Suriname consisting of 1.8 million net undeveloped acreage in two blocks set to expire in 2017 and 2018. Apache will commence drilling operations on a commitment well in 2017, and will determine a course of action based on the results of drilling tests. No reserves have been booked on this undeveloped acreage.

Estimated Proved Reserves and Future Net Cash Flows

Proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of natural gas, crude oil, condensate, and NGLs, which by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations. Estimated proved developed oil and gas reserves can be expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods. The Company reports all estimated proved reserves held under production-sharing arrangements utilizing the “economic interest” method, which excludes the host country’s share of reserves.

Estimated reserves that can be produced economically through application of improved recovery techniques are included in the “proved” classification when successful testing by a pilot project or the operation of an active, improved recovery program using reliable technology establishes the reasonable certainty for the engineering analysis on which the project or program is based. Economically producible means a resource that generates revenue that exceeds, or is reasonably expected to exceed, the costs of the operation. Reasonable certainty means a high degree of confidence that the quantities will be recovered. Reliable technology is a grouping of one or more technologies (including computational methods) that has been field-tested and has been demonstrated to provide reasonably certain results with consistency and repeatability in the formation being evaluated or in an analogous formation. In estimating its proved reserves, Apache uses several different traditional methods that can be classified in three general categories: (1) performance-based methods; (2) volumetric-based methods; and (3) analogy with similar properties. Apache will, at times, utilize additional technical analysis, such as computer reservoir models, petrophysical techniques, and proprietary 3-D seismic interpretation methods, to provide additional support for more complex reservoirs. Information from this additional analysis is combined with traditional methods outlined above to enhance the certainty of our reserve estimates.

Proved undeveloped reserves include those reserves that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion. Undeveloped reserves may be classified as proved reserves on undrilled acreage directly offsetting development areas that are reasonably certain of production when drilled, or where reliable technology provides reasonable certainty of economic producibility. Undrilled locations may be classified as having undeveloped reserves only if a development plan has been adopted indicating that they are scheduled to be drilled within five years, unless specific circumstances justify a longer time period.

This table shows reserves on a boe basis in which natural gas is converted to an equivalent barrel of oil based on a ratio of 6 Mcf to 1 bbl. This ratio is not reflective of the current price ratio between the two products.

(1)

Includes total proved reserves of 93 MMboe attributable to a one-third noncontrolling interest in Egypt

As of

December 31, 2016

, Apache had total estimated proved reserves of


MMbbls of crude oil,


MMbbls of NGLs, and

2.9

Tcf of natural gas. Combined, these total estimated proved reserves are the volume equivalent of

1.3 billion

barrels of oil or 7.9 Tcf of natural gas, of which oil represents 49 percent. As of

December 31, 2016

, the Company’s proved developed reserves totaled

1,174

MMboe and estimated PUD reserves totaled


MMboe, or approximately 10.5 percent of worldwide total proved reserves. Apache has elected not to disclose probable or possible reserves in this filing.

During


, Apache added 103 MMboe of proved reserves through exploration and development activity and 2 MMboe through purchases of minerals in-place. Apache sold a combined 7 MMboe through several divestiture transactions. During


, Apache also had combined downward revisions of previously estimated reserves of


MMboe. Changes in product prices accounted for


MMboe, lease ownership changes accounted for


MMboe, offset by engineering and performance upward revisions totaling


MMboe.

The Company’s estimates of proved reserves, proved developed reserves, and PUD reserves as of

December 31, 2016

,


, and


, changes in estimated proved reserves during the last three years, and estimates of future net cash flows from proved reserves are contained in Note 16—Supplemental Oil and Gas Disclosures in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part IV, Item 15 of this Form 10-K. Estimated future net cash flows were calculated using a discount rate of 10 percent per annum, end of period costs, and an unweighted arithmetic average of commodity prices in effect on the first day of each of the previous 12 months, held flat for the life of the production, except where prices are defined by contractual arrangements.

Proved Undeveloped Reserves

The Company’s total estimated PUD reserves of


MMboe as of

December 31, 2016

, decreased by 95 MMboe from 232 MMboe of PUD reserves reported at the end of


. During the year, Apache converted 22 MMboe of PUD reserves to proved developed reserves through development drilling activity. In North America, Apache converted 15 MMboe, with the remaining 7 MMboe in Apache’s international areas. Apache sold 3 MMboe and acquired no PUD reserves during the year. Apache added 48 MMboe of new PUD reserves through extensions and discoveries. Apache recognized a 118 MMboe downward revision in proved undeveloped reserves during the year, of which 99 MMboe was associated with lower product prices, 5 MMboe was associated with interest revisions, and 14 MMboe was a result of changes in development plans.


During the year, a total of approximately $357 million was spent on projects associated with reserves that were carried as PUD reserves at the end of 2015. A portion of Apache’s costs incurred each year relate to development projects that will be converted to proved developed reserves in future years. Apache spent approximately $289 million on PUD reserve development activity in North America and $68 million in the international areas. As of

December 31, 2016

, Apache had no material amounts of proved undeveloped reserves scheduled to be developed beyond five years from initial disclosure.

Preparation of Oil and Gas Reserve Information

Apache’s reported reserves are reasonably certain estimates which, by their very nature, are subject to revision. These estimates are reviewed throughout the year and revised either upward or downward, as warranted.

Apache’s proved reserves are estimated at the property level and compiled for reporting purposes by a centralized group of experienced reservoir engineers that is independent of the operating groups. These engineers interact with engineering and geoscience personnel in each of Apache’s operating areas and with accounting and marketing employees to obtain the necessary data for projecting future production, costs, net revenues, and ultimate recoverable reserves. All relevant data is compiled in a computer database application, to which only authorized personnel are given security access rights consistent with their assigned job function. Reserves are reviewed internally with senior management and presented to Apache’s Board of Directors in summary form on a quarterly basis. Annually, each property is reviewed in detail by our corporate and operating region engineers to ensure forecasts of operating expenses, netback prices, production trends, and development timing are reasonable.

Apache’s Executive Vice President of Corporate Reservoir Engineering is the person primarily responsible for overseeing the preparation of our internal reserve estimates and for coordinating any reserves audits conducted by a third-party engineering firm. He has a Bachelor of Science degree in Petroleum Engineering and over 36 years of industry experience with positions of increasing responsibility within Apache’s corporate reservoir engineering department. The Executive Vice President of Corporate Reservoir Engineering reports directly to our Chief Executive Officer.

The estimate of reserves disclosed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K is prepared by the Company’s internal staff, and the Company is responsible for the adequacy and accuracy of those estimates. However, the Company engages Ryder Scott Company, L.P. Petroleum Consultants (Ryder Scott) to review our processes and the reasonableness of our estimates of proved hydrocarbon liquid and gas reserves. The Company selects the properties for review by Ryder Scott based primarily on relative reserve value. The Company also considers other factors such as geographic location, new wells drilled during the year and reserves volume. During


, the properties selected for each country ranged from 87 to 100 percent of the total future net cash flows discounted at 10 percent. These properties also accounted for over 88 percent of the reserves value of our international proved reserves and 93 percent of the new wells drilled in each country. In addition, all fields containing five percent or more of the Company’s total proved reserves volume were included in Ryder Scott’s review. The review covered 83 percent of total proved reserves by volume.

During


,


, and


, Ryder Scott’s review covered 92, 90, and 91 percent, respectively, of the Company’s worldwide estimated proved reserves value and 83, 83, and 85 percent, respectively, of the Company’s total proved reserves volume. Ryder Scott’s review of


covered 81 percent of U.S., 81 percent of Canada, 85 percent of Egypt, and 92 percent of the U.K.’s total proved reserves.

Ryder Scott’s review of


covered 81 percent of U.S., 81 percent of Canada, 86 percent of Egypt, and 88 percent of the U.K.’s total proved reserves.

Ryder Scott’s review of


covered 83 percent of U.S., 75 percent of Canada, 99.5 percent of Australia, 86 percent of Egypt, and 94 percent of the U.K.’s total proved reserves.

The Company has filed Ryder Scott’s independent report as an exhibit to this Form 10-K.

According to Ryder Scott’s opinion, based on their review, including the data, technical processes, and interpretations presented by Apache, the overall procedures and methodologies utilized by Apache in determining the proved reserves comply with the current SEC regulations, and the overall proved reserves for the reviewed properties as estimated by Apache are, in aggregate, reasonable within the established audit tolerance guidelines as set forth in the Society of Petroleum Engineers auditing standards.

Title to Interests

As is customary in our industry, a preliminary review of title records, which may include opinions or reports of appropriate professionals or counsel, is made at the time we acquire properties. We believe that our title to all of the various interests set forth above is satisfactory and consistent with the standards generally accepted in the oil and gas industry, subject only to immaterial exceptions that do not detract substantially from the value of the interests or materially interfere with their use in our operations. The interests owned by us may be subject to one or more royalty, overriding royalty, or other outstanding interests (including disputes related to such interests) customary in the industry. The interests may additionally be subject to obligations or duties under applicable laws, ordinances, rules, regulations, and orders of arbitral or governmental authorities. In addition, the interests may be subject to burdens such as production payments, net profits interests, liens incident to operating agreements and current taxes, development obligations under oil and gas leases, and other encumbrances, easements, and restrictions, none of which detract substantially from the value of the interests or materially interfere with their use in our operations.

Additional Information about Apache

In this section, references to “we,” “us,” “our,” and “Apache” include Apache Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries, unless otherwise specifically stated.

Response Plans and Available Resources

Apache and its wholly owned subsidiary, Apache Deepwater LLC (ADW), developed Oil Spill Response Plans (the Plans) for their respective Gulf of Mexico operations and offshore operations in the North Sea and Suriname. These plans ensure rapid and effective responses to spill events that may occur on such entities’ operated properties. Annually, drills are conducted to measure and maintain the effectiveness of the Plans.

Apache is a member of Oil Spill Response Limited (OSRL), a large international oil spill response cooperative, which entitles any Apache entity worldwide to access OSRL’s services. Apache also has a contract in place for response resources and services with Polyeco Group, a large, privately owned, tier three Oil Spill Response Organization (OSRO), which has resources strategically staged at six bases worldwide.

In the event of a spill in the Gulf of Mexico, Clean Gulf Associates (CGA) is the primary oil spill response association available to Apache and ADW. Both Apache and ADW are members of CGA, a not-for-profit association of producing and pipeline companies operating in the Gulf of Mexico. CGA was created to provide a means of effectively staging response equipment and providing immediate spill response for its member companies’ operations in the Gulf of Mexico. In the event of a spill, CGA’s equipment, which is positioned at various staging points around the Gulf, is ready to be mobilized. In addition, ADW is a member of Marine Spill Response Corporation (MSRC), and their equipment and resources are also available to ADW for its deepwater Gulf of Mexico and new venture operations.

An Apache subsidiary is also a member of the Marine Well Containment Company (MWCC) to help the Company fulfill the government’s permit requirements for containment and oil spill response plans in deepwater Gulf of Mexico operations. MWCC is a not-for-profit, stand-alone organization whose goal is to improve capabilities for containing an underwater well control incident in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. Members and their affiliates have access to MWCC’s extensive containment network and systems. As of

December 31, 2016

, Apache’s investment in MWCC totals $163 million and is reflected in “Deferred charges and other” in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet.


Competitive Conditions

The oil and gas business is highly competitive in the exploration for and acquisitions of reserves, the acquisition of oil and gas leases, equipment and personnel required to find and produce reserves, and the gathering and marketing of oil, gas, and natural gas liquids. Our competitors include national oil companies, major integrated oil and gas companies, other independent oil and gas companies, and participants in other industries supplying energy and fuel to industrial, commercial, and individual consumers.

Certain of our competitors may possess financial or other resources substantially larger than we possess or have established strategic long-term positions and maintain strong governmental relationships in countries in which we may seek new entry. As a consequence, we may be at a competitive disadvantage in bidding for leases or drilling rights.

However, we believe our diversified portfolio of core assets, which comprises large acreage positions and well-established production bases across four geographic areas, our balanced production mix between oil and gas, our management and incentive systems, and our experienced personnel give us a strong competitive position relative to many of our competitors who do not possess similar geographic and production diversity. Our global position provides a large inventory of geologic and geographic opportunities in the four geographic areas in which we have producing operations to which we can reallocate capital investments in response to changes in commodity prices, local business environments, and markets. It also reduces the risk that we will be materially impacted by an event in a specific area or country.

Environmental Compliance

As an owner or lessee and operator of oil and gas properties and facilities, we are subject to numerous federal, provincial, state, local, and foreign country laws and regulations relating to discharge of materials into, and protection of, the environment. These laws and regulations may, among other things, impose liability on the lessee under an oil and gas lease for the cost of pollution clean-up resulting from operations, subject the lessee to liability for pollution damages and require suspension or cessation of operations in affected areas. Although environmental requirements have a substantial impact upon the energy industry as a whole, we do not believe that these requirements affect us differently, to any material degree, than other companies in our industry.

We have made and will continue to make expenditures in our efforts to comply with these requirements, which we believe are necessary business costs in the oil and gas industry. We have established policies for continuing compliance with environmental laws and regulations, including regulations applicable to our operations in all countries in which we do business. We have established operating procedures and training programs designed to limit the environmental impact of our field facilities and identify and comply with changes in existing laws and regulations. The costs incurred under these policies and procedures are inextricably connected to normal operating expenses such that we are unable to separate expenses related to environmental matters; however, we do not believe expenses related to training and compliance with regulations and laws that have been adopted or enacted to regulate the discharge of materials into the environment will have a material impact on our capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position.


ITEM 1A.

RISK FACTORS

Our business activities and the value of our securities are subject to significant hazards and risks, including those described below. If any of such events should occur, our business, financial condition, liquidity, and/or results of operations could be materially harmed, and holders and purchasers of our securities could lose part or all of their investments. Additional risks relating to our securities may be included in the prospectuses for securities we issue in the future.

Crude oil and natural gas price volatility, including the recent decline in prices for oil and natural gas, could adversely affect our operating results and the price of our common stock.

Our revenues, operating results, and future rate of growth depend highly upon the prices we receive for our crude oil and natural gas production. Historically, the markets for crude oil and natural gas have been volatile and are likely to continue to be volatile in the future. For example, the NYMEX daily settlement price for the prompt month oil contract in 2016 ranged from a high of $54.06 per barrel to a low of $26.21 per barrel. The NYMEX daily settlement price for the prompt month natural gas contract in 2016 ranged from a high of $3.93 per MMBtu to a low of $1.64 per MMBtu. The market prices for crude oil and natural gas depend on factors beyond our control. These factors include demand for crude oil and natural gas, which fluctuates with changes in market and economic conditions, and other factors, including:

•

worldwide and domestic supplies of crude oil and natural gas;

•

actions taken by foreign oil and gas producing nations, including the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC);

•

political conditions and events (including instability, changes in governments, or armed conflict) in crude oil or natural gas producing regions;

•

the level of global crude oil and natural gas inventories;

•

the price and level of imported foreign crude oil and natural gas;

•

the price and availability of alternative fuels, including coal and biofuels;

•

the availability of pipeline capacity and infrastructure;

•

the availability of crude oil transportation and refining capacity;

•

weather conditions;

•

domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes; and

•

the overall economic environment.

Our results of operations, as well as the carrying value of our oil and gas properties, are substantially dependent upon the prices of oil and natural gas, which have declined significantly since June 2014. Despite slight increases in oil and natural gas prices in 2016, prices have remained significantly lower than levels seen in recent years, which has adversely affected our revenues, operating income, cash flow, and proved reserves. Continued low prices could have a material adverse impact on our operations and limit our ability to fund capital expenditures. Without the ability to fund capital expenditures, we would be unable to replace reserves and production. Sustained low prices of crude oil and natural gas may further adversely impact our business as follows:

•

limiting our financial condition, liquidity, and/or ability to fund planned capital expenditures and operations;

•

reducing the amount of crude oil and natural gas that we can produce economically;

•

causing us to delay or postpone some of our capital projects;

•

reducing our revenues, operating income, and cash flows;

•

limiting our access to sources of capital, such as equity and long-term debt;

•

reducing the carrying value of our crude oil and natural gas properties, resulting in additional non-cash impairments;

•

reducing the carrying value of our gathering, transmission, and processing facilities, resulting in additional impairments; or

•

reducing the carrying value of goodwill.


Our ability to sell natural gas or oil and/or receive market prices for our natural gas or oil may be adversely affected by pipeline and gathering system capacity constraints and various transportation interruptions.

A portion of our natural gas and oil production in any region may be interrupted, limited, or shut in, from time to time for numerous reasons, including as a result of weather conditions, accidents, loss of pipeline or gathering system access, field labor issues or strikes, or capital constraints that limit the ability of third parties to construct gathering systems, processing facilities, or interstate pipelines to transport our production, or we might voluntarily curtail production in response to market conditions. If a substantial amount of our production is interrupted at the same time, it could temporarily adversely affect our cash flows.

Future economic conditions in the U.S. and certain international markets may materially adversely impact our operating results.

Current global market conditions, and uncertainty, including economic instability in Europe and certain emerging markets, is likely to have significant long-term effects. Global economic growth drives demand for energy from all sources, including fossil fuels. A lower future economic growth rate could result in decreased demand growth for our crude oil and natural gas production as well as lower commodity prices, which would reduce our cash flows from operations and our profitability.

Weather and climate may have a significant adverse impact on our revenues and production.

Demand for oil and natural gas are, to a degree, dependent on weather and climate, which impact the price we receive for the commodities we produce. In addition, our exploration and development activities and equipment can be adversely affected by severe weather, such as freezing temperatures, hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico or storms in the North Sea, which may cause a loss of production from temporary cessation of activity or lost or damaged equipment. Our planning for normal climatic variation, insurance programs, and emergency recovery plans may inadequately mitigate the effects of such weather conditions, and not all such effects can be predicted, eliminated, or insured against.

Our operations involve a high degree of operational risk, particularly risk of personal injury, damage, or loss of equipment, and environmental accidents.

Our operations are subject to hazards and risks inherent in the drilling, production, and transportation of crude oil and natural gas, including:

•

well blowouts, explosions, and cratering;

•

pipeline or other facility ruptures and spills;

•

fires;

•

formations with abnormal pressures;

•

equipment malfunctions;

•

hurricanes, storms, and/or cyclones, which could affect our operations in areas such as on and offshore the Gulf Coast and North Sea and other natural disasters and weather conditions; and

•

surface spillage and surface or ground water contamination from petroleum constituents, saltwater, or hydraulic fracturing chemical additives.

Failure or loss of equipment as the result of equipment malfunctions, cyber attacks, or natural disasters such as hurricanes, could result in property damages, personal injury, environmental pollution and other damages for which we could be liable. Litigation arising from a catastrophic occurrence, such as a well blowout, explosion, or fire at a location where our equipment and services are used, or ground water contamination from hydraulic fracturing chemical additives may result in substantial claims for damages. Ineffective containment of a drilling well blowout or pipeline rupture, or surface spillage and surface or ground water contamination from petroleum constituents or hydraulic fracturing chemical additives could result in extensive environmental pollution and substantial remediation expenses. If a significant amount of our production is interrupted, our containment efforts prove to be ineffective or litigation arises as the result of a catastrophic occurrence, our cash flows, and, in turn, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.


Cyber attacks targeting systems and infrastructure used by the oil and gas industry may adversely impact our operations.

Our business has become increasingly dependent on digital technologies to conduct certain exploration, development, and production activities. We depend on digital technology to estimate quantities of oil and gas reserves, process and record financial and operating data, analyze seismic and drilling information, communicate with our employees and third party partners, and conduct many of our activities. Unauthorized access to our digital technology could lead to operational disruption, data corruption or exposure, communication interruption, loss of intellectual property, loss of confidential and fiduciary data, and loss or corruption of reserves or other proprietary information. Also, external digital technologies control nearly all of the oil and gas distribution and refining systems in the United States and abroad, which are necessary to transport and market our production. A cyber attack directed at oil and gas distribution systems could damage critical distribution and storage assets or the environment, delay or prevent delivery of production to markets, and make it difficult or impossible to accurately account for production and settle transactions.

While we have experienced cyber attacks, we have not suffered any material losses relating to such attacks; however, there is no assurance that we will not suffer such losses in the future. Further, as cyber attacks continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any vulnerabilities to cyber attacks.

Our commodity price risk management and trading activities may prevent us from benefiting fully from price increases and may expose us to other risks.

To the extent that we engage in price risk management activities to protect ourselves from commodity price declines, we may be prevented from realizing the benefits of price increases above the levels of the derivative instruments used to manage price risk. In addition, our hedging arrangements may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances, including instances in which:

•

our production falls short of the hedged volumes;

•

there is a widening of price-basis differentials between delivery points for our production and the delivery point assumed in the hedge arrangement;

•

the counterparties to our hedging or other price risk management contracts fail to perform under those arrangements; or

•

an unexpected event materially impacts oil and natural gas prices.

The credit risk of financial institutions could adversely affect us.

We have exposure to different counterparties, and we have entered into transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including commercial banks, investment banks, insurance companies, other investment funds, and other institutions. These transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty. Deterioration in the credit or financial markets may impact the credit ratings of our current and potential counterparties and affect their ability to fulfill their existing obligations to us and their willingness to enter into future transactions with us. We may also have exposure to financial institutions in the form of derivative transactions in connection with any hedges. We also have exposure to insurance companies in the form of claims under our policies. In addition, if any lender under our credit facilities is unable to fund its commitment, our liquidity will be reduced by an amount up to the aggregate amount of such lender’s commitment under our credit facilities.

We are exposed to a risk of financial loss if a counterparty fails to perform under a derivative contract. This risk of counterparty non-performance is of particular concern given the recent volatility of the financial markets and significant decline in oil and natural gas prices, which could lead to sudden changes in a counterparty’s liquidity and impair its ability to perform under the terms of the derivative contract. We are unable to predict sudden changes in a counterparty’s creditworthiness or ability to perform. Even if we do accurately predict sudden changes, our ability to negate the risk may be limited depending upon market conditions. Furthermore, the bankruptcy of one or more of our hedge providers, or some other similar proceeding or liquidity constraint, might make it unlikely that we would be able to collect all or a significant portion of amounts owed to us by the distressed entity or entities. During periods of falling commodity prices our hedge receivable positions increase, which increases our exposure. If the creditworthiness of our counterparties deteriorates and results in their nonperformance, we could incur a significant loss.


The distressed financial conditions of our purchasers and partners could have an adverse impact on us in the event they are unable to pay us for the products or services we provide or to reimburse us for their share of costs.

Concerns about global economic conditions and the volatility of oil and natural gas prices have had a significant adverse impact on the oil and gas industry. We are exposed to risk of financial loss from trade, joint venture, joint interest billing, and other receivables. We sell our crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs to a variety of purchasers. As operator, we pay expenses and bill our non-operating partners for their respective shares of costs. As a result of current economic conditions and the severe decline in oil and natural gas prices, some of our customers and non-operating partners may experience severe financial problems that may have a significant impact on their creditworthiness. We cannot provide assurance that one or more of our financially distressed customers or non-operating partners will not default on their obligations to us or that such a default or defaults will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, future results of operations, or future cash flows. Furthermore, the bankruptcy of one or more of our customers or non-operating partners, or some other similar proceeding or liquidity constraint, might make it unlikely that we would be able to collect all or a significant portion of amounts owed by the distressed entity or entities. Nonperformance by a trade creditor or non-operating partner could result in significant financial losses.

A downgrade in our credit rating could negatively impact our cost of and ability to access capital.

We receive debt ratings from the major credit rating agencies in the United States. Factors that may impact our credit ratings include debt levels, planned asset purchases or sales, and near-term and long-term production growth opportunities. Liquidity, asset quality, cost structure, product mix, and commodity pricing levels and others are also considered by the rating agencies. A ratings downgrade could adversely impact our ability to access debt markets in the future, increase the cost of future debt, and potentially require us to post letters of credit or other forms of collateral for certain obligations. On February 2, 2016, our credit rating was downgraded by Standard and Poor’s to BBB/Stable, and on February 25, 2016, our credit rating was downgraded by Moody’s to Baa3/negative outlook, in each case as part of an industry-wide review and downgrade of U.S. exploration and production and oilfield services companies due to deteriorating commodity prices. Subsequently, on November 11, 2016, Moody’s changed our rating outlook to stable and affirmed our Baa3 rating. Any future downgrades could result in additional postings ranging from approximately $400 million to $1.0 billion, depending upon timing and availability of tax relief.

Market conditions may restrict our ability to obtain funds for future development and working capital needs, which may limit our financial flexibility.

The financial markets are subject to fluctuation and are vulnerable to unpredictable shocks. We have a significant development project inventory and an extensive exploration portfolio, which will require substantial future investment. We and/or our partners may need to seek financing in order to fund these or other future activities. Our future access to capital, as well as that of our partners and contractors, could be limited if the debt or equity markets are constrained. This could significantly delay development of our property interests.

Our ability to declare and pay dividends is subject to limitations.

The payment of future dividends on our capital stock is subject to the discretion of our board of directors, which considers, among other factors, our operating results, overall financial condition, credit-risk considerations, and capital requirements, as well as general business and market conditions. Our board of directors is not required to declare dividends on our common stock and may decide not to declare dividends.

Any indentures and other financing agreements that we enter into in the future may limit our ability to pay cash dividends on our capital stock, including common stock. In addition, under Delaware law, dividends on capital stock may only be paid from “surplus,” which is the amount by which the fair value of our total assets exceeds the sum of our total liabilities, including contingent liabilities, and the amount of our capital; if there is no surplus, cash dividends on capital stock may only be paid from our net profits for the then current and/or the preceding fiscal year. Further, even if we are permitted under our contractual obligations and Delaware law to pay cash dividends on common stock, we may not have sufficient cash to pay dividends in cash on our common stock.


Discoveries or acquisitions of additional reserves are needed to avoid a material decline in reserves and production.

The production rate from oil and gas properties generally declines as reserves are depleted, while related per-unit production costs generally increase as a result of decreasing reservoir pressures and other factors. Therefore, unless we add reserves through exploration and development activities or, through engineering studies, identify additional behind-pipe zones, secondary recovery reserves, or tertiary recovery reserves, or acquire additional properties containing proved reserves, our estimated proved reserves will decline materially as reserves are produced. Future oil and gas production is, therefore, highly dependent upon our level of success in acquiring or finding additional reserves on an economic basis. Furthermore, if oil or gas prices increase, our cost for additional reserves could also increase.

We may not realize an adequate return on wells that we drill.

Drilling for oil and gas involves numerous risks, including the risk that we will not encounter commercially productive oil or gas reservoirs. The wells we drill or participate in may not be productive, and we may not recover all or any portion of our investment in those wells. The seismic data and other technologies we use do not allow us to know conclusively prior to drilling a well that crude or natural gas is present or may be produced economically. The costs of drilling, completing, and operating wells are often uncertain, and drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed, or canceled as a result of a variety of factors including, but not limited to:

•

unexpected drilling conditions;

•

pressure or irregularities in formations;

•

equipment failures or accidents;

•

fires, explosions, blowouts, and surface cratering;

•

marine risks such as capsizing, collisions, and hurricanes;

•

other adverse weather conditions; and

•

increases in the cost of, or shortages or delays in the availability of, drilling rigs and equipment.

Future drilling activities may not be successful, and, if unsuccessful, this failure could have an adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial condition. While all drilling, whether developmental or exploratory, involves these risks, exploratory drilling involves greater risks of dry holes or failure to find commercial quantities of hydrocarbons.

Material differences between the estimated and actual timing of critical events or costs may affect the completion and commencement of production from development projects.

We are involved in several large development projects and the completion of these projects may be delayed beyond our anticipated completion dates. Our projects may be delayed by project approvals from joint venture partners, timely issuances of permits and licenses by governmental agencies, weather conditions, manufacturing and delivery schedules of critical equipment, and other unforeseen events. Delays and differences between estimated and actual timing of critical events may adversely affect our large development projects and our ability to participate in large-scale development projects in the future. In addition, our estimates of future development costs are based on current expectation of prices and other costs of equipment and personnel we will need to implement such projects. Our actual future development costs may be significantly higher than we currently estimate. If costs become too high, our development projects may become uneconomic to us, and we may be forced to abandon such development projects.


We may fail to fully identify potential problems related to acquired reserves or to properly estimate those reserves.

Although we perform a review of properties that we acquire that we believe is consistent with industry practices, such reviews are inherently incomplete. It generally is not feasible to review in-depth every individual property involved in each acquisition. Ordinarily, we will focus our review efforts on the higher-value properties and will sample the remainder. However, even a detailed review of records and properties may not necessarily reveal existing or potential problems, nor will it permit us as a buyer to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to assess fully and accurately their deficiencies and potential. Inspections may not always be performed on every well, and environmental problems, such as groundwater contamination, are not necessarily observable even when an inspection is undertaken. Even when problems are identified, we often assume certain environmental and other risks and liabilities in connection with acquired properties. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved oil and gas reserves and future production rates and costs with respect to acquired properties, and actual results may vary substantially from those assumed in the estimates. In addition, there can be no assurance that acquisitions will not have an adverse effect upon our operating results, particularly during the periods in which the operations of acquired businesses are being integrated into our ongoing operations.

Our liabilities could be adversely affected in the event one or more of our transaction counterparties become the subject of a bankruptcy case.

Over the last several years, we have taken action to enhance and streamline our North American portfolio through not only the acquisition of assets in key operating regions but also the divestitures of noncore domestic assets and the monetization of certain nonstrategic international assets. The agreements relating to these transactions contain provisions pursuant to which liabilities related to past and future operations have been allocated between the parties by means of liability assumptions, indemnities, escrows, trusts, and similar arrangements. One or more of the counterparties in these transactions could, either as a result of the severe decline in oil and natural gas prices or other factors related to the historical or future operations of their respective businesses, face financial problems that may have a significant impact on its ability to perform its obligations under these agreements and its solvency and ability to continue as a going concern. In the event that any such counterparty were to become unable financially to perform its liabilities or obligations assumed and as a result become the subject of a case or proceeding under Title 11 of the United States Code (the bankruptcy code) or any other relevant insolvency law or similar law (which we collectively refer to as Insolvency Laws) the counterparty may not perform its obligations under the agreements related to these transactions. In that case, our remedy would be a claim in the proceeding for damages for the breach of the contractual arrangement, which may be either a secured claim or an unsecured claim depending on whether or not we have collateral from the counterparty for the performance of the obligations. Resolution of our damage claim in such a proceeding may be delayed, and we may be forced to use available cash to cover the costs of the obligations assumed by the counterparties under such agreements should they arise.

Despite the provisions in our agreements requiring purchasers of our state or federal leasehold interests to assume certain liabilities and obligations related to such interests, if a purchaser of such interests becomes the subject of a case or proceeding under relevant Insolvency Laws and/or becomes unable financially to perform such liabilities or obligations, the relevant governmental authorities could require us to perform, and hold us responsible for, such liabilities and obligations, such as the decommissioning of such transferred assets. In such event, we may be forced to use available cash to cover the costs of such liabilities and obligations should they arise.

If a court or a governmental authority were to make any of the foregoing determinations or take any of the foregoing actions, or any similar determination or action, it could adversely impact our cash flows, operations, or financial condition.

Crude oil and natural gas reserves are estimates, and actual recoveries may vary significantly.

There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating crude oil and natural gas reserves and their value. Reservoir engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of crude oil and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner. Because of the high degree of judgment involved, the accuracy of any reserve estimate is inherently imprecise, and a function of the quality of available data and the engineering and geological interpretation. Our reserves estimates are based on 12-month average prices, except where contractual arrangements exist; therefore, reserves quantities will change when actual prices increase or decrease. In addition, results of drilling, testing, and production may substantially change the reserve estimates for a given reservoir over time. The estimates of our proved reserves and estimated future net revenues also depend on a number of factors and assumptions that may vary considerably from actual results, including:

•

historical production from the area compared with production from other areas;

•

the effects of regulations by governmental agencies, including changes to severance and excise taxes;

•

future operating costs and capital expenditures; and

•

workover and remediation costs.


For these reasons, estimates of the economically recoverable quantities of crude oil and natural gas attributable to any particular group of properties, classifications of those reserves and estimates of the future net cash flows expected from them prepared by different engineers or by the same engineers but at different times may vary substantially. Accordingly, reserves estimates may be subject to upward or downward adjustment, and actual production, revenue and expenditures with respect to our reserves likely will vary, possibly materially, from estimates.

Additionally, because some of our reserves estimates are calculated using volumetric analysis, those estimates are less reliable than the estimates based on a lengthy production history. Volumetric analysis involves estimating the volume of a reservoir based on the net feet of pay of the structure and an estimation of the area covered by the structure. In addition, realization or recognition of proved undeveloped reserves will depend on our development schedule and plans. A change in future development plans for proved undeveloped reserves could cause the discontinuation of the classification of these reserves as proved.

Certain of our undeveloped leasehold acreage is subject to leases that will expire over the next several years unless production is established on units containing the acreage.

A sizeable portion of our acreage is currently undeveloped. Unless production in paying quantities is established on units containing certain of these leases during their terms, the leases will expire. If our leases expire, we will lose our right to develop the related properties. Our drilling plans for these areas are subject to change based upon various factors, including drilling results, oil and natural gas prices, the availability and cost of capital, drilling, and production costs, availability of drilling services and equipment, gathering system and pipeline transportation constraints, and regulatory approvals.

We may incur significant costs related to environmental matters.

As an owner or lessee and operator of oil and gas properties, we are subject to various federal, provincial, state, local, and foreign country laws and regulations relating to discharge of materials into, and protection of, the environment. These laws and regulations may, among other things, impose liability on the lessee under an oil and gas lease for the cost of pollution clean-up and other remediation activities resulting from operations, subject the lessee to liability for pollution and other damages, limit or constrain operations in affected areas, and require suspension or cessation of operations in affected areas. Our efforts to limit our exposure to such liability and cost may prove inadequate and result in significant adverse effects to our results of operations. In addition, it is possible that the increasingly strict requirements imposed by environmental laws and enforcement policies could require us to make significant capital expenditures. Such capital expenditures could adversely impact our cash flows and our financial condition.

Our North American operations are subject to governmental risks.

Our North American operations have been, and at times in the future may be, affected by political developments and by federal, state, provincial, and local laws and regulations such as restrictions on production, changes in taxes, royalties and other amounts payable to governments or governmental agencies, price or gathering rate controls, and environmental protection laws and regulations.

In response to the Deepwater Horizon incident in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico in April 2010, and as directed by the Secretary of the U.S. Department of the Interior, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) and the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) issued new guidelines and regulations regarding safety, environmental matters, drilling equipment, and decommissioning applicable to drilling in the Gulf of Mexico. These regulations imposed additional requirements and caused delays with respect to development and production activities in the Gulf of Mexico.

With respect to oil and gas operations in the Gulf of Mexico, the BOEM has issued a new Notice to Lessees (NTL No. 2016-N01) significantly revising the obligations of companies operating in the Gulf of Mexico to provide supplemental assurances of performance with respect to plugging, abandonment, and decommissioning obligations associated with wells, platforms, structures, and facilities located upon or used in connection with such companies’ oil and gas leases. While requirements under the new NTL have not yet been fully implemented by BOEM, the new NTL may require that Apache provide additional security to BOEM with respect to plugging, abandonment, and decommissioning obligations relating to Apache’s current ownership interests in various Gulf of Mexico leases. We are working closely with BOEM to make arrangements for the provision of such additional required security, if such security becomes necessary under the new NTL. Additionally, we are not able to predict the effect that these changes might have on counterparties to which Apache has sold Gulf of Mexico assets or with whom Apache has joint ownership. Such changes could cause the bonding obligations of such parties to increase substantially, thereby causing a significant impact on the counterparties’ solvency and ability to continue as a going concern.


New political developments, laws, and the enactment of new or stricter regulations in the Gulf of Mexico or otherwise impacting our North American operations, and increased liability for companies operating in this sector may adversely impact our results of operations.

Changes to existing regulations related to emissions and the impact of any changes in climate could adversely impact our business.

Certain countries where we operate, including Canada and the United Kingdom, either tax or assess some form of greenhouse gas (GHG) related fees on our operations. Exposure has not been material to date, although a change in existing regulations could adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations.

In the event the predictions for rising temperatures and sea levels suggested by reports of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change do transpire, we do not believe those events by themselves are likely to impact our assets or operations. However, any increase in severe weather could have a material adverse effect on our assets and operations.

The present U.S. federal and state income tax laws affecting oil and natural gas exploration, development, and extraction may be modified by administrative, legislative, or judicial interpretation at any time. Future legislation may result in the elimination of certain U.S. federal income tax deductions currently available with respect to oil and natural gas exploration and development.

The present U.S. federal and state income tax laws affecting oil and natural gas exploration, development, and extraction may be modified by administrative, legislative, or judicial interpretation at any time. Previous legislative proposals, if enacted into law, could make significant changes to such laws, including the elimination of certain key U.S. federal income tax incentives currently available to oil and natural gas exploration and production companies. These changes include, but are not limited to, (i) the repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for oil and natural gas properties, (ii) the elimination of current deductions for intangible drilling and development costs, (iii) the elimination of the deduction for certain U.S. production activities, and (iv) an extension of the amortization period for certain geological and geophysical expenditures. The President and Congress could include some or all of these previously proposed changes in conjunction with lower tax rates as part of fundamental tax reform legislation. The passage or adoption of these changes, or similar changes, could eliminate or postpone certain tax deductions that are currently available with respect to oil and natural gas exploration and development. Further, the President and Congress may propose and implement more general tax reform changes including changes to cost recovery rules, the deductibility of interest expense, the taxation of foreign dividends, and a border adjustability provision that would impact the taxation of oil and gas companies. We are unable to predict whether any of these changes or other proposals will be enacted. Any such changes could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

Proposed federal, state, or local regulation regarding hydraulic fracturing could increase our operating and capital costs.

Several proposals are before the U.S. Congress that, if implemented, would either prohibit or restrict the practice of hydraulic fracturing or subject the process to regulation under the Safe Drinking Water Act. Several states are considering legislation to regulate hydraulic fracturing practices that could impose more stringent permitting, transparency, and well construction requirements on hydraulic-fracturing operations or otherwise seek to ban fracturing activities altogether. Hydraulic fracturing of wells and subsurface water disposal are also under public and governmental scrutiny due to potential environmental and physical impacts, including possible contamination of groundwater and drinking water and possible links to earthquakes. In addition, some municipalities have significantly limited or prohibited drilling activities and/or hydraulic fracturing, or are considering doing so. We routinely use fracturing techniques in the U.S. and other regions to expand the available space for natural gas and oil to migrate toward the wellbore. It is typically done at substantial depths in very tight formations.

Although it is not possible at this time to predict the final outcome of the legislation regarding hydraulic fracturing, any new federal, state, or local restrictions on hydraulic fracturing that may be imposed in areas in which we conduct business could result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions in the U.S.

International operations have uncertain political, economic, and other risks.

Our operations outside North America are based primarily in Egypt and the United Kingdom. On a barrel equivalent basis, approximately

46 percent

of our


production was outside North America, and approximately

31 percent

of our estimated proved oil and gas reserves on

December 31, 2016

, were located outside North America. As a result, a significant portion of our production and resources are subject to the increased political and economic risks and other factors associated with international operations including, but not limited to:

•

general strikes and civil unrest;


•

the risk of war, acts of terrorism, expropriation and resource nationalization, forced renegotiation or modification of existing contracts;

•

import and export regulations;

•

taxation policies, including royalty and tax increases and retroactive tax claims, and investment restrictions;

•

price control;

•

transportation regulations and tariffs;

•

constrained natural gas markets dependent on demand in a single or limited geographical area;

•

exchange controls, currency fluctuations, devaluation, or other activities that limit or disrupt markets and restrict payments or the movement of funds;

•

laws and policies of the United States affecting foreign trade, including trade sanctions;

•

the possibility of being subject to exclusive jurisdiction of foreign courts in connection with legal disputes relating to licenses to operate and concession rights in countries where we currently operate;

•

the possible inability to subject foreign persons, especially foreign oil ministries and national oil companies, to the jurisdiction of courts in the United States; and

•

difficulties in enforcing our rights against a governmental agency because of the doctrine of sovereign immunity and foreign sovereignty over international operations.

Foreign countries have occasionally asserted rights to oil and gas properties through border disputes. If a country claims superior rights to oil and gas leases or concessions granted to us by another country, our interests could decrease in value or be lost. Even our smaller international assets may affect our overall business and results of operations by distracting management’s attention from our more significant assets. Certain regions of the world in which we operate have a history of political and economic instability. This instability could result in new governments or the adoption of new policies that might result in a substantially more hostile attitude toward foreign investments such as ours. In an extreme case, such a change could result in termination of contract rights and expropriation of our assets. This could adversely affect our interests and our future profitability.

The impact that future terrorist attacks or regional hostilities as have occurred in Egypt and Libya may have on the oil and gas industry in general, and on our operations in particular, is not known at this time. Uncertainty surrounding military strikes or a sustained military campaign may affect operations in unpredictable ways, including disruptions of fuel supplies and markets, particularly oil, and the possibility that infrastructure facilities, including pipelines, production facilities, processing plants, and refineries, could be direct targets of, or indirect casualties of, an act of terror or war. We may be required to incur significant costs in the future to safeguard our assets against terrorist activities.

A deterioration of conditions in Egypt or changes in the economic and political environment in Egypt could have an adverse impact on our business.

Deterioration in the political, economic, and social conditions or other relevant policies of the Egyptian government, such as changes in laws or regulations, export restrictions, expropriation of our assets or resource nationalization, and/or forced renegotiation or modification of our existing contracts with EGPC, or threats or acts of terrorism, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Our operations in Egypt, excluding a one-third noncontrolling interest, contributed

24 percent

of our


production and accounted for

15 percent

of our year-end estimated proved reserves and

28 percent

of our estimated discounted future net cash flows.

Our operations are sensitive to currency rate fluctuations.

Our operations are sensitive to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly between the U.S. dollar and the Canadian dollar, and between the U.S. dollar and the British Pound. Our financial statements, presented in U.S. dollars, may be affected by foreign currency fluctuations through both translation risk and transaction risk. Volatility in exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations, particularly through the weakening of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies.


We do not always control decisions made under joint operating agreements and the parties under such agreements may fail to meet their obligations.

We conduct many of our E&P operations through joint operating agreements with other parties under which we may not control decisions, either because we do not have a controlling interest or are not operator under the agreement. There is risk that these parties may at any time have economic, business, or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours, and therefore decisions may be made which are not what we believe is in our best interest. Moreover, parties to these agreements may be unable to meet their economic or other obligations and we may be required to fulfill those obligations alone. In either case, the value of our investment may be adversely affected.

We face strong industry competition that may have a significant negative impact on our results of operations.

Strong competition exists in all sectors of the oil and gas exploration and production industry. We compete with major integrated and other independent oil and gas companies for acquisition of oil and gas leases, properties, and reserves, equipment, and labor required to explore, develop, and operate those properties, and marketing of oil and natural gas production. Crude oil and natural gas prices impact the costs of properties available for acquisition and the number of companies with the financial resources to pursue acquisition opportunities. Many of our competitors have financial and other resources substantially larger than we possess and have established strategic long-term positions and maintain strong governmental relationships in countries in which we may seek new entry. As a consequence, we may be at a competitive disadvantage in bidding for drilling rights. In addition, many of our larger competitors may have a competitive advantage when responding to factors that affect demand for oil and natural gas production, such as fluctuating worldwide commodity prices and levels of production, the cost and availability of alternative fuels, and the application of government regulations. We also compete in attracting and retaining personnel, including geologists, geophysicists, engineers, and other specialists. These competitive pressures may have a significant negative impact on our results of operations.

Our insurance policies do not cover all of the risks we face, which could result in significant financial exposure.

Exploration for and production of crude oil and natural gas can be hazardous, involving natural disasters and other events such as blowouts, cratering, fire and explosion and loss of well control, which can result in damage to or destruction of wells or production facilities, injury to persons, loss of life, or damage to property and the environment. Our international operations are also subject to political risk. The insurance coverage that we maintain against certain losses or liabilities arising from our operations may be inadequate to cover any such resulting liability; moreover, insurance is not available to us against all operational risks.

ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Apache Corporation, a Delaware corporation formed in 1954, is an independent energy company that explores for, develops, and produces natural gas, crude oil, and natural gas liquids. Apache currently has exploration and production interests in four geographic areas: the U.S., Canada, Egypt, and the U.K. (North Sea). Apache also has exploration interests in Suriname that may, over time, result in a reportable discovery and development opportunity.

During the second quarter of 2016, Apache changed its method of accounting for its oil and gas exploration and development activities from the full cost method to the successful efforts method of accounting. Financial information for all periods has been recast to reflect retrospective application of the successful efforts method of accounting. See Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Part IV, Item 15 of this Form 10-K.

During 2015, Apache sold its Australia LNG business and oil and gas assets. During 2014, Apache sold its operations in Argentina. Results of operations and cash flows from operations for Argentina and Australia are reflected as discontinued operations in the Company’s financial statements for all periods presented. Certain historical information has been recast to reflect the results of operations for Argentina and Australia as discontinued operations.

The following discussion should be read together with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part IV, Item 15 of this Form 10-K, and the risk factors and related information set forth in Part I, Item 1A and Part II, Item 7A of this Form 10-K.

Overview of 2016 Results

The Company took decisive action at the start of the significant decline in commodity prices that began in 2014 in order to preserve its financial position, improve its operational capabilities, and to position Apache for a lower-for-longer commodity price environment. The cornerstone of its approach has been capital discipline and cost structure rationalization. We accomplished these objectives through a rigorous and more centralized process for capital allocations, more detailed, long-term planning, and relentless pursuit of cost reductions in our operations and overhead structure. Apache remained focused on its mission to grow the Company for the long-term benefit of its shareholders, allocating a significant portion of its reduced capital spending program to well completion optimization, strategic testing, and strategic acreage acquisitions as opposed to investing its entire capital budget on more near-term production growth.

In September 2016, after more than two years of extensive geological and geophysical work, methodical acreage accumulation, and strategic testing and delineation drilling, Apache announced the discovery of a significant new resource play, “Alpine High.” Apache’s Alpine High acreage lies in the southern portion of the Delaware Basin, primarily in Reeves County, Texas. The Company has established an acreage position of over 320,000 contiguous net acres, which it acquired at an attractive average cost of approximately $1,300 per acre. Since first announcing the Alpine High last September, the Company has made substantial progress further delineating the opportunity. The Company has confirmed an extensive play fairway which spans 55 miles and a 5,000-foot vertical column encompassing five geologic formations, with multiple target zones spanning the hydrocarbon phase window from dry gas to wet gas to oil. We have recently identified an additional landing zone in the Woodford formation, and confirmed production from the Pennsylvanian. Based on these results, Apache now believes the drilling locations at Alpine High will exceed the 2,000 to 3,000 previously announced. During 2017, we expect to average 4 to 6 drilling rigs at Alpine High. A second hydraulic fracturing crew was added at the start of the year to accelerate completions and data collection. Using data collected from strategic testing and delineation drilling, the Company is now beginning to optimize wells drilled in Alpine High using customized targeting, larger fracs, and longer laterals. Combined with multi-well pad drilling, the Company believes these measures contribute to the optimized development of the area to maximize economic value. The field is expected to have low levels of water production which will also have a positive impact on long-term economics. We are currently installing the infrastructure, which will allow gas sales from the field around mid-year 2017.

Daily production of 522 Mboe/d decreased only four percent from 2015, despite investing a significant portion of curtailed capital spending on acreage, delineation wells, and infrastructure at Alpine High rather than drilling development wells with a focus on maintaining production levels in the shorter-term. The Company’s ability to maintain production levels is the result of several successful initiatives during the downturn: reduction of Apache’s cost structure; implementation of a more rigorous and integrated capital allocation and planning process; upgrades to, and expansion of, drilling inventory; and improvements in its capital efficiency, including reduction in service costs. Lease operating expenses were 19 percent lower than 2015 and 33 percent lower than 2014. General and administrative expenses decreased 9 percent over the past two years.


During 2016, Apache reported a $1.4 billion loss attributable to common stock, or $3.71 per diluted common share, compared to a loss of $10.4 billion, or $27.40 per share in 2015. Results for both periods were directly impacted by asset impairments primarily resulting from the significant drop in crude oil prices beginning in late 2014. Apache generated $2.5 billion in cash from continuing operating activities in 2016, a decrease of 4 percent from the prior year, as a result of falling commodity prices and lower production following curtailment of exploration and development activity. Apache has reduced debt by 24 percent from year-end 2014 levels, while increasing cash by $698 million during the same period. At the end of 2016, in addition to $1.4 billion of cash on hand, Apache has $3.5 billion in available committed borrowing capacity.

2017 Outlook

The Company currently plans to increase 2017 capital investments by more than 60 percent over 2016 spending, to approximately $3.1 billion, excluding capital associated with the one-third noncontrolling interest in Egypt. The Company’s 2017 plan assumes $50 per barrel for WTI, $51 per barrel for Brent indexed crude, $3.15 per Mcf for NYMEX natural gas, and $5.25 per Mcf for UK-indexed gas. At these price levels, our capital program will exceed anticipated operating cash flows. Based on current strip pricing, the remaining outspend will be funded primarily by proceeds from non-core asset sales, approximately $400 million of which has already occurred. In early 2017, the Company entered into put option contracts which will mitigate the downside risk of price volatility while providing full exposure to upside price potential. The put contracts provide an average floor of $50.47 per barrel and cover most of the Company’s second-half 2017 oil production.

Nearly two-thirds, or approximately $2 billion, of Apache’s capital spending in 2017 will be allocated to the Permian Basin, primarily in the Midland and Delaware Basins. This allocation includes approximately $500 million for construction of infrastructure at Alpine High. The infrastructure at Alpine High will include multiple pipeline connections along with compression, gathering, centralized processing facilities and tank batteries designed to accommodate expected volume increases as the play is developed. Internationally, Apache’s capital plan is intended to sustain longer-term free cash flow generation in Egypt and the North Sea. International spending will account for approximately 30 percent of Apache’s total 2017 budget, split nearly evenly between Egypt and the North Sea. Apache’s 2017 opportunity set in these regions is primarily centered on development drilling and lower-risk, step-out exploration wells, where the Company has a long-standing track record of success. Apache’s remaining capital budget is allocated between its remaining North American regions and an exploration well in Suriname expected to commence drilling in the first quarter.

The Company anticipates that production volumes will decline through the second quarter of 2017, before showing consistent quarterly growth beginning in the second half of the year. For the full year, the Company projects reported production in the range of 486 to 506 Mboe/d. Production excluding the noncontrolling interest and tax volumes in Egypt is expected to be in the range of 398 to 415 Mboe/d.

Operational Highlights

Apache’s deliberate focus on strategic testing and targeted development drilling during the price downturn, in addition to the Alpine High discovery, significantly impacted results in its Permian Basin plays, Egypt, and the North Sea.

Other operational highlights for the year include:

North America

•

North America onshore liquids averaged 171,691 barrels per day, with crude oil representing 65 percent of this liquids production. North America onshore liquids production represented 51 percent of worldwide liquids production and 33 percent of overall production, contributing $1.8 billion of liquids revenues in 2016. Onshore equivalent production was down 11 percent relative to 2015 as a result of a significant reduction in exploration and development capital spending during 2015 and 2016.

•

The Permian region averaged 5 operated rigs during the year, drilling 132 gross wells, 93 net wells. Over half of the region’s production is crude oil and 23 percent is NGLs. Combined, this represents more than a third of Apache’s total liquids production for 2016. The region averaged 161 Mboe/d during 2016 and contributed $1.5 billion of revenues during 2016.

•

The Midcontinent/Gulf Coast region drilled or participated in drilling 35 gross wells, with a 94 percent success rate. The region focused its drilling activities in the Woodford-SCOOP and Canyon Lime formations during 2016. The region averaged 55 Mboe/d during 2016, contributing $378 million of revenues for the year.

•

The Canada region drilled or participated in drilling 17 gross wells, with an 88 percent success rate. Drilling operations were primarily focused on the region’s Wapiti Montney, Ante Creek Montney, Duvernay, and Glauconite plays, with a goal of reducing drilling and completion costs. The region averaged 59 Mboe/d and contributed $343 million of revenues during 2016.


International and Offshore

•

The Egypt region continued to reduce its drilling program throughout 2016, averaging 6 rigs and drilling 61 gross wells. As a result of the reduced investment in drilling activity over the past several years, gross production decreased one percent. Egypt’s net production increased 11 percent from 2015, a function of the mechanics of its production-sharing contracts. In December 2016, Apache was notified by the Egyptian Ministry that it was the successful bidder in two new concessions, which will add 1.6 million gross undeveloped acres to its portfolio. Apache anticipates these concessions will be signed into law mid-2017. The region averaged 170 net Mboe/d and contributed $2.1 billion of revenues during 2016.

•

The North Sea region averaged 4 rigs during 2016, drilling 14 gross wells, 11 net wells. During the year, the region averaged production of 68 Mboe/d and contributed $970 million of revenues. Apache was able to minimize production decline to 4 percent year over year despite a significant reduction in capital expenditures. Apache continues to progress the development of its 2015 Callater (formerly K) exploration discovery in the Beryl area, with first production projected in the second half of 2017. The Company continues appraisal activities on two additional 2015 exploration discoveries: the Corona discovery, which logged 225 feet total vertical depth net pay in excellent reservoir-quality sandstone, and the Seagull discovery, which confirmed 672 feet of net oil pay over a 1,092-foot column in Triassic-age sands.

Acquisition and Divestiture Activity

Over Apache’s 60-year history, it has repeatedly demonstrated its ability to capitalize quickly and decisively on changes in its industry and economic conditions. A key component of this strategy is to continuously review and optimize Apache’s portfolio of assets in response to changes. Most recently, Apache has completed a series of divestitures designed to monetize nonstrategic assets and enhance Apache’s portfolio in order to strategically allocate resources to more impactful development opportunities. These divestments comprised primarily capital intensive projects and assets that were not accretive to earnings in the near-term, and included all of Apache’s operations in Australia and Argentina. These divestments include:

•

Australia Operations

On June 5, 2015, Apache’s subsidiaries completed the sale of the Company’s Australian subsidiary Apache Energy Limited to a consortium of private equity funds managed by Macquarie Capital Group Limited and Brookfield Asset Management Inc. for total proceeds of $1.9 billion. Additionally, in October 2015, Apache’s subsidiaries completed the sale of its 49 percent interest in Yara Pilbara Holdings Pty Ltd (YPHPL), to Yara International for total proceeds of $391 million. The effective date of the transaction was January 1, 2015.

•

LNG Projects

On April 2, 2015 and April 10, 2015, Apache subsidiaries completed the sale of its interest in the Wheatstone LNG and Kitimat LNG projects, respectively, along with accompanying upstream oil and gas reserves to Woodside Petroleum Limited (Woodside) for a total cash consideration of $3.7 billion.

•

Nonstrategic Assets in the Anadarko Basin and in Southern Louisiana

On December 31, 2014, Apache completed the sale of certain Anadarko basin and southern Louisiana oil and gas assets for approximately $1.3 billion in two separate transactions. In the Anadarko basin, Apache sold approximately 115,000 net acres in Wheeler County, Texas, and western Oklahoma. In southern Louisiana, the Company sold working interests in approximately 90,000 net acres. The effective date of both of these transactions was October 1, 2014.

•

Certain Gulf of Mexico Deepwater Assets

On June 30, 2014, Apache completed the sale of non-operated interests in the Lucius and Heidelberg development projects and 11 primary term deepwater exploration blocks in the Gulf of Mexico for $1.4 billion. The effective date of the transaction was May 1, 2014.

•

Nonstrategic Canadian Assets

On April 30, 2014, Apache completed the sale of primarily dry gas producing hydrocarbon assets in the Deep Basin area of western Alberta and British Columbia, Canada, for $374 million. The assets comprise 328,400 net acres in the Ojay, Noel, and Wapiti areas. Apache retained 100 percent of its working interest in horizons below the Cretaceous in the Wapiti area, including rights to the liquids-rich Montney and other deeper horizons. The effective date of the transaction was January 1, 2014.

•

Argentina Operations

On March 12, 2014, Apache’s subsidiaries completed the sale of all of the Company’s operations in Argentina to YPF Sociedad Anónima for $800 million (subject to customary closing adjustments) plus the assumption of $52 million of bank debt as of June 30, 2013.

The table shows production on a barrel of oil equivalent basis (boe) in which natural gas is converted to an equivalent barrel of oil based on a ratio of 6 Mcf to 1 bbl. This ratio is not reflective of the price ratio between the two products.

(4)

Average sales volumes from the North Sea for 2016 were

66,872

boe/d. Sales volumes may vary from production volumes as a result of the timing of liftings in the Beryl field.


Pricing

The following table presents pricing information by region:

Crude Oil Prices

A substantial portion of our crude oil production is sold at prevailing market prices, which fluctuate in response to many factors that are outside of the Company’s control. Average realized crude oil prices for


were

down

14 percent

compared to


, a direct result of the sharply lower benchmark oil prices over the past year. Crude oil prices realized in


averaged

$41.63

per barrel.

Continued volatility in the commodity price environment reinforces the importance of our asset portfolio. While the market price received for natural gas varies among geographic areas, crude oil tends to trade within a global market. Price movements for all types and grades of crude oil generally move in the same direction.

Natural Gas Prices

Natural gas, which currently has a limited global transportation system, is subject to price variances based on local supply and demand conditions. Our primary markets include North America, Egypt, and the U.K. An overview of the market conditions in our primary gas-producing regions follows:

•

North America has a common market; most of our gas is sold on a monthly or daily basis at either monthly or daily market prices. Our North American regions averaged

$1.97

per Mcf in


,

down

from

$2.39

per Mcf in


.


•

In Egypt, our gas is sold to EGPC, primarily under an industry pricing formula indexed to Dated Brent crude oil with a minimum gas price of $1.50 per MMBtu and a maximum gas price of $2.65 per MMBtu, plus an upward adjustment for liquids content. Overall, the region averaged

$2.71

per Mcf in


, down

7 percent

from the prior year.

•

Natural gas from the North Sea Beryl field is processed through the SAGE gas plant operated by Apache. The gas is sold to a third party at the St. Fergus entry point of the national grid on a National Balancing Point index price basis. The region averaged

$4.51

per Mcf in


, a

33 percent

decrease

from an average of

$6.73

per Mcf in


.

NGL Prices

Apache’s NGL production is sold under contracts with prices at market indices based on local supply and demand conditions, less the costs for transportation and fractionation, or on a weighted-average sales price received by the purchaser.

vs.


During 2015, crude oil revenues totaled

$5.1 billion

, approximately 49 percent lower than the 2014 total of

$10.1 billion

, driven by a

47 percent

decrease in average crude oil prices and a

4 percent

decrease in worldwide production. Average daily production in 2015 was

percent of our 2015 oil and gas production revenues and

53 percent

of our equivalent production, compared to 79 and 51 percent, respectively, in the prior year. Lower realized prices reduced revenues $4.8 billion, while lower production volumes reduced revenues an additional $222 million.

Worldwide crude oil production from continuing operations decreased

12.6

Mb/d. When excluding production from asset divestitures during 2015 and 2014, crude oil production remained essentially flat as drilling and recompletion activity in our North American onshore regions offset natural decline in all regions.

Worldwide gas production from continuing operations decreased

16 percent

. Excluding production from asset divestitures during 2015 and 2014, gas production decreased only 2 percent. This decrease was driven primarily by natural decline and well shut-ins in Egypt and Canada. This decrease was primarily offset by drilling and recompletion activity in North America onshore regions.

Operating Expenses

The table below presents a comparison of our expenses on an absolute dollar basis and an equivalent unit of production (boe) basis. Our discussion may reference expenses on a boe basis, on an absolute dollar basis or both, depending on context. All operating expenses include costs attributable to a noncontrolling interest in Egypt. Operating expenses for all periods exclude discontinued operations in Argentina and Australia.

(1) For expenses impacted by the timing of


liftings in the North Sea, per-boe calculations are based on sales volumes rather than production volumes.

Lease Operating Expenses (LOE)

LOE includes several key components, such as direct operating costs, repair and maintenance, and workover costs. Direct operating costs generally trend with commodity prices and are impacted by the type of commodity produced and the location of properties (i.e., offshore, onshore, remote locations, etc.). Fluctuations in commodity prices impact operating cost elements both directly and indirectly. They directly impact costs such as power, fuel, and chemicals, which are commodity price based. Commodity prices also affect industry activity and demand, thus indirectly impacting the cost of items such as rig rates, labor, boats, helicopters, materials, and supplies. Oil, which contributed more than half of our 2016 production, is inherently more expensive to produce than natural gas. Repair and maintenance costs are typically higher on offshore properties.

During 2016, LOE

decreased

$360 million

, or

19 percent

, on an absolute dollar basis compared to


. On a per-unit basis, LOE

decreased

$1.50

, or

16 percent

compared to 2015. During 2015, LOE

decreased

$384 million

, or

17 percent

, on an absolute dollar basis compared to 2014. On a per-unit basis, LOE

decreased

$0.91

, or

9 percent

, compared to 2014. These reductions reflect our continued focus on cost reductions consistent with the current price environment.


Gathering and Transportation

Apache generally sells oil and natural gas under two common types of agreements, both of which include a transportation charge. One is a netback arrangement, under which we sell oil or natural gas at the wellhead and collect a lower relative price to reflect transportation costs to be incurred by the purchaser. In this case, we record sales at the netback price received from the purchaser. Alternatively, we sell oil or natural gas at a specific delivery point, pay our own transportation to a third-party carrier, and receive a price with no transportation deduction. In this case, we record the separate transportation cost as gathering and transportation costs.

In the U.S. and Canada we sell oil and natural gas under both types of arrangements. In the North Sea, we pay transportation charges to a third-party carrier. In Egypt, our oil and natural gas production that is sold to EGPC is primarily under netback arrangements. The Egypt crude oil that is exported is sold under both types of arrangements.


vs.


Gathering and transportation costs

decreased

$11 million

from


. The decrease was driven primarily by a decrease in volumes and rate changes in Canada, partially offset by rate changes in the Permian Basin.


vs.


Gathering and transportation costs decreased $62 million from 2014. The decrease was driven primarily by North American onshore divestitures.

Taxes Other Than Income

Taxes other than income primarily consist of U.K. Petroleum Revenue Tax (PRT), severance taxes on properties onshore and in state waters off the coast of the U.S., and ad valorem taxes on properties in the U.S. and Canada. Severance taxes are generally based on a percentage of oil and gas production revenues, while the U.K. PRT is assessed on net receipts from qualifying fields in the U.K. North Sea. We are subject to a variety of other taxes including U.S. franchise taxes and various Canadian taxes, including the Freehold Mineral tax and Saskatchewan Resource surcharge.


vs.


Taxes other than income in 2016 were

$156 million

lower than 2015. In the third quarter of this year, the rate of U.K. PRT, historically assessed on qualifying fields in the U.K. North Sea, was reduced to zero percent effective January 1, 2016.  As a result, U.K. PRT decreased $92 million over the comparable 2015 period. Severance tax decreased $25 million as a result of the decline in oil and gas production and lower prices. Ad valorem taxes decreased $21 million as a result of a decrease in property values in 2016.


vs.


Taxes other than income in 2015 were $295 million lower than 2014. U.K. PRT decreased $118 million over the comparable 2014 period as the result of decreased production revenues in the North Sea from qualifying fields during the year. Severance tax decreased $138 million as the result of lower revenues and the divestiture of properties in Louisiana and Oklahoma. Ad valorem taxes decreased $27 million as a result of property divestitures.

Exploration Expense

Exploration expense includes unproved leasehold impairments, exploration dry hole expense, geological and geophysical expense, and the costs of maintaining and retaining unproved leasehold properties. The following table presents a summary of these expenses:


vs.


Exploration expenses in


decreased

$2.3 billion

, or

83 percent

, compared to


, primarily a result of stabilizing commodity and leasehold prices reducing unproved leasehold impairments during 2016 in all key geographic areas. Dry hole expense decreased $52 million primarily as a result of reduced capital spending during 2016. Geological and geophysical expense decreased by $45 million during 2016 compared to 2015 as a result of reduced capital spending.



vs.


Exploration expenses in 2015

increased

$272 million

, or

11 percent

, compared to 2014 as lower commodity prices impacted exploration activity and resulted in unproved leasehold impairments increasing in all key geographic areas. This increase was partially offset by reduced exploration dry hole costs in 2015. Dry hole expense was $185 million higher in 2014 as a result of unsuccessful drilling activities expensed in that period associated with wells primarily in the Gulf of Mexico and Egypt. Geological and geophysical expense decreased $33 million as a result of fewer seismic purchases in Canada during 2015.

General and Administrative (G&A) Expenses


vs.


G&A expenses

increased

$30 million

, or

8 percent

, from 2015. On a per-unit basis, G&A expenses

increased

$0.23

to

$2.15

per boe. The increase in G&A expense was primarily related to non-cash stock-based compensation expense.


vs.


G&A expenses

decreased

$73 million

, or

16 percent

, from 2014. On a per-unit basis, G&A expenses

decreased

$0.15

to

$1.92

per boe. These reductions reflect Apache’s intense focus on driving internal efficiencies and bringing overhead in line with the current commodity price environment. In 2015, we rationalized our entire organizational structure, eliminating layers of management, consolidating office locations, and reducing corporate and regional staffing to more closely align with activity levels expected in the future.

Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization (DD&A)


vs.


Oil and gas property DD&A expense of

$2.5 billion

in


decreased

$516 million

compared to


. The Company’s oil and gas property DD&A rate

decreased

$2.09

per boe in


compared to


. The primary factor driving both lower absolute dollar expense and lower DD&A per boe rates was the reduction in the Company’s oil and gas properties as a result of impairments to proved properties in 2015 and 2016. Other asset depreciation

decreased

$166 million

compared to


primarily related to a reduction in the Company

’

s gas gathering, transmission, and processing (GTP) assets as a result of impairments to GTP assets during 2015.


vs.


Oil and gas property DD&A expense decreased

$1.2 billion

compared to 2014. The Company’s oil and gas property DD&A rate decreased

$4.21

to

$15.01

per boe in 2015 compared to 2014. The primary factor driving both lower absolute dollar expense and lower DD&A per boe rates was the reduction in the Company’s oil and gas properties as a result of impairments to proved properties in 2014 and 2015. Other asset depreciation remained relatively flat.

Impairments

During 2016, the Company recorded asset impairments totaling

$1.1 billion

in connection with fair value assessments, including

$486 million

for a PRT decommissioning asset that is no longer expected to be realizable from future abandonment activities in the North Sea,

$427 million

impairments of oil and gas proved properties in the U.S. and Canada,

$135 million

impairments of certain GTP facilities in the North Sea, and

$55 million

for inventory write-downs.

During 2015, the Company recorded asset impairments totaling

$9.5 billion

, including $7.4 billion impairments of oil and gas proved properties, $1.7 billion impairments of GTP facilities, a $148 million impairment of our YPHPL equity method investment sold in the fourth quarter, $163 million impairment of goodwill in our North Sea reporting unit, and $55 million for inventory write-downs. Oil and gas proved property impairments resulted from lower commodity prices and downward revisions of reserves resulting from changes to the Company's development plans in certain areas. GTP impairments included $555 million for facilities in Canada, $102 million in the U.S., and $1.1 billion in Egypt. The Egyptian impairments resulted in net losses for the year in the applicable concessions, significantly reducing tax expense recorded under our production-sharing contracts.

During 2014, the Company recorded asset impairments totaling

$7.1 billion

, including $6.1 billion impairments of oil and gas proved properties, $655 million impairment of assets held for sale, $347 million impairments of goodwill in our U.S. and Canadian reporting units, and $32 million for inventory write-downs.


The following table presents a summary of asset impairments recorded for

of expenses during


,


, and


, respectively, primarily related to company reorganization, including separation costs, investment banking fees and other associated costs. The charges for


include $33 million for employee separation and $6 million for consolidation of office space and other reorganization efforts.

Financing Costs, Net

Financing costs incurred during the period comprised the following:


vs.


Net financing costs

decreased

$94 million

from


. The decrease is primarily related to an

increase

of

$33 million

in capitalized interest, a

decrease

of

$22 million

in interest expense, and a $39 million loss on the early extinguishment of debt incurred in 2015.


vs.


Net financing costs

increased

$98 million

from 2014. The increase is primarily related to a

decrease

of

$70 million

in capitalized interest from lower asset balances qualifying for capitalized interest and a $39 million loss on the early extinguishment of debt during 2015, partially offset by a decrease of $13 million in interest expense resulting from lower average debt balances.

Provision for Income Taxes

The 2016 income tax benefit from continuing operations totaled

$442 million

. During 2016, Apache’s effective tax rate was impacted primarily by non-cash impairments of the carrying value of the Company’s oil and gas properties, non-cash impairments of the Company’s PRT decommissioning asset, the impact of the change in U.K. statutory income tax rate, and an increase in the amount of valuation allowances on U.S. and Canadian deferred tax assets.

In 2016, the U.K. government enacted Finance Bill 2016 which provides income tax relief to Exploration and Production (E&P) companies operating in the North Sea through a reduction of Supplementary Charge from 20 percent to 10 percent, effective January 1, 2016. As a result of the enacted legislation in the third quarter of 2016, the Company recorded a deferred tax benefit of $238 million related to the remeasurement of the Company’s December 31, 2015 U.K. deferred income tax liability.


In 2015, Apache repatriated the sales proceeds from the divestment of its interest in LNG projects and Australian upstream assets. Upon the repatriation of these proceeds, Apache recognized a U.S. current income tax liability of $560 million. Pursuant to its plan of divestiture of these assets, Apache recorded a deferred income tax liability of $560 million on undistributed foreign earnings in 2014.

The 2015 income tax benefit from continuing operations totaled $1.0 billion. The 2015 effective tax rate reflects the tax benefit from $11.9 billion of asset impairments, the recognition of $2.1 billion of deferred tax assets related to foreign tax credit carryforwards, and an increase in valuation allowance against the Canadian region’s net deferred tax assets. Separately, the U.K. government enacted Finance Bill 2015 which provided income tax relief to E&P companies operating in the North Sea through a reduction of Supplementary Charge from 32 percent to 20 percent, effective January 1, 2015. As a result of the enacted legislation, in 2015, Apache recorded a deferred tax benefit of $414 million related to the remeasurement of the Company’s December 31, 2014 U.K. deferred income tax liability.

For additional information regarding income taxes, please refer to Note 9—Income Taxes in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part IV, Item 15 of this Form 10-K.

Capital Resources and Liquidity

Operating cash flows are the Company’s primary source of liquidity. We may also elect to utilize available cash on hand, committed borrowing capacity, access to both debt and equity capital markets, or proceeds from the sale of nonstrategic assets for all other liquidity and capital resource needs.

Apache’s operating cash flows, both in the short-term and the long-term, are impacted by highly volatile oil and natural gas prices, as well as costs and sales volumes. Significant changes in commodity prices impact our revenues, earnings and cash flows. These changes potentially impact our liquidity if costs do not trend with changes in commodity prices. Historically, costs have trended with commodity prices, albeit on a lag. Sales volumes also impact cash flows; however, they have a less volatile impact in the short-term.

Apache’s long-term operating cash flows are dependent on reserve replacement and the level of costs required for ongoing operations. Cash investments are required to fund activity necessary to offset the inherent declines in production and proved crude oil and natural gas reserves. Future success in maintaining and growing reserves and production is highly dependent on the success of our drilling program and our ability to add reserves economically. Deterioration in commodity prices also impacts estimated quantities of proved reserves. During 2016, we recognized negative reserve revisions of approximately 11 percent of our year-end 2015 estimated proved reserves as a result of lower prices. If realized prices for the remainder of 2017 approximate commodity futures prices as of December 31, 2016, the Company does not expect additional negative revisions for the year.

The Company currently plans to increase 2017 capital investments by more than 60 percent from 2016 spending, to approximately $3.1 billion, excluding capital associated with the one-third noncontrolling interest in Egypt. The Company’s 2017 plan assumes $50 per barrel for WTI, $51 per barrel for Brent indexed crude, $3.15 per Mcf for NYMEX natural gas, and $5.25 per Mcf for UK-indexed gas. At these price levels, our capital program will exceed anticipated operating cash flows. Based on current strip pricing, the remaining outspend will be funded primarily by proceeds from non-core asset sales, approximately $400 million of which has already occurred. In early 2017, the Company entered into put option contracts which will mitigate the downside risk of price volatility while providing full exposure to upside price potential. Nearly two-thirds, or approximately $2 billion, of Apache’s capital spending in 2017 will be allocated to the Permian Basin, primarily in the Midland and Delaware Basins. This allocation includes approximately $500 million for construction of infrastructure at Alpine High. International spending will account for approximately 30 percent of Apache’s total 2017 budget, split nearly evenly between Egypt and the North Sea. Apache’s remaining capital budget is allocated between its remaining North American regions and an exploration well in Suriname expected to commence drilling in the first quarter.

We believe the liquidity and capital resource alternatives available to Apache will be adequate to fund short-term and long-term operations, including our capital spending program, repayment of debt maturities, payment of dividends, and any amount that may ultimately be paid in connection with commitments and contingencies.

Sources and Uses of Cash

The following table presents the sources and uses of our cash and cash equivalents for the years presented:

Net Cash Provided by Continuing Operating Activities

Operating cash flows are our primary source of capital and liquidity and are impacted, both in the short-term and the long-term, by volatile oil and natural gas prices. The factors that determine operating cash flows are largely the same as those that affect net earnings, with the exception of non-cash expenses such as DD&A, asset retirement obligation (ARO) accretion, exploratory dry hole expense, asset impairments, and deferred income tax expense.

Net cash provided by continuing operating activities for


totaled

$2.5 billion

, down

$101 million

from


. The decrease primarily reflects lower commodity prices.

For a detailed discussion of commodity prices, production, and expenses, please see “Results of Operations” in this Item 7. For additional detail on the changes in operating assets and liabilities and the non-cash expenses which do not impact net cash provided by operating activities, please see the Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows in the Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part IV, Item 15 of this Form 10-K.

Australia Discontinued Operations

During 2015, Apache completed the sale of its Wheatstone LNG project and associated upstream assets to Woodside for total proceeds of $2.8 billion. During 2015, Apache also completed the sale of its Australian subsidiary Apache Energy Limited (AEL) to a consortium of private equity funds managed by Macquarie Capital Group Limited and Brookfield Asset Management Inc. for total proceeds of $1.9 billion. The results of operations for the divested Australian assets, asset impairments, and losses on disposal are classified as discontinued operations in all periods presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.


Argentina Discontinued Operations

During 2014, Apache completed the sale of our Argentina operations and properties to YPF Sociedad Anónima for cash proceeds of $800 million (subject to customary closing adjustments). The results of operations related to Argentina have been classified as discontinued operations in all periods presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Net cash provided by Argentina discontinued operations for the first quarter of 2014 was $2 million.

Liquidity


Cash and Cash Equivalents

At

December 31, 2016

, we had

$1.4 billion

in cash and cash equivalents, of which $1 billion of cash was held by foreign subsidiaries, and approximately $347 million was held by Apache Corporation and U.S. subsidiaries. The cash held by foreign subsidiaries should not be subject to additional U.S. income taxes if repatriated. The majority of the cash is invested in highly liquid, investment-grade instruments with maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase.

Debt

At

December 31, 2016

, outstanding debt, which consisted of notes and debentures, totaled

$8.5 billion

. We have $550 million maturing in 2018, $150 million maturing in 2019, $493 million maturing in 2021, and the remaining maturing in years 2022 through 2096. At

December 31, 2016

, we had $483,000 of notes due March 2017 classified as current debt on the consolidated balance sheet.

In November 2016, the Company initiated a program to purchase in the open market up to $250 million in aggregate principal amount of senior notes issued under its indentures.  In the fourth quarter of 2016, Apache purchased and canceled $181 million aggregate principal amount of its senior notes through open market repurchases for $182 million in cash, including accrued interest and $0.5 million of premium. These repurchases resulted in a $1 million net loss on extinguishment of debt, which is included in “Financing costs, net” in our statement of consolidated operations. The net loss includes an acceleration of related discount and deferred financing costs.

In January 2017, we purchased and canceled an additional $69 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes for $71 million in cash, including accrued interest and $1 million of premium, which completed the open market repurchase program.

Available Credit Facilities

In June 2015, the Company entered into a five-year revolving credit facility which matures in June 2020, subject to Apache’s two, one-year extension options. The facility provides for aggregate commitments of $3.5 billion (including a $750 million letter of credit subfacility), with rights to increase commitments up to an aggregate $4.5 billion. Proceeds from borrowings may be used for general corporate purposes. Apache’s available borrowing capacity under this facility supports its commercial paper program. In connection with entry into the $3.5 billion facility, Apache terminated $5.3 billion in commitments under existing credit facilities. As of December 31, 2016, there were no borrowings under this credit facility, leaving aggregate available borrowing capacity at $3.5 billion.

At the Company’s option, the interest rate per annum for borrowings under the 2015 facility is either a base rate, as defined, plus a margin, or the London Inter-bank Offered Rate (LIBOR), plus a margin. The Company also pays quarterly a facility fee at a per annum rate on total commitments. The margins and the facility fee vary based upon the Company’s senior long-term debt rating. At

December 31, 2016

, the base rate margin was 0.075 percent, the LIBOR margin was 1.075 percent, and the facility fee was 0.175 percent.

The financial covenants of the 2015 credit facility require the Company to maintain an adjusted debt-to-capital ratio of not greater than 60 percent at the end of any fiscal quarter. For purposes of this calculation, capital excludes the effects of non-cash write-downs, impairments, and related charges occurring after June 30, 2015. At

December 31, 2016

, the Company’s debt-to-capital ratio as calculated under the credit facility was 33 percent.

The 2015 facility's negative covenants restrict the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to create liens securing debt on its hydrocarbon-related assets, with exceptions for liens typically arising in the oil and gas industry, purchase money liens, liens on subsidiary assets located outside of the United States and Canada, and liens arising as a matter of law, such as tax and mechanics’ liens. The Company also may incur liens on assets if debt secured thereby does not exceed 5 percent of the Company’s consolidated assets, or approximately $1.1 billion as of

December 31, 2016

. Negative covenants also restrict Apache’s ability to merge with another entity unless it is the surviving entity, dispose of substantially all of its assets, and guarantee debt of non-consolidated entities in excess of the stated threshold.

In February 2016, Apache entered into a three-year letter of credit facility providing £900 million in commitments, with options to increase commitments to £1.075 billion and extend the term by one year. The facility is available for letters of credit denominated in pounds sterling, U.S. dollars, Canadian dollars, and any other foreign currency consented to by an issuing bank. The facility also is available for loans in pounds sterling, U.S. dollars, and Canadian dollars to cash collateralize letters of credit or obligations to provide letters of credit, in each case, to the extent letters of credit are unavailable under the facility. The facility’s representations and warranties, covenants, and events of default are substantially similar to those in Apache’s 2015 $3.5 billion revolving credit facility.


Commissions are payable on letters of credit outstanding under the 2016 facility at a per annum rate equal to a LIBOR margin. Borrowings bear interest per annum at a base rate or LIBOR, plus a margin. A facility fee at a per annum rate on aggregate commitments also is payable. Letter of credit commissions, the interest margin, and the facility fee vary depending on Apache’s senior unsecured long-term debt rating. At December 31, 2016, the LIBOR margin was 1.075 percent, the base rate margin was 0.075 percent, and the facility fee was 0.175 percent.

The 2016 facility is available for the Company’s letter of credit needs, particularly those which may arise in respect of abandonment obligations assumed in various North Sea acquisitions. As of December 31, 2016, three letters of credit aggregating approximately £147.5 million and no borrowings were outstanding under this facility.

There are no clauses in the 2015 $3.5 billion or 2016 £900 million credit facilities that permit the lenders to accelerate payments or refuse to lend based on unspecified material adverse changes. The agreements for these facilities do not have drawdown restrictions or prepayment obligations in the event of a decline in credit ratings. However, the agreements allow the lenders to accelerate payment maturity and terminate lending and issuance commitments for nonpayment and other breaches, and if the Company or any of its U.S. or Canadian subsidiaries defaults on other indebtedness in excess of the stated threshold, is insolvent, or has any unpaid, non-appealable judgment against it for payment of money in excess of the stated threshold. Lenders may also accelerate payment maturity and terminate lending and issuance commitments if the Company undergoes a specified change in control or any borrower has specified pension plan liabilities in excess of the stated threshold. The Company was in compliance with the terms of these credit facilities as of December 31, 2016.

There is no assurance that the financial condition of banks with lending commitments to the Company will not deteriorate. We closely monitor the ratings of the banks in our bank groups. Having large bank groups allows the Company to mitigate the potential impact of any bank’s failure to honor its lending commitment.

Commercial Paper Program

As of December 31, 2016, the Company has available a $3.5 billion commercial paper program. The commercial paper program generally enables Apache to borrow funds for up to 270 days at competitive interest rates. The commercial paper program is fully supported by available borrowing capacity under the Company’s 2015 $3.5 billion committed credit facility. If the Company is unable to issue commercial paper following a significant credit downgrade or dislocation in the market, the Company’s 2015 committed credit facility, which expires in 2020, is available as a 100 percent backstop. As of

December 31, 2016

, the Company had no borrowings under its commercial paper program.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

Apache enters into customary agreements in the oil and gas industry for drilling rig commitments, firm transportation agreements, and other obligations as described below in “Contractual Obligations” in this Item 7. Other than the off-balance sheet arrangements described herein, Apache does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements with unconsolidated entities that are reasonably likely to materially affect our liquidity or capital resource positions.


C

ontractual Obligations

The following table summarizes the Company’s contractual obligations as of

December 31, 2016

. For additional information regarding these obligations, please see Note 8—Debt and Note 10—Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part IV, Item 15 of this Form 10-K.

(1)

This table does not include the Company’s liability for dismantlement, abandonment, and restoration costs of oil and gas properties or pension or postretirement benefit obligations. For additional information regarding these liabilities, please see Notes 7 and 11, respectively, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part IV, Item 15 of this Form 10-K.

(2)

This represents our capital lease obligation discounted at 4.4 percent for a Midland office building.

(3)

Amounts represent any agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms. These include minimum commitments associated with long-term take-or-pay contracts, NGL processing agreements, drilling work program commitments, and agreements to secure capacity rights on third-party pipelines. Amounts exclude certain product purchase obligations related to marketing and trading activities for which there are no minimum purchase requirements or the amounts are not fixed or determinable.

(4)

Amounts include long-term lease payments for office space, aircraft, supply and standby vessels, gas pipeline and land leases, and equipment related to exploration, development, and production activities, such as compressors. The Company expects to receive $10 million in sublease income associated with these leases.

Apache is also subject to various contingent obligations that become payable only if certain events or rulings were to occur. The inherent uncertainty surrounding the timing of and monetary impact associated with these events or rulings prevents any meaningful accurate measurement, which is necessary to assess settlements resulting from litigation. Apache’s management believes that it has adequately reserved for its contingent obligations, including approximately

$51 million

for environmental remediation and approximately

$15 million

for various contingent legal liabilities. For a detailed discussion of the Company’s environmental and legal contingencies, please see Note 10—Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part IV, Item 15 of this Form 10-K.

In addition to our recorded environmental and legal liabilities, we have potential exposure to future obligations related to divested properties. Apache has divested various leases, wells, and facilities located in the Gulf of Mexico where the purchasers typically assume all obligations to plug, abandon, and decommission the associated wells, structures, and facilities acquired. One or more of the counterparties in these transactions could, either as a result of the severe decline in oil and natural gas prices or other factors related to the historical or future operations of their respective businesses, face financial problems that may have a significant impact on their solvency and ability to continue as a going concern. If a purchaser of our Gulf of Mexico assets becomes the subject of a case or proceeding under relevant insolvency laws or otherwise fails to perform required abandonment obligations, Apache could be required to perform such actions under applicable federal laws and regulations. In such event, we may be forced to use available cash to cover the costs of such liabilities and obligations should they arise.

With respect to our retained oil and gas operations in the Gulf of Mexico, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) has issued Notice to Lessees (NTL) No. 2016-N01 pertaining to the obligations of companies to provide supplemental assurances for performance with respect to plugging, abandonment, decommissioning, and site clearance obligations associated with wells, platforms, structures, and facilities located upon or used in connection with such companies’ oil and gas leases. Under this NTL, the Company will likely be required to provide additional security to BOEM with respect to plugging, abandonment, and decommissioning obligations relating to the Company’s current ownership interests in various Gulf of Mexico leases. We are working closely with the BOEM to make arrangements for the provision of such additional required security, if such security becomes necessary under the new NTL. Additionally, we are not able to predict the effect that these changes might have on counterparties to which Apache has sold Gulf of Mexico assets. Such changes could cause the bonding obligations of such parties to increase substantially, thereby causing a significant impact on the counterparties’ solvency and ability to continue as a going concern.


Insurance Program

We maintain insurance policies that include coverage for physical damage to our assets, general liabilities, workers’ compensation, employers’ liability, sudden and accidental pollution, and other risks. Our insurance coverage is subject to deductibles or retentions that we must satisfy prior to recovering on insurance. Additionally, our insurance is subject to policy exclusions and limitations. There is no assurance that our insurance will adequately protect us against liability from all potential consequences and damages.

Our current insurance policies covering physical damage to our assets provide up to $1 billion in coverage per occurrence. These policies also provide sudden and accidental pollution coverage. Coverage for Gulf of Mexico named windstorms is excluded from this coverage.

Our current insurance policies covering general liabilities provide approximately $500 million in coverage, scaled to Apache’s interest. Our service agreements, including drilling contracts, generally indemnify Apache for injuries and death of the service provider’s employees as well as subcontractors hired by the service provider.

Apache purchases multi-year political risk insurance from the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) and highly-rated insurers covering a portion of its investments in Egypt for losses arising from confiscation, nationalization, and expropriation risks. The Islamic Corporation for the Insurance of Investment and Export Credit (ICIEC, an agency of the Islamic Development Bank) reinsures OPIC. In the aggregate, these insurance policies provide up to $750 million of coverage to Apache, subject to policy terms and conditions and a retention of approximately $1 billion.

Apache has an additional insurance policy with OPIC, which, subject to policy terms and conditions, provides up to $300 million of coverage through 2024 for losses arising from (1) non-payment by EGPC of arbitral awards covering amounts owed Apache on past due invoices and (2) expropriation of exportable petroleum in the event that actions taken by the government of Egypt prevent Apache from exporting our share of production. The Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA), a member of the World Bank Group, provides $150 million in reinsurance to OPIC.

Future insurance coverage for our industry could increase in cost and may include higher deductibles or retentions. In addition, some forms of insurance may become unavailable.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Apache prepares its financial statements and the accompanying notes in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which require management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. Apache identifies certain accounting policies as critical based on, among other things, their impact on the portrayal of Apache’s financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity and the degree of difficulty, subjectivity, and complexity in their deployment. Critical accounting policies cover accounting matters that are inherently uncertain because the future resolution of such matters is unknown. Management routinely discusses the development, selection, and disclosure of each of the critical accounting policies. The following is a discussion of Apache’s most critical accounting policies.

Reserves Estimates

Proved oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities of natural gas, crude oil, condensate, and NGLs that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing conditions, operating conditions, and government regulations.

Proved undeveloped reserves include those reserves that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion. Undeveloped reserves may be classified as proved reserves on undrilled acreage directly offsetting development areas that are reasonably certain of production when drilled, or where reliable technology provides reasonable certainty of economic producibility. Undrilled locations may be classified as having undeveloped reserves only if a development plan has been adopted indicating that they are scheduled to be drilled within five years, unless specific circumstances justify a longer time.

Despite the inherent imprecision in these engineering estimates, our reserves are used throughout our financial statements. For example, since we use the units-of-production method to amortize our oil and gas properties, the quantity of reserves could significantly impact our DD&A expense. A material adverse change in the estimated volumes of reserves could result in property impairments. Finally, these reserves are the basis for our supplemental oil and gas disclosures.


Reserves are calculated using an unweighted arithmetic average of commodity prices in effect on the first day of each of the previous 12 months, held flat for the life of the production, except where prices are defined by contractual arrangements. Operating costs, production and ad valorem taxes and future development costs are based on current costs with no escalation.

Apache has elected not to disclose probable and possible reserves or reserve estimates in this filing.

Oil and Gas Exploration Costs

Apache accounts for its exploration and production activities using the successful efforts method of accounting. Costs of acquiring unproved and proved oil and gas leasehold acreage are capitalized. Costs of drilling and equipping productive wells, including development dry holes, and related production facilities are also capitalized. Oil and gas exploration costs, other than the costs of drilling exploratory wells, are charged to expense as incurred. Costs associated with drilling an exploratory well are initially capitalized, or suspended, pending a determination as to whether proved reserves have been found. On a quarterly basis, management reviews the status of all suspended exploratory drilling costs in light of ongoing exploration activities and determines whether the Company is making sufficient progress in its ongoing exploration and appraisal efforts. If management determines that future appraisal drilling or development activities are unlikely to occur, associated suspended exploratory well costs are recorded as dry hole expense and reported in exploration expense in the statement of consolidated operations. Otherwise, the costs of exploratory wells remain capitalized.

Long-Lived Assets

Long-lived assets used in operations, including proved oil and gas properties, are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate a possible significant deterioration in future cash flows expected to be generated by an asset group. Individual assets are grouped for impairment purposes based on a judgmental assessment of the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets. If there is an indication the carrying amount of an asset may not be recovered, the asset is assessed by management through an established process in which changes to significant assumptions such as prices, volumes, and future development plans are reviewed. If, upon review, the sum of the undiscounted pre-tax cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset group, the carrying value is written down to estimated fair value. Because there usually is a lack of quoted market prices for long-lived assets, the fair value of impaired assets is typically determined based on the present values of expected future cash flows using discount rates believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants. The expected future cash flows used for impairment reviews and related fair value calculations are typically based on judgmental assessments of future production volumes, commodity prices, operating costs, and capital investment plans, considering all available information at the date of review.

During the past two years, there was a substantial decline in commodity prices. The resulting change in future commodity price assumptions and impact to our future development plan was a triggering event which required us to reassess our long-lived assets for impairment. Based on the results of this assessment, we recorded impairments of certain proved oil and gas properties and gathering, transmission, and processing facilities. For discussion of these impairments, see “Fair Value Measurements” of Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Asset Retirement Obligation (ARO)

The Company has significant obligations to remove tangible equipment and restore land or seabed at the end of oil and gas production operations. Apache’s removal and restoration obligations are primarily associated with plugging and abandoning wells and removing and disposing of offshore oil and gas platforms in the North Sea and Gulf of Mexico. Estimating the future restoration and removal costs is difficult and requires management to make estimates and judgments. Asset removal technologies and costs are constantly changing, as are regulatory, political, environmental, safety, and public relations considerations.

ARO associated with retiring tangible long-lived assets is recognized as a liability in the period in which the legal obligation is incurred and becomes determinable. The liability is offset by a corresponding increase in the underlying asset. The ARO liability reflects the estimated present value of the amount of dismantlement, removal, site reclamation, and similar activities associated with Apache’s oil and gas properties. The Company utilizes current retirement costs to estimate the expected cash outflows for retirement obligations. Inherent in the present value calculation are numerous assumptions and judgments including the ultimate settlement amounts, inflation factors, credit-adjusted discount rates, timing of settlement, and changes in the legal, regulatory, environmental, and political environments. Accretion expense is recognized over time as the discounted liability is accreted to its expected settlement value.


Income Taxes

Our oil and gas exploration and production operations are subject to taxation on income in numerous jurisdictions worldwide. We record deferred tax assets and liabilities to account for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements and our tax returns. We routinely assess the ability to realize our deferred tax assets. If we conclude that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized under accounting standards, the tax asset would be reduced by a valuation allowance. Numerous judgments and assumptions are inherent in the determination of future taxable income, including factors such as future operating conditions (particularly as related to prevailing oil and gas prices).

The Company regularly assesses and, if required, establishes accruals for tax contingencies that could result from assessments of additional tax by taxing jurisdictions in countries where the Company operates. Tax reserves have been established and include any related interest, despite the belief by the Company that certain tax positions meet certain legislative, judicial, and regulatory requirements. These reserves are subject to a significant amount of judgment and are reviewed and adjusted on a periodic basis in light of changing facts and circumstances considering the progress of ongoing tax audits, case law, and any new legislation. The Company believes that the reserves established are adequate in relation to the potential for any additional tax assessments.

Purchase Price Allocation

Accounting for the acquisition of a business requires the allocation of the purchase price to the various assets and liabilities of the acquired business and recording deferred taxes for any differences between the allocated values and tax basis of assets and liabilities. Any excess of the purchase price over the amounts assigned to assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill.

The purchase price allocation is accomplished by recording each asset and liability at its estimated fair value. Estimated deferred taxes are based on available information concerning the tax basis of the acquired company’s assets and liabilities and tax-related carryforwards at the merger date, although such estimates may change in the future as additional information becomes known. The amount of goodwill recorded in any particular business combination can vary significantly depending upon the values attributed to assets acquired and liabilities assumed relative to the total acquisition cost.

In estimating the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, we made various assumptions. The most significant assumptions relate to the estimated fair values assigned to proved and unproved crude oil and natural gas properties. To estimate the fair values of these properties, we prepared estimates of crude oil and natural gas reserves as described above in “Reserve Estimates” of this Item 7. Estimated fair values assigned to assets acquired can have a significant effect on results of operations in the future.

Goodwill

As of

December 31, 2016

, the Company’s consolidated balance sheet included

$87 million

of goodwill, all of which has been assigned to the Egypt reporting unit. Goodwill is assessed at least annually for impairment at the reporting unit level. We conduct a qualitative goodwill impairment assessment as of July 1 of each year, and whenever impairment indicators arise, by examining relevant events and circumstances which could have a negative impact on our goodwill such as macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, cost factors that have a negative effect on earnings and cash flows, overall financial performance, acquisitions and divestitures, and other relevant entity-specific events.

The first step of the impairment test requires management to make estimates regarding the fair value of each reporting unit to which goodwill has been assigned. If it is necessary to determine the fair value of the reporting unit, we use a combination of the income approach and the market approach.

Under the income approach, the fair value of each reporting unit is estimated based on the present value of expected future cash flows. The income approach is dependent on a number of factors including estimates of forecasted revenue and operating costs, proved reserves, the success of future exploration for and development of unproved reserves, discount rates, and other variables. Negative revisions of estimated reserves quantities, increases in future cost estimates, divestiture of a significant component of the reporting unit, or sustained decreases in crude oil or natural gas prices could lead to a reduction in expected future cash flows and possibly an impairment of all or a portion of goodwill in future periods.

Key assumptions used in the discounted cash flow model described above include estimated quantities of crude oil and natural gas reserves, including both proved reserves and risk-adjusted unproved reserves; estimates of market prices considering forward commodity price curves as of the measurement date; and estimates of operating, administrative, and capital costs adjusted for inflation. We discount the resulting future cash flows using discount rates similar to those used by the Company in the valuation of acquisitions and divestitures.


To assess the reasonableness of our fair value estimate, we use a market approach to compare the fair value to similar businesses whose securities are actively traded in the public market. This requires management to make certain judgments about the selection of comparable companies, recent comparable asset transactions, and transaction premiums. Associated market multiples are applied to various financial metrics of the reporting unit to estimate fair value.

Although we base the fair value estimate of each reporting unit on assumptions we believe to be reasonable, those assumptions are inherently unpredictable and uncertain, and actual results could differ from the estimate. In the event of a prolonged global recession, commodity prices may stay depressed or decline further, thereby causing the fair value of the reporting unit to decline, which could result in an impairment of goodwill.

ITEM 7A.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

The primary objective of the following information is to provide forward-looking quantitative and qualitative information about our exposure to market risk. The term market risk relates to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in oil, gas, and NGL prices, interest rates, or foreign currency and adverse governmental actions. The disclosures are not meant to be precise indicators of expected future losses, but rather indicators of reasonably possible losses. The forward-looking information provides indicators of how we view and manage our ongoing market risk exposures.

Commodity Risk

The Company’s revenues, earnings, cash flow, capital investments and, ultimately, future rate of growth are highly dependent on the prices we receive for our crude oil, natural gas and NGLs, which have historically been very volatile because of unpredictable events such as economic growth or retraction, weather and political climate. In


, our average crude oil realizations decreased to

$41.63

per barrel compared to

$48.31

per barrel in

. Based on average daily production for 2016, a $1.00 per barrel change in the weighted average realized oil price would have increased or decreased revenues for the year by approximately $101 million, and a $0.10 per Mcf change in the weighted average realized price of natural gas would have increased or decreased revenues for the year by approximately $40 million.

We periodically enter into derivative positions on a portion of our projected oil and natural gas production through a variety of financial and physical arrangements intended to manage fluctuations in cash flows resulting from changes in commodity prices. Apache typically uses futures contracts, swaps, and options to mitigate commodity price risk. During


and


, the Company did not have any derivative positions.

Subsequent to December 31, 2016, the Company entered into put option derivative contracts not designated as cash flow hedges for 2017 crude oil production of

175,000

barrels per day. These contracts will be settled against either NYMEX WTI or Dated Brent between July 1, 2017 and December 31, 2017, with a weighted average strike price of

$50.47

per barrel. Apache paid a total premium of

$100 million

for these contracts, averaging

$3.09

per barrel.

See Note 5—Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part IV, Item 15 of this Form 10-K.

Foreign Currency Risk

The Company’s cash flow stream relating to certain international operations is based on the U.S. dollar equivalent of cash flows measured in foreign currencies. In Canada, oil and gas prices and costs, such as equipment rentals and services, are generally denominated in Canadian dollars but are heavily influenced by U.S. markets. Our North Sea production is sold under U.S. dollar contracts, and the majority of costs incurred are paid in British pounds. In Egypt, substantially all oil and gas production is sold under U.S. dollar contracts, and the majority of the costs incurred are denominated in U.S. dollars. Revenue and disbursement transactions denominated in Canadian dollars and British pounds are converted to U.S. dollar equivalents based on the average exchange rates during the period.

Foreign currency gains and losses also arise when monetary assets and monetary liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the end of each month. Currency gains and losses are included as either a component of “Other” under “Revenues and Other” or, as is the case when we re-measure our foreign tax liabilities, as a component of the Company’s provision for income tax expense on the statement of consolidated operations. A 10 percent strengthening or weakening of the Canadian dollar and British pound against the U.S. dollar as of

December 31, 2016

, would result in a foreign currency net loss or gain, respectively, of approximately $99 million.

REPORT OF MANAGEMENT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

Management of the Company is responsible for the preparation and integrity of the consolidated financial statements appearing in this annual report on Form 10-K. The financial statements were prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and include amounts that are based on management’s best estimates and judgments.

Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. Our internal control over financial reporting is supported by a program of internal audits and appropriate reviews by management, written policies and guidelines, careful selection and training of qualified personnel and a written code of business conduct adopted by our Company’s board of directors, applicable to all Company directors and all officers and employees of our Company and subsidiaries.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements and even when determined to be effective, can only provide reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013).

Based on our assessment, management believes that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016.

The Company’s independent auditors, Ernst & Young LLP, a registered public accounting firm, are appointed by the Audit Committee of the Company’s board of directors. Ernst & Young LLP have audited and reported on the consolidated financial statements of Apache Corporation and subsidiaries and the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. The reports of the independent auditors follow this report on pages F-2 and F-3.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Apache Corporation:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Apache Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the related statements of consolidated operations, comprehensive income (loss), cash flows, and changes in equity for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2016. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Apache Corporation and subsidiaries at December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2016, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has elected to change its method of accounting for oil and gas exploration and development activities from the full-cost method of accounting to the successful-efforts method of accounting in 2016.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Apache Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016, based on criteria established in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated

February 24, 2017

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Apache Corporation:

We have audited Apache Corporation and subsidiaries’ internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016, based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). Apache Corporation and subsidiaries’ management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Report of Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Apache Corporation and subsidiaries maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheet of Apache Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the related statements of consolidated operations, comprehensive income (loss), cash flows, and changes in equity for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2016 of Apache Corporation and subsidiaries, and our report dated

APACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Nature of Operations

Apache Corporation (Apache or the Company) is an independent energy company that explores for, develops, and produces natural gas, crude oil, and natural gas liquids. The Company has exploration and production interests in

four

geographic areas: the United States (U.S.), Canada, Egypt, and the United Kingdom (U.K.) North Sea (North Sea). Apache also has exploration interests in Suriname that may, over time, result in a reportable discovery and development opportunity.

1.   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Accounting policies used by Apache and its subsidiaries reflect industry practices and conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (GAAP). The Company’s financial statements for prior periods include reclassifications that were made to conform to the current-year presentation. During the second quarter of 2015, Apache completed the sale of its Australian LNG business and oil and gas assets. In March 2014, Apache completed the sale of all of its operations in Argentina. Results of operations and cash flows for the divested Australia assets and Argentina operations are reflected as discontinued operations in the Company’s financial statements for all periods presented. Significant policies are discussed below.

Recast Financial Information for Change in Accounting Principle

In the second quarter of 2016, Apache voluntarily changed its method of accounting for its oil and gas exploration and development activities from the full cost method to the successful efforts method of accounting. The financial information for prior periods has been recast to reflect retrospective application of the successful efforts method, as prescribed by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 932 “Extractive Activities—Oil and Gas.” Although the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas exploration and development activities continues to be an accepted alternative, the successful efforts method of accounting is the generally preferred method of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and is more widely used in the industry such that the change improves comparability of the Company’s financial statements to its peers. The Company believes the successful efforts method provides a more representational depiction of assets and operating results. The successful efforts method also provides for the Company’s investments in oil and gas properties to be assessed for impairment in accordance with ASC 360 “Property, Plant, and Equipment” rather than valuations based on prices and costs prescribed under the full cost method as of the balance sheet date. For more detailed information regarding the effects of the change to the successful efforts method, please refer to Note 2—Change in Accounting Principle. The Company has recast certain historical information for the years ended 2015 and 2014, including the Statement of Consolidated Operations, Statement of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss), Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows, Consolidated Balance Sheet, Statement of Consolidated Changes in Equity, and related information in Notes 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, and 18.

In addition, in the first quarter of 2016, the Company retrospectively adopted a new accounting standard update for all periods presented which requires debt issuance costs to be presented as a direct deduction from the carrying value of the associated debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. For more information regarding this update, please refer to Note 8—Debt and Financing Costs.

Principles of Consolidation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Apache and its subsidiaries after elimination of intercompany balances and transactions. The Company’s undivided interests in oil and gas exploration and production ventures and partnerships are proportionately consolidated. The Company consolidates all other investments in which, either through direct or indirect ownership, Apache has more than a

50 percent

voting interest or controls the financial and operating decisions. Noncontrolling interests represent third-party ownership in the net assets of a consolidated Apache subsidiary and are reflected separately in the Company’s financial statements. Sinopec International Petroleum Exploration and Production Corporation (Sinopec) owns a one-third minority participation in Apache’s Egypt oil and gas business as a noncontrolling interest, which is reflected as a separate component of equity in Apache’s consolidated balance sheet. Investments in which Apache holds less than

50 percent

of the voting interest are typically accounted for under the equity method of accounting, with the balance recorded as a component of “Deferred charges and other” in Apache’s consolidated balance sheet and results of operations recorded as a component of “Other” under “Revenues and Other” in the Company’s statement of consolidated operations.

APACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)

Use of Estimates

Preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Apache evaluates its estimates and assumptions on a regular basis. Actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions used in preparation of its financial statements and changes in these estimates are recorded when known. Significant estimates with regard to these financial statements include the fair value determination of acquired assets and liabilities and assets held for sale at year-end (see Note 3—Acquisitions and Divestitures), the estimate of proved oil and gas reserves and related present value estimates of future net cash flows therefrom (see Note 16—Supplemental Oil and Gas Disclosures), the assessment of asset retirement obligations (see Note 7—Asset Retirement Obligation), the estimates of fair value for long-lived assets and goodwill (see “Fair Value Measurements,” “Property and Equipment,” and “Goodwill” sections in this Note 1 below), and the estimate of income taxes (see Note 9—Income Taxes).

Fair Value Measurements

Certain assets and liabilities are reported at fair value on a recurring basis in Apache’s consolidated balance sheet. ASC 820-10-35 provides a hierarchy that prioritizes and defines the types of inputs used to measure fair value. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to Level 1 inputs, which consist of unadjusted quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets. Level 2 inputs consist of quoted prices for similar instruments. Level 3 valuations are derived from inputs that are significant and unobservable; hence, these valuations have the lowest priority.

The valuation techniques that may be used to measure fair value include a market approach, an income approach, and a cost approach. A market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities. An income approach uses valuation techniques to convert future amounts to a single present amount based on current market expectations, including present value techniques, option-pricing models, and the excess earnings method. The cost approach is based on the amount that currently would be required to replace the service capacity of an asset (replacement cost).

Recurring fair value measurements are presented in further detail in Note 8—Debt and Note 11—Retirement and Deferred Compensation Plans.

Apache also uses fair value measurements on a nonrecurring basis when certain qualitative assessments of its assets indicate a potential impairment. For the year ended

December 31, 2016

, the Company recorded asset impairments totaling

$1.1 billion

in connection with fair value assessments in the current low commodity price environment. Impairments totaling

$427 million

and

$135 million

were recorded for proved properties and gathering, transmission, and processing (GTP) facilities, respectively, which were written down to their fair values. These impairments are discussed in further detail below in “Property and Equipment.” Also in 2016, the Company recorded

$486 million

for a U.K. Petroleum Revenue Tax (PRT) decommissioning asset that is no longer expected to be realizable from future abandonment activities in the North Sea and

$55 million

for inventory write-downs.

In 2016, the U.K. government enacted Finance Bill 2016, providing tax relief to exploration and production (E&P) companies operating in the U.K. North Sea. Under the enacted legislation, the U.K. PRT rate was reduced to

zero

from the previously enacted

35 percent

rate in effect from January 1, 2016. PRT expense ceased prospectively from that date. As a further result of this change, the Company reduced the recoverable PRT decommissioning asset that would have been realized from future abandonment activities by

$486 million

(

$292 million

net of tax). This recoverable PRT decommissioning asset had an aggregate remaining value of

$8 million

as of December 31, 2016, which is recorded in “Deferred charges and other” on the consolidated balance sheet. The recoverable value of the PRT decommissioning asset was estimated using the income approach. The expected future cash flows used in the determination were based on anticipated spending and timing of planned future abandonment activities for applicable fields, considering all available information at the date of review. Apache has classified this fair value measurement as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.

For the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company recorded asset impairments totaling

$9.5 billion

in connection with fair value assessments. Impairments totaling

$7.4 billion

and

$1.7 billion

were recorded for proved properties and GTP facilities, respectively, which were written down to their fair values. These impairments are discussed in further detail below in “Property and Equipment.” Also in 2015, the Company recorded

$163 million

for the impairment of goodwill,

$148 million

for the impairment of an equity method investment sold in the fourth quarter, and

$55 million

for inventory write-downs. For a discussion of the equity method investment impairment, see Note 3—Acquisitions and Divestitures.

F-10

APACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)

For the year ended December 31, 2014, the Company recorded asset impairments totaling

$7.1 billion

in connection with fair value assessments, including

$6.1 billion

for proved properties,

$347 million

for the impairment of goodwill,

$655 million

for the impairment of assets held for sale, and

$32 million

for inventory write-downs. The Company also recorded

$833 million

in impairments related to the sale of the Company’s Australian assets and an additional

$271 million

in impairment of proved properties and inventory in Australia. These impairments are classified as discontinued operations in 2014. For discussion of these impairments, see “Property and Equipment” and “Goodwill” below and Note 3—Acquisitions and Divestitures.

Cash Equivalents

The Company considers all highly liquid short-term investments with a maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents. These investments are carried at cost, which approximates fair value. As of

December 31, 2016

and


, Apache had

$1.4 billion

and

$1.5 billion

, respectively, of cash and cash equivalents.

Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

Accounts receivable are stated at the historical carrying amount net of write-offs and an allowance for doubtful accounts. The carrying amount of Apache’s accounts receivable approximates fair value because of the short-term nature of the instruments. The Company routinely assesses the collectability of all material trade and other receivables. Many of Apache’s receivables are from joint interest owners on properties Apache operates. The Company may have the ability to withhold future revenue disbursements to recover any non-payment of these joint interest billings. The Company accrues a reserve on a receivable when, based on the judgment of management, it is probable that a receivable will not be collected and the amount of any reserve may be reasonably estimated. As of

December 31, 2016

,


, and


, the Company had an allowance for doubtful accounts of

$93 million

,

$103 million

, and

$98 million

, respectively.

The following table describes changes to the Company’s allowance for doubtful accounts for


,


, and


:

Inventories

Inventories consist principally of tubular goods and equipment, stated at weighted-average cost, and oil produced but not sold, stated at the lower of cost or market.

Property and Equipment

The carrying value of Apache’s property and equipment represents the cost incurred to acquire the property and equipment, including capitalized interest, net of any impairments. For business combinations, property and equipment cost is based on the fair values at the acquisition date.

Oil and Gas Property

The Company follows the successful efforts method of accounting for its oil and gas property. Under this method of accounting, exploration costs such as exploratory geological and geophysical costs, delay rentals, and exploration overhead are expensed as incurred. All costs related to production, general corporate overhead, and similar activities are expensed as incurred. If an exploratory well provides evidence to justify potential development of reserves, drilling costs associated with the well are initially capitalized, or suspended, pending a determination as to whether a commercially sufficient quantity of proved reserves can be attributed to the area as a result of drilling. This determination may take longer than one year in certain areas depending on, among other things, the amount of hydrocarbons discovered, the outcome of planned geological and engineering studies, the need for additional appraisal drilling activities to determine whether the discovery is sufficient to support an economic development plan, and government sanctioning of development activities in certain international locations. At the end of each quarter, management reviews the status of all suspended exploratory well costs in light of ongoing exploration activities; in particular, whether the Company is making sufficient progress in its ongoing exploration and appraisal efforts or, in the case of discoveries requiring government sanctioning, whether development negotiations are underway and proceeding as planned. If management determines that future appraisal drilling or development activities are unlikely to occur, associated suspended exploratory well costs are expensed.

APACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)

Acquisition costs of unproved properties are assessed for impairment at least annually and are transferred to proved oil and gas properties to the extent the costs are associated with successful exploration activities. Significant undeveloped leases are assessed individually for impairment based on the Company’s current exploration plans. Unproved oil and gas properties with individually insignificant lease acquisition costs are amortized on a group basis over the average lease term at rates that provide for full amortization of unsuccessful leases upon lease expiration or abandonment. Costs of expired or abandoned leases are charged to exploration expense, while costs of productive leases are transferred to proved oil and gas properties. Costs of maintaining and retaining unproved properties, as well as amortization of individually insignificant leases and impairment of unsuccessful leases, are included in exploration costs in the statement of consolidated operations.

Costs to develop proved reserves, including the costs of all development wells and related equipment used in the production of crude oil and natural gas, are capitalized. Depreciation of the cost of proved oil and gas properties is calculated using the unit-of-production (UOP) method. The UOP calculation multiplies the percentage of estimated proved reserves produced each quarter by the carrying value of those reserves. The reserve base used to calculate depreciation for leasehold acquisition costs and the cost to acquire proved properties is the sum of proved developed reserves and proved undeveloped reserves. With respect to lease and well equipment costs, which include development costs and successful exploration drilling costs, the reserve base includes only proved developed reserves. Estimated future dismantlement, restoration and abandonment costs, net of salvage values, are included in the depreciable cost.

Oil and gas properties are grouped for depreciation in accordance with ASC 932 “Extractive Activities - Oil and Gas.” The basis for grouping is a reasonable aggregation of properties with a common geological structural feature or stratigraphic condition, such as a reservoir or field.

When circumstances indicate that proved oil and gas properties may be impaired, the Company compares unamortized capitalized costs to the expected undiscounted pre-tax future cash flows for the associated assets grouped at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are independent of cash flows of other assets. If the expected undiscounted pre-tax future cash flows, based on Apache’s estimate of future crude oil and natural gas prices, operating costs, anticipated production from proved reserves and other relevant data, are lower than the unamortized capitalized cost, the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value. Fair value is generally estimated using the income approach described in the ASC 820 “Fair Value Measurement.” If applicable, the Company utilizes accepted bids as the basis for determining fair value. The expected future cash flows used for impairment reviews and related fair value calculations are typically based on judgmental assessments of future production volumes, commodity prices, operating costs, and capital investment plans, considering all available information at the date of review. These assumptions are applied to develop future cash flow projections that are then discounted to estimated fair value, using a discount rate believed to be consistent with those applied by market participants. Apache has classified these fair value measurements as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.

The following table represents non-cash impairments of the carrying value of the Company’s proved and unproved property and equipment for

Gathering, Transmission, and Processing Facilities

GTP facilities totaled

$976 million

and

$1.1 billion

at

December 31, 2016

and


, respectively, with accumulated depreciation for these assets totaling

$130 million

and

$160 million

for the respective periods. GTP facilities are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The estimation of useful life takes into consideration anticipated production lives from the fields serviced by the GTP assets, whether Apache-operated or third party, as well as potential development plans by Apache for undeveloped acreage within or in close proximity to those fields.

The Company assesses the carrying amount of its GTP facilities whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. If the carrying amount of these facilities is more than the sum of the undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss is recognized for the excess of the carrying value over its fair value. During 2016, the Company recorded impairments of

$135 million

on certain GTP assets in the North Sea, which were written down to their fair values of

$142 million

. The fair values of the impaired assets were determined using a combination of the income approach and the market approach. The income approach considers internal estimates of future throughput volumes, processing rates, and costs. These assumptions were applied to develop future cash flow projections that were then discounted to estimated fair value, using a discount rate believed to be consistent with those applied by market participants. Apache has classified these non-recurring fair value measurements as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. During 2015, the Company recorded impairments of

$1.7 billion

on certain GTP assets, including

$1.1 billion

in Egypt,

$555 million

in Canada, and

$103 million

in the U.S., which were written down to their fair values of

$306 million

in aggregate. During 2014, the Company recorded impairments of

$1.1 billion

of its GTP assets related to the sale of Apache’s Wheatstone and Kitimat LNG projects, and the remaining carrying value of those assets was reclassified to “Assets held for sale” on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2014. The

$430 million

impairment of GTP assets related to Apache's Wheatstone LNG project is reflected in discontinued operations in the Company's statement of consolidated operations.

The costs of GTP facilities retired or otherwise disposed of and associated accumulated depreciation are removed from Apache’s consolidated financial statements, and the resulting gain or loss is reflected in “Gain (loss) on divestitures” under “Revenues and Other” in the Company’s statement of consolidated operations. No gain or loss on the sales of GTP facilities was recognized during 2016. During 2015, Apache recorded a gain on the sale of GTP facilities totaling

$59 million

associated with the Company’s divestitures of certain Permian Basin assets. During 2014, the Company recorded a loss totaling

$180 million

associated with divestitures of certain Anadarko basin and southern Louisiana assets.

Other Property and Equipment

Other property and equipment includes computer software and equipment, buildings, vehicles, furniture and fixtures, land, and other equipment. These assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from


to


years. Accumulated depreciation for these assets totaled

$780 million

and

$693 million

at

December 31, 2016

and


, respectively.

Asset Retirement Costs and Obligations

The initial estimated asset retirement obligation related to property and equipment is recorded as a liability at its fair value, with an offsetting asset retirement cost recorded as an increase to the associated property and equipment on the consolidated balance sheet. Revisions in estimated liabilities can result from changes in estimated inflation rates, changes in service and equipment costs and changes in the estimated timing of an asset’s retirement. Asset retirement costs are depreciated using a systematic and rational method similar to that used for the associated property and equipment. Accretion expense on the liability is recognized over the estimated productive life of the related assets.

Capitalized

Interest

For significant projects, interest is capitalized as part of the historical cost of developing and constructing assets. Significant oil and gas investments in unproved properties actively being explored, significant exploration and development projects that have not commenced production, significant midstream development activities that are in progress, and investments in equity method affiliates that are undergoing the construction of assets that have not commenced principal operations qualify for interest capitalization. Interest is capitalized until the asset is ready for service. Capitalized interest is determined by multiplying the Company’s weighted-average borrowing cost on debt by the average amount of qualifying costs incurred. Once an asset subject to interest capitalization is completed and placed in service, the associated capitalized interest is expensed through depreciation or impairment.

Goodwill

Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of an entity over the estimated fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, and it is recorded in “Deferred charges and other” in the Company's consolidated balance sheet. The Company assesses the carrying amount of goodwill by testing for impairment annually and when impairment indicators arise. The impairment test requires allocating goodwill and all other assets and liabilities to assigned reporting units. As of

December 31, 2016

, Apache assesses each country as a reporting unit. The fair value of each unit is determined and compared to the book value of the reporting unit. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the book value, including goodwill, then goodwill is written down to the implied fair value of the goodwill through a charge to expense.

In order to determine the fair value of each reporting unit, the Company uses a combination of the income approach and the market approach. The income approach considers management views on current operating measures as well as assumptions pertaining to market forces in the oil and gas industry, such as future production, future commodity prices, and costs. These assumptions are applied to develop future cash flow projections that are then discounted to estimate fair value, using a discount rate similar to those used by the Company in the valuation of acquisitions and divestitures. To assess the reasonableness of its fair value estimate, the Company uses a market approach to compare the fair value to similar businesses whose securities are actively traded in the public market. This requires management to make certain judgments about the selection of comparable companies, recent comparable asset transactions, and transaction premiums. Associated market multiples are applied to various financial metrics of the reporting unit to estimate fair value. Apache has classified this reporting unit estimation as a non-recurring Level 3 fair value measurement.

When there is a disposal of a reporting unit or a portion of a reporting unit that constitutes a business, goodwill associated with that business is included in the carrying amount to determine the gain or loss on disposal. The amount of goodwill allocated to the carrying amount of a business can significantly impact the amount of gain or loss recognized on the sale of that business. The amount of goodwill to be included in that carrying amount is based on the relative fair value of the business to be disposed of and the portion of the reporting unit that will be retained.

The following presents the changes to goodwill for the years ended


,


, and


:

Reductions in estimated net present value of expected future cash flows from oil and gas properties resulted in implied fair values below the carrying values of Apache’s U.S., North Sea, and Canada reporting units. These goodwill impairments have been recorded in “Impairments” in the Company’s statement of consolidated operations.

Accounts Payable

Included in accounts payable at

December 31, 2016

and


, are liabilities of approximately

$86 million

and

$129 million

, respectively, representing the amount by which checks issued but not presented to the Company’s banks for collection exceeded balances in applicable bank accounts.

Commitments and Contingencies

Accruals for loss contingencies arising from claims, assessments, litigation, environmental and other sources are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. These accruals are adjusted as additional information becomes available or circumstances change.

Revenue Recognition and Imbalances

Oil and gas revenues are recognized when production is sold to a purchaser at a fixed or determinable price, when delivery has occurred and title has transferred, and if collectability of the revenue is probable. Cash received relating to future revenues is deferred and recognized when all revenue recognition criteria are met.

Apache uses the sales method of accounting for gas production imbalances. The volumes of gas sold may differ from the volumes to which Apache is entitled based on its interests in the properties. These differences create imbalances that are recognized as a liability only when the properties’ estimated remaining reserves net to Apache will not be sufficient to enable the under-produced owner to recoup its entitled share through production. The Company’s recorded liability is generally reflected in other non-current liabilities. No receivables are recorded for those wells where Apache has taken less than its share of production. Gas imbalances are reflected as adjustments to estimates of proved gas reserves and future cash flows in the unaudited supplemental oil and gas disclosures.

Apache markets its own North American natural gas production. Since the Company’s production fluctuates because of operational issues, it is occasionally necessary to purchase third-party oil and gas to fulfill sales obligations and commitments. The costs of third-party oil and gas purchases totaled

$159 million

,

$105 million

, and

$70 million

, for 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively, which offset the related sales proceeds recorded as “Other” under “Revenues and Other” in the statement of consolidated operations.

The Company’s Egyptian operations are conducted pursuant to production sharing contracts under which contractor partners pay all operating and capital costs for exploring and developing the concessions. A percentage of the production, generally up to

40 percent

, is available to contractor partners to recover these operating and capital costs over contractually defined periods. Cost recovery is reflected in revenue. The balance of the production is split among the contractor partners and the Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation (EGPC) on a contractually defined basis.

Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

Apache periodically enters into derivative contracts to manage its exposure to commodity price risk. These derivative contracts, which are generally placed with major financial institutions, may take the form of forward contracts, futures contracts, swaps, or options. The oil and gas reference prices upon which the commodity derivative contracts are based reflect various market indices that have a high degree of historical correlation with actual prices received by the Company for its oil and gas production. As of

December 31, 2016

, Apache had no open derivative positions.

When applicable, Apache records all derivative instruments, other than those that meet the normal purchases and sales exception, on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at fair value. Changes in fair value are recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met. Gains and losses from the change in fair value of derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are reported in current-period income as “Other” under “Revenues and Other” in the statement of consolidated operations. Hedge accounting treatment allows unrealized gains and losses on cash flow hedges to be deferred in other comprehensive income. Realized gains and losses from the Company’s 2014 oil and gas cash flow hedges, including terminated contracts, were recognized in oil and gas production revenues when the forecasted transaction occurred. For more information, please refer to Note 5—Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.

Income Taxes

Apache records deferred tax assets and liabilities to account for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the financial statements and tax returns. The Company routinely assesses the ability to realize its deferred tax assets. If the Company concludes that it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized, the tax asset is reduced by a valuation allowance. Numerous judgments and assumptions are inherent in the determination of future taxable income, including factors such as future operating conditions (particularly as related to prevailing oil and gas prices) and changing tax laws.

Apache does not record U.S. deferred income taxes on foreign subsidiaries that are deemed to be permanently reinvested. When such earnings are no longer deemed permanently reinvested, Apache will recognize the appropriate U.S. current or deferred income tax liabilities. For more information, please refer to Note 9—Income Taxes.

Foreign Currency Transaction Gains and Losses

The U.S. dollar is the functional currency for each of Apache’s international operations. The functional currency is determined country-by-country based on relevant facts and circumstances of the cash flows, commodity pricing environment and financing arrangements in each country. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses arise when monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are remeasured to their U.S. dollar equivalent at the exchange rate in effect at the end of each reporting period. Foreign currency gains and losses also arise when revenue and disbursement transactions denominated in a country’s local currency are converted to a U.S. dollar equivalent based on the average exchange rates during the reporting period.

Foreign currency transaction gains and losses related to current taxes payable and deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded as components of the provision for income taxes. For further discussion, please refer to Note 9—Income Taxes. All other foreign currency transaction gains and losses are reflected in “Other” under “Revenues and Other” in the statement of consolidated operations. The Company’s other foreign currency gains and losses netted to a loss in 2016 of

$25 million

, a loss in 2015 of

$11 million

, and a gain in 2014 of

$8 million

.

Insurance Coverage

The Company recognizes an insurance receivable when collection of the receivable is deemed probable. Any recognition of an insurance receivable is recorded by crediting and offsetting the original charge. Any differential arising between insurance recoveries and insurance receivables is recorded as a capitalized cost or as an expense, consistent with its original treatment.

Earnings Per Share

The Company’s basic earnings per share (EPS) amounts have been computed based on the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS reflects potential dilution, using the treasury stock method, which assumes that options were exercised and restricted stock was fully vested.

Stock-Based Compensation

The Company accounts for stock-based compensation under the fair value recognition provisions of ASC Topic 718, “Compensation—Stock Compensation.” The Company grants various types of stock-based awards including stock options, nonvested restricted stock units, and performance-based awards. Additionally, the Company also grants cash-based stock appreciation rights. These plans and related accounting policies are defined and described more fully in Note 12—Capital Stock. Stock compensation awards granted are valued on the date of grant and are expensed, net of estimated forfeitures, over the required service period.

ASC Topic 718 also requires that benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost be reported as financing cash flows rather than as operating cash flows. The Company classified

$2 million

,

$1 million

, and

$35,000

as financing cash inflows in


,


, and

Treasury Stock

The Company follows the weighted-average-cost method of accounting for treasury stock transactions.

New Pronouncements Issued But Not Yet Adopted

In January 2017, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2017-04, “Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment.” ASU 2017-04 seeks to simplify the accounting for goodwill by eliminating the second step in the goodwill impairment test which requires an entity to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill. Under the new guidance, an entity will recognize an impairment loss if the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, with the impairment loss not to exceed the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. This update will be applied prospectively and is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests conducted in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted for annual and interim goodwill impairment testing dates after January 1, 2017. The Company plans to early adopt this ASU, and does not expect the adoption to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.

APACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)

In August 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230).  ASU 2016-15 seeks to reduce the existing diversity in practice in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. This update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the provisions of ASU 2016-15 and assessing the impact, if any, it may have on its statement of consolidated cash flows.

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, “Financial Instruments - Credit Losses.”  The standard changes the impairment model for most financial assets and certain other instruments, including trade and other receivables, held-to-maturity debt securities and loans, and requires entities to use a new forward-looking expected loss model that will result in the earlier recognition of allowance for losses. This update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted for a fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within that fiscal year.  The Company does not expect to adopt the guidance early. Entities will apply the standard’s provisions as a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is adopted. The Company is evaluating the new guidance and does not believe this standard will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, which seeks to simplify accounting for share-based payment transactions including income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and the classification on the statement of cash flows. The new standard requires the Company to recognize the income tax effects of awards in the income statement when the awards vest or are settled. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016. The Company has evaluated the new guidance and recorded a cumulative-effect adjustment of

$11 million

as of January 1, 2017 representing an increase in accumulated deficit with the offset to paid-in capital to reflect actual forfeitures versus the previously-estimated forfeiture rate.

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, a new lease standard requiring lessees to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities for most leases classified as operating leases under previous U.S. GAAP. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. The Company will be required to use a modified retrospective approach for leases that exist or are entered into after the beginning of the earliest comparative period in the financial statements. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this standard on its consolidated financial statements.

In May 2014, the FASB and the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) issued a joint revenue recognition standard, ASU 2014-09. The new standard removes inconsistencies in existing standards, changes the way companies recognize revenue from contracts with customers, and increases disclosure requirements. The codification was amended through additional ASUs and, as amended, requires companies to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in amounts that reflect the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The standard is required to be adopted using either the full retrospective approach, with all prior periods presented adjusted, or the modified retrospective approach, with a cumulative adjustment to retained earnings on the opening balance sheet. The Company will adopt the new standard utilizing the modified retrospective approach. Upon preliminary evaluation, the Company does not expect the adoption of this ASU to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. The Company is continuing to evaluate the disclosure requirements of this ASU and does not plan on early adopting the standard.

2.   CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLE

During the second quarter of 2016, the Company voluntarily changed its method of accounting for oil and gas exploration and development activities from the full cost method to the successful efforts method. Accordingly, financial information for prior periods has been recast to reflect retrospective application of the successful efforts method. In general, under successful efforts, exploration expenditures such as exploratory dry holes, exploratory geological and geophysical costs, delay rentals, unproved impairments, and exploration overhead are charged against earnings as incurred, versus being capitalized under the full cost method of accounting. Successful efforts also provides for the assessment of potential property impairments under ASC 360 by comparing the net carrying value of oil and gas properties with associated projected undiscounted pre-tax future net cash flows. If the expected undiscounted pre-tax future net cash flows are lower than the unamortized capitalized costs, the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value. Under the full cost method of accounting, a write-down would be required if the net carrying value of oil and gas properties exceeds a full cost “ceiling,” using an unweighted arithmetic average of commodity prices in effect on the first day of each of the previous 12 months. In addition, gains or losses, if applicable, are generally recognized on the dispositions of oil and gas property and equipment under the successful efforts method, as opposed to an adjustment to the net carrying value of the remaining assets under the full cost method. Apache’s consolidated financial statements have been recast to reflect these differences.

The following tables present the effects of the change to the successful efforts method in the statement of consolidated operations:

The following summarizes a further aging by geographic area of those exploratory well costs that have been capitalized for a period greater than one year since the completion of drilling at

December 31, 2016

:

Projects with suspended exploratory well costs capitalized for a period greater than one year since the completion of drilling are those identified by management as exhibiting sufficient quantities of hydrocarbons to justify potential development.  Management is actively pursuing efforts to assess whether reserves can be attributed to these projects.

Suspended exploratory well costs capitalized for a period greater than one year since the completion of drilling at December 31, 2016 primarily relate to the Seagull and Corona discoveries in the North Sea. In Seagull, appraisal work continues as the Company interprets the multi-azimuth 3-D survey acquired in late 2015. The survey will be used to create a development plan to be submitted to the Oil and Gas Authority in the U.K. in 2017. The suspended exploratory well costs related to the Corona discovery are pending development plan approval. In December 2016, the Company submitted the full field development plan to the Oil and Gas Authority in the U.K. Remaining activities required to classify the associated reserves as proved include approval of development plans and project sanctioning.

The remaining capitalized well costs in excess of one year relate to exploratory drilling in Suriname. The suspended exploratory well costs for the Block 53 Popokai well are pending the results of the Block 53 Kolibrie exploratory well. The Company plans to drill Kolibrie in 2017.

5.    DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES

Objectives and Strategies

The Company is exposed to fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas prices on the majority of its worldwide production. Apache manages the variability in its cash flows by occasionally entering into derivative transactions on a portion of its crude oil and natural gas production. When appropriate, the Company utilizes various types of derivative financial instruments, including swaps and options, to manage fluctuations in cash flows resulting from changes in commodity prices. As of

December 31, 2016

, Apache had no open commodity derivative positions.

Subsequent to December 31, 2016, the Company entered into put option derivative contracts not designated as cash flow hedges for 2017 crude oil production of

175,000

barrels per day. These contracts will be settled against either NYMEX WTI or Dated Brent between July 1, 2017 and December 31, 2017, with a weighted average strike price of

$50.47

per barrel. Apache paid a total premium of

$100 million

for these contracts, averaging

$3.09

per barrel.

Derivative Activity Recorded in the Statement of Consolidated Operations

The following table summarizes the effect of derivative instruments on the Company’s statement of consolidated operations:

Unrealized gains and losses for derivative activity recorded in the statement of consolidated operations is reflected in the statement of consolidated cash flows as a component of “Other” in “Adjustments to reconcile net income (loss) to net cash provided by operating activities.”

7.    ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATION

The following table describes changes to the Company’s asset retirement obligation (ARO) liability for the years ended

December 31, 2016

and


:

The ARO liability reflects the estimated present value of the amount of dismantlement, removal, site reclamation, and similar activities associated with Apache’s oil and gas properties. The Company utilizes current retirement costs to estimate the expected cash outflows for retirement obligations. The Company estimates the ultimate productive life of the properties, a risk-adjusted discount rate, and an inflation factor in order to determine the current present value of this obligation. To the extent future revisions to these assumptions impact the present value of the existing ARO liability, a corresponding adjustment is made to the oil and gas property balance.

Accretion expense for


includes discontinued operations of

$13 million

, which are included in “Net income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax” in the statement of consolidated operations.

During


and


, the Company recorded

$41 million

and

$68 million

, respectively, in abandonment liabilities resulting from Apache’s exploration and development capital program. Liabilities settled primarily relate to individual properties, platforms, and facilities plugged and abandoned during the period. Approximately

$233 million

of abandonment costs were revised  downward to reflect changes in estimates of timing and costs, primarily in the North Sea.

8.    DEBT

Overview

All of the Company’s debt is senior unsecured debt and has equal priority with respect to the payment of both principal and interest. The indentures for the notes described below place certain restrictions on the Company, including limits on Apache’s ability to incur debt secured by certain liens and its ability to enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions. Upon certain changes in control, all of these debt instruments would be subject to mandatory repurchase, at the option of the holders. None of the indentures for the notes contain prepayment obligations in the event of a decline in credit ratings.

In November 2016, the Company initiated a program to purchase in the open market up to

$250 million

in aggregate principal amount of senior notes issued under its indentures. In the fourth quarter of 2016, Apache purchased and canceled

$181 million

aggregate principal amount of its senior notes through open market repurchases for

$182 million

in cash, including accrued interest and

$0.5 million

of premium. These repurchases resulted in a

$1 million

net loss on extinguishment of debt, which is included in “Financing costs, net” in Apache's consolidated statement of operations. The net loss includes an acceleration of related discount and deferred financing costs.

In January 2017, Apache purchased and canceled an additional

$69 million

aggregate principal amount of senior notes for

$71 million

in cash, including accrued interest and

$1 million

of premium, which completed the open market repurchase program.

APACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)

In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03 “Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs,” which requires debt issuance costs to be presented as a direct deduction from the carrying value of the associated debt liability. The Company adopted this update in the first quarter of 2016 and applied the changes retrospectively for all periods presented. At December 31, 2015, the Company had debt issuance costs of

$61 million

classified as a long-term asset as a component of “Deferred charges and other” on the balance sheet that have been netted against “Long-term debt” in these financial statements. As of

December 31, 2016

, long-term debt is presented net of debt issuance costs of

$56 million

.

Fair Value

The Company’s debt is recorded at the carrying amount, net of unamortized discount and debt issuance costs, on its consolidated balance sheet. The carrying amount of the Company’s commercial paper and uncommitted credit facilities and overdraft lines approximate fair value because the interest rates are variable and reflective of market rates. Apache uses a market approach to determine the fair value of its fixed-rate debt using estimates provided by an independent investment financial data services firm (a Level 2 fair value measurement).

Money Market and Overdraft Lines of Credit

The Company has certain uncommitted money market and overdraft lines of credit that are used from time to time for working capital purposes. As of

December 31, 2016

and


, there was

no

outstanding balance on Apache’s lines of credit.

Unsecured Committed Bank Credit Facilities

In June 2015, the Company entered into a

five

-year revolving credit facility which matures in

June 2020

, subject to Apache’s

two

,

one

-year extension options. The facility provides for aggregate commitments of

$3.5 billion

(including a

$750 million

letter of credit subfacility), with rights to increase commitments up to an aggregate

$4.5 billion

. Proceeds from borrowings may be used for general corporate purposes. Apache’s available borrowing capacity under this facility supports its commercial paper program. In connection with entry into the

$3.5 billion

facility, Apache terminated

$5.3 billion

in commitments under existing credit facilities. As of

December 31, 2016

, there were no borrowings under this credit facility, leaving aggregate available borrowing capacity at

$3.5 billion

.

At the Company’s option, the interest rate per annum for borrowings under the 2015 facility is either a base rate, as defined, plus a margin or the London Inter-bank Offered Rate (LIBOR), plus a margin. The Company also pays quarterly a facility fee at per annum rate on total commitments. The margins and the facility fee vary based upon the Company’s senior long-term debt rating. At

December 31, 2016

, the base rate margin was

0.075 percent

, the LIBOR margin was

1.075 percent

, and the facility fee was

0.175 percent

.

The financial covenants of the 2015 credit facility require the Company to maintain an adjusted debt-to-capital ratio of not greater than

60 percent

at the end of any fiscal quarter. For purposes of this calculation, capital excludes the effects of non-cash write-downs, impairments, and related charges occurring after June 30, 2015.

The 2015 facility’s negative covenants restrict the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to create liens securing debt on its hydrocarbon-related assets, with exceptions for liens typically arising in the oil and gas industry, purchase money liens, liens on subsidiary assets located outside of the United States and Canada, and liens arising as a matter of law, such as tax and mechanics’ liens. The Company also may incur liens on assets if debt secured thereby does not exceed

5 percent

of the Company’s consolidated assets, or approximately

$1.1 billion

as of

December 31, 2016

. Negative covenants also restrict Apache’s ability to merge with another entity unless it is the surviving entity, dispose of substantially all of its assets, and guarantee debt of non-consolidated entities in excess of the stated threshold.

In February 2016, Apache entered into a

three

-year letter of credit facility providing

£900 million

in commitments, with options to increase commitments to

£1.075 billion

and extend the term by

one year

. The facility is available for letters of credit denominated in pounds sterling, U.S. Dollars, Canadian Dollars, and any other foreign currency consented to by an issuing bank. The facility also is available for loans in pounds sterling, U.S. Dollars, and Canadian Dollars to cash collateralize letters of credit or obligations to provide letters of credit, in each case, to the extent letters of credit are unavailable under the facility. The facility’s representations and warranties, covenants, and events of default are substantially similar to those in Apache’s 2015

$3.5 billion

revolving credit facility.

Commissions are payable on letters of credit outstanding under the 2016 facility at a per annum rate equal to a LIBOR margin.  Borrowings bear interest per annum at a base rate or LIBOR, plus a margin. A facility fee at a per annum rate on aggregate commitments also is payable.  Letter of credit commissions, the interest margin, and the facility fee vary depending on Apache’s senior unsecured long-term debt rating. At December 31, 2016, the LIBOR margin was

1.075 percent

, the base rate margin was

0.075 percent

, and the facility fee was

0.175 percent

.

The 2016 facility is available for the Company’s letter of credit needs, particularly those which may arise in respect of abandonment obligations assumed in various North Sea acquisitions.  As of December 31, 2016,

three

letters of credit aggregating approximately

£147.5 million

and no borrowings were outstanding under this facility.

There are no clauses in the 2015

$3.5 billion

or 2016

£900 million

credit facilities that permit the lenders to accelerate payments or refuse to lend based on unspecified material adverse changes. The agreements for these facilities do not have drawdown restrictions or prepayment obligations in the event of a decline in credit ratings. However, the agreements allow the lenders to accelerate payment maturity and terminate lending and issuance commitments for nonpayment and other breaches, and if the Company or any of its U.S. or Canadian subsidiaries defaults on other indebtedness in excess of the stated threshold, is insolvent, or has any unpaid, non-appealable judgment against it for payment of money in excess of the stated threshold. Lenders may also accelerate payment maturity and terminate lending and issuance commitments if the Company undergoes a specified change in control or any borrower has specified pension plan liabilities in excess of the stated threshold. The Company was in compliance with the terms of these credit facilities as of December 31, 2016.

Commercial Paper Program

The Company has available a

$3.5 billion

commercial paper program which generally enables Apache to borrow funds for up to


days at competitive interest rates. The commercial paper program is fully supported by available borrowing capacity under the Company’s 2015 committed credit facility. At

In 2014, Apache evaluated its permanent reinvestment position and determined that undistributed earnings from certain foreign subsidiaries located in Apache’s Australia, Egypt, and North Sea regions will no longer be permanently reinvested. As a result of this change in position, the Company recorded

$560 million

of U.S. deferred income tax expense on undistributed earnings that were previously considered permanently reinvested as a component of continuing operations. In addition, the Company recorded

$311 million

of U.S. deferred income tax expense on foreign earnings that were distributed to the U.S. in 2014. The Company’s Canadian subsidiaries do not currently have undistributed earnings.

The Company has recorded an increase in valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets, primarily driven by asset impairments. The Company has assessed the future potential to realize these deferred tax assets and has concluded that it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will not be realized based on current economic conditions and expectations for the future.

10.    COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

Legal Matters

Apache is party to various legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business, including litigation and governmental and regulatory controls. The Company has an accrued liability of approximately

$15 million

for all legal contingencies that are deemed to be probable of occurring and can be reasonably estimated. Apache’s estimates are based on information known about the matters and its experience in contesting, litigating, and settling similar matters. Although actual amounts could differ from management’s estimate, none of the actions are believed by management to involve future amounts that would be material to Apache’s financial position, results of operations, or liquidity after consideration of recorded accruals. For material matters that Apache believes an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible, the Company has disclosed the nature of the matter and a range of potential exposure, unless an estimate cannot be made at this time. It is management’s opinion that the loss for any other litigation matters and claims that are reasonably possible to occur will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.

Argentine Claims

On March 12, 2014, the Company and its subsidiaries completed the sale of all of the Company’s subsidiaries’ operations and properties in Argentina to YPF Sociedad Anonima (YPF). As part of that sale, YPF assumed responsibility for all of the past, present, and future litigation in Argentina involving Company subsidiaries, except that Company subsidiaries have agreed to indemnify YPF for certain environmental, tax, and royalty obligations capped at an aggregate of

$100 million

. The indemnity is subject to specific agreed conditions precedent, thresholds, contingencies, limitations, claim deadlines, loss sharing, and other terms and conditions. On April 11, 2014, YPF provided its first notice of claims pursuant to the indemnity. Company subsidiaries have not paid any amounts under the indemnity but will continue to review and consider claims presented by YPF. Further, Company subsidiaries retain the right to enforce certain Argentina-related indemnification obligations against Pioneer Natural Resources Company (Pioneer) in an amount up to

$67.5 million

pursuant to the terms and conditions of stock purchase agreements entered in 2006 between Company subsidiaries and subsidiaries of Pioneer.

Louisiana Restoration

Louisiana surface owners often file lawsuits or assert claims against oil and gas companies, including Apache, claiming that operators and working interest owners in the chain of title are liable for environmental damages on the leased premises, including damages measured by the cost of restoration of the leased premises to their original condition, regardless of the value of the underlying property. From time-to-time restoration lawsuits and claims are resolved by the Company for amounts that are not material to the Company, while new lawsuits and claims are asserted against the Company. With respect to each of the pending lawsuits and claims, the amount claimed is not currently determinable or is not material, except as noted. Further, the overall exposure related to these lawsuits and claims is not currently determinable. While an adverse judgment against Apache is possible, Apache intends to actively defend these lawsuits and claims.

On July 24, 2013, a lawsuit captioned

Board of Commissioners of the Southeast Louisiana Flood Protection Authority – East v. Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company et al.

, Case No. 2013-6911 was filed in the Civil District Court for the Parish of Orleans, State of Louisiana, in which plaintiff on behalf of itself and as the board governing the levee districts of Orleans, Lake Borgne Basin, and East Jefferson alleges that Louisiana coastal lands have been damaged as a result of oil and gas industry activity, including a network of canals for access and pipelines. Plaintiff seeks unspecified damages and injunctive relief in the form of abatement and restoration based on claims of negligence, strict liability, natural servitude of drain, public nuisance, private nuisance, and breach of contract – third party beneficiary. Apache has been indiscriminately named as one of many defendants in the lawsuit. In 2014 the Louisiana state government passed a law (SB 469) clarifying that only entities authorized under the Coastal Zone Management Act may bring litigation to assert claims arising out of the permitted activities. Plaintiff is not one of those authorized entities. On February 13, 2015, the federal court entered judgment in favor of defendants dismissing all of plaintiff’s claims with prejudice on various grounds, and plaintiff appealed the case to the 5

th

Circuit Court of Appeals. The appeal is still pending. The overall exposure related to this lawsuit is not currently determinable. While an adverse judgment against Apache might be possible, Apache intends to continue to vigorously oppose the claims, including by defending against plaintiff’s appeal of the federal court’s judgment.

Delaware completed its audit of the Company's accounts payable, payroll, and royalty payments, on which the Company expects an assessment of less than

$200,000

. However, Delaware suspended its audit before completing its examination of the Company’s accounts receivable, following the June 2016

Environmental Matters

The Company, as an owner or lessee and operator of oil and gas properties, is subject to various federal, provincial, state, local, and foreign country laws and regulations relating to discharge of materials into, and protection of, the environment. These laws and regulations may, among other things, impose liability on the lessee under an oil and gas lease for the cost of pollution clean-up resulting from operations and subject the lessee to liability for pollution damages. In some instances, the Company may be directed to suspend or cease operations in the affected area. We maintain insurance coverage, which we believe is customary in the industry, although we are not fully insured against all environmental risks.

Apache manages its exposure to environmental liabilities on properties to be acquired by identifying existing problems and assessing the potential liability. The Company also conducts periodic reviews, on a Company-wide basis, to identify changes in its environmental risk profile. These reviews evaluate whether there is a probable liability, the amount, and the likelihood that the liability will be incurred. The amount of any potential liability is determined by considering, among other matters, incremental direct costs of any likely remediation and the proportionate cost of employees who are expected to devote a significant amount of time directly to any possible remediation effort. As it relates to evaluations of purchased properties, depending on the extent of an identified environmental problem, the Company may exclude a property from the acquisition, require the seller to remediate the property to Apache’s satisfaction, or agree to assume liability for the remediation of the property. The Company’s general policy is to limit any reserve additions to any incidents or sites that are considered probable to result in an expected remediation cost exceeding

$300,000

. Any environmental costs and liabilities that are not reserved for are treated as an expense when actually incurred. In Apache’s estimation, neither these expenses nor expenses related to training and compliance programs are likely to have a material impact on its financial condition.

As of

December 31, 2016

, the Company had an undiscounted reserve for environmental remediation of approximately

$51 million

. Apache is not aware of any environmental claims existing as of

December 31, 2016

that have not been provided for or would otherwise have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations. There can be no assurance however, that current regulatory requirements will not change or past non-compliance with environmental laws will not be discovered on the Company’s properties.

Apache Canada Ltd. (ACL) reported a produced water release from a water injection pipeline in a remote area of the Belloy Field that occurred on or about May 4, 2016, and an H2S leak at the Zama 10-33-115-06 on or about September 19, 2016. The causes of these incidents remain under investigation. With respect to previous releases of produced water that occurred in the Zama area on or between October 3 and October 25, 2013, and in the Belloy Field on or about January 20, 2014, the Company resolved all of the charges associated with these releases with the Crown.  The Company does not expect the economic impact of any of these incidents to have a material effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.

LNG Divestiture Dispute

Each of Woodside and the Company asserted claims against the other resulting in court proceedings in the Supreme Court of Western Australia and the Court of Queen’s Bench of Alberta, Calgary.  Woodside also initiated third party expert determination proceedings at the ICC International Centre for ADR concerning certain aspects of its purchase price adjustment claims.  Each of these proceedings has now been dismissed by agreement in November 2016. The parties have resolved the central matters in dispute on mutually agreeable terms and there was no significant impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.

Australian Operations Divestiture Dispute

By a Sale and Purchase Agreement dated April 9, 2015 (SPA), the Company and its subsidiaries divested their remaining Australian operations to Quadrant Energy Pty Ltd (Quadrant). Closing occurred on June 5, 2015. By letter dated June 6, 2016, Quadrant provided the Company with a notice of claim under the SPA claiming approximately

$200 million

in the aggregate. The Company believes that these claims lack merit and will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operation, or liquidity.

11.    RETIREMENT AND DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLANS

Apache Corporation provides retirement benefits to its U.S. employees through the use of multiple plans: a 401(k) savings plan, a money purchase retirement plan, a non-qualified retirement/savings plan, and a non-qualified restorative retirement savings plan. The 401(k) savings plan provides participating employees the ability to elect to contribute up to

50 percent

of eligible compensation, as defined, to the plan with the Company making matching contributions up to a maximum of

8 percent

of each employee’s annual eligible compensation. In addition, the Company, at its discretion, annually contributes

6 percent

of each participating employee’s annual eligible compensation to a money purchase retirement plan. The 401(k) savings plan and the money purchase retirement plan are subject to certain annually-adjusted, government-mandated restrictions that limit the amount of employee and Company contributions. For certain eligible employees, the Company also provides a non-qualified retirement/savings plan or a non-qualified restorative retirement savings plan. These plans allow the deferral of up to

50 percent

of each employee’s base salary, up to

75 percent

of each employee’s annual bonus (that accepts employee contributions) and the Company’s matching contributions in excess of the government mandated limitations imposed in the 401(k) savings plan and money purchase retirement plan.

Vesting in the Company’s contributions in the 401(k) savings plan, the money purchase retirement plan, the non-qualified retirement savings plan and the non-qualified restorative retirement savings plan occurs at the rate of

20 percent

for every completed year of employment. Upon a change in control of ownership, immediate and full vesting occurs.

Additionally, Apache Canada Ltd. and Apache North Sea Limited maintain separate retirement plans, as required under the laws of Canada and the U.K., respectively.

The aggregate annual cost to Apache of all U.S. plans, the money purchase retirement plan, non-qualified retirement/savings plan, and non-qualified restorative retirement savings plan was

$82 million

,

$77 million

, and

$107 million

for


,


, and


, respectively.

Apache also provides a funded noncontributory defined benefit pension plan (U.K. Pension Plan) covering certain employees of the Company’s North Sea operations in the U.K. The plan provides defined pension benefits based on years of service and final salary. The plan applies only to employees who were part of BP North Sea’s pension plan as of April 2, 2003, prior to the acquisition of BP North Sea by the Company effective July 1, 2003.

Additionally, the Company offers postretirement medical benefits to U.S. employees who meet certain eligibility requirements. Eligible participants receive medical benefits up until the age of


or at the date they become eligible for Medicare, provided the participant remits the required portion of the cost of coverage. The plan is contributory with participants’ contributions adjusted annually. The postretirement benefit plan does not cover benefit expenses once a covered participant becomes eligible for Medicare.

Stock Options

As of

December 31, 2016

, the Company had issued options to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock under the employee stock option plan adopted in 2005 (the Stock Option Plan), as well as the 2007 Omnibus Equity Compensation Plan (the 2007 Plan), the 2011 Plan, and the 2016 Plan (together, the Omnibus Plans). New shares of Company stock will be issued for employee stock option exercises. Under the Stock Option Plan and the Omnibus Plans, the exercise price of each option equals the closing price of Apache’s common stock on the date of grant. Options issued prior to 2016 generally become exercisable ratably over a

four

-year period and expire


years after granted. Options granted in or after 2016 become exercisable ratably over a

three

-year period and expire

10 years

after granted. The Omnibus Plans and the Stock Option Plan were submitted to and approved by the Company’s shareholders.

A summary of stock options issued and outstanding under the Stock Option Plan and the Omnibus Plans is presented in the table and narrative below:

(1)

As of

December 31, 2016

, options outstanding had a weighted average remaining contractual life of

4.6

years and aggregate intrinsic value of

As of

December 31, 2016

, options exercisable had a weighted average remaining contractual life of

3.7

years and aggregate intrinsic value of

.

The fair value of each stock option award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Assumptions used in the valuation are disclosed in the following table. Expected volatilities are based on historical volatility of the Company's common stock and other factors. The expected dividend yield is based on historical yields on the date of grant. The expected term of stock options granted represents the period of time that the stock options are expected to be outstanding and is derived from historical exercise behavior, current trends, and values derived from lattice-based models. The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.

Total Shareholder Return (TSR) Stock Units

To provide long-term incentives for Apache employees to deliver competitive returns to the Company’s stockholders, the Company has granted conditional restricted stock units to eligible employees. The ultimate number of shares awarded from these conditional restricted stock units is based upon measurement of total shareholder return of Apache common stock as compared to a designated peer group during a three-year performance period. Should any restricted stock units be awarded at the end of the three-year performance period,

50 percent

of restricted stock units awarded will immediately vest, and an additional

25 percent

will vest on succeeding anniversaries of the end of the performance period. Grants from the total shareholder return programs were outstanding at

December 31, 2016

Apache has a business performance program for certain eligible employees with

50 percent

of the shares payout based upon the TSR program payout model as described above, and the remaining

50 percent

of the shares based on performance and financial objectives as defined in the plan. The overall results of the objectives will be calculated at the end of the award’s stated performance period and, if a payout is warranted, applied to the target number of restricted stock units awarded. The business performance shares will immediately vest

Oil and Gas Reserve Information

Proved oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities of natural gas, crude oil, condensate, and natural gas liquids (NGLs) that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing conditions, operating conditions, and government regulations. Estimated proved developed oil and gas reserves can be expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods. The Company reports all estimated proved reserves held under production-sharing arrangements utilizing the “economic interest” method, which excludes the host country’s share of reserves.

Estimated reserves that can be produced economically through application of improved recovery techniques are included in the “proved” classification when successful testing by a pilot project or the operation of an active, improved recovery program using reliable technology establishes the reasonable certainty for the engineering analysis on which the project or program is based. Economically producible means a resource which generates revenue that exceeds, or is reasonably expected to exceed, the costs of the operation. Reasonable certainty means a high degree of confidence that the quantities will be recovered. Reliable technology is a grouping of one or more technologies (including computational methods) that has been field-tested and has been demonstrated to provide reasonably certain results with consistency and repeatability in the formation being evaluated or in an analogous formation. In estimating its proved reserves, Apache uses several different traditional methods that can be classified in three general categories: 1) performance-based methods; 2) volumetric-based methods; and 3) analogy with similar properties. Apache will, at times, utilize additional technical analysis such as computer reservoir models, petrophysical techniques, and proprietary 3-D seismic interpretation methods to provide additional support for more complex reservoirs. Information from this additional analysis is combined with traditional methods outlined above to enhance the certainty of our reserve estimates.

There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves and projecting future rates of production and timing of development expenditures. The reserve data in the following tables only represent estimates and should not be construed as being exact.

During


, Apache sold a combined


MMboe primarily through divestiture transactions in Canada. The Company added


MMboe of estimated proved reserves through purchases of minerals in-place and


MMboe from extensions, discoveries, and other additions. The Company recorded


MMboe of exploration and development adds in North America, primarily associated with Woodford, Bone Springs, and Wolfcamp drilling programs in the Permian Basin (


MMboe), Montney and Glauconite drilling in Canada (


MMboe), and Woodford drilling activity in the MidContinent region (


MMboe).

The international regions contributed


MMboe of exploration and development adds during 2016 with Egypt contributing


MMboe from onshore exploration and appraisal activity in the Khalda, Khalda 2, and East Beni Suef concessions. The North Sea offshore region contributed


MMboe from drilling success in the Beryl, Forties, and Nevis fields.

During


, Apache also had combined downward revisions of previously estimated reserves of


MMboe. Changes in product prices accounted for


MMboe, lease ownership changes accounted for


MMboe, offset by engineering and performance upward revisions totaling


MMboe.

Approximately

9 percent

of Apache’s year-end


estimated proved developed reserves are classified as proved not producing. These reserves relate to zones that are either behind pipe, or that have been completed but not yet produced, or zones that have been produced in the past, but are not now producing because of mechanical reasons. These reserves are considered to be a lower tier of reserves than producing reserves because they are frequently based on volumetric calculations rather than performance data. Future production associated with behind pipe reserves is scheduled to follow depletion of the currently producing zones in the same wellbores. Additional capital may have to be spent to access these reserves. The capital and economic impact of production timing are reflected in this Note 16, under “Future Net Cash Flows.”

Future Net Cash Flows

Future cash inflows as of

December 31, 2016

and


were calculated using an unweighted arithmetic average of oil and gas prices in effect on the first day of each month in the respective year, except where prices are defined by contractual arrangements. Operating costs, production and ad valorem taxes and future development costs are based on current costs with no escalation.

The following table sets forth unaudited information concerning future net cash flows for proved oil and gas reserves, net of income tax expense. Income tax expense has been computed using expected future tax rates and giving effect to tax deductions and credits available, under current laws, and which relate to oil and gas producing activities. This information does not purport to present the fair market value of the Company’s oil and gas assets, but does present a standardized disclosure concerning possible future net cash flows that would result under the assumptions used.

Estimated future net cash flows before income tax expense, discounted at
