BUSINESS AND PROPERTIES

General

Apache Corporation, a Delaware corporation formed in 1954, is an
    independent energy company that explores for, develops and
    produces natural gas, crude oil and natural gas liquids. In
    North America, our exploration and production interests are
    focused in the Gulf of Mexico, the Gulf Coast, East Texas, the
    Permian basin, the Anadarko basin and the Western Sedimentary
    basin of Canada. Outside of North America, we have exploration
    and production interests onshore Egypt, offshore Western
    Australia, offshore the United Kingdom (U.K.) in the North Sea
    (North Sea), and onshore Argentina. In November 2007, we were
    high bidder on two exploration blocks on the Chilean side of the
    island of Tierra del Fuego. Our common stock, par value $0.625
    per share, has been listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE)
    since 1969, on the Chicago Stock Exchange (CHX) since 1960, and
    on the NASDAQ National Market (NASDAQ) since 2004. On
    May 24, 2007, we filed certifications of our compliance
    with the listing standards of the NYSE and the NASDAQ, including
    our chief executive officer’s certification of compliance
    with the NYSE standards. Through our website,

http://www.apachecorp.com,

you can access, free of charge, electronic copies of the
    charters of the committees of our Board of Directors, other
    documents related to Apache’s corporate governance
    (including our Code of Business Conduct and Governance
    Principles), and documents Apache files with the Securities and
    Exchange Commission (SEC), including our annual reports on

Form 10-K,

Form 10-Q,

and current reports on

Form 8-K,

as well as any amendments to these reports filed or furnished
    pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities
    Exchange Act of 1934. Included in our annual and quarterly
    reports are the certifications of our chief executive officer
    and our chief financial officer that are required by applicable
    laws and regulations. Access to these electronic filings is
    available as soon as reasonably practicable after we file such
    material with, or furnish it to, the SEC. You may also request
    printed copies of our committee charters or other governance
    documents by writing to our corporate secretary at the address
    on the cover of this report. Our reports filed with the SEC are
    also made available to read and copy at the SEC’s Public
    Reference Room at 100 F Street, N.E.,
    Washington, D.C., 20549. You may obtain information about
    the Public Reference Room by contacting the SEC at

1-800-SEC-0330.

Reports filed with the SEC are also made available on its
    website at www.sec.gov.

We hold interests in many of our United States (U.S.), Canadian,
    and other international properties through subsidiaries,
    including Apache Canada Ltd., DEK Energy Company (DEKALB),
    Apache Energy Limited (AEL), Apache North America, Inc., and
    Apache Overseas, Inc. Properties referred to in this document
    may be held by those subsidiaries. We treat all operations as
    one line of business.

Growth
    Strategy

Apache’s mission is to grow a profitable upstream oil and
    gas company for the long-term benefit of our shareholders. Our
    strategy is to build a portfolio of core areas which provide
    long-term growth opportunities through grass-roots drilling
    supplemented by occasional acquisitions. Two decades ago,
    recognizing that the United States was a mature oil and gas
    province, we launched an international exploration component to
    our portfolio approach, which provides exposure to larger
    reserve targets with which to continue production and reserve
    growth. We have producing operations in six countries, comprised
    of seven regions — the United States (Gulf Coast and
    Central regions), Canada, Egypt, the North Sea, Australia and
    Argentina. We are finalizing contracts for two exploration
    blocks in Chile. We seek to grow profitably while building
    critical mass that supports sustainable, lower-risk, repeatable
    drilling opportunities. This enables us to pursue higher-risk,
    higher-reward exploration primarily in our international
    regions; particularly our growth areas of Australia, Canada and
    Egypt. We also seek a balance in terms of product mix and
    geologic and geographic risk, in order to achieve consistency in
    our results. As a testament to our balanced portfolio approach
    Apache increased production for the

th

out
    of 29 years and reserves for the

nd

consecutive
    year.

Operating regions are given the autonomy necessary to make
    drilling and operating decisions and to act quickly. Management
    and incentive systems motivate appropriate risk taking to reach
    or exceed targeted hurdle rates of return. These are measured
    monthly, reviewed quarterly with senior management and utilized
    in


determining annual performance rewards. Apache is also one of
    the leading acquirers of three-dimensional

(3-D)

seismic data in the industry today. Our geophysical personnel
    have developed strategies for rapid and cost-effective
    acquisition and processing of

3-D

data,
    enabling our technical teams to analyze large swaths of acreage,
    generate drilling prospects on an accelerated timetable and
    lessen drilling risk.

In 2008, we are planning another active year of drilling and
    have set a preliminary exploration and development budget of
    approximately $4.6 billion, or nine percent more than 2007.
    Our 2008 plan also includes just under $400 million for
    gathering, transmission and processing (GTP) assets. As is our
    custom, we will review and revise our capital expenditure
    estimates throughout the year based on changing industry
    conditions and results-to-date. Additionally, we continually
    look for opportunities to acquire producing oil and gas
    properties where we believe we can add value and earn adequate
    rates of return and may take advantage of such acquisition
    opportunities should they arise.

North
    America

In the U.S., the Gulf Coast region consistently delivers high
    returns on invested capital and cash flow significantly in
    excess of its exploration and development spending. Occasional
    acquisitions have played an important role because with steep
    decline rates, offshore reserves are generally shorter-lived and
    difficult to replace on a cost effective basis through drilling
    alone. The Central region brings the balance of long-lived
    reserves and consistent drilling results to the portfolio in the
    areas of the Permian basin of West Texas and New Mexico, East
    Texas and the Anadarko basin of western Oklahoma. Apache’s
    future growth in the U.S. is more likely to be achieved
    through a combination of drilling and acquisitions, rather than
    through drilling activity alone. Our March 2007
    $1 billion acquisition of properties in the Permian basin,
    for example, complimented our active drilling program in 2007,
    buttressed our growth in the U.S. and brought numerous
    opportunities to increase future production through workovers,
    recompletions and drilling.

In Canada, we have five million net acres across the provinces
    of British Columbia, Alberta and Saskatchewan. We have a
    significant inventory of low-risk drilling opportunities in and
    around a number of Apache fields in Alberta, including Provost,
    Hatton, Nevis, Kaybob and West 5. With significant increases in
    Canadian acquisition and land costs, our 2004 and 2005
    agreements with Exxon Mobil Corporation (ExxonMobil) provide a
    way for Apache to earn acreage through drilling with no upfront
    costs, while ExxonMobil retains a royalty on fee lands and a
    convertible working interest on leasehold acreage. We also have
    emerging resource plays in the gas bearing shales of Northeast
    British Columbia (NEBC), where we have now acquired 200,000
    highly prospective net acres, and in the Manville coals of
    central Alberta. A recent ill-conceived change in Alberta
    royalty rates will limit our investment there, primarily to
    shallow drilling activity and divert investments to Saskatchewan
    or British Columbia.

International

In Egypt’s Western Desert, Apache’s 18.9 million
    gross acres encompass a sizable resource in the Cretaceous Upper
    Bahariya formations and outstanding exploration potential in
    deeper intervals from lower Cretaceous to Jurassic. The Qasr gas
    and condensate field, discovered in 2003, is the largest ever
    found by Apache with ultimate recoverable reserves of an
    estimated 2.25 Tcf of gas and 80 MMbbls of associated
    liquids. Apache’s gas production is restricted because
    Western Desert infrastructure is at capacity. Two new gas trains
    will add

100 MMcf/d

of capacity each and are currently under construction with
    completion slated for around year-end 2008. Our historical
    growth in Egypt has been driven by drilling and Apache is the
    most active driller in Egypt.

In Australia, Apache’s recent expansion beyond our core
    holdings in the Carnarvon basin is beginning to pay off. In the
    Exmouth basin, development of prior-year discoveries at the Van
    Gogh and Pyrenees fields, sanctioned in 2007, is progressing.
    The Van Gogh development is operated by Apache and the Pyrenees
    development is operated by BHP Billiton. Production from each
    field is estimated at 20,000 b/d net to Apache. Van Gogh
    development drilling has commenced with first oil production
    expected in the first half of 2009. Pyrenees development
    drilling is expected to commence in 2009 with first oil
    production expected in 2010. In the Gippsland basin, we acquired
    nearly 1.5 million net acres over the past several years
    and have generated an inventory of high-risk, high-potential
    exploration prospects with drilling to commence in 2008.
    Development drilling at the Reindeer discovery and the
    construction of pipeline and processing infrastructure is
    scheduled to commence in 2008 with first production


anticipated in 2010. The Julimar gas discovery, which could
    potentially surpass the size of the Qasr field in Egypt, will be
    further appraised in 2008 in order to begin work on a
    development plan.

Apache is also the beneficiary of strong demand for Carnarvon
    basin natural gas where industry prices have recently risen to a
    multiple of Apache’s Australian $1.89 per Mcf average price
    in 2007. Apache is currently in the tender process for its gas
    from the Reindeer field and expects to complete negotiations
    during 2008 on initial contracts. Apache also anticipates
    tendering Julimar gas to market in 2008.

Apache entered the North Sea in 2003 acquiring an approximately
    97 percent working interest in the Forties field (Forties),
    the largest field ever discovered in the U.K. Production
    decreased eight percent in 2007 but was still well ahead of our
    28,800 b/d proved acquisition forecast. Production was impacted
    by suspension of drilling on the Alpha and Echo platforms for
    facility upgrades. We plan an active 15-well program in 2008
    which is forecasted to increase production over 2007. We will
    also drill two exploration wells and one appraisal well on
    blocks outside Forties. 2008 will also mark the completion of a
    number of key facility projects such as installation of new gas
    lift compression equipment on both the Alpha and Delta platforms
    and new produced water handling and reinjection facility on
    Charlie, as well as an enhanced crude oil import-export header
    system designed to significantly impact the reliability and
    operating efficiency of the field.

For several years we held small interests in Argentina with a
    long-term view of expanding there through acquisitions. In April
    2006, we purchased Pioneer Natural Resources’ (Pioneer)
    interests in Neuquén and the Austral basins and in
    September 2006 purchased our partner’s, Pan American
    Fueguina S.R.L. (Pan American), interests in Tierra del Fuego
    (TdF), gaining operatorship in the under-exploited, highly
    prospective Austral basin concessions. 2007 was a year of
    significant accomplishments. We increased production on the
    acquired properties through a successful drilling and
    development program and have established Argentina as
    Apache’s latest core area. We made the first significant
    oil discovery from our

3-D

seismic
    work in TdF which came online producing approximately 1,600 b/d
    and

1.3 MMcf/d.

We were able to increase our gas price over 20 percent from
    2006 with the prospect of signing more spot contracts for around
    $3.00 per Mcf. 2007 was not without its challenges as the
    government placed a ceiling on oil prices in the fourth quarter
    that effectively caps our oil price at $42.00 per barrel when
    the WTI price is $60.90 or greater. In TdF, the price cap
    applies but Apache retains the 21 percent Value Added
    Tax collected from buyers, effectively increasing realized
    prices. While Argentina presents unique challenges with evolving
    governmental regulations, we are optimistic about our ability to
    find additional hydrocarbons with the drill bit and growing our
    reserves and production over the long-term.

Operating
    Highlights

We currently have production in six countries: the United States
    (Gulf Coast and Central regions), Canada, Egypt, Australia,
    offshore the United Kingdom in the North Sea and Argentina. We
    are finalizing contracts for two exploration blocks in Chile.


The following table sets out a brief comparative summary of
    certain key 2007 data for each area. Each country’s

The following discussions include references to our plans for
    2008. These only represent initial estimates and could vary
    significantly from actual results. During the year, we routinely
    adjust our level of spending based on results and changing
    industry conditions.

United
    States

Gulf Coast

— The Gulf Coast region comprises
    our interests in and along the Gulf of Mexico, in the areas
    on-and offshore Louisiana and Texas. Apache has been the largest

held-by-production

acreage holder and the second largest producer in Gulf waters
    less than 1,200 feet deep since 2004. For the ninth
    consecutive year, the Gulf Coast was our leading region for both
    production volumes and revenues. In 2007 the region contributed
    close to 25 percent of our production and 27 percent
    of our revenues. Gulf Coast activities in 2007 focused on an
    active drilling program, completing 65 out of 84 total wells
    drilled as producers, and restoring production impacted by the
    2005 hurricanes. This region performed 233 workover and
    recompletion operations during 2007. At year-end 2007, the Gulf
    Coast region accounted for approximately 15 percent of our
    estimated proved reserves. Although actual annual capital
    expenditures may change considerably in 2008, we currently
    estimate investing approximately $900 million on drilling,
    recompletions, equipment upgrades, production enhancement
    projects and seismic. In addition, we plan to spend an estimated
    $400 million on plugging and abandonment work, including
    $250 million associated with damage caused by Hurricanes
    Katrina and Rita in 2005.

Central —

The Central region includes assets in
    East Texas, the Permian basin of West Texas and New Mexico,
    and the Anadarko basin of western Oklahoma and the Texas
    Panhandle, where the Company got its start over 50 years
    ago. In early 2007, we acquired an additional $1 billion of
    producing properties in the Permian basin. At year-end 2007, the
    Central region accounted for approximately 26 percent of
    our estimated proved reserves, the largest concentration in the
    Company. During 2007, we participated in drilling
    343 wells, 335 of which were completed as productive.
    Apache also performed 994 workovers and recompletions in the
    region during the year. We currently estimate spending
    approximately $660 million in 2008 on drilling,
    recompletions and production enhancement projects.


Marketing

— In general, most of our
    U.S. gas is sold based on either monthly or daily market
    prices. Our natural gas is sold primarily to Local Distribution
    Companies (LDCs), utilities, end-users, integrated major oil and
    gas companies and marketers. Approximately five percent of our
    2007 U.S. natural gas production was sold under long-term
    fixed-price physical contracts which expire in 2008. See
    Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about
    Market Risk “Commodity Risk” in this

Form 10-K.

Apache primarily markets its U.S. crude oil to integrated
    major oil companies, purchasers, transporters, and refiners. The
    objective is to maximize the value of the crude oil sold by
    identifying the best markets and most economical transportation
    routes available to move the crude oil. Sales contracts are
    generally

30-day

evergreen contracts and renew automatically until canceled by
    either party. These contracts provide for sales that are priced
    daily at market prevailing prices. In 2007, we entered several
    multi-month contracts in order to reduce the transportation cost
    component of these contracts.

We manage our credit risk by selling our oil and gas to
    creditworthy counterparties and monitoring our exposure on a
    daily basis.

Canada

Overview

— Our exploration and development
    activity in our Canadian region is concentrated in the provinces
    of Alberta, British Columbia, Saskatchewan and to a minor degree
    the Northwest Territories. The region comprises 23 percent
    of our estimated proved reserves, the second largest in the
    Company. We hold five million net acres in Canada, the largest
    of our North American regions. This year we drilled
    348 wells with 287 completed as producers. Exploration
    wells comprised 9 percent of the net wells drilled, up from
    six percent in 2006. We performed 478 workover and
    recompletion projects. We currently estimate spending
    approximately $600 million in 2008 to drill 394 wells.
    Our 2008 drilling program will include 358 low-risk development
    wells and 36 higher risk, higher potential exploration wells in
    NEBC and Alberta.

Apache continues to target shallow gas including coal bed
    methane (CBM) in fields such as Provost and Nevis and through
    these efforts has emerged as one of Canada’s largest
    producers of CBM. The North and South Grant Lands obtained
    through farm-in agreements discussed below provide additional
    CBM potential. Also in 2008 we will continue our pursuit of the
    emerging shale gas play in NEBC, where we have now acquired over
    200,000 highly prospective net acres, with a nine well winter
    drilling program.

Apache signed farm-in agreements in 2004 and 2005 with
    ExxonMobil covering over one million acres of undeveloped
    properties in the province of Alberta. Under the agreements,
    Apache drilled to earn an interest in the land while ExxonMobil
    retained a royalty on fee lands and a convertible working
    interest on leasehold acreage. Through the end of 2007, Apache
    had drilled a total of 751 wells on the farm-in acreage
    from both agreements.

Marketing

— Our Canadian natural gas sales
    focuses on sales to LDCs, utilities, end-users, integrated
    majors, supply aggregators and marketers. Our composite client
    portfolio is creditworthy and diverse. Improved North American
    natural gas pipeline connectivity has triggered a closer
    correlation between Canadian and U.S. natural gas prices.
    To diversify our market exposure and optimize pricing
    differences in the U.S. and Canada, we transport natural
    gas via our firm transportation contracts to California, the
    Chicago area, and eastern Canada. Our objective is to sell the
    majority of our production monthly, either into the first of the
    month market, or the daily market. In 2007, approximately two
    percent of our gas sales were subject to long-term fixed-price
    contracts, the longest of which expires in 2011.

Our Canadian crude oil is primarily sold to refiners, integrated
    majors and marketers. To increase the market value of our
    condensate and heavier crudes, our condensate is either used or
    sold for blending purposes. We sell our oil and natural gas
    liquids (NGLs) on crude oil postings, which are market
    reflective prices that depend on worldwide crude oil prices and
    are adjusted for transportation and quality. In order to reach
    more purchasers and diversify our market, we transport crude on
    12 pipelines to the major trading hubs within Alberta and
    Saskatchewan.

Egypt

Overview —

In Egypt, our operations are
    conducted pursuant to production sharing contracts under which
    the contractor partner pays all operating and capital
    expenditure costs for exploration and development. A percentage


of the production, usually up to 40 percent, is available
    to the contractor partners to recover operating and capital
    expenditure costs. In general, the balance of the production is
    allocated between the contractor partners and Egyptian General
    Petroleum Corporation (EGPC) on a contractually defined basis.
    Apache is the largest acreage holder and the most active driller
    in Egypt. Egypt holds our largest acreage position with
    approximately 18.9 million gross acres in 23 separate
    concessions (19 producing concessions) as of December 31,
    2007. Development leases within concessions generally have a

25-year

life
    with extensions possible for additional commercial discoveries,
    or on a negotiated basis. Apache is the largest producer of
    liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas in the Western Desert and
    third largest in all of Egypt. Egypt contributed 20 percent
    of Apache’s production revenues and 18 percent of
    total production in 2007 and approximately 12 percent of
    total estimated proved reserves. The Company reports all
    estimated proved reserves held under production sharing
    agreements utilizing the economic interest method, which
    excludes the host country’s share of reserves.

In 2007, Apache had an active drilling program in Egypt,
    completing 161 of 192 wells, an 84 percent success
    rate, and conducted 450 workovers and recompletions. We
    currently plan to spend approximately $1 billion in 2008;
    $700 million on drilling nearly 300 wells,
    recompletions and production enhancement projects and
    $300 million on gathering, transmission and processing
    facility projects. In 2006 we received approval to expand our
    Western Desert gas processing capacity and infrastructure to
    process an additional

200 MMcf/d

primarily from the Qasr field discovery. Work commenced in 2007
    and we expect incremental production from the expansion to begin
    late in the fourth quarter of 2008.

Marketing

— Our gas production is sold to EGPC
    under an industry pricing formula, a sliding scale based on
    Dated-Brent crude oil with a minimum of $1.50 per MMbtu and a
    maximum of $2.65 per MMbtu, which corresponds to a Dated-Brent
    price of $21.00 per barrel. Generally, the industry pricing
    formula applies to all new gas discovered and produced. In
    exchange for extension of the Khalda Concession lease in July
    2004, Apache agreed to accept the industry pricing formula on a
    majority of gas sold, but retained the previous gas price
    formula (without a price cap) until 2013 for up to

100 MMcf/d

gross.

Oil from the Khalda Concession, the Qarun Concession and other
    nearby Western Desert blocks is either sold directly to EGPC or
    other third-parties. Oil sales are made either directly into the
    Egyptian oil pipeline grid, exported via one of two terminals on
    the north coast of Egypt, or sold to third parties
    (non-governmental) through the MIDOR refinery located in
    northern Egypt. Oil production that is presently sold to EGPC is
    sold on a spot basis at a “Western Desert” price
    (indexed to Brent). In 2007, we exported 32 cargoes
    (approximately 9.8 million barrels) of Western Desert crude
    oil from the El Hamra and Sidi Kerir terminals located on the
    northern coast of Egypt. These export cargoes were sold at
    market prices at or above our domestic sales to EGPC.
    Additionally, 28 cargoes representing 3.7 million
    barrels were sold in Egypt to other non-governmental purchasers
    at prevailing market prices. We expect export sales from both
    the Khalda and Qarun areas in the Western Desert will continue
    in 2008.

Australia

Overview —

Our exploration activity in
    Australia is focused in the offshore Carnarvon, Gippsland and
    Browse basins where Apache holds 5.4 million net acres in
    31 Exploration Permits, 10 Production Licenses, and 5 Retention
    Leases. Production operations are concentrated in the Carnarvon
    basin, the location of all 10 Production Licenses, all of which
    are operated by Apache. In 2007, the region generated
    $536 million of production revenues from 16.9 MMboe,
    approximately eight percent of our total production, and
    accounted for 11 percent of our year-end estimated proved
    reserves. During the year we participated in drilling
    24 wells; generating eight productive gas wells and two
    productive oil wells.

During 2008, our Australian region plans to increase its
    exploration, appraisal and field development activities.
    Twenty-four exploration wells are expected to be drilled in
    2008, targeting gas opportunities in the highly prospective
    Julimar-Brunello area, in the Carnarvon basin and prospects in
    the Gippsland basin, which targets both oil and gas
    opportunities. Two new development projects were sanctioned in
    2007. Van Gogh, operated by Apache, is an oil discovery in the
    Exmouth basin that will be produced through a Floating
    Production Storage and Offloading tanker (FPSO) beginning in
    early 2009 with Apache’s share estimated at 20,000 b/d. We
    plan to drill 13 wells in the Van Gogh field in 2008 while
    work progresses on the FPSO and subsea components. Pyrenees, the
    second project and also in the Exmouth basin, is operated by BHP
    Billiton (BHP). This field will also be produced through an


FPSO and should commence production in 2010 at an estimated
    20,000 b/d net to Apache. Work will continue on the Reindeer gas
    discovery in the Carnarvon basin, with gas to be piped to shore
    for processing at a new gas plant located at Devil’s Creek
    beginning in 2010. Two development wells are planned for the
    field in 2008.

In 2008, we currently estimate spending approximately
    $550 million on 48 wells and production enhancement
    projects and another $350 million on new development
    facilities at Van Gogh, Pyrenees and Reindeer.

Marketing

— As of December 31, 2007,
    Apache had a total of 21 active gas contracts with expiration
    dates ranging from July 2008 to July 2030. Generally, natural
    gas is sold in Western Australia under long-term, fixed-price
    contracts, many of which contain price escalation clauses based
    on the Australian consumer price index.

We continue to export all of our crude oil production into
    international markets at prices indexed to Asian benchmark
    crudes which typically track at or above NYMEX WTI prices.

North
    Sea

Overview —

In 2007, the North Sea region
    produced 19.7 MMboe, generating $1.4 billion of
    revenue. We continued to develop our North Sea core area around
    the Forties field, including investments in upgrades to improve
    the operating efficiency of our platforms. In the Forties field,
    we commissioned a number of key facility projects, including new
    power generation and multi-platform gas and power distribution
    systems, export pumping, produced water handling and injection
    systems and drilling rig package upgrades.

These efforts have already shown to be successful as operating
    efficiencies improved 11 percent relative to 2006. Despite
    an improvement in topsides efficiency, 2007 production was down
    eight percent from 2006. Workovers to restore production on the
    Echo platform progressed slower than planned, and new drilling
    was postponed on the Alpha platform to complete facility
    upgrades. Production from each of the other three platforms in
    the field (Bravo, Charlie, and Delta) increased in 2007 compared
    to 2006.

In 2007 we invested $538 million of capital in the North
    Sea region, including investments in drilling, recompletion and
    facility upgrades. The region drilled 16 wells in 2007,
    five of which were productive. Three exploration wells were
    drilled outside Forties but did not find commercial hydrocarbon
    accumulations. Also during 2007, a seismic survey acquired over
    Forties in 2005 was reprocessed to identify bypassed oil in the
    main reservoir units and enabled us to update the inventory of
    future drilling targets.

North Sea capital expenditures for 2008 are currently estimated
    at $500 million. In Forties, we will continue the
    development drilling program with 15 new wells planned and
    completion of several platform facility upgrades initiated last
    year. The upgrades for 2008 include finalizing the installation
    of a produced water handling and re-injection system on the
    Charlie platform, new gas lift compression systems on Alpha and
    Delta, replacement of glycol dehydration systems and upgrades to
    lower voltage electrical systems. Outside Forties, at least one
    appraisal and two exploration wells are planned to be drilled
    during the year.

Marketing —

In 2007, we entered into one new
    term contract for the physical sale of Forties crude at
    prevailing market prices, which are composed of base market
    indices, adjusted for the quality difference between the Forties
    crude and Brent and a premium to reflect the higher market value
    for term arrangements. In 2006, a new value adjustment formula
    (Quality Bank Adjustment) was implemented in BP’s Forties
    Pipeline System, through which Forties crude is shipped and
    commingled with crudes from other central North Sea fields. The
    new agreed upon formula better represents Apache’s crude
    value in the Forties Pipeline System.

Argentina

Argentina became our latest core area following two significant
    acquisitions in 2006 that substantially increased our presence
    in the country. In the second quarter of 2006, we completed our
    purchase of Pioneer’s operations in Argentina for
    $675 million, with estimated proved reserves of
    22 MMbbls of liquid hydrocarbons and 297 Bcf of
    natural gas. In the third quarter of 2006, we acquired
    additional interests in (and now operate) seven concessions in
    Tierra del Fuego from Pan American for total consideration of
    $429 million. Our oil and gas assets are located in the
    Neuquén, San Jorge and Austral basins of Argentina. In
    2007, we recorded 17.4 MMboe of


production and at year end had 112.0 MMboe of estimated
    proved reserves, approximately eight percent and
    five percent, respectively, of Apache’s total
    production and reserves.

In 2007 Apache completed over 1,700 square kilometers of a
    nearly 2,500 square kilometer 3D seismic mega shoot in
    Tierra del Fuego. The program will be completed in 2008.

On the mainland, we established the commerciality of two gas
    areas in the Neuquén Basin, each operated by Apache with a
    100 percent working interest. In the Anticlinal Campamento
    block, Apache completed five Pre Cuyo “Deep Gas”
    wells. In our Estacion Fernandez Oro block we completed four
    wells and established commerciality of the “Deep
    Lajas” gas play. We are encouraged by the results and
    foresee the potential of 150 new drilling locations.

In Tierra del Fuego, Apache made two significant discoveries on
    operated blocks in which we own a 70 percent working
    interest. In our Cabo Nombre Sur area, we drilled two wells
    directionally into a new reservoir structure. In our Seccion
    Banos area, we discovered a new field between two mature fields
    five miles apart. We believe we have sufficient drilling
    locations to utilize our shallow rig for the remainder of 2008
    and are evaluating mobilizing another rig to the province.

In total, the region drilled 94 wells, 92 of which were
    productive. In 2008, Apache plans to invest $250 million
    drilling 100 wells and performing recompletion activities.
    The region also plans to invest an additional $40 million
    on waterfloods and expanded production facilities.

Marketing

— In Argentina, we receive low
    government-regulated pricing on a substantial portion of our gas
    production. The volumes we are required to sell at regulated
    prices are set by the government and vary with seasonal factors
    and industry category. We extended our exisiting natural gas
    contracts to regulated markets through year-end 2011, per the
    Argentine Secretary of Energy’s request. We also entered
    into three new term gas contracts up to five years in duration
    for volume up to

35 MMcf/d.

During the year, we realized an average price of $.76 per Mcf on
    government-regulated sales. The majority of the remaining
    volumes were sold at market-driven prices, in excess of $2.00
    per Mcf at year-end.

In October 2006, the Argentine government removed the export tax
    exempt status previously afforded the province of Tierra del
    Fuego through a Special Customs area exemption. The government
    further assessed an export tax on all gas exports from Argentina
    based upon the price paid for natural gas imports from Bolivia.
    This tax reduced the value we receive under our contract with
    Methanex in Chile, however, we entered into an interim agreement
    with Methanex to mitigate the effects of this tax. Subsequent to
    the interim agreement, the Government of Argentina prohibited
    further gas exports to Methanex. Apache notified Methanex in
    June 2007 of the existence of force majeure, which continues to
    prevent deliveries of gas pursuant to the Methanex contract. The
    Methanex contract represents less than 10 percent of our
    gas sales in Argentina.

We are currently selling our oil in the domestic market. The
    government imposed a sliding-scale tax on oil exports which
    effectively limits the amount we are able to receive in the
    domestic market to a parity price equivalent to the price of
    exported crude oil after adjusting for the export taxes.
    Effective November 19, 2007, the export tax regulations
    were further modified and now include a cap of $42.00 per barrel
    when WTI is $60.90 or greater. In TdF, the price cap applies but
    Apache retains the 21 percent Value Added Tax
    collected from buyers, effectively increasing realized prices.

Chile

In November 2007, Apache was awarded the exploration rights on
    two blocks comprising one million net acres in Tierra del Fuego
    at a bid round. This acreage is adjacent to our 552,000 net
    acres on the Argentinean side of Tierra del Fuego and represents
    a natural extension of our expanding exploration and production
    operations. Apache is finalizing the contracts with the Chilean
    government and plans to shoot

3-D

seismic
    in 2008.

Subsequent
    Events

In January 2008, Apache, BP plc and Chevron Corporation entered
    into a contract with Well Control, Inc. to decommission downed
    platforms and related well facilities located offshore Louisiana
    in the Gulf of Mexico for a fixed fee of $750 million.
    Apache’s portion is 37.5 percent.


On January 29, 2008, the Company completed the sale of its
    50 percent interest in Ship Shoal blocks 349 and 359
    on the Outer Continental Shelf of the Gulf of Mexico to W&T
    Offshore, Inc. for $116 million.

On January 31, 2008, the Company completed the sale of
    properties in the Permian basin of West Texas and New Mexico to
    Vanguard Permian, LLC for $78 million.

On February 14, 2008, Apache’s Board of Directors
    declared a special cash dividend of 10 cents per common share
    payable on March 18, 2008, to stockholders of record on
    February 26, 2008. The regular dividend on the common
    shares is payable on May 22, 2008, to stockholders of
    record on April 22, 2008, at the rate of 15 cents per share.

On February 28, 2008, nine days of the

10-day

requirement for the $108 threshold of the Company’s
    2005 Share Appreciation Plan have been met and
    14 trading days remain in the current

30-day

period. This plan provides incentives for employees to double
    Apache’s share price to $108 by the end of 2008. See
    Note 7 — Capital Stock of Item 15 in this

Form 10-K.

Drilling
    Statistics

Worldwide, in 2007, we participated in drilling 1,101 gross
    wells, with 955 (87 percent) completed as producers. We
    also performed more than 4,048 workovers and recompletions
    during the year. Historically, our drilling activities in the
    U.S. generally concentrate on exploitation and extension of
    existing, producing fields rather than exploration. As a general
    matter, our operations outside of the U.S. focus on a mix
    of exploration and exploitation wells. In addition to our
    completed wells, at year-end several wells had not yet reached
    completion: 62 in the U.S. (28.49 net); 14 in Canada
    (13.69 net); 29 in Egypt (27.95 net); three in Australia (2.17
    net); one in the North Sea (0.98 net); and 17 in Argentina (16.4
    net).

As of December 31, 2007, we had 4,294,752, 1,868,688 and
    4,803,317 net acres scheduled to expire by
    December 31, 2008, 2009 and 2010, respectively, if
    production is not established or we take no other action to
    extend the terms. We plan to continue the terms of many of these
    licenses and concession areas through operational or
    administrative actions and do not expect a significant portion
    of our net acreage position to expire before such actions occur.

Estimated
    Proved Reserves and Future Net Cash Flows

As of December 31, 2007, Apache had total estimated proved
    reserves of 1,134 MMbbls of crude oil, condensate and NGLs
    and 7.9 Tcf of natural gas. Combined, these total estimated
    proved reserves are equivalent to 2.4 billion barrels of
    oil equivalent or 14.7 Tcf of natural gas. During 2007, the
    Company’s reserves grew six percent, the
    22nd consecutive annual increase.

Proved oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities of
    natural gas, crude oil, condensate and NGLs that geological and
    engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be
    recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing
    economic and operating conditions. The Company reports all
    estimated proved reserves held under production sharing
    arrangements utilizing the “economic interest” method,
    which excludes the host country’s share of reserves.
    Reserve estimates are considered proved if economical
    productivity is supported by either actual production or
    conclusive formation tests. Estimated reserves that can be
    produced economically through application of improved recovery
    techniques are included in the “proved” classification
    when successful testing by a pilot project or the operation of
    an active, improved recovery program in the reservoir provides
    support for the engineering analysis on which the project or
    program is based. Estimated proved developed oil and gas
    reserves can be expected to be recovered through existing wells
    with existing equipment and operating methods.

Apache emphasizes that its reported reserves are estimates
    which, by their nature, are subject to revision. The estimates
    are made using available geological and reservoir data, as well
    as production performance data. These estimates are reviewed
    throughout the year, and revised either upward or downward, as
    warranted by additional performance data.

Apache’s proved reserves are estimated at the property
    level and compiled for reporting purposes by a centralized group
    of experienced reservoir engineers who are independent of the
    operating groups. These engineers interact with engineering and
    geoscience personnel in each of Apache’s operating areas,
    and with accounting and marketing employees to obtain the
    necessary data for projecting future production, costs, net
    revenues and ultimate recoverable reserves. Reserves are
    reviewed internally with senior management and presented to
    Apache’s Board of Directors in summary form on a quarterly
    basis. Annually, each property is reviewed in detail by our
    centralized and operating region engineers to ensure forecasts
    of operating expenses, netback prices, production trends and
    development timing are reasonable.

The estimate of reserves disclosed in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

are prepared by the Company’s internal staff and the
    Company is responsible for the adequacy and accuracy of those
    estimates. However, we engage Ryder Scott Company, L.P.
    Petroleum Consultants (Ryder Scott) to review our processes and
    the reasonableness of our estimates of proved hydrocarbon liquid
    and gas reserves. We selected the properties for review by Ryder
    Scott and these properties represented all material fields,
    approximately 88 percent of international properties and
    over 80 percent of each country’s reserve value for
    new wells drilled during the year. During 2007, 2006 and 2005,
    Ryder Scott’s review covered 77, 75 and 74 percent of
    the Company’s worldwide estimated reserves value,
    respectively.

Ryder Scott opined that the overall proved reserves for the
    reviewed properties as estimated by the Company are, in the
    aggregate, reasonable, prepared in accordance with generally
    accepted petroleum engineering and evaluation principles, and
    conform to the SEC’s definition of proved reserves as set
    forth in

Rule 210.4-10(a)

of

Regulation S-X.

Ryder Scott has informed the Company that their tests and
    procedures used during their reserves audit conform to the
    Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and
    Gas Reserves Information approved by the Society of Petroleum
    Engineers. Paragraph 2.2(f) of the Standards Pertaining to
    the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information
    defines a reserves audit as the process of reviewing certain of
    the pertinent facts interpreted and assumptions made that have
    resulted in an estimate of reserves prepared by others and the
    rendering of an opinion about (1) the appropriateness of
    the methodologies employed, (2) the adequacy and quality of
    the data relied upon, (3) the depth and thoroughness of the
    reserves estimation process, (4) the


classification of reserves appropriate to the relevant
    definitions used, and (5) the reasonableness of the
    estimated reserve quantities.

The Company’s estimates of proved reserves and proved
    developed reserves as of December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005,
    changes in estimated proved reserves during the last three
    years, and estimates of future net cash flows and discounted
    future net cash flows from estimated proved reserves are
    contained in Note 12 - Supplemental Oil and Gas Disclosures
    of Item 15 in this

Form 10-K.

These estimated future net cash flows are based on prices on the
    last day of the year and are calculated in accordance with
    Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 69,
    “Disclosures about Oil and Gas Producing Activities.”
    Disclosure of this value and related reserves has been prepared
    in accordance with SEC

Regulation S-X

Rule 4-10.

Employees

On December 31, 2007, we had 3,521 employees. Only 24
    of these employees are subject to collective bargaining
    agreements, all of whom are in Argentina.

Offices

Our principal executive offices are located at One Post Oak
    Central, 2000 Post Oak Boulevard, Suite 100, Houston, Texas

77056-4400.

At year-end 2007, we maintained regional exploration

and/or

production offices in Tulsa, Oklahoma; Houston, Texas; Calgary,
    Alberta; Cairo, Egypt; Perth, Western Australia; Aberdeen,
    Scotland; and Buenos Aires, Argentina. Apache leases all of its
    primary office space. The current lease on our principal
    executive offices runs through December 31, 2013. For
    information regarding the Company’s obligations under its
    office leases, see the table in Item 7 —
    Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
    and Results of Operations, “Capital Resources and
    Liquidity,” and Note 9 — Commitments and
    Contingencies of Item 15 in this

Form 10-K.

Title
    to Interests

As is customary in our industry, a preliminary review of title
    records is made at the time we acquire properties, which may
    include opinions or reports of appropriate professionals or
    counsel. We believe that our title to all of the various
    interests set forth above is satisfactory and consistent with
    the standards generally accepted in the oil and gas industry,
    subject only to immaterial exceptions which do not detract
    substantially from the value of the interests or materially
    interfere with their use in our operations. The interests owned
    by us may be subject to one or more royalty, overriding royalty,
    and other outstanding interests (including disputes related to
    such interests) customary in the industry. The interests may
    additionally be subject to obligations or duties under
    applicable laws, ordinances, rules, regulations, and orders of
    arbitral or governmental authorities. In addition, the interests
    may be subject to burdens such as production payments, net
    profits interests, liens incident to operating agreements and
    current taxes, development obligations under oil and gas leases,
    and other encumbrances, easements, and restrictions, none of
    which detract substantially from the value of the interests or
    materially interfere with their use in our operations.

ITEM 1A.

RISK
    FACTORS

Our business activities and the value of our securities are
    subject to significant hazards and risks, including those
    described below. If any of such events should occur, our
    business, financial condition, liquidity

and/or

results of operations could be materially harmed, and holders
    and purchasers of our securities could lose part or all of their
    investments. Additional risks relating to our securities may be
    included in the prospectuses for securities we issue in the
    future.

Our
    profitability is highly dependent on the prices of crude oil,
    natural gas and natural gas liquids, which have historically
    been very volatile

Our estimated proved reserves, revenues, profitability,
    operating cash flows and future rate of growth are highly
    dependent on the prices of crude oil, natural gas and NGLs,
    which are affected by numerous factors beyond our control.
    Historically, these prices have been very volatile, and are
    likely to remain volatile in the future. A significant and
    extended downward trend in commodity prices would have a
    material adverse effect on our


revenues, profitability and cash flow, and could result in a
    reduction in the carrying value of our oil and gas properties
    and the amounts of our estimated proved oil and gas reserves. To
    the extent that we have not hedged our production with
    derivative contracts or fixed-price contracts, any significant
    and extended decline in oil and natural gas prices adversely
    affects our financial position.

Our
    commodity hedging may prevent us from benefiting fully from
    price increases and may expose us to other risks

To the extent that we engage in hedging activities to protect
    ourselves from commodity price declines, we may be prevented
    from realizing the benefits of price increases above the levels
    of the hedges.

Hedging arrangements may expose us to the risk of financial loss
    in certain circumstances, including instances in which our
    production is less than expected; there is a widening of price
    basis differentials between delivery points for our production
    and the delivery point assumed in the hedge arrangement; or the
    counterparties to our future contracts fail to perform under the
    contracts. We cannot assure that our hedging transactions will
    reduce the risk or minimize the effect of any decline in crude
    oil or natural gas prices.

Acquisitions
    or discoveries of additional reserves are needed to avoid a
    material decline in reserves and production

The production rate from oil and gas properties generally
    declines as reserves are depleted, while related per unit
    production costs generally increase due to decreasing reservoir
    pressures and other factors. Therefore, unless we add reserves
    through exploration and development activities or, through
    engineering studies, identify additional behind-pipe zones,
    secondary recovery reserves or tertiary recovery reserves, or
    acquire additional properties containing proved reserves our
    estimated proved reserves will decline materially as reserves
    are produced. Future oil and gas production is, therefore,
    highly dependent upon our level of success in acquiring or
    finding additional reserves on an economic basis. Furthermore,
    if oil or gas prices increase, our cost for additional reserves
    could also increase.

Inherent
    risk in drilling

Drilling for oil and gas involves numerous risks, including the
    risk that we will not encounter commercially productive oil or
    gas reservoirs. The wells we drill or participate in may not be
    productive and we may not recover all or any portion of our
    investment in those wells. The seismic data and other
    technologies we use do not allow us to know conclusively prior
    to drilling a well that crude or natural gas is present or may
    be produced economically. The costs of drilling, completing and
    operating wells are often uncertain, and drilling operations may
    be curtailed, delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of
    factors including, but not limited to:

•

unexpected drilling conditions;

•

pressure or irregularities in formations;

•

equipment failures or accidents;

•

fires, explosions, blowouts and surface cratering;

•

marine risks such as capsizing, collisions and hurricanes;

•

other adverse weather conditions; and

•

increase in the cost of, or shortages or delays in the
    availability of, drilling rigs and equipment.

Certain future drilling activities may not be successful and, if
    unsuccessful, this failure could have an adverse effect on our
    future results of operations and financial condition. While all
    drilling, whether developmental or exploratory, involves these
    risks, exploratory drilling involves greater risks of dry holes
    or failure to find commercial quantities of hydrocarbons.


Risks
    arising from the failure to fully identify potential problems
    related to acquired reserves or to properly estimate those
    reserves

Although we perform a review of the acquired properties that we
    believe is consistent with industry practices, such reviews are
    inherently incomplete. It generally is not feasible to review in
    depth every individual property involved in each acquisition.
    Ordinarily, we will focus our review efforts on the higher-value
    properties and will sample the remainder. However, even a
    detailed review of records and properties may not necessarily
    reveal existing or potential problems, nor will it permit a
    buyer to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to
    assess fully their deficiencies and potential. Inspections may
    not always be performed on every well, and environmental
    problems, such as ground water contamination, are not
    necessarily observable even when an inspection is undertaken.
    Even when problems are identified, we often assume certain
    environmental and other risks and liabilities in connection with
    acquired properties. There are numerous uncertainties inherent
    in estimating quantities of proved oil and gas reserves and
    actual future production rates and associated costs with respect
    to acquired properties, and actual results may vary
    substantially from those assumed in the estimates. In addition,
    there can be no assurance that acquisitions will not have an
    adverse effect upon our operating results, particularly during
    the periods in which the operations of acquired businesses are
    being integrated into our ongoing operations.

Our
    North American operations are subject to governmental risks that
    may impact our operations

Our North American operations have been, and at times in the
    future may be, affected by political developments and by
    federal, state, provincial and local laws and regulations such
    as restrictions on production, changes in taxes, royalties and
    other amounts payable to governments or governmental agencies,
    price or gathering rate controls and environmental protection
    laws and regulations.

International
    operations have uncertain political, economic and other
    risks

Our operations outside North America are based primarily in
    Egypt, Australia, the United Kingdom and Argentina. On a barrel
    equivalent basis, approximately 44 percent of our 2007
    production was outside North America and approximately
    36 percent of our estimated proved oil and gas reserves on
    December 31, 2007 were located outside North America. As a
    result, we face political and economic risks and other
    uncertainties that are more prevalent than our North American
    operations. Such factors include, but are not limited to:

•

general strikes and civil unrest;

•

the risk of war, acts of terrorism, expropriation, forced
    renegotiation or modification of existing contracts;

•

import and export regulations;

•

taxation policies, including royalty and tax increases and
    retroactive tax claims, and investment restrictions;

•

price control;

•

transportation regulations and tariffs;

•

constrained natural gas markets dependent on demand in a single
    or limited geographical area;

•

exchange controls, currency fluctuations, devaluation or other
    activities that limit or disrupt markets and restrict payments
    or the movement of funds;

•

laws and policies of the United States affecting foreign trade,
    including trade sanctions;

•

the possibility of being subject to exclusive jurisdiction of
    foreign courts in connection with legal disputes relating to
    licenses to operate and concession rights in countries where we
    currently operate;

•

the possible inability to subject foreign persons to the
    jurisdiction of courts in the United States; and

•

difficulties in enforcing our rights against a governmental
    agency because of the doctrine of sovereign immunity and foreign
    sovereignty over international operations.

Foreign countries have occasionally asserted rights to oil and
    gas properties through border disputes. If a country claims
    superior rights to oil and gas leases or concessions granted to
    us by another country, our interests


could decrease in value or be lost. Even our smaller
    international assets may affect our overall business and results
    of operations by distracting management’s attention from
    our more significant assets. Various regions of the world have a
    history of political and economic instability. This instability
    could result in new governments or the adoption of new policies
    that might result in a substantially more hostile attitude
    toward foreign investment. In an extreme case, such a change
    could result in termination of contract rights and expropriation
    of foreign-owned assets. This could adversely affect our
    interests and our future profitability.

The impact that future terrorist attacks or regional hostilities
    may have on the oil and gas industry in general, and on our
    operations in particular, is not known at this time. Uncertainty
    surrounding military strikes or a sustained military campaign
    may affect operations in unpredictable ways, including
    disruptions of fuel supplies and markets, particularly oil, and
    the possibility that infrastructure facilities, including
    pipelines, production facilities, processing plants and
    refineries, could be direct targets of, or indirect casualties
    of, an act of terror or war. We may be required to incur
    significant costs in the future to safeguard our assets against
    terrorist activities.

On December 23, 2004, Apache entered into a

20-year

insurance contract with the Overseas Private Investment
    Corporation (OPIC) which provides $300 million of political
    risk insurance for the Company’s Egyptian operations. This
    policy insures us against (1) non-payment by EGPC of
    arbitral awards covering amounts owed Apache on past due
    invoices and (2) expropriation of exportable petroleum when
    actions taken by the Government of Egypt prevent Apache from
    exporting our share of production.

The Company also purchases multi-year commercial political risk
    insurance contracts from highly rated international insurers
    covering portions of its investments in Egypt and Argentina. The
    insurance provides coverage for confiscation, nationalization,
    and expropriation risks and currency inconvertibility. Effective
    March 23, 2007, the Company entered into an additional
    multi-year insurance contract with OPIC to provide
    $200 million of coverage for Egypt in excess of the
    commercial insurance program.

We
    have limited control over the activities on properties we do not
    operate

Other companies operate some of the properties in which we have
    an interest. We have limited ability to influence or control the
    operation or future development of these non-operated properties
    or the amount of capital expenditures that we are required to
    fund with respect to them. Our dependence on the operator and
    other working interest owners for these projects and our limited
    ability to influence or control the operation and future
    development of these properties could materially adversely
    affect the realization of our targeted returns on capital and
    lead to unexpected future costs.

Material
    differences between the estimated and actual timing of critical
    events may affect the completion and commencement of production
    from development projects

We are involved in several large development projects whose
    completion may be delayed beyond our anticipated completion
    dates. Our projects may be delayed by project approvals from
    joint venture partners; timely issuances of permits and licenses
    by governmental agencies; weather conditions; manufacturing and
    delivery schedules of critical equipment; and other unforeseen
    events. Delays and differences between estimate and actual
    timing of critical events may adversely affect our forward
    looking statements related to large development projects, and
    our ability to participate in large scale development projects
    in the future.

Our
    operations are sensitive to currency rate
    fluctuations

Our operations are sensitive to fluctuations in foreign currency
    exchange rates, particularly between the U.S. dollar with
    the Canadian dollar, the Australian dollar and the British
    Pound. Our financial statements, presented in U.S. dollars,
    are affected by foreign currency fluctuations through both
    translation risk and transaction risk. Volatility in exchanges
    rates may adversely affect our results of operation,
    particularly by a weakening U.S. dollar relative to other
    currencies.


Weather
    and climate may have a significant impact on our revenues and
    productivity

Demand for oil and natural gas are, to a significant degree,
    dependent on weather and climate, which impacts the price we
    receive for the commodities we produce. In addition, our
    exploration and development activities and equipment can be
    adversely affected by severe weather, such as hurricanes in the
    Gulf of Mexico or cyclones offshore Australia, which may cause a
    loss of production from temporary cessation of activity or lost
    or damaged equipment. While our planning for normal climatic
    variation, insurance program, and emergency recovery plans
    mitigate the effects of the weather, not all such effects can be
    predicted, eliminated or insured against.

Costs
    incurred related to environmental matters

We, as an owner or lessee and operator of oil and gas
    properties, are subject to various federal, provincial, state,
    local and foreign country laws and regulations relating to
    discharge of materials into, and protection of the environment.
    These laws and regulations may, among other things, impose
    liability on the lessee under an oil and gas lease for the cost
    of pollution

clean-up

resulting from operations, subject the lessee to liability for
    pollution damages, and require suspension or cessation of
    operations in affected areas.

We have made and will continue to make expenditures in our
    efforts to comply with these requirements, which we believe are
    necessary business costs in the oil and gas industry. We have
    established policies for continuing compliance with
    environmental laws and regulations, including regulations
    applicable to our operations in all countries in which we do
    business. We also have established operational procedures and
    training programs designed to minimize the environmental impact
    of our field facilities. Apache manages its exposure to
    environmental liabilities on properties to be acquired by
    identifying existing problems and assessing the potential
    liability. The costs incurred by these policies and procedures
    are inextricably connected to normal operating expenses such
    that we are unable to separate the expenses related to
    environmental matters; however, we do not believe any such
    additional expenses are material to our financial position or
    results of operations.

The Company also conducts periodic reviews, on a company-wide
    basis, to identify changes in its environmental risk profile.
    These reviews evaluate whether there is a probable liability,
    its amount, and the likelihood that the liability will be
    incurred. The amount of any potential liability is determined by
    considering, among other matters, incremental direct costs of
    any likely remediation and the proportionate cost of our
    employees who are expected to devote a significant amount of
    time to any possible remediation effort. Our general policy is
    to limit any reserve additions to incidents or sites that are
    considered probable to result in an expected remediation cost
    exceeding $300,000.

We maintain insurance coverage, which we believe is customary in
    the industry, although we are not fully insured against all
    environmental risks. As described in Note 9 —
    Commitments and Contingencies of Item 15, in this

Form 10-K,

on December 31, 2007, we had an accrued liability of
    $28 million for environmental remediation. We have not
    incurred any material environmental remediation costs in any of
    the periods presented and we are not aware of any future
    environmental remediation matters that would be material to our
    financial position or results of operations.

Although environmental requirements have a substantial impact
    upon the energy industry, generally these requirements do not
    appear to affect us any differently, or to any greater or lesser
    extent, than other upstream companies in the industry. We do not
    believe that compliance with federal, provincial, state, local
    or foreign country provisions regulating the discharge of
    materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the
    protection of the environment, will have a material adverse
    effect upon the capital expenditures, earnings or competitive
    position of Apache or its subsidiaries; however, there is no
    assurance that changes in or additions to laws or regulations
    regarding the protection of the environment will not have such
    an impact.

Industry
    competition

Strong competition exists in all sectors of the oil and gas
    exploration and production industry. We compete with major
    integrated and other independent oil and gas companies for
    acquisition of oil and gas leases, properties and reserves,
    equipment and labor required to explore, develop and operate
    those properties and the marketing of oil and natural gas
    production. Higher recent crude oil and natural gas prices have
    increased the costs of properties


available for acquisition and the number of companies with the
    financial resources to pursue acquisition opportunities. Many of
    our competitors have financial and other resources substantially
    larger than we possess and have established strategic long-term
    positions and maintain strong governmental relationships in
    countries in which we may seek new entry. As a consequence, we
    may be at a competitive disadvantage in bidding for drilling
    rights. In addition, many of our larger competitors may have a
    competitive advantage when responding to factors that affect
    demand for oil and natural gas production, such as changing
    worldwide prices and levels of production, the cost and
    availability of alternative fuels and the application of
    government regulations. We also compete in attracting and
    retaining personnel, including geologists, geo-physicists,
    engineers and other specialists.

Insurance
    does not cover all risks

Exploration for and production of oil and natural gas can be
    hazardous, involving unforeseen occurrences such as blowouts,
    cratering, fires and loss of well control, which can result in

MANAGEMENT’S
    DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
    OPERATIONS

Our accompanying consolidated financial statements, including
    the notes thereto, contain detailed information that should be
    referred to in conjunction with the following discussion.

Executive
    Overview

Apache Corporation (Apache or the Company) is one of the largest
    independent (non-integrated) oil and natural gas upstream
    companies in the United States (U.S.). At Apache, we strive to
    generate competitive returns and build a profitable oil and gas
    company for the long-term benefit of our shareholders using the
    following strategy:

•

Build a balanced portfolio of assets which provides a platform
    for profitable growth through drilling and acquisitions across
    the cycles of our dynamic industry;

•

Maintain financial discipline and a strong balance
    sheet; and

•

Maximize cash flow and earnings from each unit of production by
    controlling administrative, operating and capital costs.

A key part of our strategy is balancing our portfolio through
    diversity of geological risk, political risk, hydrocarbon mix
    (crude oil versus natural gas) and reserve life in order to
    achieve consistency in results. Our portfolio of geographic
    locations provides variation of all of these factors and,
    additionally, in the case of Australia and Argentina, the
    potential for increasing the value of our investments through
    rising natural gas prices. We currently have operations in the
    United States (Central and Gulf Coast regions), Canada, Egypt,
    the United Kingdom sector of the North Sea, Australia and
    Argentina. We are finalizing contracts for two exploration
    blocks in Chile. Each region has a significant producing asset
    base as well as large undeveloped acreage positions which


provide room for growth. In 2007, no single region contributed
    more than 26 percent of our production or reserves. We seek
    to maintain diversity of reserve life, which translates into
    balance in the timing of returns on our investments. Reserve
    life (estimated reserves divided by annual production) in our
    regions ranges from as short as six years to as long as
    20 years. By maintaining a balanced hydrocarbon mix, we are
    protecting against price deterioration in a given product while
    retaining upside potential through a significant increase in
    either commodity price. For example, in 2007, oil and liquids
    provided 47 percent of our production, but 65 percent
    of our total oil and gas revenues. We were well positioned to
    realize the benefit of higher oil prices, which significantly
    outpaced natural gas price increases. At year-end, our estimated
    proved reserves were also balanced at 54 percent natural
    gas and 46 percent crude oil and liquids. Additionally, in
    each region, we have attained a critical mass that supports
    sustainable lower-risk drilling opportunities, balanced by
    higher-risk, higher-reward exploration. In 2007, we drilled, or
    participated in, 1,101 gross wells with an overall
    87 percent success rate; 89 percent were developmental
    and 11 percent exploratory.

We believe our balanced portfolio strategy enhances our ability
    to deliver long-term production growth, increase proved reserves
    at a reasonable economic cost and achieve competitive investment
    rates of return for the benefit of our shareholders. Our
    management and incentive systems underscore high cash flow and
    appropriate risk taking to reach or exceed targeted hurdle rates
    of return on invested capital. These are measured monthly,
    reviewed with management quarterly and utilized to determine
    annual performance awards. We review capital allocations, at
    least quarterly, through a disciplined and focused process of
    reviewing internally generated drilling prospects, opportunities
    for tactical acquisitions, land positions with additional
    drilling prospects or, occasionally, new core areas which could
    enhance our portfolio. We continue to deliver strong results
    with 2007 return on capital employed and return on equity of
    16 percent and 20 percent, respectively. Also in 2007,
    we increased reserves for the

nd

consecutive
    year and production for the

th

of
    the last 29 years, a testament to our balanced portfolio
    approach.

We periodically evaluate our properties to determine whether
    sales of certain assets could provide opportunities to redeploy
    our capital resources to rebalance our portfolio and enhance
    prospective returns. As a result of this process, in 2007 we
    sold non-strategic oil and gas properties located in northwest
    Louisiana for approximately $56 million and contracted to
    sell others for approximately $309 million. The assets
    under contract are expected to close in the first quarter of
    2008.

Preserving financial flexibility is key to our overall business
    philosophy. We ended 2007 with a year-end debt-to-capitalization
    ratio of 22 percent, despite current year capital
    investments of $5.8 billion, excluding asset retirement
    costs. In tightening credit markets, Apache’s single-A debt
    ratings provide a competitive advantage in accessing capital.

The third critical component of our overall strategy is
    maximization of earnings and cash flow. Both are significantly
    impacted by commodity prices, our ability to economically add
    reserves through drilling and acquisitions, and controlling
    costs to add and produce reserves. Commodity prices fluctuate
    and are influenced by factors beyond our control, including
    worldwide supply and demand, political stability and
    governmental actions and regulations. While historically high
    prices have increased our oil and gas revenues in 2007, they
    also led to increased industry competition and consequently
    rising costs. Drilling, operating and administrative costs
    continue to increase from both inflationary pressures from
    higher commodity prices and the weakened U.S. dollar. We
    have experienced additional cost increases, particularly in the
    U.S., with higher demand resulting from activity to repair
    damage caused by the 2005 Gulf of Mexico hurricanes. Increased
    demand for producing oil and gas properties has also resulted in
    higher acquisition prices. We closely monitor drilling and
    acquisition cost trends in each of our core areas relative to
    product prices and, when appropriate, adjust our capital budgets
    accordingly. In addition, we


actively seek to identify and pursue alternatives to maintain
    efficient levels of costs and expenses. Despite pressure from
    rising costs, 2007 pre-tax margins were our second highest on
    record. We calculate pre-tax margins as follows:

Operating
    Highlights

We made considerable operational progress during the year which
    we believe adds to our platform for long-term profitable growth.
    Key operational highlights include:

U.S. Central

•

Our $1 billion acquisition of producing properties in the
    Permian basin of West Texas and a successful drilling program
    contributed to another year of growth with productions and
    reserves increasing 17 and 15 percent, respectively. These
    acquired properties had an estimated 70 MMboe at the end of
    2006 and compliment our existing long-lived Permian basin assets.

U.S. Gulf Coast

•

In September 2007, we executed a farm-in agreement securing
    exploration and development opportunities in deep rights below
    the Austin chalk on approximately 400,000 net acres.

•

Our Gulf Coast region increased daily equivalent production
    25 percent upon restoration of final production outages
    from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, successful drilling and
    recompletion programs and a full year of production from
    properties acquired in June 2006.

Canada

•

We drilled and tested one horizontal well and conducted
    long-term production tests on two vertical wells in our Ootla
    shale gas play in British Columbia. Encouraged by our results,
    we acquired additional acreage in the play during the year,
    bringing our total position to 400,000 gross (200,000 net)
    acres.

Egypt

•

We doubled our acreage position with a 50 percent interest
    in four new concessions, adding 10.5 million gross acres of
    exploration potential. Progress is being made on our Salam gas
    plant expansion, which should be completed by the end of 2008,
    adding approximately 90 to 100 million cubic feet per day

(MMcf/d)

and
    4,500 barrels per day (b/d) of capacity net to Apache. We
    also continued expansion of several waterflood projects with
    further drilling and increased water injection capacity.

Australia

•

In 2007 we announced discoveries in the Julimar, Julimar East
    and Brunello fields on Australia’s Northwest Shelf. The
    discovery which could potentially be the largest field ever
    found by Apache, will be further appraised in 2008. We own a
    65 percent working interest in the Julimar-Brunello complex.

•

The Pyrenees development, operated by BHP Billiton (BHP), was
    sanctioned in 2007. Construction will begin in 2008 with
    development drilling to start in early 2009. This project is
    expected to commence production in early 2010 at an estimated
    net rate of 20,000 b/d.

•

We executed a contract for a Floating Production Storage and
    Offloading vessel (FPSO) that will be used in the
    $500 million Van Gogh development in Western
    Australia’s Exmouth Basin. We own 52.5 percent of the
    development, which was sanctioned in 2007. Production is
    expected to come online in 2009, adding an estimated 20,000 b/d
    to our net production.


•

We sanctioned the construction of a pipeline and an onshore
    natural gas processing plant for our Reindeer gas project in
    2007. The field is slated to begin producing in the middle of
    2010 at an estimated net rate of

60 MMcf/d.

•

In 2007 our average realized gas price increased
    15 percent, or $.24 per Mcf, with considerable upward
    pressure on prices of newly contracted gas.

North Sea

•

Significant investments in platform upgrades continued in 2007.
    With production averaging almost 54,000 b/d, the Forties remains
    Apache’s largest value field in terms of production,
    reserves, and cash flow.

Argentina

•

In 2007 Apache completed 1,700 square kilometers of a
    nearly 2,500 square kilometer

3-D

seismic
    mega shoot in Tierra del Fuego. The program will be completed in
    2008.

•

In December 2007, Apache announced that the first significant
    well drilled from a location identified in the three-dimensional
    seismic survey in Tierra del Fuego began producing at a rate of
    approximately 1,600 b/d and

1.3 MMcf/d

from the Lower Cretaceous Springhill sandstone.

•

In 2007 our average realized gas price increased
    21 percent, up $.20 per Mcf.

Chile

•

In November 2007, Apache was awarded the exploration rights on
    two blocks comprising one million net acres in Chile at a bid
    round. This acreage is adjacent to our 552,000 net acres on
    the Argentinean side of Tierra del Fuego and represents a
    natural extension of our expanding exploration and production
    operations. Apache is finalizing the contracts with the Chilean
    government and plans to begin shooting

3-D

seismic
    in 2008.

Financial
    Highlights

In 2007, records were achieved in the key financial measures of
    earnings, cash flow, revenues, production and year-end estimated
    reserves. Financial highlights for 2007 relative to 2006 include:

•

Record earnings of $2.8 billion, up 10 percent.

•

Record cash provided by operating activities of
    $5.7 billion, up 32 percent.

•

Record oil and gas revenues of $10 billion, up
    23 percent.

•

Record production of 561,239 boe per day, up 12 percent.

•

Record oil prices averaged $68.84 per bbl, up 15 percent;
    gas prices averaged $5.34 per Mcf, up three percent.

•

Capital expenditures totaled $5.8 billion; including
    $4.3 billion for exploration and development (excluding
    asset retirement obligations), $1 billion for acquisitions
    and $473 million for gathering, transmission and processing
    facilities.

•

Record estimated reserves of 2.4 billion barrels of oil
    equivalent, up six percent.

Oil
    and Natural Gas Prices

Our revenues are sensitive to changes in prices received for our
    products. A substantial portion of our production is sold at
    prevailing market prices which fluctuate in response to many
    factors that are outside of our control. Given the current
    tightly balanced market, small variations in either supply,
    demand, or both, can have dramatic effects on prices we receive
    for our oil and natural gas production. Political instability
    and availability of alternative fuels could impact worldwide
    supply, while other economic factors could impact demand.

While the market price received for crude oil and natural gas
    varies among geographic areas, crude oil trades in a worldwide
    market. Generally, price movements for all types and grades of
    crude oil move in the same direction. Apache manages a portion
    of its exposure to fluctuations in crude oil prices using
    financial instruments.

In Argentina, we are currently selling our oil in the domestic
    market. The government imposed a sliding-scale tax on oil
    exports which effectively limits the amount we are able to
    receive in the domestic market to a parity price equivalent to
    the price of exported crude oil after adjusting for export
    taxes. Effective November 19, 2007, the export tax
    regulations were further modified and now include a cap of
    $42.00 per barrel when WTI is $60.90 or greater. In TdF, the
    price cap applies but Apache retains the
    21 percent Value Added Tax collected from buyers,
    effectively increasing realized prices.

Natural gas, which has a limited global transportation system,
    is more subject to local supply and demand conditions. The
    majority of our gas sales contracts are indexed to prevailing
    local market prices. Apache uses a variety of strategies to
    manage our exposure to fluctuations in natural gas prices
    including fixed-price contracts and derivatives.

Apache primarily sells natural gas into four markets:

1) North America, which has a common market and where
    supply and demand are currently tightly balanced; creating a
    volatile pricing environment where most of our gas is sold on a
    monthly or daily basis at either monthly or daily market prices.

2) Egypt, where the majority of our gas is sold to Egyptian
    General Petroleum Corporation (EGPC) under an industry pricing
    formula indexed to Dated-Brent crude oil with a maximum price of
    $2.65 per MMbtu. Apache has retained the previous gas price
    formula (without a price cap) until 2013 on up to

100 gross MMcf/d.

3) Australia, which has a local market with mostly
    long-term fixed-price contracts that are periodically adjusted
    for changes in Australia’s consumer price index.

4) Argentina, where we receive low government-regulated
    pricing on a substantial portion of our production. The volumes
    we are required to sell at regulated prices are set by the
    government and vary with seasonal factors and industry category.
    During the year, we realized an average price of $.76 per Mcf on
    government regulated sales. The majority of the remaining
    volumes were sold at market-driven prices, in excess of $2.00
    per Mcf at year-end.

Year
    2007 Compared to Year 2006

Crude Oil Revenues

Apache’s 2007
    consolidated crude oil revenues totaled $6.3 billion,
    $1.3 billion above 2006, with nearly equal contributions
    from an 11 percent rise in production and a 15 percent
    increase in our realized oil price. On the whole, production
    increased an average 24,523 barrels per day (b/d), driven
    by the U.S. which was up 23,927 b/d. Crude oil price
    realizations averaged $68.84 per barrel for the year, $83.00 in
    the fourth quarter alone.

U.S. oil revenues were up $879 million to
    $2.2 billion with $580 million, or two-thirds of the
    increase, attributable to a 36 percent increase in
    production. A 23 percent increase in realized prices added
    the remaining $299 million. Gulf Coast production climbed
    48 percent to 53,842 b/d, mainly on production restored
    from hurricane damaged properties, a full year of production
    from Gulf of Mexico properties acquired in June 2006 and
    successful drilling and recompletion activities. Central region
    production grew 21 percent to 36,917 b/d, with the addition
    of Permian basin properties acquired from Anadarko Petroleum
    Corporation (Anadarko) in March 2007 and successful drilling and
    recompletion activities.

In Egypt, crude oil revenues rose $294 million, to
    $1.6 billion, with increased production generating an
    additional $110 million of revenues. The balance of the
    increase in revenues, $184 million, came from a
    14 percent increase in realized prices, which were up $8.91
    to $72.51 per barrel. Daily production averaged 60,735 b/d, up
    seven percent. Production gains were associated with development
    drilling in the Khalda and Matruh concessions as well as the
    East Bahariya, Umbarka, El Diyur and North El Diyur concessions.

Australia’s crude oil revenues of $401 million
    increased 35 percent, or $105 million. Production was
    16 percent higher generating $55 million of the
    increase. Production growth resulted from an additional interest
    acquired in the Legendre field, completion of West Cycad wells,
    and increased liquids from the Bambra, Wonnich Deep, Doric and
    Lee gas wells. Australia’s price realizations rose
    17 percent to $79.79 per barrel, the highest in the
    Company, generating an additional $50 million of revenue.

Argentina’s oil revenues increased $85 million to
    $192 million, with over 90 percent of the increase
    associated with 67 percent higher production. The year 2007
    benefited from a full year of production from acquisitions made
    in 2006, as well as successful drilling, workover and
    recompletion activity during the year. Higher volumes added
    $77 million to revenues, with price increases adding
    $8 million. Argentina’s realized oil prices averaged
    $45.99 per barrel, up seven percent from the prior year.

North Sea oil revenues increased $41 million to
    $1.4 billion. Oil prices averaged $70.93 per barrel, up
    13 percent, adding $168 million in revenues.
    Production averaged 53,632 b/d, down eight percent, reducing


revenues by $127 million. Production increases on three of
    our platforms were more than offset by declines from wells at
    the Alpha and Echo platforms while drilling operations were
    postponed for facility upgrades. Drilling operations on the
    Alpha platform will resume in 2008.

Canada’s oil revenues increased $15 million to
    $467 million, with a 14 percent price increase mostly
    offset by a nine percent decline in production. Prices averaged
    $68.29 per barrel, up from $59.90 in 2006. Production dropped in
    2007 primarily because of natural decline resulting from a
    38 percent reduction in exploration and development capital
    invested in Canada compared to 2006.

China had no crude oil revenues in 2007 compared to
    $73 million in the prior year, a result of our August 2006
    asset divestiture and exit from China.

Natural Gas Revenues

Apache’s natural gas
    revenues increased 17 percent, or $503 million, to
    $3.5 billion. Higher production contributed
    $405 million of the additional revenues. Gas production
    averaged

1,796 MMcf/d,

up 13 percent from 2006. Natural gas prices increased $.17
    to an average $5.34 per Mcf, generating an additional
    $98 million in revenue.

U.S. natural gas revenues grew by $385 million to
    nearly $2 billion. U.S. production rose
    15 percent, boosting revenues $264 million. Gulf Coast
    production increased 16 percent, boosted by final
    production restoration on hurricane damaged properties, a full
    year of production from Gulf of Mexico properties acquired in
    June 2006, and successful drilling and recompletion activities.
    Central region production climbed 14 percent on successful
    drilling and recompletion activities and the addition of Permian
    basin properties acquired in March 2007. Higher natural gas
    prices, which averaged $7.04 per Mcf compared to $6.54 in 2006,
    added $121 million to revenues.

Gas revenues in Egypt were up $53 million, to
    $404 million, on an 11 percent increase in production
    and a four percent increase in price realizations. Production
    gains of

23 MMcf/d

boosted the region’s average output to

241 MMcf/d,

generating an additional $39 million in revenues.
    Production gains resulted from higher throughput and less
    downtime at the Obaiyed plant compared to 2006 and new wells in
    the North East Abu Gharadig (NEAG) concession. Higher prices
    added another $14 million.

Australia’s natural gas revenues increased $22 million
    to $134 million, on higher price realizations and
    production gains. Price realizations improved 15 percent,
    adding $16 million to revenues. A five percent
    demand-driven rise in production generated another
    $6 million of revenues.

Argentina’s natural gas revenues more than doubled to
    $86 million, bolstered by a full year of production from
    2006 property acquisitions, successful drilling and recompletion
    activities and a 21 percent increase in price realizations.
    Production grew

89 MMcf/d,

or 79 percent, generating $38 million of new revenues.
    The price gain added another $8 million.

Canada’s natural gas revenues decreased $6 million, to
    $892 million on a four percent decline in production.
    Production, which averaged

388 MMcf/d,

was impacted by natural decline which more than offset increases
    from drilling and recompletion activities. Our exploration and
    development capital investment in Canada was 38 percent lower
    than 2006. Lower production reduced revenues by
    $37 million. Natural gas prices rose $.21, to $6.30 per
    Mcf, increasing revenues $31 million.

Year
    2006 Compared to Year 2005

Crude Oil Revenues

Crude oil revenues in 2006
    increased $498 million from 2005 to $4.9 billion.
    Price gains across all regions, which averaged $8.26 more per
    barrel than 2005, generated an additional $706 million of
    revenues. These additional revenues were partially offset by the
    effect of a four percent decline in production. All segments
    reported a significant increase in realized crude oil price,
    with Argentina, Egypt, and the U.S. also benefiting from
    production growth compared to 2005.

Egypt generated an additional $233 million of crude oil
    revenue in 2006. An 18 percent increase in crude oil price
    realizations, generated $200 million of the additional
    revenues, with the remainder coming from a three percent
    increase in production. While Egypt experienced production
    growth in many areas, the predominate contributor was from
    drilling results at the Khalda Concession which benefited from a
    full year of associated condensate related to increased Qasr
    field gas production.


U.S. crude oil revenues for 2006 increased
    $162 million, with a 13 percent increase in crude oil
    price realizations contributing $151 million of the
    additional revenues and a small increase in 2006 oil production
    contributing the remaining $11 million. The third-quarter
    2005 hurricanes reduced Apache’s 2006 average annual daily
    crude oil production 13,100 b/d, compared to 10,813 b/d in 2005.
    Shut-in production reduced the Company’s 2006 and 2005
    crude oil revenues by approximately $297 million and
    $186 million, respectively. Central region production rose
    18 percent, reflecting drilling and recompletion activity
    in the Permian basin and southeast New Mexico, and the Amerada
    Hess acquired properties. Gulf Coast production was
    10 percent below 2005 levels with downtime, hurricane
    production shut-ins and natural decline outpacing growth
    attributed to drilling and recompletion activity and the BP
    acquired properties.

Argentina’s 2006 oil revenues increased $91 million
    over 2005 with $89 million of the increase associated with
    production growth, driven primarily by acquired properties and
    subsequent exploitation activities. Higher oil price
    realizations generated the other $2 million.

The North Sea’s 2006 crude oil revenues were
    $80 million higher than 2005 with $240 million of
    additional revenues generated from a 19 percent increase in
    price realizations, partially offset by lower production, which
    was down 11 percent on a comparative basis. Production was
    lower in 2006 primarily because of production interruptions
    associated with commissioning of major infrastructure projects
    and temporary unplanned shutdown of the third-party Forties
    Pipeline System during the third quarter of 2006. The focus on
    upgrades in 2006 also displaced drilling operations necessary to
    mitigate natural decline.

Canada’s 2006 oil revenues increased $17 million over
    2005, with $56 million of additional revenues associated
    with higher price realizations, partially offset by lower
    production, which was down eight percent. Canadian production
    was down in most areas as natural decline exceeded drilling and
    production enhancement activities.

Australia’s 2006 crude oil revenues were $27 million
    less than 2005, as a 23 percent decline in production more
    than offset an 18 percent increase in realized price. The
    production decrease resulted from normal field decline which
    offset a full year of associated condensate production from the
    John Brookes field and other development activities, mainly in
    the Bambra, Zephyrus and Stag areas.

China’s 2006 oil revenues were $59 million less than
    2005, a consequence of the August 2006 divestiture.

Natural Gas Revenues

Our 2006 consolidated
    natural gas revenues increased $73 million from the prior
    year with $614 million of additional revenues generated
    from production growth mostly offset by the effect of a
    19 percent decline in realized prices. All core gas
    producing regions generated additional revenues in 2006 from
    production growth; however they were mostly offset by lower
    relative natural gas prices.

Egypt contributed $73 million more to 2006 consolidated
    natural gas revenues on a 31 percent increase in production
    and a four percent decrease in realized gas prices. The
    year-over-year production growth came primarily from the Khalda
    concession, mostly attributable to a full year of production
    from the Qasr field.

Argentina’s 2006 natural gas revenues increased
    $38 million, with all of the additional revenues associated
    with production growth. As with oil, the production growth
    primarily came from acquired properties and subsequent
    exploitation activities.

Australia’s 2006 natural gas revenues were $35 million
    higher than 2005. Natural gas production increases added
    $38 million to revenues, while lower gas price realizations
    reduced revenues $3 million. The additional production was
    attributed to a full year of production from the John Brookes
    field.

U.S. natural gas revenues were $17 million higher in
    2006. U.S. natural gas production, up 12 percent,
    contributed $166 million of additional revenues, while a
    nine percent price decline lowered revenues $149 million.
    The 2005 hurricanes reduced Apache’s 2006 average annual
    daily natural gas production

37 MMcf/d

compared to

59 MMcf/d

in 2005. Shut-in production from the hurricanes reduced the
    Company’s 2006 and 2005 natural gas revenues by
    approximately $95 million and $211 million,
    respectively. Central region production rose 16 percent
    from 2005, benefiting from drilling and recompletion activity,
    primarily in central and western Oklahoma, in East Texas and
    from acquired properties. Gulf Coast region production was nine
    percent above 2005 levels on the BP


acquired properties, hurricane restoration, and drilling and
    recompletion activity, principally in the Chauvin, Ship Shoal
    and South Timbalier fields.

Canada’s 2006 natural gas revenues decreased
    $91 million from 2005. An additional $72 million of
    revenues generated from a nine percent increase in production
    were more than offset by the impact of a 16 percent
    decrease in realized natural gas prices. Canada’s
    production growth was concentrated in the North and South Grant
    Lands and Kabob areas, with activity in other areas more than
    offset by natural decline.

Costs

The table below compares our costs on an absolute dollar basis
    and an equivalent unit of production (boe) basis. Our discussion

Full-cost DD&A expense totaled $2.2 billion,
    $509 million more than 2006. Production growth drove
    $210 million of the increase; the remainder is a
    consequence of higher costs. DD&A per boe averaged $10.78,
    $1.49 higher than 2006 as the costs to acquire, find and develop
    reserves continued to exceed our historical cost basis.
    Increasing costs also impact our estimates for future
    development of known reserves and estimates to abandon
    properties, both of which impact our full-cost depletion rate.

DD&A on other assets increased $22 million to
    $140 million with facilities coming online, in Canada,
    Egypt and the U.S. A full year of DD&A on assets
    acquired during 2006 in Argentina also contributed to the
    year-over-year increase.

Lease Operating Expenses (LOE)

LOE is
    comprised of several components: direct operating costs, repair
    and maintenance, ad valorem taxes, and workover costs.

Direct operating costs are generally driven by commodity price
    levels, the type of commodity produced and the location of
    properties (i.e. offshore, onshore, remote locations, etc).
    Rising commodity prices impact operating cost


elements directly and indirectly. They directly impact costs
    such as power, fuel, and chemicals which are commodity price
    based. Other items such as labor, boats, helicopters and
    materials and supplies are indirectly impacted as high prices
    increase activity and demand and thus, costs. Our operating
    costs increased 12 percent in 2007 and 19 percent in
    2006 when compared to the prior year driven by increasing
    commodity prices. Our average realized commodity price per boe
    for 2007 was 10 percent higher than 2006, eight percent
    higher than 2005, and 50 percent higher than 2004. Oil is
    inherently more expensive to produce than natural gas. Oil and
    liquids were 47 percent of our production in both 2007 and
    2006. A significant portion of our ad valorem taxes are reserve
    based and increase when prices rise. Repair and maintenance
    costs are higher on offshore properties and in areas with remote
    plants and facilities. All production in Australia and the North
    Sea and over 80 percent from the U.S. Gulf Coast
    region is from offshore properties. Workovers accelerate
    production; hence, they generally rise with commodity prices. In
    addition, workover activity generally increases after
    acquisitions. Fluctuations in exchange rates impact the
    Company’s LOE, with a weakening U.S. dollar adding to
    per unit costs and a strengthening U.S. dollar lowering per
    unit costs in our international regions. In 2007, the
    U.S. dollar weakened 18, 11 and two percent relative to the
    Canadian dollar, the Australian dollar and the British Pound,
    respectively.

The following discussion will focus on

per-unit

costs which we believe to be the most meaningful measure for
    analyzing LOE.

LOE averaged $8.33 per boe, an increase of $.88. Almost
    two-thirds of the increase was from additional workover activity
    ($.16), a weakening U.S. dollar ($.16), hurricane repair
    activity ($.15), incentive-based compensation ($.07) and ad
    valorem taxes ($.03). The remaining increase is the result of
    the inflationary impact of higher commodity prices on all other
    operating costs, as described above.

The U.S. contributed $.45 to the $.88 per boe increase.
    Driving factors in the increase were additional hurricane
    repairs ($.15), more workover activity ($.13), acquired Permian
    basin oil properties which carry a higher rate than our
    historical average ($.05), incremental incentive-based
    compensation with Apache’s rising stock price ($.04),
    higher ad valorem taxes ($.03), and the inflationary impact
    higher commodity prices have on operating costs ($.05). Over
    two-thirds of the increase in workover activity occurred on
    properties acquired in March 2007, in the Permian basin of West
    Texas.

Canada added $.34 per boe to the consolidated rate, $.09 of
    which was attributed to a decline in relative production. A
    weakening U.S. dollar negatively impacted the rate an
    additional $.09. The balance of the increase related to higher
    levels of workover activity ($.03), higher ad valorem taxes
    ($.02), lease rentals ($.02), company labor ($.02) and generally
    higher costs.

The North Sea increased the consolidated rate $.09 per boe; the
    net impact of a $.10 per boe increase on a decline in production
    volumes and a reduction of $.01 on lower costs. The benefit of
    decreases in diesel fuel consumption ($.08) and lower turnaround
    expenses more than offset increases from the impact of the
    weakening U.S. dollar ($.05), higher standby and supply
    boat costs ($.01) and higher contract labor ($.01). We are
    seeing the benefits of several years of facility upgrades to
    reduce the operating costs, including completion of our power
    generation ring.

Australia increased the consolidated rate $.09 per boe over
    2006. The increase was primarily a result of our acquisition of
    an additional interest in Legendre, an oil field which carries a
    higher cost per barrel than our existing blended Australian rate
    ($.06), and appreciation of the Australian dollar relative to
    the U.S. dollar ($.02).

Two Argentine acquisitions, in April and September 2006, lowered
    the 2007 consolidated rate $.13 per boe. The LOE rate on these
    properties was lower than our existing consolidated rate.

Egypt had no impact on the consolidated rate. Our 2006 exit from
    China increased the 2007 consolidated rate $.04 per boe.

Gathering and Transportation

We generally sell
    oil and natural gas under two common types of agreements, both
    of which include a transportation charge. One is a netback
    arrangement, under which we sell oil or natural gas at the
    wellhead and collect a lower relative price to reflect
    transportation costs to be incurred by the purchaser. In this
    case, we record sales at the netback price received from the
    purchaser. Alternatively, we sell oil or natural gas at a
    specific delivery point, pay our own transportation to a
    third-party carrier and receive a price with no


transportation deduction. In this case, we record the separate
    transportation cost as gathering and transportation costs.

In both the U.S. and Canada, we sell oil and natural gas
    under both types of arrangements. In the North Sea, we pay
    transportation to a third-party carrier. In Australia, oil and
    natural gas are sold under netback arrangements. In Egypt, our
    oil and natural gas production is primarily sold to EGPC under
    netback arrangements; however, we also export crude oil under
    both types of arrangements. In Argentina, we sell oil and
    natural gas under both types of arrangements.

The following table presents gathering and transportation costs
    we paid directly to third-party carriers for each of the periods

    Sea crude oil sales and our Egyptian crude oil exports not sold
    under netback arrangements. The $14 million increase was
    driven primarily by U.S. production growth, an increase in
    Egyptian crude exports not sold under netback arrangements and a
    full year of transportation costs paid to third parties in
    Argentina.

Severance and Other Taxes

Severance and other taxes are
    primarily comprised of severance taxes on properties onshore and
    in state or provincial waters in the U.S. and Australia,
    and the United Kingdom (U.K.) Petroleum Revenue Tax (PRT).
    Severance taxes are generally based on a percentage of oil and
    gas production revenues, while the U.K. PRT is assessed on net
    receipts (revenues less qualifying operating costs and capital
    spending) from the Forties field in the U.K. North Sea. We are
    subject to a variety of other taxes including
    U.S. franchise taxes, Australian Petroleum Resources Rent
    tax, and various Canadian taxes including: Freehold Mineral tax,
    Saskatchewan Capital and Saskatchewan Resources Surtax. We also
    pay taxes on invoices and bank transactions in Argentina. The
    table below presents a comparison of these expenses:

Severance and other taxes decreased $12 million, or two
    percent, on an absolute basis. On a

per-unit

basis they decreased $.38, or 13 percent, reflecting the
    12 percent increase in equivalent production. The increase
    in severance taxes was driven by higher production and prices on
    U.S. and Australian properties burdened by such taxes. U.K.
    PRT was 12 percent below 2006, largely driven by lower
    comparable revenues on less production and slightly


higher deductible costs. Deductible costs include capital
    expenditures, LOE, general and administrative expenses
    (G&A), and transportation tariffs. Other taxes increased
    with a full year of taxes on invoice and bank transactions in
    Argentina.

General and Administrative Expenses

G&A
    was $64 million, or $.18 per boe, higher than 2006.
    Incentive-based compensation added $.12 per boe to the rate, a
    consequence of strong stock price appreciation during the year,
    while insurance costs added $.11 per boe, a consequence of
    industry-wide premium increases after the 2005 hurricanes. These
    increases were partially offset by a decrease in rate stemming
    from higher production.

Financing Costs, Net

The major components of
    financing costs, net, include interest expense and capitalized
    interest. Net financing costs for 2007 increased
    $78 million or $.29 per boe, on higher average outstanding
    debt balances, which offset a slightly lower average interest
    rate.

Provision for Income Taxes

The 2007 provision
    for income taxes was $1.9 billion, $403 million above
    2006 on both higher taxable income and a higher effective tax
    rate. Apache’s 2007 effective tax rate was
    39.8 percent compared to 36.3 percent in 2006. The
    2007 effective rate was impacted by a non-cash charge related to
    the effect of the weakening U.S. dollar on our foreign
    deferred taxes. Partially offsetting this charge was an out of
    period benefit from Canadian federal tax rate reductions enacted
    in the second and fourth quarters of 2007. The 2006 effective
    tax rate was impacted by a charge related to retroactive
    application of a 10 percent increase in the oil and gas
    company supplemental tax enacted by the U.K, a benefit from a
    Canadian federal and provincial tax rate reduction enacted in
    the second quarter of 2006 and a gain recognized on the sale of
    China. Foreign currency fluctuations had a negligible impact on
    the 2006 rate.

2006 DD&A

$

Our 2006 full-cost DD&A expense totaled $1.7 billion,
    $374 million more than 2005. Our 2006 full-cost DD&A
    rate of $9.29 per boe was $1.30 per boe more than 2005,
    reflecting rising acquisition costs, higher abandonment cost
    estimates, rising industry-wide drilling and finding costs,
    especially in the U.S. and Canada, and incremental future
    development costs associated with recent acquisitions and newly
    identified development projects. The increase in costs,
    including increased estimates of future development costs, is
    related to increased demand for drilling and associated
    services, a consequence of both higher oil and gas prices and
    additional demand resulting from the ongoing need to repair
    damage caused by hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005. The
    increase in 2006 DD&A, relative to 2005 was mitigated by a
    decline in Egypt resulting from the January 2006 sale of
    Egypt’s deepwater acreage. Our 2006 full-cost DD&A
    expense was $73 million lower because of the production
    shut-in for hurricane damage.

Depreciation of other assets increased $27 million in 2006,
    reflecting ongoing development of infrastructure in Canada that
    began in 2005 to accommodate development on the acquired
    ExxonMobil acreage, and the Qasr field support facilities in
    Egypt, including completion of the Tarek gas plant inter-connect.

Lease Operating Expenses

LOE averaged $7.45
    per boe in 2006, $1.18 per boe higher than 2005. The 2005
    hurricanes increased our worldwide rate by $.44 per boe in 2006,
    a reflection of shut-in production and additional expenses in
    excess of our insurance coverage. The remainder of the increase
    was driven by industry-wide cost increases, as discussed above,
    workover activity, a weaker U.S. dollar relative to the
    Canadian dollar and British Pound and higher non-hurricane
    related repair costs in our U.S. Gulf Coast and Canadian
    regions.


The U.S. added $.63 per boe to the 2006 worldwide rate. The
    Central region added $.04 per boe, with production growth nearly
    outpacing increases in costs, while the Gulf Coast region added
    $.59 per boe. In addition to the impact of industry-wide cost
    increases, activity levels soared in the Gulf of Mexico as
    producers continued to repair and restore production following
    the 2005 hurricanes. This increase in demand on top of an
    already tight-supply market for boats, helicopters, divers,
    labor, equipment and parts to complete repairs, pushed costs
    even higher in the region. The region’s 2006 LOE included
    approximately $26 million, or $.14 per boe, for repairs in
    excess of insurance coverage. The 2006 rate increase was also
    impacted by additional workover activity, higher insurance rates
    and more non-hurricane repair costs, relative to 2005.

Canada added $.40 per boe to the 2006 worldwide rate. Higher
    costs added $.46 per boe, while production growth reduced the
    rate $.06. The weakening U.S. dollar accounted for $.09 per
    boe of the increase. The balance related to a higher level of
    workover activity, higher repair and maintenance costs,
    reclamation and restoration projects undertaken during 2006 and
    the general rise in costs, including increases in power rates,
    contract labor and fuel.

Egypt added $.02 to the 2006 worldwide rate as a
    $32 million increase in costs, including increased workover
    activity, was mostly offset by associated production growth.

Australia reduced the 2006 worldwide rate $.11 per boe with
    production growth more than offsetting associated incremental
    operating costs.

The North Sea added $.37 per boe to the 2006 consolidated rate,
    with approximately two-thirds of the increase in rate related to
    lower relative production, the strengthening British Pound and
    an increase in pension liabilities. The balance of the increase
    in costs related to major 2006 turnaround activity, higher fuel
    rates and usage as major projects were commissioned and higher
    maintenance and repair activity, relative to 2005.

Argentina reduced the 2006 consolidated rate $.19 per boe with
    production growth related to the 2006 acquisitions more than
    offsetting associated incremental operating costs.

    increase in costs for 2006 was driven primarily by
    U.S. production growth and Egyptian crude exports.

Severance and other taxes totaled $554 million in 2006,
    $101 million greater than 2005. U.K. PRT increased
    $109 million in 2006 on a six percent increase in revenue
    and a 21 percent decrease in qualifying deductible capital
    spending. Australia’s severance taxes declined on lower
    revenues associated with lower oil production. Canada’s
    severance taxes decreased $6 million with the phase out of
    the federal large corporation tax. Other taxes increased
    $9 million on additional U.S. franchise taxes,
    consistent with our growth and a $5 million special profits
    charge levied on petroleum revenues by the Chinese government.

General and Administrative Expenses

G&A
    averaged $1.16 per boe for 2006, $.04 per boe less than 2005.
    Absolute costs increased $13 million to $211 million.
    The additional cost in 2006 was primarily associated with
    expansion of international operations in conjunction with
    acquisitions and increasing insurance costs.

Financing Costs, Net

Net financing costs for
    2006 were $26 million higher than in 2005. Gross interest
    expense increased $42 million in 2006 as a result of a
    higher average debt balance and higher short-term interest
    rates. Capitalized interest increased $4 million, a result
    of a higher average unproved property balance. Interest income
    rose $10 million compared to 2005 on higher cash balances.
    Our weighted-average cost of borrowing on December 31, 2006
    was 6.3 percent compared to 6.7 percent on
    December 31, 2005.

Provision for Income Taxes

Income tax expense
    for 2006 totaled $1.5 billion, $125 million less than
    2005. The effective tax rate for 2006 was 36.3 percent,
    down from 37.6 percent in 2005. The 2006 effective rate was
    impacted by a combination of federal and provincial tax rate
    reductions enacted by Canada during the second quarter of 2006,
    a 10 percent increase in the oil and gas company
    supplemental tax enacted by the U.K. during the third quarter of
    2006 and the gain recognized on the sale of China, as discussed
    below. Currency fluctuations had a negligible impact on the 2006
    effective tax rate.

The effective income tax rate for 2006 was impacted by the gain
    recognized in conjunction with divestment of operations in
    China. The Company intends to permanently reinvest earnings of
    its foreign subsidiaries and as such, has not recorded
    U.S. income tax expense on any undistributed foreign
    earnings, including the gain from the China sale.

Acquisitions
    and Divestitures

    Activity

U.S. Gulf Coast Farm-in

On September 6,
    2007, Apache entered into an Exploration Agreement with various
    EnerVest Partnerships (EVP) for an initial term of four years
    whereby Apache committed to spend $30 million in qualified
    expenditures to explore, drill, produce and market hydrocarbons
    from specified undeveloped formations across 400,000 net acres
    in Central and East Texas. Apache must spend the entire
    $30 million in qualified expenditures during the initial
    term or pay the difference as liquidated damages.

U.S. Permian Basin

On March 29,
    2007, the Company closed its acquisition of controlling interest
    in 28 oil and gas fields in the Permian basin of West Texas from
    Anadarko for $1 billion. Apache estimates that these fields
    had proved reserves of 57 million barrels (MMbbls) of
    liquid hydrocarbons and 78 billion cubic feet (Bcf) of
    natural gas as of year-end 2006. The Company funded the
    acquisition with debt. Apache and Anadarko entered into a joint-


venture arrangement to effect the transaction. The Company
    entered into cash flow hedges for a portion of the crude oil and
    the natural gas production.

Divestitures

In 2007 we sold non-strategic oil
    and gas properties located in northwest Louisiana for
    approximately $56 million.

Subsequent Divestitures

On January 29,
    2008, the Company completed the sale of its 50 percent
    interest in Ship Shoal blocks 349 and 369 on the outer
    continental shelf of the Gulf of Mexico to W&T Offshore,
    Inc. for $116 million.

On January 31, 2008, the Company completed the sale of
    properties in the Permian basin of West Texas and New Mexico to
    Vanguard Permian, LLC for $78 million.

    Activity

U.S. Permian Basin

On January 5,
    2006, the Company purchased Amerada Hess’s interest in
    eight fields located in the Permian basin of West Texas and New
    Mexico. The original purchase price was reduced from
    $404 million to $269 million because other interest
    owners exercised their preferential rights to purchase a number
    of the properties. The settlement price at closing of
    $239 million was adjusted for revenues and expenditures
    occurring between the effective date and the closing date of the
    acquisition. The acquired fields had estimated proved reserves
    of 27 MMbbls of liquid hydrocarbons and 27 Bcf of
    natural gas as of

year-end

2005.

Argentina

On April 25, 2006, the Company
    acquired the operations of Pioneer Natural Resources (Pioneer)
    in Argentina for $675 million. The settlement price at
    closing, of $703 million, was adjusted for revenues and
    expenditures occurring between the effective date and closing
    date of the acquisition. The properties are located in the
    Neuquén, San Jorge and Austral basins of Argentina and
    had estimated net proved reserves of approximately
    22 MMbbls of liquid hydrocarbons and 297 Bcf of
    natural gas as of December 31, 2005. Eight gas processing
    plants (five operated and three non-operated), 112 miles of
    operated pipelines in the Neuquén basin and
    2,200 square miles of three-dimensional

(3-D)

seismic data were also included in the transaction. Apache
    financed the purchase with cash on hand and commercial paper.

The purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired and
    liabilities assumed based upon the estimated fair values as of
    the date of acquisition, as follows (in thousands):

On September 19, 2006, Apache acquired additional interests
    in (and now operates) seven concessions in the Tierra del Fuego
    Province from Pan American Fueguina S.R.L. (Pan American) for
    total consideration of $429 million. The settlement price
    at closing of $396 million was adjusted for normal closing
    items, including revenues and expenses between the effective
    date and the closing date of the acquisition. Apache financed
    the purchase with cash on hand and commercial paper.

The total cash consideration allocated below includes working
    capital balances purchased, asset retirement obligations assumed

U.S. Gulf Coast

In June 2006, the Company
    acquired the remaining producing properties of BP plc (BP) on
    the Outer Continental Shelf of the Gulf of Mexico. The original
    purchase price was reduced from $1.3 billion for
    18 producing fields to $845 million because other
    interest owners exercised their preferential rights to purchase
    five of the 18 fields. The purchase price consisted of
    $747 million of proved property, $42 million of
    unproved property and $56 million of facilities. The
    settlement price on the date of closing of $821 million was
    adjusted primarily for revenues and expenditures occurring
    between the April 1, 2006 effective date and the closing
    date of the acquisition. The acquired properties include 13
    producing fields (nine of which are operated) with estimated
    proved reserves of 19.5 MMbbls of liquid hydrocarbons and
    148 Bcf of natural gas. Apache financed the purchase with
    cash on hand and commercial paper.

Divestitures

On January 6, 2006, the
    Company completed the sale of its 55 percent interest in
    the deepwater section of Egypt’s West Mediterranean
    Concession to Amerada Hess for $413 million. Apache did not
    have any proved reserves booked for these properties.

On August 8, 2006, the Company completed the sale of its
    24.5 percent interest in the Zhao Dong block, offshore the
    People’s Republic of China, to Australia-based ROC Oil
    Company Limited for $260 million, marking Apache’s
    exit from China. The effective date of the transaction was
    July 1, 2006. The Company recorded a gain of
    $174 million in the third quarter of 2006.

Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities

Net
    cash provided by operating activities (“operating cash
    flow”) is our primary source of capital and liquidity.
    Factors affecting changes in operating cash flow are largely the
    same as those that affect net earnings, with the exception of
    noncash expenses such as DD&A and deferred income tax
    expense. As a result, our 2007 operating cash flow increased
    from 2006, largely from increases in net earnings, as discussed
    in the “Results of Operations” section of this report.
    Operating cash flow in 2006 was flat to 2005.

Debt

On January 26, 2007, the Company
    issued $500 million principal amount, $499.5 million
    net of discount, of senior unsecured 5.625% notes maturing
    January 15, 2017 and $1 billion principal amount,
    $993 million net of discount, of senior unsecured
    6% notes maturing January 15, 2037. The notes are
    redeemable, as a whole or in part, at Apache’s option,
    subject to a make-whole premium. The proceeds were used to repay
    a portion of the Company’s commercial paper outstanding at
    the end of 2006 in anticipation of funding our $1 billion
    acquisition of Permian basin properties from Anadarko which
    closed March 29, 2007, and for general corporate purposes.

On April 16, 2007, the Company issued $500 million
    principal amount, $498.8 million net of discount, of senior
    unsecured 5.25% notes maturing April 15, 2013. The
    notes are redeemable, as a whole or in part, at Apache’s
    option, subject to a make-whole premium. The proceeds were used
    to repay a portion of the Company’s outstanding commercial
    paper and for general corporate purposes.

Exploration and Development (E&D)

—
    Increases in our 2007 cash flows enabled us to invest larger
    amounts on E&D capital projects during the year. We
    invested $4.2 billion on exploration and development
    activities in 2007, up 15 percent from 2006. Our 2006
    E&D capital expenditures were $314 million above 2005.

In the U.S., we invested $1.6 billion on exploration and
    development activities in 2007. Our Gulf Coast region invested
    approximately $1 billion on drilling, recompletions, and
    platform and production support facilities, including
    $46 million of associated hurricane redevelopment capital
    in excess of insurance coverage. The region drilled
    54 wells in the Gulf of Mexico and 30 wells onshore,
    with a 77 percent success rate, despite ongoing hurricane
    repair activity. The Central region had its most active year
    ever investing $637 million, including the drilling of
    343 wells with a 98 percent success rate. The region
    added to its inventory of opportunities to grow production with
    the addition of Permian basin properties from Anadarko in the
    first quarter of 2007.

Canada’s drilling program accounted for more than
    31 percent of the Company’s wells drilled. The region
    invested $651 million in 2007 on exploration and
    development activities and drilled 348 wells with an
    83 percent success rate.

We invested $538 million in the North Sea on exploration
    and development drilling, recompletions and facility upgrades.
    Five of 16 exploration and development wells drilled during 2007
    were productive.

Egypt had another active and successful exploration and
    development program investing $605 million, drilling
    192 wells at an 84 percent success rate.

In Australia, we invested $516 million in exploration and
    development activities as we participated in drilling
    28 wells, 14 exploration wells and 14 development wells.
    Three of the exploration wells and six of the development wells
    were productive for a success rate of 32 percent.

In Argentina our 2007 exploration and development activities
    increased by $171 million over 2006 as we invested
    $287 million drilling 94 wells, three exploratory and
    91 development, with a 98 percent success rate.

Acquisitions —

We completed $1 billion of
    acquisitions in 2007 compared to $2.4 billion in 2006.
    Acquisition capital expenditures occur as attractive
    opportunities arise and therefore, vary from year to year.

Asset Retirement Costs

— In 2007, we also
    recorded $439 million of additional asset retirement costs.
    The increase is primarily related to revisions of our cost
    estimates. The continued escalation of service costs and the
    high


level of abandonment activities in the Gulf Coast region have
    increased our expected obligations. Continued worldwide drilling
    programs and acquisition activity also contributed to the
    increased abandonment costs.

Gathering, Transmission and Processing Facilities
    (GTP)

— We invested $473 million in GTP
    facilities in 2007 compared to $249 million in 2006. In
    Egypt we invested $422 million on the expansion of gas
    processing facilities to alleviate the processing capacity
    bottleneck throttling deliverability. In Canada, we invested
    $24 million in processing plants.

2008 Outlook

— We plan another active year of
    drilling. Because we revise our estimates of exploration and
    development capital expenditures frequently throughout the year
    based on industry conditions, year-to-year results and the
    relative levels of commodity prices and service costs,
    accurately projecting future expenditures is difficult at best.
    At the end of 2007, we had a fairly active drilling program
    underway; however, if commodity prices soften and service costs
    do not decline accordingly, Apache will not hesitate to reduce
    activity until margins are back in line. Conversely, should
    commodity prices increase we may increase 2008 expenditures
    accordingly. Our 2008 preliminary plan includes exploration and
    development capital of approximately $4.6 billion and GTP
    of approximately $400 million. We generally do not project
    estimates for acquisitions because their timing is
    unpredictable. We continually look for properties in which we
    believe we can add value and earn adequate rates of return and
    will take advantage of those opportunities as they arise.

Debt Repayment

The $170 million Apache
    Finance Pty Ltd (Apache Finance Australia) 6.5% notes
    matured on December 17, 2007. The notes were repaid using
    funds borrowed on Apache’s commercial paper program.

Repurchases of Common Stock

On April 19,
    2006, the Company announced that its board of directors
    authorized the purchase of up to 15 million shares of the
    Company’s common stock representing a market value of
    approximately $1 billion on the date of announcement. The
    Company may buy shares from time to time on the open market, in
    privately negotiated transactions, or a combination of both. The
    timing and amounts of any purchases will be at the discretion of
    Apache’s management. The Company initiated the purchase
    program on May 1, 2006, after the Company’s
    first-quarter 2006 earnings information was disseminated in the
    market. During 2006, the Company purchased 2,500,000 shares
    at an average price of $69.74 per share. No stock purchases were
    made in 2007.

Dividends

The Company has paid cash dividends
    on its common stock for 43 consecutive years through 2007.
    Future dividend payments will depend on the Company’s level
    of earnings, financial requirements and other relevant factors.
    Common dividends paid during 2007 rose 34 percent to
    $199 million, reflecting the increase in common shares
    outstanding and the higher common stock dividend rate. The
    Company increased its quarterly cash dividend 50 percent,
    to 15 cents per share from 10 cents per share, effective with
    the November 2006 dividend payment. Common dividends paid during
    2006 rose 33 percent to $148 million, reflecting the
    increase in common shares outstanding and the higher common
    stock dividend rate.

During 2007 and 2006, Apache paid a total of $6 million in
    dividends each year on its Series B Preferred Stock issued
    in August 1998. See Note 7 — Capital Stock of

In recent years, our primary sources of capital and liquidity
    has been operating cash flow. Additionally, we maintain
    revolving credit facilities and a commercial paper program which
    can be accessed as needed to supplement operating cash flow.
    Other available sources of capital and liquidity include the
    issuance of equity


securities and long-term debt. During 2006, another source of
    liquidity was the divestiture of our assets in China. We expect
    the combination of these sources of capital will be more than
    adequate to fund costs and expenses necessary to maintain
    continued operations, future capital expenditures, payment of
    principal and interest on outstanding debt, dividends and other
    contractual obligations as discussed later in this section.

Operating Cash Flow

Historically, fluctuations
    in commodity prices have been the primary reason for the
    Company’s short-term changes in cash provided by operating
    activities. Sales volume changes have also impacted operating
    cash flow in the short-term, but have not been as volatile as
    commodity prices. Apache’s long-term operating cash flow
    from operating activities is dependent on commodity prices,
    reserve replacement and the level of costs and expenses required
    for continued operations.

Our business, as with other extractive industries, is a
    depleting one in which each barrel produced must be replaced or
    the Company, and a critical source of our future liquidity, will
    shrink. Cash investments are continuously required to fund
    exploration and development projects and acquisitions which are
    necessary to offset the inherent declines in production and
    proven reserves. See Item 1 and 2, Business and Properties,
    “Risks Factors,” in this

Form 10-K.

Future success in maintaining and growing reserves and
    production will be highly dependent upon having adequate capital
    resources available, success in both exploration and development
    activities and acquiring additional reserves.

Our 2007 year-end reserve life index indicates an average
    decline of 8.4 percent per year. This projection is based
    on production and prices at year-end 2007, except in those
    instances where future natural gas and oil sales are covered by
    physical contract terms providing for higher or lower prices,
    estimates of investments required to develop estimated proved
    undeveloped reserves, and costs and taxes reflected in our
    standardized measure in Note 12 - Supplemental Oil and Gas
    Disclosures (Unaudited) of Item 15 in this

Form 10-K.

Debt and Credit Facilities

Year-end 2007
    outstanding current and long-term debt totaled
    $4.2 billion, $405 million higher than year-end 2006.
    The Company’s outstanding debt consists of notes,
    debentures, commercial paper and uncommitted bank lines maturing
    intermittently in years 2008 through 2096. Debt due in 2008
    includes $135 million of commercial paper, $80 million
    of money market lines of credit and a small note. Apache’s
    commercial paper is fully supported by available borrowing
    capacity under committed credit facilities which expire in 2012.
    In 2009, $100 million in debt matures with the remaining
    $3.9 billion maturing thereafter.

On April 30, 2007, the Company amended its existing
    $1.5 billion U.S. five-year revolving credit facility
    to extend the maturity date one year to May 28, 2012. The
    amendment also allows the Company to increase the size of the
    facility by up to $750 million by adding commitments from
    new or existing lenders.

The Company also amended its $450 million U.S. credit
    facility, $150 million Australian credit facility and
    $150 million Canadian credit facility to extend the
    maturity dates of all the commitments to May 12, 2012. The
    amendment also allows the Company to increase the size of the
    U.S. facility by up to $250 million, the Australian
    facility by up to $150 million and the Canadian facility by
    up to $150 million by adding commitments from new or
    existing lenders.

As detailed above, the Company currently has $2.25 billion
    of syndicated bank credit facilities. The available borrowing
    capacity under the credit facilities at December 31, 2007,
    after netting outstanding commercial paper, was
    $2.1 billion. The financial covenants of the credit
    facilities require the Company to maintain a

debt-to-capitalization

ratio of not greater than 60 percent at the end of any
    fiscal quarter. The negative covenants include restrictions on
    the Company’s ability to create liens and security
    interests on our assets, with exceptions for liens typically
    arising in the oil and gas industry, purchase money liens and
    liens arising as a matter of law, such as tax and mechanics
    liens. The Company may incur liens on assets located in the
    U.S., Canada and Australia of up to five percent of the
    Company’s consolidated assets, which approximated
    $1.4 billion as of December 31, 2007. There are no
    restrictions on incurring liens in countries other than the
    U.S., Canada and Australia. There are also restrictions on
    Apache’s ability to merge with another entity, unless the
    Company is the surviving entity, and a restriction on our
    ability to guarantee debt of entities not within our
    consolidated group.

There are no clauses in the facilities that permit the lenders
    to accelerate payments or refuse to lend based on unspecified
    material adverse changes (MAC clauses). The credit facility
    agreements do not have drawdown restrictions or prepayment
    obligations in the event of a decline in credit ratings.
    However, the agreements allow the


lenders to accelerate payments and terminate lending commitments
    if Apache Corporation, or any of its U.S., Canadian and
    Australian subsidiaries, defaults on any direct payment
    obligation in excess of $100 million or has any unpaid,
    non-appealable judgment against it in excess of
    $100 million. The Company was in compliance with the terms
    of the credit facilities as of December 31, 2007.

Credit Ratings

Apache’s senior unsecured
    long-term debt is currently rated A3 by Moody’s, A- by
    Standard & Poor’s and A by Fitch. Apache’s
    short-term debt rating for its commercial paper program is
    currently

P-2

by
    Moody’s,

A-2

by
    Standard & Poor’s and F1 by Fitch. The outlook is
    stable from all three rating agencies.

Oil and Gas Capital Expenditures

We fund
    exploration and development activities primarily through net
    cash provided by operating activities and budget capital
    expenditures based on projected operating cash flow. Our
    operating cash flow, both in the short and long-term, is
    impacted by highly volatile oil and natural gas prices,
    production levels, industry trends impacting operating expenses
    and our ability to continue to acquire or find high-margin
    reserves at competitive prices. For these reasons, management
    primarily relies on annual operating cash flow forecasts.
    Longer-term operating cash flow and capital spending projections
    are rarely used by management to operate the business. Annual
    operating cash flow forecasts are revised monthly in response to
    changing market conditions and production projections. Apache
    routinely adjusts capital expenditure budgets in response to
    these adjusted operating cash flow forecasts and market trends
    in drilling and acquisitions costs.

We use a combination of our operating cash flow, borrowings
    under the our lines of credit and commercial paper program and,
    from time to time, issues of public debt or common stock to fund
    significant acquisitions.

Contractual
    Obligations

We are subject to various financial obligations and commitments
    in the normal course of operations. These contractual
    obligations represent known future cash payments that we are
    required to make and relate primarily to long-term debt,
    operating leases, pipeline transportation commitments and
    international commitments. The Company expects to fund these
    contractual obligations with cash generated from operating
    activities.

The following table summarizes the Company’s contractual
    obligations as of December 31, 2007. See
    Note 9 — Commitments and Contingencies of
    Item 15 in this

Form 10-K

for further discussion.


Apache is also subject to various contingent obligations that
    become payable only if certain events or rulings were to occur.
    The inherent uncertainty surrounding the timing of and monetary
    impact associated with these events or rulings prevents any
    meaningful accurate measurement, which is necessary to assess
    any impact on future liquidity. Such obligations include
    environmental contingencies and potential settlements resulting
    from litigation. Apache’s management feels that it has
    adequately reserved for its contingent obligations including
    approximately $28 million for environmental remediation and
    approximately $7 million for various legal liabilities. See
    Note 9 — Commitments and Contingencies of
    Item 15 in this

Form 10-K

for a detailed discussion of the Company’s environmental
    and legal contingencies.

The Company also accrued approximately $41 million as of
    December 31, 2007, for an insurance contingency because of
    our involvement with Oil Insurance Limited (OIL). Apache is a
    member of this insurance pool which insures specific property,
    pollution liability and other catastrophic risks of the Company.
    As part of its membership, the Company is contractually
    committed to pay termination fees were we to elect to withdraw
    from OIL. Apache does not anticipate withdrawal from the
    insurance pool; however, the potential termination fee is
    calculated annually based on past losses and the liability
    reflecting this potential charge has been accrued as required.

Off-Balance
    Sheet Arrangements

Apache does not currently utilize any off-balance sheet
    arrangements with unconsolidated entities to enhance liquidity
    and capital resource positions.

Critical
    Accounting Policies and Estimates

Apache prepares its financial statements and the accompanying
    notes in conformity with accounting principles generally
    accepted in the United States of America, which requires
    management to make estimates and assumptions about future events
    that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and
    the accompanying notes. Apache identifies certain accounting
    policies as critical based on, among other things, their impact
    on the portrayal of Apache’s financial condition, results
    of operations or liquidity, and the degree of difficulty,
    subjectivity and complexity in their deployment. Critical
    accounting policies cover accounting matters that are inherently
    uncertain because the future resolution of such matters is
    unknown. Management routinely discusses the development,
    selection and disclosure of each of the critical accounting
    policies. Following is a discussion of Apache’s most
    critical accounting policies:

Full-Cost Method of Accounting for Oil and Gas
    Operations

The accounting for our business is
    subject to special accounting rules that are unique to the oil
    and gas industry. There are two allowable methods of accounting
    for oil and gas business activities: the successful-efforts
    method and the full-cost method. There are several significant
    differences between these methods. Under the successful-efforts
    method, costs such as G&G, exploratory dry holes and delay
    rentals are expensed as incurred, where under the full-cost
    method these types of charges would be capitalized to their
    respective full-cost pool. In the measurement of impairment of
    oil and gas properties, the successful-efforts method of
    accounting follows the guidance provided in Statement of
    Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 144,
    “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
    Assets,” where the first measurement for impairment is to
    compare the net book value of the related asset to its
    undiscounted future cash flows using commodity prices consistent
    with management expectations. Under the full-cost method, the
    net book value (full-cost pool) is compared to the future net
    cash flows discounted at 10 percent using commodity prices
    in effect on the last day of the reporting period (ceiling
    limitation). If the full-cost pool is in excess of the ceiling
    limitation, the excess amount is charged through income.


We have elected to use the full-cost method to account for our
    investment in oil and gas properties. Under this method, the
    Company capitalizes all acquisition, exploration and development
    costs for the purpose of finding oil and gas reserves, including
    salaries, benefits and other internal costs directly
    attributable to these finding activities. Although some of these
    costs will ultimately result in no additional reserves, we
    expect the benefits of successful wells to more than offset the
    costs of any unsuccessful ones. In addition, gains or losses on
    the sale or other disposition of oil and gas properties are not
    recognized unless the gain or loss would significantly alter the
    relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves of
    oil and natural gas attributable to a country. As a result, we
    believe that the full-cost method of accounting better reflects
    the true economics of exploring for and developing oil and gas
    reserves. Our financial position and results of operations would
    have been significantly different had we used the successful
    efforts method of accounting for our oil and gas investments.
    Generally, the application of the full-cost method of accounting
    for oil and gas property results in higher capitalized costs and
    higher DD&A rates compared to similar companies applying
    the successful efforts methods of accounting.

Reserve Estimates

Our estimate of proved
    reserves is based on the quantities of oil and gas which
    geological and engineering data demonstrate, with reasonable
    certainty, to be recoverable in future years from known
    reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions. The
    Company reports all estimated proved reserves held under
    production sharing arrangements utilizing the “economic
    interest” method, which excludes the host country’s
    share of reserves. The accuracy of any reserve estimate is a
    function of the quality of available data, engineering and
    geological interpretation, and judgment. For example, we must
    estimate the amount and timing of future operating costs,
    severance taxes, development costs, and workover costs, all of
    which may in fact vary considerably from actual results. In
    addition, as prices and cost levels change from year to year,
    the estimate of proved reserves also changes. Any significant
    variance in these assumptions could materially affect the
    estimated quantity and value of our reserves. As such, our
    reserve engineers review and revise the Company’s reserve
    estimates at least annually.

Despite the inherent imprecision in these engineering estimates,
    our reserves are used throughout our financial statements. For
    example, since we use the units-of-production method to amortize
    our oil and gas properties, the quantity of reserves could
    significantly impact our DD&A expense. Our oil and gas
    properties are also subject to a “ceiling” limitation
    based in part on the quantity of our proved reserves. Finally,
    these reserves are the basis for our supplemental oil and gas
    disclosures.

Costs Excluded

Under the full-cost method of
    accounting, oil and gas properties include costs that are
    excluded from capitalized costs being amortized (amortization
    base). These amounts represent investments in unproved
    properties and major development projects. Apache excludes these
    costs on a

country-by-country

basis until proved reserves are found or until it is determined
    that the costs are impaired. All costs excluded are reviewed at
    least quarterly by the Company’s accounting, exploration
    and engineering staffs to determine if impairment has occurred.
    Nonproducing leases are evaluated based on the progress of the
    Company’s exploration program to date. Exploration costs
    are transferred to the amortization base upon completion of
    drilling individual wells. If geological and geophysical
    (G&G) costs cannot be associated with specific properties,
    they are included in the amortization base as incurred. The
    amount of any impairment is transferred to the amortization base
    or a charge is made against earnings for those international
    operations where a proved reserve base has not yet been
    established. Impairments transferred to the amortization base
    increase the DD&A rate for that country. For international
    operations where a reserve base has not yet been established,
    all costs associated with a prospect or play would be considered
    quarterly for impairment upon full evaluation of such prospect
    or play. This evaluation considers among other factors, seismic
    data, requirements to relinquish acreage, drilling results,
    remaining time in the commitment period, remaining capital
    plans, and political, economic, and market conditions.

Impairments

We assess all of our unproved
    properties for possible impairment on a quarterly basis based on
    geological trend analysis, dry holes or relinquishment of
    acreage. When impairment occurs, costs associated with these
    properties are generally transferred to our proved property base
    where they become subject to amortization.


Impairments in international areas without proved reserves are
    charged to earnings upon determination that impairment has
    occurred.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

We routinely
    assess the recoverability of all material trade and other
    receivables to determine their collectibility. Many of our
    receivables are from joint interest owners on properties we
    operate. Thus, we may have the ability to withhold future
    revenue disbursements to recover any non-payment of joint
    interest billings. Our crude oil and natural gas receivables are
    typically collected within two months. We accrue a reserve on a
    receivable when, based on the judgment of management, it is
    probable that a receivable will not be collected and the amount
    of any reserve may be reasonably estimated.

Beginning in 2001, we experienced a gradual decline in the
    timeliness of receipts from EGPC for our Egyptian oil and gas
    sales. During 2007, we experienced wide variability in the
    timing of cash receipts. We have not established a reserve for
    these Egyptian receivables because we continue to get paid,
    albeit late, and have no indication that we will not be able to
    collect our receivable.

Asset Retirement Obligation (ARO)

The Company
    has significant obligations to remove tangible equipment and
    restore land or seabed at the end of oil and gas production
    operations. Apache’s removal and restoration obligations
    are primarily associated with plugging and abandoning wells and
    removing and disposing of offshore oil and gas platforms.
    Estimating the future restoration and removal costs is difficult
    and requires management to make estimates and judgments because
    most of the removal obligations are many years in the future and
    contracts and regulations often have vague descriptions of what
    constitutes removal. Asset removal technologies and costs are
    constantly changing, as are regulatory, political,
    environmental, safety and public relations considerations.

ARO, associated with retiring tangible long-lived assets are
    recognized as a liability in the period in which the legal
    obligation is incurred and becomes determinable. The liability
    is offset by a corresponding increase in the underlying asset.
    The ARO is recorded at fair value, and accretion expense is
    recognized over time as the discounted liability is accreted to
    its expected settlement value.

Inherent in the present value calculation are numerous
    assumptions and judgments including the ultimate settlement
    amounts, inflation factors, credit adjusted discount rates,
    timing of settlement, and changes in the legal, regulatory,
    environmental and political environments. To the extent future
    revisions to these assumptions impact the present value of the
    existing ARO liability, a corresponding adjustment is made to
    the oil and gas property balance.

Income Taxes

Our oil and gas exploration and
    production operations are currently located in six countries. As
    a result, we are subject to taxation on our income in numerous
    jurisdictions. We record deferred tax assets and liabilities to
    account for the expected future tax consequences of events that
    have been recognized in our financial statements and our tax
    returns. We routinely assess the realizability of our deferred
    tax assets. If we conclude that it is more likely than not that
    some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be
    realized under accounting standards, the tax asset would be
    reduced by a valuation allowance. We consider future taxable
    income in making such assessments. Numerous judgments and
    assumptions are inherent in the determination of future taxable
    income, including factors such as future operating conditions
    (particularly as related to prevailing oil and gas prices).

The Company regularly assesses and, if required, establishes
    accruals for tax contingencies that could result from
    assessments of additional tax by taxing jurisdictions in
    countries where the Company operates. Tax reserves have been
    established, and include any related interest, despite the
    belief by the Company that certain tax positions have been fully
    documented in the Company’s tax returns. These reserves are
    subject to a significant amount of judgment and are reviewed and
    adjusted on a periodic basis in light of changing facts and
    circumstances considering the progress of ongoing tax audits,
    case law and any new legislation. The Company believes that the
    reserves established are adequate in relation to the potential
    for any additional tax assessments.

Derivatives

Apache uses derivative contracts
    to manage its exposure to oil and gas price volatility and
    foreign currency volatility. The Company accounts for the
    contracts in accordance with SFAS No. 133,
    “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
    Activities.” The estimated fair values of Apache’s
    derivative contracts within the scope of this statement are
    carried on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet. For
    oil and gas derivative contracts designated and qualifying as
    cash flow hedges, realized gains and losses are recognized in
    oil and gas production revenues when the forecasted transaction
    occurs. For foreign currency forward contracts


designated and qualifying as cash flow hedges, realized gains
    and losses are generally recognized in lease operating expense
    when the forecasted transaction occurs. SFAS No. 133
    requires that gains and losses from the change in fair value of
    derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting
    be “marked-to-market” and reported in current period
    income, rather than in the period in which the hedged
    transaction is settled. Realized gains and losses on derivative
    contracts not qualifying as cash flow hedges are reported in
    “Other” under “Revenues and Other” of the
    Statement of Consolidated Operations.

The fair value estimate of Apache’s derivative contracts
    requires judgment; however, the Company’s derivative
    contracts are either exchange traded or valued by reference to
    commodities and currencies that are traded in highly liquid
    markets. As such, the ultimate fair value is determined by
    references to readily available public data. Option valuations
    are verified against independent third-party quotations. See
    Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about
    Market Risk, “Commodity Risk” in this

Form 10-K

for commodity price sensitivity information and the
    Company’s policies related to the use of derivatives.

Stock-Based Compensation

Stock compensation
    awards granted are valued on the date of grant and are expensed,
    net of estimated forfeitures, on a straight-line basis over the
    required service period. Inherent in expensing stock options and
    other stock-based compensation are several judgments and
    estimates that must be made. These include determining the
    underlying valuation methodology for stock compensation awards
    and the related inputs utilized in each valuation, such as the
    Company’s expected stock price volatility, expected term of
    the employee option, expected dividend yield, the expected
    risk-free interest rate, the underlying stock price and the
    exercise price of the option. Changes to these assumptions could
    result in different valuations for individual share awards and
    will be carefully scrutinized for each material grant. For
    option valuations, Apache utilizes the Black-Scholes option
    pricing model. For valuing the Share Appreciation Plan awards,
    the Company utilizes a Monte Carlo simulation model developed by
    a third party. Please refer to Note 7 — Capital
    Stock of Item 15 of this

Form 10-K

for a detailed description of our stock compensation plans.

ITEM 7A.

QUANTITATIVE
    AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

The primary objective of the following information is to provide
    forward-looking quantitative and qualitative information about
    our exposure to market risk. The term market risk relates to the
    risk of loss arising from adverse changes in oil, gas and NGL
    prices, interest rates, foreign currency, weather and climate,
    and governmental risks. The disclosures are not meant to be
    precise indicators of expected future losses, but rather
    indicators of reasonably possible losses. The forward-looking
    information provides indicators of how we view and manage our
    ongoing market risk exposures.

Commodity
    Risk

We periodically enter into hedging activities on a portion of
    our projected oil and natural gas production through a variety
    of financial and physical arrangements intended to support oil
    and natural gas prices at targeted levels and to manage our
    overall exposure to oil and gas price fluctuations. Apache may
    use futures contracts, swaps, options and fixed-price physical
    contracts to hedge its commodity prices. Realized gains or
    losses from the Company’s price risk management activities
    are recognized in oil and gas production revenues when the
    associated production occurs. Apache does not generally hold or
    issue derivative instruments for trading purposes.

Apache historically only hedged long-term oil and gas prices
    related to a portion of its expected production associated with
    acquisitions; however, in 2006 and 2007, the Company’s
    Board of Directors authorized management to hedge a portion of
    production generated from the Company’s drilling program.
    Approximately 17 percent of 2007 natural gas and crude oil
    production was subject to financial derivative hedges.

On December 31, 2007, the Company had open natural gas
    derivative hedges in an asset position with a fair value of
    $59 million. A 10 percent increase in natural gas
    prices would reduce the fair value by approximately
    $59 million, while a 10 percent decrease in prices
    would increase the fair value by approximately $68 million.
    The Company also had open oil derivatives in a liability
    position with a fair value of $699 million. A
    10 percent increase in oil prices would increase the
    liability by approximately $402 million, while a
    10 percent decrease in prices would


decrease the liability by approximately $368 million. These fair
    value changes assume volatility based on prevailing market
    parameters at December 31, 2007. See
    Note 3 — Hedging and Derivative Instruments of
    Item 15 in this

Form 10-K

for notional volumes and terms associated with the
    Company’s derivative contracts.

Apache conducts its risk management activities for its
    commodities under the controls and governance of its risk
    management policy. The Risk Management Committee, comprising the
    Chief Financial Officer, General Counsel, Treasurer and other
    key members of Apache’s management, approve and oversee
    these controls, which have been implemented by designated
    members of the treasury department. The treasury and accounting
    departments also provide separate checks and reviews on the
    results of hedging activities. Controls for our commodity risk
    management activities include limits on credit, limits on
    volume, segregation of duties, delegation of authority and a
    number of other policy and procedural controls.

Interest
    Rate Risk

On December 31, 2007, the Company’s debt with fixed
    interest rates represented approximately 95 percent of
    total debt. As a result, the interest expense on approximately
    5 percent of Apache’s debt will fluctuate based on
    short-term interest rates. A 10 percent change in floating
    interest rates on year-end floating debt balances would change
    annual interest expense by approximately $1.8 million.

Foreign
    Currency Risk

The Company’s cash flow stream relating to certain
    international operations is based on the U.S. dollar
    equivalent of cash flows measured in foreign currencies. In
    Australia, oil production is sold under U.S. dollar
    contracts and the majority of the gas production is sold under
    fixed-price Australian dollar contracts. Over half the costs
    incurred for Australian operations are paid in
    U.S. dollars. In Canada, the majority of oil and gas
    production is sold under Canadian dollar contracts. The majority
    of the costs incurred are paid in Canadian dollars. The North
    Sea production is sold under U.S. dollar contracts and the
    majority of costs incurred are paid in U.K. pounds. In Egypt,
    all oil and gas production is sold under U.S. dollar
    contracts and the majority of the costs incurred are denominated
    in U.S. dollars. Argentine revenues and expenditures are
    largely denominated in U.S. dollars, but converted into
    Argentine pesos at the time of payment. Revenue and disbursement
    transactions denominated in Australian dollars, Canadian
    dollars, British pounds, Egyptian pounds and Argentine pesos are
    converted to U.S. dollars equivalents based on the average
    exchange rates during the period.

Foreign currency gains and losses also arise when monetary
    assets and monetary liabilities denominated in foreign
    currencies are translated at the end of each month. Currency
    gains and losses are included as either a component of
    “Other” under “Revenues and Other,” or, as
    is the case when we re-measure our foreign tax liabilities, as a
    component of the Company’s provision for income tax expense
    on the Statement of Consolidated Operations.

Weather
    and Climate Risk

Demand for oil and natural gas are, to a significant degree,
    dependent on weather and climate, which impacts the price we
    receive for the commodities we produce. In addition, our
    exploration and development activities and equipment can be
    adversely affected by severe weather, such as hurricanes in the
    Gulf of Mexico or cyclones offshore Australia which may cause a
    loss of production from temporary cessation of activity or lost
    or damaged equipment. While our planning for normal climatic
    variation, insurance program, and emergency recovery plans
    mitigate the effects of the weather, not all such effects can be
    predicted, eliminated or insured against.

Governmental
    Risk

Apache’s U.S. and international operations have been,
    and at times in the future may be, affected by political
    developments and by federal, state, local and provincial laws
    and regulations impacting production levels, taxes,
    environmental requirements and other assessments including a
    potential Windfall Profits Tax. See Item 1A —
    Risk Factors, for further discussion.


Forward-Looking
    Statements and Risk

Certain statements in this report, including statements of the
    future plans, objectives, and expected performance of the
    Company, are forward-looking statements that are dependent upon
    certain events, risks and uncertainties that may be outside the
    Company’s control, and which could cause actual results to
    differ materially from those anticipated. Some of these include,
    but are not limited to, capital expenditure projections, the
    market prices of oil and gas, economic and competitive
    conditions, inflation rates, legislative and regulatory changes,
    financial market conditions, political and economic
    uncertainties of foreign governments, future business decisions
    and other uncertainties, all of which are difficult to predict.

There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating
    quantities of proved oil and gas reserves and in projecting
    future rates of production and the timing of development
    expenditures. The total amount or timing of actual future
    production may vary significantly from reserve and production
    estimates. The drilling of exploratory wells can involve
    significant risks, including those related to timing, success
    rates and cost overruns. Lease and rig availability, complex
    geology and other factors can affect these risks. Although
    Apache makes use of futures contracts, swaps, options and
    fixed-price physical contracts to mitigate risk, fluctuations in
    oil and gas prices, or a prolonged continuation of low prices
    may substantially adversely affect the Company’s financial
    position, results of operations and cash flows.

    reporting.

We periodically review the design and effectiveness of our
    disclosure controls, including compliance with various laws and
    regulations that apply to our operations both inside and outside

    and effectiveness of our disclosure controls, and may take other
    corrective action, if our reviews identify deficiencies or
    weaknesses in our controls.

REPORT OF
    MANAGEMENT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL
    REPORTING

Management of the Company is responsible for the preparation and
    integrity of the consolidated financial statements appearing in
    this annual report on

Form 10-K.

The financial statements were prepared in conformity with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
    and include amounts that are based on management’s best
    estimates and judgments.

Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and
    maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting
    as such term is defined in

Rule 13a-15(f)

under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange
    Act”). The Company’s internal control over financial
    reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding
    the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    the consolidated financial statements. Our internal control over
    financial reporting is supported by a program of internal audits
    and appropriate reviews by management, written policies and
    guidelines, careful selection and training of qualified
    personnel and a written code of business conduct adopted by our
    Company’s board of directors, applicable to all Company
    directors and all officers and employees of our Company and
    subsidiaries.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements and
    even when determined to be effective, can only provide
    reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement
    preparation and presentation. Also, projections of any
    evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the
    risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in
    conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or
    procedures may deteriorate.

Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s
    internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2007. In making this assessment, management
    used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in

Internal
    Control — Integrated Framework

. Based on our
    assessment, management believes that the Company maintained
    effective internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2007.

The Company’s independent auditors, Ernst & Young
    LLP, a registered public accounting firm, are appointed by the
    Audit Committee of the Company’s board of directors.
    Ernst & Young LLP have audited and reported on the
    consolidated financial statements of Apache Corporation and
    subsidiaries, and the effectiveness of the Company’s
    internal control over financial reporting. The reports of the
    independent auditors follow this report on pages F-2 and F-3.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Apache Corporation:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    Apache Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2007
    and 2006, and the related consolidated statements of operations,
    shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three
    years in the period ended December 31, 2007. These
    consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the
    Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
    opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our
    audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
    present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
    financial position of Apache Corporation and subsidiaries as of
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the consolidated results of
    their operations and their cash flows for each of the three
    years ended December 31, 2007, in conformity with
    U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

As described in Note 1 and Note 9 to the consolidated
    financial statements, in 2006 the Company adopted the provisions
    of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 158,
    “Employees Accounting for Defined Benefit Plans and Other
    Postretirement Plans.” In addition, as described in
    Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, in 2007
    the Company adopted the provisions of Financial Accounting
    Standards Board Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for
    Uncertainty in Income Taxes.”

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States),
    Apache Corporation’s internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on criteria
    established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by
    the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission and our report dated February 28, 2008,
    expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Apache Corporation:

We have audited Apache Corporation’s internal control over
    financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on
    criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
    the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Apache
    Corporation’s management is responsible for maintaining
    effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its
    assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
    financial reporting included in the accompanying Report of
    Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our
    responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s
    internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
    that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the
    design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
    the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we
    considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
    audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Apache Corporation maintained, in all material
    respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as
    of December 31, 2007, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated balance sheets of Apache Corporation and
    subsidiaries as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the
    related consolidated statements of operations,
    shareholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three
    years in the period ended December 31, 2007, and our report
    dated February 28, 2008, expressed an unqualified opinion
    thereon.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Nature of Operations

Apache Corporation
    (Apache or the Company) is an independent energy company that
    explores for, develops and produces natural gas, crude oil and
    natural gas liquids. The Company’s North American
    exploration and production activities are divided into two
    United States (U.S.) operating regions (Central and Gulf Coast)
    and a Canadian region. Approximately 64 percent of the
    Company’s proved reserves are located in North America.
    Outside of North America, Apache has exploration and production
    interests in Egypt, offshore Western Australia, offshore the
    United Kingdom in the North Sea (North Sea) and Argentina. In
    November 2007, the Company announced that it had been awarded
    two exploration blocks in Chile. The Company is currently
    finalizing agreements on these blocks with the Chilean
    government.

1.

SUMMARY
    OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Accounting Policies used by Apache and its subsidiaries reflect
    industry practices and conform to accounting principles
    generally accepted in the U.S. (GAAP). Certain
    reclassifications have been made to prior periods to conform
    with the current presentations. Significant policies are
    discussed below.

Principles of Consolidation

The accompanying
    consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Apache
    and its subsidiaries after elimination of intercompany balances
    and transactions. The Company consolidates all investments in
    which the Company, either through direct or indirect ownership,
    has more than a 50 percent voting interest. In addition,
    Apache consolidates all variable interest entities where it is
    the primary beneficiary. The Company’s interests in oil and
    gas exploration and production ventures and partnerships are
    proportionately consolidated.

Use of Estimates

Preparation of financial
    statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make
    estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets
    and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and
    liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the
    reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
    period. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience
    and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable
    under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for
    making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities
    that are not readily apparent from other sources. Apache
    evaluates its estimates and assumptions on a regular basis.
    Actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions
    used in preparation of its financial statements and changes in
    these estimates are recorded when known. Significant estimates
    with regard to these financial statements include the estimate
    of proved oil and gas reserves and related present value
    estimates of future net cash flows there from (See
    Note 12 — Supplemental Oil and Gas Disclosure),
    asset retirement obligations, income taxes, valuation of
    derivative instruments and contingency obligations including
    legal and environmental risks and exposures.

Cash Equivalents

The Company considers all
    highly liquid short-term investments purchased with an original
    maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. These
    investments are carried at cost, which approximates fair value.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

The Company
    routinely assesses the recoverability of all material trade and
    other receivables to determine their collectibility. Many of
    Apache’s receivables are from joint interest owners on
    properties Apache operates. Thus, Apache may have the ability to
    withhold future revenue disbursements to recover any non-payment
    of joint interest billings. Generally, the Company’s crude
    oil and natural gas receivables are collected within two months.
    The Company accrues a reserve on a receivable when, based on the
    judgment of management, it is probable that a receivable will
    not be collected and the amount of any reserve may be reasonably
    estimated. As of both December 31, 2007 and 2006, the
    Company had an allowance for doubtful accounts of
    $23 million.

Beginning in 2001, Apache experienced a gradual decline in the
    timeliness of receipts from EGPC for our Egyptian oil and gas
    sales. During 2007, the Company experienced wide variability in
    the timing of cash receipts. Apache has not established a
    reserve for these Egyptian receivables because the Company
    continues to get paid, albeit late, and has no indication that
    it will not be able to collect the receivable.

APACHE
    CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Inventories

Inventories consist principally of
    tubular goods and production equipment, stated at the lower of
    weighted-average cost or market, and oil produced but not sold,
    stated at the lower of cost or market.

Property and Equipment

The Company uses the
    full-cost method of accounting for its exploration and
    development activities. Under this method of accounting, the
    cost of both successful and unsuccessful exploration and
    development activities are capitalized as property and
    equipment. This includes any internal costs that are directly
    related to exploration and development activities, including
    salaries and benefits, but does not include any costs related to
    production, general corporate overhead or similar activities.
    Historically, total capitalized internal costs in any given year
    have not been material to total oil and gas costs capitalized in
    such year. Apache capitalized $208 million,
    $146 million and $141 million of these internal costs
    in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Proceeds from the sale or
    disposition of oil and gas properties are accounted for as a
    reduction to capitalized costs unless a significant portion of
    the Company’s proved reserve quantities in a particular
    country are sold (greater than 25 percent), in which case a
    gain or loss is recognized.

Costs Excluded

Properties and equipment
    include costs that are excluded from costs being depreciated or
    amortized. Oil and gas costs excluded represent investments in
    unproved properties and major development projects in which the
    Company owns a direct interest. Apache excludes these costs on a

country-by-country

basis until proved reserves are found or until it is determined
    that the costs are impaired. All costs excluded are reviewed at
    least quarterly to determine if impairment has occurred. For
    international operations where a reserve base has not yet been
    established, impairments are charged to earnings and are
    determined through an evaluation considering among other
    factors, seismic data, requirements to relinquish acreage,
    drilling results, remaining time in the commitment period,
    remaining capital plan and political, economic and market
    conditions. In those countries where proved reserves exist,
    exploratory drilling costs associated with dry holes are
    transferred to proved properties immediately upon determination
    that a well is dry and amortized accordingly. Also, G&G
    costs not associated with specific properties are recorded to
    proved property.

Depreciation, Depletion and
    Amortization

DD&A of oil and gas properties
    is calculated quarterly, on a

country-by-country

basis, using the Units of Production Method (UOP). The UOP
    calculation, in simplest terms, multiplies the percentage of
    estimated proved reserves produced each quarter times the costs
    of those reserves. The result is to recognize expense at the
    same pace that the reservoirs are actually depleting. The
    amortization base in the UOP calculation includes the sum of
    proved property costs net of accumulated DD&A, estimated
    future development costs (costs to access and develop reserves
    needing additional facilities, equipment or downhole work in
    order to produce) and asset retirement costs which are not
    already included in oil and gas property, less related salvage
    value.

Buildings, equipment and gas gathering, transmission and
    processing facilities are depreciated on a straight-line basis
    over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from
    three to 20 years. Accumulated depreciation for these
    assets totaled $720 million and $582 million at
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

Ceiling Test

Under the full-cost method of
    accounting, a ceiling test is performed each quarter. The test
    establishes a limit (ceiling), on a

country-by-country

basis, on the book value of oil and gas properties. The
    capitalized costs of proved oil and gas properties, net of
    accumulated DD&A and the related deferred income taxes, may
    not exceed this “ceiling”. The ceiling limitation is
    the estimated after-tax future net cash flows from proved oil
    and gas reserves, excluding future cash outflows associated with
    settling asset retirement obligations accrued on the balance
    sheet. The estimate of after-tax future net cash flows is
    calculated using a discount rate of 10 percent per annum
    and prices in effect at the end of the period held flat for the
    life of production, except where future oil and gas sales are
    covered by physical contract terms or by derivative instruments
    that qualify, and are accounted for, as cash flow hedges. If
    capitalized costs exceed this limit, the excess is charged to
    expense and reflected as additional DD&A. See Note 12
    - Supplemental Oil and Gas Disclosures (Unaudited) for a
    discussion on calculation of estimated future net cash flows.

F-9

APACHE
    CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Given the volatility of oil and gas prices, it is reasonably
    possible that the Company’s estimate of discounted future
    net cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves could change in
    the near term. If oil and gas prices decline significantly, even
    if only for a short period of time, it is possible that
    write-downs of oil and gas properties could occur.

Asset Retirement Obligations

The initial
    estimated retirement obligation of properties is recognized as a
    liability, with an associated increase in properties and
    equipment for the asset retirement cost. Accretion expense is
    recognized over the estimated productive life of the related
    assets. If the fair value of the estimated asset retirement
    obligation changes, an adjustment is recorded to both the asset
    retirement obligation and the asset retirement cost. Revisions
    in estimated liabilities can result from revisions of estimated
    inflation rates, escalating asset retirement costs and changes
    in the estimated timing of settling asset retirement obligations.

Capitalized Interest Cost

Interest is
    capitalized as part of the historical cost of acquiring assets.
    Oil and gas investments in unproved properties and exploration
    and development activities which are in progress qualify for
    capitalized interest. Major construction projects also qualify
    for interest capitalization until the assets are ready for
    service. Capitalized interest is calculated by multiplying the
    Company’s weighted-average interest rate on debt by the
    amount of qualifying costs. Capitalized interest cannot exceed
    gross interest expense. As oil and gas costs excluded are
    transferred to the DD&A pool, any associated capitalized
    interest is also transferred to the DD&A pool. As major
    construction projects are completed, the associated capitalized
    interest is amortized over the useful life of the related asset.
    Capitalized interest totaled $76 million, $61 million
    and $57 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005 respectively.

Goodwill

Goodwill represents the excess of the
    purchase price of an entity over the estimated fair value of the
    assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The Company assesses
    the carrying amount of goodwill by testing the goodwill for
    impairment annually and when impairment indicators arise. The
    impairment test requires allocating goodwill and all other
    assets and liabilities to assigned reporting units. The fair
    value of each unit is determined and compared to the book value
    of the reporting unit. If the fair value of the reporting unit
    is less than the book value, including goodwill, then the
    goodwill is written down to the implied fair value of the
    goodwill through a charge to expense. Goodwill totaled
    $189 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, with
    approximately $103 million and $86 million recorded in
    Canada and Egypt, respectively. Each country was assessed as a
    reporting unit. No impairment of goodwill was recognized during
    2007, 2006 or 2005.

Accounts Payable

Included in accounts payable
    at December 31, 2007 and 2006, are liabilities of
    approximately $125 million and $204 million,
    respectively, representing the amount by which checks issued,
    but not presented to the Company’s banks for collection,
    exceeded balances in applicable bank accounts.

Commitments and Contingencies

Accruals for
    loss contingencies arising from claims, assessments, litigation,
    environmental and other sources are recorded when it is probable
    that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be
    reasonably estimated. These accruals are adjusted as additional
    information becomes available or circumstances change.

Revenue Recognition and Imbalances

Oil and gas
    revenues are recognized when production is sold to a purchaser
    at a fixed or determinable price, when delivery has occurred and
    title has transferred, and if collectibility of the revenue is
    probable. Cash received relating to future revenues is deferred
    and recognized when all revenue recognition criteria are met.

Apache uses the sales method of accounting for gas production
    imbalances. The volumes of gas sold may differ from the volumes
    to which Apache is entitled based on its interests in the
    properties. These differences create imbalances that are
    recognized as a liability only when the properties’
    estimated remaining reserves net to Apache will not be
    sufficient to enable the underproduced owner to recoup its
    entitled share through production. The Company’s recorded
    liability is generally reflected in other non-current
    liabilities. No receivables are recorded for those wells where
    Apache has taken less than its share of production. Gas
    imbalances are reflected as adjustments to estimates of proved
    gas reserves and future cash flows in the unaudited supplemental
    oil and gas disclosures.

APACHE
    CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The Company’s Egyptian operations are conducted pursuant to
    production sharing contracts under which contractor partners pay
    all operating and capital costs for exploring and developing the
    concessions. A percentage of the production, usually up to
    40 percent, is available to the contractor partners to
    recover all operating and capital costs. The balance of the
    production is split among the contractor partners and Egyptian
    General Petroleum Corporation (EGPC) on a contractually defined
    basis.

Apache markets its own U.S. natural gas production. As the
    Company’s production fluctuates because of operational
    issues, it is occasionally necessary to purchase gas
    (third-party gas) to fulfill its sales obligations and
    commitments. Both the costs and sales proceeds of this
    third-party gas are reported on a net basis in oil and gas
    production revenues. The costs of third-party gas netted against
    the related sales proceeds totaled $123 million,
    $160 million and $158 million, for 2007, 2006 and
    2005, respectively.

Derivative Instruments and Hedging
    Activities

Apache periodically enters into
    derivative contracts to manage its exposure to foreign currency
    risk and commodity price risk. These derivative contracts, which
    are generally placed with major financial institutions that the
    Company believes are minimal credit risks, may take the form of
    forward contracts, futures contracts, swaps or options. The oil
    and gas reference prices, upon which the commodity derivative
    contracts are based, reflect various market indices that have a
    high degree of historical correlation with actual prices
    received by the Company for its oil and gas production.

Apache accounts for its derivative instruments in accordance
    with SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative
    Instruments and Hedging Activities,” as amended.
    SFAS No. 133 establishes accounting and reporting
    standards requiring that all derivative instruments, other than
    those that meet the normal purchases and sales exception, be
    recorded on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability
    measured at fair value (which is generally based on information
    obtained from independent parties). SFAS No. 133 also
    requires that changes in fair value be recognized currently in
    earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met.
    Hedge accounting treatment allows unrealized gains and losses on
    cash flow hedges to be deferred in other comprehensive income.
    Realized gains and losses from the Company’s oil and gas
    cash flow hedges, including terminated contracts, are generally
    recognized in oil and gas production revenues when the
    forecasted transaction occurs. Realized gains and losses on
    foreign currency cash flow hedges are generally recognized in
    lease operating expense when the forecasted transaction occurs.
    Gains and losses from the change in fair value of derivative
    instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are
    reported in current period income as “Other” under
    Revenue and Other in the Statement of Consolidated Operations.
    If at any time the likelihood of occurrence of a hedged
    forecasted transaction ceases to be “probable,” hedge
    accounting under SFAS No. 133 will cease on a
    prospective basis and all future changes in the fair value of
    the derivative will be recognized directly in earnings. Amounts
    recorded in other comprehensive income prior to the change in
    the likelihood of occurrence of the forecasted transaction will
    remain in other comprehensive income until such time as the
    forecasted transaction impacts earnings. If it becomes probable
    that the original forecasted production will not occur, then the
    derivative gain or loss would be reclassified from accumulated
    other comprehensive income into earnings immediately. Hedge
    effectiveness is measured at least quarterly based on the
    relative changes in fair value between the derivative contract
    and the hedged item over time, and any ineffectiveness is
    immediately reported under Revenues and Other in the Statement
    of Consolidated Operations.

General and Administrative Expense

General and
    administrative expenses are reported net of recoveries from
    owners in properties operated by Apache and net of amounts
    related to lease operating activities or capitalized pursuant to
    the full-cost method of accounting.

Income Taxes

We record deferred tax assets and
    liabilities to account for the expected future tax consequences
    of events that have been recognized in our financial statements
    and our tax returns. We routinely assess the realizability of
    our deferred tax assets. If we conclude that it is more likely
    than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets
    will not be realized under accounting standards, the tax asset
    is reduced by a valuation allowance. We consider future taxable
    income in making such assessments. Numerous judgments and
    assumptions are inherent

F-11

APACHE
    CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

in the determination of future taxable income, including factors
    such as future operating conditions (particularly as related to
    prevailing oil and gas prices.)

Earnings from Apache’s international operations are
    permanently reinvested; therefore, the Company does not
    recognize U.S. deferred taxes on the unremitted earnings of
    its international subsidiaries. If it becomes apparent that some
    or all of the unremitted earnings will be remitted, the Company
    would then reflect taxes on those earnings.

Foreign Currency Translation

The
    U.S. dollar has been determined to be the functional
    currency for each of Apache’s international operations. The
    functional currency is determined

country-by-country

based on relevant facts and circumstances of the cash flows,
    commodity pricing environment, and financing arrangements in
    each country.

The Company accounts for foreign currency gains and losses in
    accordance with SFAS No. 52 “Foreign Currency
    Translation.” Foreign currency translation gains and losses
    related to deferred taxes are recorded as a component of its
    provision for income taxes. The Company recorded additional
    deferred tax expense of $228 million in 2007, a
    $5 million deferred tax benefit in 2006 and
    $13 million of additional deferred tax expense in 2005;
    (see Note 6 — Income Taxes). All other foreign
    currency gains and losses are reflected in “Other”
    under Revenues and Other in the Statement of Consolidated
    Operations. The Company’s other foreign currency gains and
    losses included in “Other” under Revenues and Other in
    the Statement of Consolidated Operations, netted to a gain of
    $9 million in 2007, a $15 million loss in 2006 and a
    gain of $11 million in 2005.

Insurance Coverage

The Company recognizes an
    insurance receivable when collection of the receivable is deemed
    probable. Any recognition of an insurance receivable is recorded
    by crediting and offsetting the original charge. Any
    differential arising between insurance recoveries and insurance
    receivables is recorded as a capitalized cost or as an expense,
    consistent with its original treatment.

In connection with damage related to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita
    in 2005, please see Note 9 — Commitments and
    Contingencies for a discussion on the status of claims filed.

Earnings Per Share

The Company’s basic
    earnings per share (EPS) amounts have been computed based on the
    weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding
    for the period. Diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution,
    using the treasury stock method, which could occur if options
    were exercised and if restricted stock were fully vested.

Diluted EPS also includes the impact of unvested Share
    Appreciation Plans. For awards in which the share price goals
    have already been achieved, shares are included in diluted EPS
    using the treasury stock method. For those awards in which the
    share price goals have not been achieved, the number of
    contingently issuable shares included in the diluted EPS is
    based on the number of shares, if any, using the treasury stock
    method, that would be issuable if the market price of the
    Company’s stock at the end of the reporting period exceeded
    the share price goals under the terms of the plan.

Stock-Based Compensation

The Company accounts
    for stock-based compensation under the fair value recognition
    provisions of

SFAS No. 123-R,

“Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,” as amended
    and revised. The Company grants various types of stock-based
    awards including stock options, nonvested equity shares
    (restricted stock) and performance-based awards. In 2003 and
    2004, the Company also granted cash based stock appreciation
    rights. These plans and related accounting policies are defined
    and described more fully in Note 7 — Capital
    Stock. Stock compensation awards granted are valued on the date
    of grant and are expensed, net of estimated forfeitures, on a
    straight-line basis over the required service period.

SFAS No. 123-R

also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of
    recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash
    flow rather than as an operating cash flow. The Company
    classified $30 million, $49 million and
    $27 million as financing cash inflows in 2007, 2006 and
    2005, respectively.

Recently
    Issued Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted

In December 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
    (FASB) issued a revision to SFAS No. 141
    “Business Combinations” (SFAS No. 141(R)).
    The revision broadens the definition of a business combination
    to include all transactions or other events in which control of
    one or more businesses is obtained. Further, the statement
    establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer
    recognizes assets acquired, liabilities assumed and any
    non-controlling interests acquired. SFAS No. 141(R) is
    effective for business combination transactions for which the
    acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first
    reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2008.
    Early adoption is prohibited. Apache is currently evaluating the
    provisions of SFAS No. 141(R) and assessing the impact
    it may have on the Company.

Also in December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160
    “Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial
    Statements.” This statement amends Accounting Research
    Bulletin No. 51, “Consolidated Financial
    Statements.” SFAS No. 160 establishes accounting
    and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interests in a
    subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. It
    clarifies that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary is an
    ownership interest in the consolidated entity that should be
    reported as equity in the Consolidated Financial Statements.
    SFAS No. 160 is effective for fiscal years, and
    interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning on or after
    December 15, 2008. Early adoption is prohibited. We are
    currently evaluating the provisions of SFAS No. 160
    and assessing the impact it may have on the Company.

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159,
    “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
    Liabilities,” which permits entities to measure various
    financial instruments and certain other items at fair value.
    SFAS No. 159 will be effective for the Company in the
    first quarter of 2008. At the present time, the Company does not
    expect to apply the provisions of SFAS No. 159.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157
    “Fair Value Measurements.” SFAS No. 157
    defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair
    value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.
    The statement does not require any new fair value measurements
    for Apache. This statement is effective for financial statements
    issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007.
    The adoption of SFAS No. 157 is not expected to
    materially impact the Company’s Consolidated Financial
    Statements; however, it will result in additional disclosures
    related to the use of fair values in the financial statements.

Also in September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158
    “Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Plans and
    Other Postretirement Plans.” The statement requires
    employers to recognize any over-funded or under-funded status of
    a defined benefit postretirement plan as an asset or liability
    in their Consolidated Financial Statements. Unrealized
    components of net periodic benefit costs are reflected in other
    comprehensive income, net of tax. As of the year ended
    December 31, 2006, Apache adopted the recognition and
    disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 158. The Company
    recorded an adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income
    in Shareholders’ Equity of $11 million
    ($6 million after tax). The adjustment reflects the
    recognition of the Company’s unfunded status for both the
    Company’s pension plan and post retirement benefit plan.
    Refer to Note 9 — Commitments and Contingencies
    for additional disclosures.

In July 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48
    (FIN 48) “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income
    Taxes”. FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for income
    taxes, by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold a tax
    position is required to meet before being recognized in the
    financial statements. The interpretation also provides guidance
    on derecognizing, measurement, classification, interest and
    penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and
    transition. The Company adopted FIN 48 as of
    January 1, 2007, as required. As a result of the
    implementation of FIN 48, the Company recorded a
    $49 million increase in its tax reserves and an offsetting
    decrease to retained earnings for uncertain tax positions. As of
    the adoption date, the Company had total tax reserves

of $563 million, including $521 million of
    unrecognized tax benefits which, if recognized, would impact the
    Company’s effective income tax rate in future periods. This
    reserve includes an estimate of potential interest and
    penalties, which are recorded as components of income tax
    expense, in the amount of $91 million as of January 1,
    2007. Liabilities related to uncertain tax positions are

ACQUISITIONS
    AND DIVESTITURES

    Activity

U.S. Gulf Coast Farm-in

On
    September 6, 2007 Apache entered into an Exploration
    Agreement with various EnerVest Partnerships (EVP) for an
    initial term of four years whereby Apache committed to spend
    $30 million in qualified expenditures to explore, drill,
    produce and market hydrocarbons from specified undeveloped
    formations across 400,000 net acres in Central and East Texas.
    Apache must spend the entire $30 million in qualified
    expenditures during the initial term or pay the difference as
    liquidated damages.

U.S. Permian Basin

On March 29,
    2007, the Company closed its acquisition of controlling interest
    in 28 oil and gas fields in the Permian basin of West Texas from
    Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (Anadarko) for $1 billion.
    Apache estimates that these fields had proved reserves of
    57 million barrels (MMbbls) of liquid hydrocarbons and
    78 billion cubic feet (Bcf) of natural gas as of

year-end

2006. The Company funded the acquisition with debt. Apache and
    Anadarko entered into a joint-venture arrangement to effect the
    transaction. The Company entered into cash flow hedges for a
    portion of the crude oil and the natural gas production.

Divestitures

In 2007 the Company sold
    non-strategic oil and gas properties located in northwest
    Louisiana for approximately $56 million and contracted to
    sell others for approximately $309 million. The assets
    under contract are expected to close in the first quarter of
    2008.

Subsequent Events

On January 29, 2008,
    the Company completed the sale of its 50 percent interest
    in Ship Shoal blocks 349 and 369 on the outer continental
    shelf of the Gulf of Mexico to W&T Offshore, Inc. for
    $116 million.

On January 31, 2008, the Company completed the sale of
    properties in the Permian basin of West Texas and New Mexico to
    Vanguard Permian, LLC for $78 million.

    Activity

U.S. Permian Basin

On January 5,
    2006, the Company purchased Hess’s interest in eight fields
    located in the Permian basin of West Texas and New Mexico. The
    original purchase price was reduced from $404 million to
    $269 million because other interest owners exercised their
    preferential rights on a number of the properties. The
    settlement price on the date of closing of $239 million was
    adjusted primarily for revenues and expenditures occurring
    between the closing date and the effective date of the
    acquisition. Apache estimates that these fields had proved
    reserves of 27 MMbbls of liquid hydrocarbons and
    27 Bcf of natural gas as of year-end 2005.

Argentina

On April 25, 2006, the Company
    acquired the operations of Pioneer Natural Resources (Pioneer)
    in Argentina for $675 million. The settlement price at
    closing, of $703 million, was adjusted for revenues and
    expenditures occurring between the effective date and closing
    date of the acquisition. The properties are located in the
    Neuquén, San Jorge and Austral basins of Argentina and
    had estimated net proved reserves of approximately
    22 MMbbls of liquid hydrocarbons and 297 Bcf of
    natural gas as of December 31, 2005. Eight gas processing
    plants (five operated and three non-operated), 112 miles of
    operated pipelines in the Neuquén basin and
    2,200 square miles of three-dimensional

    properties of BP plc (BP) on the Outer Continental Shelf of the
    Gulf of Mexico. The original purchase price was reduced from
    $1.3 billion to $845 million because other interest
    owners exercised their preferential rights to purchase five of
    the original 18 producing fields. The settlement price on the
    date of closing of $821 million was adjusted primarily for
    revenues and expenditures occurring between the closing date and
    the effective date of the acquisition. The effective date of the
    purchase was April 1, 2006. The properties include 13
    producing fields (nine of which are operated) with estimated
    proved reserves of 19.5 MMbbls of liquid hydrocarbons and
    148 Bcf of natural gas. Apache financed the purchase with
    cash on hand and commercial paper.

Divestitures

On January 6, 2006, the
    Company completed the sale of its 55 percent interest in
    the deepwater section of Egypt’s West Mediterranean
    Concession to Hess for $413 million. Proceeds from the sale
    were accounted for as a reduction of capitalized costs. Apache
    did not have any proved reserves booked for these properties.

On August 8, 2006, the Company completed the sale of its
    24.5 percent interest in the Zhao Dong block, offshore the
    People’s Republic of China, to Australia-based ROC Oil
    Company Limited for $260 million, marking Apache’s
    exit from China. The effective date of the transaction was
    July 1, 2006, and the Company recorded a gain of
    $174 million in the third quarter of 2006.

HEDGING
    AND DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

The Company is exposed to fluctuations in crude oil and natural
    gas prices on the majority of its worldwide production.
    Management believes it is prudent to manage the variability in
    cash flows on a portion of its crude oil and natural gas
    production. The Company utilizes various types of derivative
    financial instruments to manage fluctuations in cash flows
    resulting from changes in commodity prices. Derivative
    instruments typically entered into by the Company, and
    designated as cash flow hedges, are swaps and options.

As of December 31, 2007, the total outstanding positions of
    Apache’s natural gas and crude oil cash flow hedges were as

A costless collar is an option position established by selling a
    call and purchasing a put. The call establishes a maximum price
    (ceiling) and the put establishes a minimum price (floor) that
    will be received for volumes under contract. The fixed-price
    swaps establish a set price the Company will receive for volumes
    under contract.

U.S. natural gas prices in the table above represent a
    weighted average of several contracts entered into on a per
    million British thermal units (MMBtu) basis and are settled
    against a combination of indices, including NYMEX Henry Hub,
    Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line and Houston Ship Channel. The
    Canadian natural gas prices in the table above represent a
    weighted average of AECO Index prices. These gas collars are
    entered into on a per gigajoule (GJ) basis, are converted to
    U.S. dollars utilizing a December 31, 2007 exchange
    rate, and are settled against the AECO Index. Crude oil prices
    in the table above primarily represent a weighted average of
    NYMEX Cushing Index prices on contracts entered into on a per
    barrel (Bbl) basis. These crude oil contracts are settled
    primarily against the NYMEX Cushing index.

The contracts entered into by the Company are valued using
    actively quoted prices and quotes obtained from reputable
    third-party financial institutions. The Company has exposure to
    credit risk to the extent the counterparty to the contract is
    unable to meet its settlement commitment. Apache actively
    monitors the creditworthiness of each counterparty and assesses
    the impact, if any, on the Company’s derivative positions.
    In addition, the Company may exercise its right to net realized
    gains against realized losses when settling its swap and options
    positions with a counterparty.

A reconciliation of the components of accumulated other
    comprehensive income (loss) in the Statement of Consolidated
    Shareholders’ Equity related to Apache’s commodity
    derivative activity is presented in the table below:

(411,678

Differences between the fair values and the unrealized loss on
    derivatives before income taxes recognized in accumulated other
    comprehensive income (loss) are related to premiums, recognition
    of unrealized gains and losses on certain derivatives that did
    not qualify for hedge accounting and hedge ineffectiveness.
    Based on market prices as of December 31, 2007, the Company
    recorded an unrealized loss in other comprehensive income of
    $639 million ($412 million after tax). Unrealized
    gains and losses on these commodity hedges will fluctuate
    significantly and will ultimately be realized in future earnings
    contemporaneously with the related sales of natural gas and
    crude oil production applicable to specific hedges. Of the
    $639 million estimated unrealized loss on derivatives at
    December 31, 2007, approximately $264 million
    ($169 million after tax) applies to the next
    12 months; however, estimated and actual amounts are likely
    to vary materially as a result of changes in market conditions.
    These contracts, designated as hedges, qualified and continue to
    qualify for hedge accounting in accordance with
    SFAS No. 133, as amended.

The majority of Apache’s asset retirement obligations (ARO)
    relate to plugging, abandonment and restoration of oil and gas
    properties. An abandonment liability is initially recorded in
    the period the related assets are placed in service, with an
    offsetting increase to properties and equipment. The liabilities
    incurred are recorded at fair value, and accretion expense is
    recognized over the life of the related assets, increasing the
    liability to its expected settlement value. Liabilities settled
    relate to individual properties plugged and abandoned or sold
    during the period and includes the continued abandonment
    activity of platforms lost during Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.
    Revisions in estimated liabilities during the period primarily
    related to escalating retirement costs, changes in property
    lives and the expected timing of settling asset retirement
    obligations.

All of the Company’s debt is senior unsecured debt and has

    interest. The 6.25%, 5.25%, 5.625% and 6% notes are
    redeemable, as a whole or in part, at Apache’s option,
    subject to a make-whole premium. The remaining U.S. notes
    are not redeemable. Under certain conditions, the Company has
    the right to advance maturity on the 7.375% debentures and
    7.625% debentures.

The Company has $19 million of debt discounts as of
    December 31, 2007, that will be charged to interest expense
    over the life of the related debt issuances; $1 million,
    $714,000 and $668,000 was recognized in 2007, 2006 and 2005,
    respectively.

As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, the Company had
    approximately $33 million and $21 million,
    respectively, of unamortized deferred loan costs associated with
    its various debt obligations. These costs are included in
    deferred charges and other in the accompanying consolidated
    balance sheet and are being charged to expense over the life of
    the related debt issuances.

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The indentures for the notes described above place certain
    restrictions on the Company, including limits on Apache’s
    ability to incur debt secured by certain liens and its ability
    to enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions. Upon
    certain change in control, all of these debt instruments would
    be subject to mandatory repurchase, at the option of the
    holders. None of the indentures for the notes contain
    pre-payment obligations in the event of a decline in credit
    ratings.

Debt
    Issuances

On January 26, 2007, the Company issued $500 million
    principal amount, $499.5 million net of discount, of senior
    unsecured 5.625% notes maturing January 15, 2017 and
    $1.0 billion principal amount, $993 million net of
    discount, of senior unsecured 6% notes maturing
    January 15, 2037. The notes are redeemable, as a whole or
    in part, at Apache’s option, subject to a make-whole
    premium. The proceeds were used to repay a portion of the
    Company’s commercial paper outstanding in anticipation of
    funding our $1 billion acquisition of Permian basin
    properties from Anadarko which closed March 29, 2007, and
    for general corporate purposes.

On April 16, 2007, the Company issued $500 million
    principal amount, $498.8 million net of discount, of senior
    unsecured 5.25% notes maturing April 15, 2013. The
    notes are redeemable, as a whole or in part, at Apache’s
    option, subject to a make-whole premium. The proceeds were used
    to repay a portion of the Company’s outstanding commercial
    paper and for general corporate purposes.

The Company has certain uncommitted money market lines of credit
    which are used from time to time for working capital purposes.
    As of December 31, 2007, $76 million was drawn on
    facilities in Argentina and $4 million was drawn on
    U.S. facilities, compared with $59 million and
    $11 million in the prior year.

The Company has a $1.95 billion commercial paper program
    which enables Apache to borrow funds for up to 270 days at
    competitive interest rates. As of December 31, 2007, the
    Company had issued $135 million of commercial paper at a
    weighted-average interest rate of 5.32%, compared to
    $1.6 billion at 5.15% in the prior year. The commercial
    paper is fully supported by available borrowing capacity under
    U.S. committed credit facilities which expire in 2012. Any
    commercial paper issued reduces available borrowing capacity
    under our U.S. credit facilities.

Debt
    Repayments

The $170 million Apache Finance Pty Ltd (Apache Finance
    Australia) 6.5% notes matured on December 17, 2007.
    The notes were repaid using funds borrowed under Apache’s
    commercial paper program.

Subsidiary
    Debt

The notes issued by Apache Finance Australia and Apache Finance
    Canada are irrevocably and unconditionally guaranteed by Apache
    and, in the case of Apache Finance Australia, by Apache North
    America, Inc., an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the
    Company. Under certain conditions related to changes in relevant
    tax laws, Apache Finance Australia and Apache Finance Canada
    have the right to redeem the notes prior to maturity. The Apache
    Finance Canada 4.375% notes may be redeemed at the
    Company’s option subject to a make-whole premium (see
    Note 14 — Supplemental Guarantor Information).

Credit
    Facilities

On April 30, 2007, the Company amended its existing
    $1.5 billion U.S. five-year revolving credit facility
    to extend the maturity date one year to May 28, 2012. The
    amendment also allows the Company to increase the size of the
    facility by up to $750 million by adding commitments from
    new or existing lenders.

The Company also amended its $450 million U.S. credit
    facility, $150 million Australian credit facility and
    $150 million Canadian credit facility to extend the
    maturity dates of all the commitments to May 12, 2012. The

F-20

APACHE
    CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

amendment also allows the Company to increase the size of the
    U.S. facility by up to $250 million, the Australian
    facility by up to $150 million and the Canadian facility by
    up to $150 million by adding commitments from new or
    existing lenders.

The Company currently has $2.25 billion of syndicated bank
    credit facilities, of which $2.1 billion was available at
    December 31, 2007. The financial covenants of the credit
    facilities require the Company to maintain a
    debt-to-capitalization ratio of not greater than 60 percent
    at the end of any fiscal quarter. The negative covenants include
    restrictions on the Company’s ability to create liens and
    security interests on our assets, with exceptions for liens
    typically arising in the oil and gas industry, purchase money
    liens and liens arising as a matter of law, such as tax and
    mechanics liens. The Company may incur liens on assets located
    in the U.S., Canada and Australia of up to five percent of the
    Company’s consolidated assets, which approximated
    $1.4 billion as of December 31, 2007. There are no
    restrictions on incurring liens in countries other than the
    U.S., Canada and Australia. There are also restrictions on
    Apache’s ability to merge with another entity, unless the
    Company is the surviving entity, and a restriction on our
    ability to guarantee debt of entities not within our
    consolidated group.

There are no clauses in the facilities that permit the lenders
    to accelerate payments or refuse to lend based on unspecified
    material adverse changes (MAC clauses). The credit facility
    agreements do not have drawdown restrictions or prepayment
    obligations in the event of a decline in credit ratings.
    However, the agreements allow the lenders to accelerate payments
    and terminate lending commitments if Apache Corporation, or any
    of its U.S., Canadian and Australian subsidiaries, defaults on
    any direct payment obligation in excess of $100 million or
    has any unpaid, non-appealable judgment against it in excess of
    $100 million. The Company was in compliance with the terms
    of the credit facilities as of December 31, 2007. The
    Company’s debt-to-capitalization ratio as of
    December 31, 2007 was 22 percent.

At the Company’s option, the interest rate for the
    facilities is based on (i) the greater of (a) The JP
    Morgan Chase Bank prime rate or (b) the federal funds rate
    plus one-half of one percent or (ii) the London Inter-bank
    Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a margin determined by the
    Company’s senior long-term debt rating. The
    $1.5 billion and the $450 million credit facilities
    (U.S. credit facilities) also allow the Company to borrow
    under competitive auctions.

At December 31, 2007, the margin over LIBOR for committed
    loans was .19 percent on the $1.5 billion facility and
    .23 percent on the other three facilities. If the total
    amount of the loans borrowed under the $1.5 billion
    facility equals or exceeds 50 percent of the total facility
    commitments, then an additional .05 percent will be added
    to the margins over LIBOR. If the total amount of the loans
    borrowed under all of the other three facilities equals or
    exceeds 50 percent of the total facility commitments, then
    an additional .10 percent will be added to the margins over
    LIBOR. The Company also pays quarterly facility fees of
    .06 percent on the total amount of the $1.5 billion
    facility and .07 percent on the total amount of the other
    three facilities. The facility fees vary based upon the
    Company’s senior long-term debt rating. The
    U.S. credit facilities are used to support Apache’s
    commercial paper program.

Credit
    Ratings

Apache’s senior unsecured long-term debt is currently rated
    A3 by Moody’s, A- by Standard & Poor’s and A
    by Fitch. Apache’s short-term debt rating for its
    commercial paper program is currently

P-2

by
    Moody’s,

A-2

by
    Standard & Poor’s and F1 by Fitch. The outlook is
    stable from all three rating agencies.

Approximately $13 million of the deferred tax assets and
    $14 million of the deferred tax liabilities are classified
    as current on December 31, 2007.

The Company has not recorded U.S. deferred income taxes on
    the undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries as
    management intends to permanently reinvest such earnings. As of
    December 31, 2007, the undistributed earnings of the
    foreign subsidiaries amounted to approximately
    $13.1 billion. Upon distribution of these earnings in the
    form of dividends or otherwise, the Company may be subject to
    U.S. income taxes and foreign withholding taxes. It is not
    practical, however, to estimate the amount of taxes that may be
    payable on the eventual remittance of these earnings after
    consideration of available foreign tax credits. Presently,
    limited foreign tax credits are available to reduce the
    U.S. taxes on such amounts if repatriated.

On December 31, 2007, the Company had state net operating
    loss carryforwards of $361 million and foreign net
    operating loss carryforwards of $6 million in Canada,
    $38 million in Argentina and $92 million in Australia.
    The Company also had $97 million of capital loss
    carryforwards in Canada. The state net operating losses will
    expire over the next 20 years, if they are not otherwise
    utilized. The foreign net operating loss in Canada will begin to
    expire in 2011, the Argentina net operating loss will begin to
    expire in 2012, and the Australia net operating loss has an
    indefinite carryover period. The capital loss in Canada also has
    an indefinite carryover period.

The tax benefits of carryforwards are recorded as an asset to
    the extent that management assesses the utilization of such
    carryforwards to be “more likely than not.” When the
    future utilization of some portion of the carryforwards is
    determined not to be “more likely than not,” a
    valuation allowance is provided to reduce the recorded tax
    benefits from such assets. The Company does not believe the
    utilization of a Canadian capital loss generated in 2007 to be
    “more likely than not.” Accordingly, a
    $12 million valuation allowance was provided to reduce the
    tax benefit from this deferred tax asset.

Apache adopted the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards
    Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 48 (FIN 48),
    “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes” as of
    January 1, 2007. FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for
    income taxes by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold a
    tax position must meet before being recognized in

the financial statements. As a result of the implementation of
    FIN 48, the Company recorded a $49 million increase in
    its tax reserves and an offsetting decrease to retained earnings
    for uncertain tax positions. A reconciliation of the beginning
    and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:

Included in the balance at December 31, 2007, are
    $41 million of tax positions for which the ultimate
    deductibility is highly certain but for which there is
    uncertainty about the timing of such deductibility. Because of
    the impact of deferred tax accounting, other than penalties and
    interest, the disallowance of the shorter deductibility period
    would not affect the annual effective income tax rate but would
    accelerate the payment of cash to the taxing authority to an
    earlier period.

The Company records interest and penalties related to
    unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. During the
    years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, the Company
    recorded approximately $43 million, $26 million and
    $35 million, respectively, in interest and penalties. The
    Company had approximately $128 million and $85 million
    for the payment of interest and penalties accrued as of
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

Apache and its subsidiaries are subject to U.S. federal
    income tax as well as income tax in various states and foreign
    jurisdictions. In many cases, the Company’s uncertain tax
    positions are related to tax years that may be subject to
    examination by the relevant taxing authority. The Company’s
    earliest open tax years in its key jurisdictions are as follows:

The Company is in Administrative Appeals with the Internal
    Revenue Service regarding the 2002 and 2003 tax years, and under
    IRS Audit for the 2004 and 2005 tax years. Resolution of either
    of the above may occur in 2008 which could result in a
    significant change to the balance of the FIN 48 reserve.
    However, the resolution of unagreed tax issues in the
    Company’s open tax years cannot be predicted with absolute
    certainty and differences between what has been recorded and the
    eventual outcomes may occur. Due to this uncertainty and the
    uncertain timing of the final resolution of the Appeals process
    and the 2004 and 2005 audits, an accurate estimate of the range
    of outcomes occurring during the next 12 months cannot be
    made at this time. Nevertheless, the Company believes that it
    has adequately provided for income taxes and any related
    interest and penalties for all open tax years.

On April 19, 2006, the Company announced that its Board of
    Directors authorized the purchase of up to 15 million
    shares of the Company’s common stock representing a market
    value of approximately $1 billion on the date of the
    announcement. The Company may buy shares from time to time on
    the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, or a
    combination of both. The timing and amounts of any purchases
    will be at the discretion of Apache’s management. The
    Company initiated the purchase program on May 1, 2006,
    after the Company’s first-quarter 2006 earnings information
    was disseminated in the market. During 2006, the Company
    purchased 2,500,000 shares at an average price of $69.74
    per share. No stock purchases were made in 2007.

    expensed was $73 million, $35 million and
    $61 million ($47 million, $23 million and
    $40 million after-tax), respectively. Costs related to the
    plans are capitalized or expensed based on the nature of the
    employee’s activities.

Stock Options

As of December 31, 2007,
    officers and employees held options to purchase shares of the
    Company’s common stock under one or more of the employee
    stock option plans adopted in 1995, 1998, 2000, 2005 and 2007
    (collectively, the Stock Option Plans). New shares of Company
    stock will be issued for employee option exercises; however,
    under the 2000 Stock Option Plan, shares of treasury stock are
    used for employee option exercises. Under the Stock Option
    Plans, the exercise price of each option equals the closing
    price of Apache’s common stock on the date of grant.
    Options generally become exercisable ratably over a four-year
    period and expire 10 years after granted. The Stock Option
    Plans allow for accelerated vesting if there is a change in
    control (as defined in each plan). All of the Stock Option
    Plans, except for the 2000 Stock Option Plan, were submitted to
    and approved by the Company’s stockholders.

On October 31, 1996, the Company also established the 1996
    Performance Stock Option Plan (the Performance Plan) for
    substantially all full-time employees, excluding officers and
    certain other key employees. Under the Performance Plan, the
    exercise price of each option equals the closing price of Apache
    common stock on the date of grant. All options become
    exercisable after nine and one-half years and expire
    10 years from the date of grant. Under the terms of the
    Performance Plan, no grants were made after December 31,
    1998.

As of December 31, 2007, the remaining contractual life for
    options outstanding, expected to vest, and exercisable is
    7.2 years, 7.2 years and 4.9 years, respectively.
    The aggregate intrinsic value of options outstanding, expected
    to vest and exercisable at yearend was $343 million,
    $136 million and $191 million, respectively.

The fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of
    grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Assumptions
    used in the valuation are disclosed in the following table.
    Expected volatilities are based on implied volatilities of
    traded options on the Company’s stock, historical
    volatility of the Company’s stock, and other factors. The
    expected dividend yield is based on historical yields on the
    date of grant. The expected term of options granted represents
    the period of time that the options are expected to be
    outstanding and is derived from historical exercise behavior,
    current trends and values derived from lattice-based models. The
    risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in
    effect at the time of grant.

The intrinsic value of options exercised during 2007 was
    approximately $105 million and the Company realized an
    additional tax benefit of approximately $31 million for the
    amount of intrinsic value in excess of compensation cost
    recognized. As of December 31, 2007, the total compensation
    cost related to non-vested options not yet recognized was
    $74 million, which will be recognized over the remaining
    vesting period of the options.

Stock Appreciation Rights

In 2003 and 2004,
    the Company issued a total of 1,802,210 and 1,328,400,
    respectively, of stock appreciation rights (SARs) to
    non-executive employees in lieu of stock options. The SARs vest
    ratably over four years and will be settled in cash upon
    exercise throughout their

10-year

life. The weighted-average exercise price of the SARs was $42.68
    and $28.78 for those issued in 2004 and 2003, respectively. The
    number of SARs outstanding as of December 31, 2007 was
    1,300,849, of which 1,058,257 were exercisable. Because the SARs
    are cash settled, the Company records compensation expense on
    the vested SARs outstanding

F-28

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

based on the fair value of the SARs at the end of each period.
    As of yearend, the weighted-average fair value of SARs
    outstanding was $73.81 based on the Black-Scholes valuation
    methodology using assumptions comparable to those discussed
    above. During 2007, 689,056 SARs were exercised and
    approximately 68,000 were forfeited. The aggregate of cash
    payments made to settle SARs exercised in 2007 was
    $31 million.

Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock
    Units

The Company has restricted stock and
    restricted stock unit plans that are for all executive officers
    and certain other key employees. The plans have been approved by
    Apache’s board of directors. The Company awarded 399,500,
    149,500 and 155,300 restricted stock units at a per share market
    price of $77.31, $71.52 and $55.90 in 2007, 2006 and 2005,
    respectively. The value of the stock issued was established by
    the market price on the date of grant and is being recorded as
    compensation expense ratably over the four-year vesting terms.
    During 2007, 2006 and 2005, $8.2 million, $6.1 million
    and $4.3 million, respectively, was charged to expense as
    shares vested. For 2007, $1 million was capitalized. As of
    December 31, 2007, there was $36 million of total
    unrecognized compensation cost related to approximately 584,850
    unvested shares. The weighted-average remaining life of unvested
    shares is approximately 2.7 years.

2005 Share Appreciation Plan

On
    May 5, 2005, the Company’s stockholders approved the
    2005 Share Appreciation Plan that provides incentives for
    substantially all full-time employees and officers to double
    Apache’s share price to $108 by the end of 2008, with an
    interim goal of $81 to be achieved by the end of 2007. To
    achieve the trigger price, the Company’s stock price must
    close at or above the stated threshold for 10 days out of
    any 30 consecutive trading days by the end of the stated period.
    Under the plan, if the first threshold is achieved approximately
    1.4 million shares would be awarded for an intrinsic cost
    of $113 million. Achieving the second threshold would
    result in approximately 2 million shares awarded for an
    intrinsic cost of $219 million. Shares ultimately issued
    would be reduced for any minimum tax withholding requirements.
    Under the terms of this targeted stock plan, awards are payable
    in four equal installments, beginning with the date the trigger
    stock price is met and on each succeeding anniversary date. The
    shares of Apache common stock contingently issuable under the
    2005 Share Appreciation Plan are excluded from the
    computation of income per common share until the stated goals
    are met as described below.

Current accounting practices dictate that, regardless of whether
    these thresholds are ultimately achieved, the Company must
    recognize the fair value cost at the grant date based on
    numerous assumptions, including an estimate of the likelihood
    that Apache’s stock price will achieve these thresholds and
    the expected forfeiture rate. As a result, the Company will
    recognize expense and capitalized costs of approximately
    $79 million over the expected service life of the plan. For
    2007, 2006 and 2005, $10.6 million ($6.8 million after
    tax), $12.1 million ($7.8 million after tax) and
    $6.6 million ($4.3 million after tax) was expensed,
    respectively. In 2007, 2006 and 2005, $5.4 million,
    $6.2 million and $3.4 million was capitalized,
    respectively.

As of June 14, 2007, Apache’s share price exceeded the
    interim $81 threshold for the

10-day

requirement. As such, Apache will issue approximately one
    million shares of its common stock, after minimum tax
    withholding requirements, in four equal installments. The first
    installment was issued in July 2007. Subsequent installments
    will be issued in July of 2008, 2009 and 2010 to employees
    remaining with the Company during that period. As of
    February 28, 2008, nine days of the

10-day

requirement for the $108 threshold have been met and 14 trading
    days remain in the current

30-day

period.

    yield of .57 and .56 percent.

2000 Share Appreciation Plan

In October
    2000, the Company adopted the 2000 Share Appreciation Plan
    under which grants were made to substantially all full-time
    employees, including officers. The Share Price Goals were based
    on achieving a closing price of $43.29, $51.95 and $77.92 per
    share on any 10 days out of any 30 consecutive trading days
    prior to January 1, 2005. In 2004, Apache’s share
    price exceeded the first threshold ($43.29) and second threshold
    ($51.95) under this plan. As such, the Company issued
    3.2 million shares of its common stock, after minimum tax
    withholding requirements, which were distributed to employees in
    three annual installments in 2004, 2005 and 2006. The third
    share-price threshold ($77.92) was not triggered and the related
    grants were cancelled as of December 31, 2004. A summary of

Preferred
    Stock

The Company has five million shares of no par preferred stock
    authorized, of which 25,000 shares have been designated as
    Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock (the
    Series A Preferred Stock) and 100,000 shares have been
    designated as the 5.68 percent Series B
    Cumulative Preferred Stock (the Series B Preferred Stock).

Series A Preferred Stock

In December
    1995, the Company declared a dividend of one right (a Right) for
    each 2.31 shares (adjusted for subsequent stock dividends
    and a two-for-one stock split) of Apache common stock
    outstanding on January 31, 1996. Each full Right entitles
    the registered holder to purchase from the Company one
    ten-thousandth (1/10,000) of a share of Series A Preferred
    Stock at a price of $100 per one ten-thousandth of a share,
    subject to adjustment. The Rights are exercisable 10 calendar
    days following a public announcement that certain persons or
    groups have acquired 20 percent or more of the outstanding
    shares of Apache common stock or 10 business days following
    commencement of an offer for 30 percent or more of the
    outstanding shares of Apache common stock. In addition, if a
    person or group becomes the beneficial owner of 20 percent
    or more of Apache’s outstanding common stock (flip in
    event); each Right will become exercisable for shares of
    Apache’s common stock at 50 percent of the then market
    price of the common stock. If a 20 percent shareholder of
    Apache acquires Apache, by merger or otherwise, in a transaction
    where Apache does not survive or in which Apache’s common
    stock is changed or exchanged (flip over event), the Rights
    become exercisable for shares of the common stock of the Company
    acquiring Apache at 50 percent of the then market price for
    Apache common stock. Any Rights that are or were beneficially
    owned by a person who has acquired 20 percent or more of
    the outstanding shares of Apache common stock and who engages in
    certain transactions or realizes the benefits of certain
    transactions with the Company will become void. If an offer to
    acquire all of the Company’s outstanding shares of common
    stock is determined to be fair by Apache’s board of
    directors, the transaction will not trigger a flip in event or a
    flip over event. The Company may also redeem the Rights at $.01
    per Right at any time until 10 business days after public
    announcement of a flip in event. These rights were originally
    scheduled to expire on January 31, 2006. Effective as of
    that date, the Rights were reset to one right per share of
    common stock and the expiration was extended to January 31,
    2016. Unless the Rights have been previously redeemed, all
    shares of Apache common stock issued by the Company after
    January 31, 1996 will include Rights. Unless and until the
    Rights become exercisable, they will be transferred with and
    only with the shares of Apache common stock.

Series B Preferred Stock

In August 1998,
    Apache issued 100,000 shares ($100 million) of
    Series B Preferred Stock in the form of one million
    depositary shares, each representing one-tenth (1/10) of a share
    of Series B Preferred Stock, for net proceeds of
    $98 million. The Series B Preferred Stock has no
    stated maturity, is not subject to a sinking fund and is not
    convertible into Apache common stock or any other securities of
    the Company. Apache has the option to redeem the Series B
    Preferred Stock at $1,000 per preferred share on or after
    August 25, 2008. Holders of the shares are entitled to
    receive cumulative cash dividends at an annual rate of $5.68 per
    depositary share when, and if, declared by Apache’s board
    of directors. During 2007, the Company paid $5.7 million on

The fair value of the notes and debentures is based upon an
    estimate provided to the Company by an independent investment
    banking firm. The carrying amount of the commercial paper and
    money market lines of credit approximated fair value because the
    interest rates are variable and reflective of market rates. The
    Company’s trade receivables and trade payables are by their
    very nature short-term. The carrying values included in the
    accompanying consolidated balance sheet approximate fair value
    at December 31, 2007 and 2006.

COMMITMENTS
    AND CONTINGENCIES

Apache is party to various legal actions arising in the ordinary
    course of business. Matters that are probable of unfavorable
    outcomes to Apache and which can be reasonably estimated are
    accrued. Such accruals are based on information known about the
    matters, Apache’s estimates of the outcomes of such matters
    and its experience in contesting, litigating and settling
    similar matters. None of the actions are believed by management
    to involve future amounts that would be material to
    Apache’s financial position or results of operations after
    consideration of recorded accruals although actual amounts could
    differ materially from management’s estimate that are
    reasonably possible to occur will not have a material adverse
    affect on the Company’s financial position or results of
    operations.

Legal
    Matters

Grynberg

In 1997, Jack J. Grynberg began
    filing lawsuits against other natural gas producers, gatherers,
    and pipelines claiming that the defendants have under paid
    royalty to the federal government and Indian tribes by
    mis-measurement of the volume and heating content of natural gas
    and are responsible for acts of others who mis-measured natural
    gas. In 2004, Grynberg filed suit against Apache making the same
    claims he had made previously against others in the industry.
    With the addition of Apache, there are more than 300 defendants
    to these actions. The Grynberg lawsuits have been consolidated
    through a federal Multi-District Litigation (MDL) action
    located in Wyoming federal court for discovery and pre-trial
    purposes. Although Grynberg purports to be acting on behalf of
    the government, the federal government has declined to join in
    the cases. While an adverse judgment against Apache is possible,
    Apache does not believe the plaintiff’s claims have merit
    and plans to vigorously pursue its defenses against these
    claims. Exposure related to this lawsuit is not currently
    determinable. Apache and other defendants in the MDL filed
    motions to dismiss based upon Grynberg’s failure to prove
    statutory requirements for maintaining qui tam lawsuits. On
    October 20, 2006, the multi-district Judge ruled in favor
    of Apache and other defendants on these motions to dismiss,
    dismissing Grynberg’s lawsuit against Apache and others.
    Grynberg has appealed the ruling.

Argentine Environmental Claims

The company
    acquired a subsidiary of Pioneer in Argentina (PNRA) that is
    involved in various administrative proceedings with
    environmental authorities in the Neuquén Province relating
    to permits for and discharges from operations in that province.
    PNRA is cooperating with the proceedings, although it from time
    to time challenges whether certain assessed fines, which could
    exceed $100,000, are appropriate. PNRA was named in a suit
    initiated against oil companies operating in the Neuquén
    basin entitled

Asociación de Superficiarios de la
    Patagonia v. YPF S.A.

,

et. al.

, originally filed
    on August 21, 2003, in the Argentine National Supreme Court
    of Justice. The plaintiffs, a private group of landowners, have
    also named the national government and several provinces as
    third parties. The lawsuit alleges injury to the environment
    generally by the oil and gas industry. The plaintiffs
    principally seek from all defendants, jointly, (i) the
    remediation of contaminated sites, of the superficial and
    underground waters, and of soil that allegedly was degraded as a
    result of deforestation, (ii) if the remediation is not
    possible, payment of an indemnification for the material and
    moral damages claimed from defendants operating in the
    Neuquén basin, of which PNRA is a small portion,
    (iii) adoption of all of the necessary measures to prevent
    future environmental damages, and (iv) the creation of a
    private restoration fund to provide coverage for remediation of
    potential future environmental damages. Much of the alleged
    damage relates to operations by the Argentine state oil company,
    which conducted oil and gas operations throughout Argentina
    prior to its privatization, which began in 1990. While the
    plaintiffs will seek to make all oil and gas companies operating
    in the Neuquén basin jointly liable for each others’
    actions, PNRA will defend on an individual basis and attempt to
    require the plaintiffs to delineate damages by company. PNRA
    intends to defend itself vigorously in the case. It is not
    certain exactly how or what the court will do in this matter as
    it is the first of its kind. While it is possible PNRA

F-33

APACHE
    CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

may incur liabilities related to the environmental claims, no
    reasonable prediction can be made as PNRA’s exposure
    related to this lawsuit is not currently determinable.

Louisiana Restoration

Numerous surface owners
    filed claims or sent demand letters to oil and gas companies,
    including Apache, claiming that, under either expressed or
    implied lease terms or Louisiana law, they are liable for damage
    measured by the cost of restoration of leased premises to their
    original condition as well as damages for contamination and
    cleanup. Many of these lawsuits claim small amounts, while
    others assert claims in excess of a million dollars. Also, some
    lawsuits or claims are being settled or resolved, while others
    are still being filed. Any exposure, therefore, related to these
    lawsuits and claims is not currently determinable. While an
    adverse judgment against Apache is possible, Apache intends to
    actively defend the cases.

Hurricane Related Litigation

In a case styled

Ned Comer, et al vs.Murphy Oil USA, Inc., et al

,

Case No: 1:05-cv-00436;

U.S.D.C.,

United States District Court, Southern District of
    Mississippi

., Mississippi property owners whose homes and
    businesses were damaged by Hurricane Katrina are requesting
    class certification. They allege that hurricanes’
    meteorological effects increased in frequency and intensity due
    to global warming, and there will be continued future damage
    from increasing intensity of storms and sea level rises. They
    claim this was caused by the defendants (oil and gas companies,
    electric and coal companies, and chemical manufacturers).
    Plaintiffs claim defendants’ emissions of “greenhouse
    gases” cause global warming, which they blame as the cause
    of their damages. They also claim that the oil company
    defendants artificially inflated and manipulated the prices of
    gasoline, diesel fuel, jet fuel, natural gas, and other end-use
    petrochemicals, and covered it up by misrepresentations. They
    further allege a conspiracy to disseminate misinformation and
    cover up the relationship between the defendants and global
    warming. Plaintiffs seek, among other damages, actual,
    consequential, and punitive or exemplary damages. The District
    Court dismissed the case on August 30, 2007. The plaintiffs
    appealed the dismissal. Prior to the dismissal, the plaintiffs
    filed a motion to amend the lawsuit to add additional
    defendants, including Apache. The motion was rendered moot by
    the District Court’s order of dismissal.

Insurance Claims

Apache filed claims for
    damage related to two 2005 hurricanes with Oil Insurance Ltd.
    (OIL and OIL Coverage) and with its principal commercial
    insurance underwriters who provided “Excess Coverage”
    for property damage in excess of OIL Coverage, business
    interruption insurance, and liability coverage.

Through December 31, 2007, Apache collected
    $110 million from OIL for property damage and
    $119 million from underwriters for property damage in
    excess of OIL Coverage. Apache also collected $150 million
    from its underwriters for business interruption claims and an
    additional $35 million for wreck removal under its primary
    liability policy.

Apache’s Excess Coverage policy included an endorsement
    providing $165 million per occurrence for wreck removal
    costs and expenses. Similarly, Apache had another policy which
    included the same endorsement for wreck removal costs and
    expenses that provided an additional $100 million of
    coverage per occurrence. The underwriters paid $200 million
    to settle all existing and prospective claims for wreck removal
    costs related to Hurricane Katrina.

Other Matters

The Company is involved in other
    litigation and is subject to government and regulatory controls
    in the normal course of business. The Company has an accrued
    liability of approximately $7 million for other legal
    contingencies that are probable of occurring and can be
    reasonably estimated. It is management’s opinion that the
    loss for any such other litigation matters and claims that are
    reasonably possible to occur will not have a material adverse
    affect on the Company’s financial position or results of
    operations.

Environmental
    Matters

The Company, as an owner or lessee and operator of oil and gas
    properties, is subject to various federal, provincial, state,
    local and foreign country laws and regulations relating to
    discharge of materials into, and protection of, the environment.
    These laws and regulations may, among other things, impose
    liability on the lessee under an oil and gas lease for the cost
    of pollution

clean-up

resulting from operations and subject the lessee to liability
    for pollution damages. In some instances, the Company may be
    directed to suspend or cease operations in

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

the affected area. We maintain insurance coverage, which we
    believe is customary in the industry, although we are not fully
    insured against all environmental risks.

Apache manages its exposure to environmental liabilities on
    properties to be acquired by identifying existing problems and
    assessing the potential liability. The Company also conducts
    periodic reviews, on a Company-wide basis, to identify changes
    in its environmental risk profile. These reviews evaluate
    whether there is a probable liability, its amount, and the
    likelihood that the liability will be incurred. The amount of
    any potential liability is determined by considering, among
    other matters, incremental direct costs of any likely
    remediation and the proportionate cost of employees who are
    expected to devote a significant amount of time directly to any
    possible remediation effort. As it relates to evaluations of
    purchased properties, depending on the extent of an identified
    environmental problem, the Company may exclude a property from
    the acquisition, require the seller to remediate the property to
    Apache’s satisfaction, or agree to assume liability for the
    remediation of the property. The Company’s general policy
    is to limit any reserve additions to any incidents or sites that
    are considered probable to result in an expected remediation
    cost exceeding $300,000. Any environmental costs and liabilities
    that are not reserved for are treated as an expense when
    actually incurred. In our estimation, neither these expenses nor
    expenses related to training and compliance programs are likely
    to have a material impact on our financial condition. As of
    December 31, 2007, the Company had an undiscounted reserve
    for environmental remediation of approximately $28 million.
    Apache is not aware of any environmental claims existing as of
    December 31, 2007, which have not been provided for or
    would otherwise have a material impact on its financial position
    or results of operations. There can be no assurance, however,
    that current regulatory requirements will not change, or past
    non-compliance with environmental laws will not be discovered on
    the Company’s properties.

Retirement and Deferred Compensation
    Plans

Apache Corporation provides retirement
    benefits to its U.S. employees through the use of three
    types of plans: an IRC 401(k); a money purchase pension plan and
    a restorative non-qualified retirement savings plan. The Apache
    401(k) savings plan provides participating employees the ability
    to elect to contribute up to 50 percent of eligible
    compensation to the plan with the Company making matching
    contributions up to a maximum of six percent of each
    employee’s annual covered compensation. In addition, the
    Company annually contributes six percent of each participating
    employee’s compensation, as defined, to a money purchase
    retirement plan. The 401(k) plan and the money purchase
    retirement plan are subject to certain annually-adjusted,
    government-mandated restrictions which limit the amount of
    employee and Company contributions. For certain eligible
    employees, the Company also provides a non-qualified
    retirement/savings plan which allows the deferral of up to
    50 percent of each employee’s salary, and which
    accepts employee contributions and the Company’s matching
    contributions in excess of the government mandated limitations
    imposed in the 401(k) savings plan and money purchase retirement
    plan.

Vesting in the Company’s contributions in the 401(k)
    savings plan, the money purchase retirement plan and the
    non-qualified retirement/savings plan occurs at the rate of
    20 percent for every full-year of employment. Upon a change
    in control of ownership, immediate and full vesting occurs.

Additionally, Apache Energy Limited, Apache Canada Ltd. and
    Apache North Sea Limited maintain separate retirement plans, as
    required under the laws of Australia, Canada and the United
    Kingdom, respectively. Total annual cost under the retirement
    plans (all locations) were $59 million, $41 million
    and $39 million for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Apache also provides a funded noncontributory defined benefit
    pension plan (U.K. Pension Plan) covering certain employees of
    the Company’s North Sea operations who were hired by Apache
    as part of a 2003 acquisition. The plan provides defined pension
    benefits based on years of service and final average salary. The
    plan is closed to newly hired employees.

Additionally, the Company offers postretirement medical benefits
    to U.S. employees who meet certain eligibility
    requirements. Covered participants receive medical benefits up
    until the age of 65 provided the participant remits the required
    portion of the cost of coverage. The plan is contributory with
    participants’

As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, the accumulated benefit
    obligation for the pension plan was $91 million and
    $90 million, respectively.

Apache’s defined benefit pension plan assets are held by a
    non-related Trustee who has been instructed to invest the assets
    in an equal blend of equity securities and low-risk debt
    securities. The Company believes this blend of investments will
    provide a reasonable rate of return and ensure that the benefits
    promised to members are provided.

The plan’s assets do not include any equity or debt
    securities of Apache. A breakout of previous allocations for

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Included in the table above are leases for buildings, facilities
    and related equipment with varying expiration dates through
    2035. Net rental expense was $31 million, $23 million,
    and $20 million for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Subsequent Events

In January 2008, Apache, BP
    plc and Chevron Corporation entered into a contract with Well
    Control, Inc. to decommission downed platforms and related well
    facilities located offshore Louisiana in the Gulf of Mexico for
    a fixed fee of $750 million. Apache’s portion is
    37.5 percent.

MAJOR
    CUSTOMERS

In 2007, purchases by Shell accounted for 12 percent of the
    Company’s oil and gas production revenues.

In 2006, purchases by BP accounted for 20 percent of the
    Company’s oil and gas production revenues.

In 2005, purchases by BP and Shell each accounted for
    16 percent of the Company’s oil and gas production
    revenues.

Concentration of Credit Risk

Beginning in
    2001, Apache experienced a gradual decline in the timeliness of
    receipts from EGPC for our Egyptian oil and gas sales. During
    2007, the Company experienced wide variability in the timing of
    cash receipts. Apache has not established a reserve for these
    Egyptian receivables because the Company continues to get paid,
    albeit late, and has no indication that it will not be able to
    collect the receivable.

Oil
    and Gas Reserve Information

The estimate of reserves disclosed in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

are prepared by the Company’s internal staff and the
    Company is responsible for the adequacy and accuracy of those
    estimates. However, we engage Ryder Scott Company, L.P.
    Petroleum Consultants (Ryder Scott) to review our processes and
    the reasonableness of our estimates of proved hydrocarbon liquid
    and gas reserves. We selected the properties for review by Ryder
    Scott and these properties represented all material fields,
    approximately 88 percent of international properties and
    over 80 percent of each country’s reserve value for
    new wells drilled during the year. During 2007, 2006 and 2005,
    Ryder Scott’s review covered 77, 75 and 74 percent of
    the Company’s worldwide estimated reserves value,
    respectively.

Ryder Scott opined that the overall proved reserves for the
    reviewed properties as estimated by the Company are, in the
    aggregate, reasonable, prepared in accordance with generally
    accepted petroleum engineering and evaluation principles, and
    conform to the SEC’s definition of proved reserves as set
    forth in

Rule 210.4-10(a)

of

Regulation S-X.

Ryder Scott has informed the Company that their tests and
    procedures used during their reserves audit conform to the
    Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and
    Gas Reserves Information approved by the Society of Petroleum
    Engineers. Paragraph 2.2(f) of the Standards Pertaining to
    the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information
    defines a reserves audit as the process of reviewing certain of
    the pertinent facts interpreted and assumptions made that have
    resulted in an estimate of reserves prepared by others and the
    rendering of an opinion about (1) the appropriateness of
    the methodologies employed, (2) the adequacy and quality of
    the data relied upon, (3) the depth and thoroughness of the
    reserves estimation process, (4) the classification of
    reserves appropriate to the relevant definitions used, and
    (5) the reasonableness of the estimated reserve quantities.

As of December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, on a barrel of
    equivalent basis 31, 32 and 30 percent of our estimated
    worldwide reserves, respectively, were classified as proved
    undeveloped. Approximately 20 percent of our year-end 2007
    estimated proved developed reserves are classified as proved not
    producing. These reserves relate to zones that are either behind
    pipe, or that have been completed but not yet produced, or zones
    that have been produced in the past, but are not now producing
    because of mechanical reasons. These reserves may be regarded as
    less certain than producing reserves because they are frequently
    based on volumetric calculations rather than performance data.
    Future production associated with behind pipe reserves is
    scheduled to follow depletion of the currently producing zones
    in the same wellbores. It should be noted that additional
    capital may have to be spent to access these reserves. The
    capital and economic impact of production timing are reflected
    in this Note 12, under “Future Net Cash Flows.”

Future
    Net Cash Flows

Future cash inflows are based on year-end oil and gas prices
    except in those instances where future natural gas or oil sales
    are covered by physical contract terms providing for higher or
    lower amounts. Operating costs, production and ad valorem taxes
    and future development costs are based on current costs with no
    escalation.

The following table sets forth unaudited information concerning
    future net cash flows for oil and gas reserves, net of income
    tax expense. Income tax expense has been computed using expected
    future tax rates and giving effect to tax deductions and credits
    available, under current laws, and which relate to oil and gas
    producing activities. This information does not purport to
    present the fair market value of the Company’s oil and gas
    assets, but does present a standardized disclosure concerning
    possible future net cash flows that would result under the
    assumptions used.

Prior to 2007, Canadian provincial tax credits were included in
    the estimated future net cash flows. Effective January 1,
    2007, the Alberta government eliminated the Royalty Tax Credit
    program.

Estimated future net cash flows before income tax expense,
    discounted at 10 percent per annum, totaled approximately
    $47.5 billion, $29.6 billion and $35.9 billion as
    of December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Impact
    of Pricing

The estimates of cash flows and reserve quantities shown above
    are based on year-end oil and gas prices, except in those cases
    where future natural gas or oil sales are covered by physical
    contracts at specified prices. Forward price volatility is
    largely attributable to supply and demand perceptions for
    natural gas and oil.

Under the full-cost method of accounting, a ceiling test is
    performed each quarter. The test establishes a limit (ceiling),
    on a

country-by-country

basis, on the book value of oil and gas properties. The
    capitalized costs of proved oil and gas properties, net of
    accumulated DD&A and the related deferred income taxes, may
    not exceed this “ceiling”. The ceiling limitation is
    the estimated after-tax future net cash flows from proved oil
    and gas reserves, excluding future cash outflows associated with
    settling asset retirement obligations accrued on the balance
    sheet. The ceiling limitation is calculated using a discount
    rate of 10 percent per annum and using prices in effect at
    the end of the period held flat for the life of production,
    except where future oil and gas sales are covered by physical
    contract terms or by derivative instruments that qualify, and
    are accounted for, as cash flow hedges. If capitalized costs
    exceed this limit, the excess is charged to expense and
    reflected as additional DD&A. Given the volatility of oil
    and gas prices, it is reasonably possible that the
    Company’s estimate of discounted future net cash flows from
    proved oil and gas reserves could change in the near term. If
    oil and gas prices decline significantly, even if only for a
    short period of time, it is possible that write-downs of oil and
    gas properties could occur in the future.

The sum of the individual quarterly net income per common share
    amounts may not agree with year-to-date net income per common
    share as each quarterly computation is based on the weighted
    average number of common shares outstanding during that period.
    All potentially dilutive securities were included in each
    quarterly computation of diluted net income per common share, as
    none were antidilutive.

SUPPLEMENTAL
    GUARANTOR INFORMATION

Prior to 2001, Apache Finance Australia was a finance subsidiary
    of Apache with no independent operations. In this capacity, it
    issued approximately $270 million of publicly traded notes
    that are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Apache and,
    beginning in 2001, Apache North America, Inc. In 2007,
    $170 million of these notes matured and were repaid. The
    guarantors of Apache Finance Australia have joint and several
    liabilities. Similarly, Apache Finance Canada was also a finance
    subsidiary of Apache and had issued approximately
    $300 million of publicly traded notes that were fully and
    unconditionally guaranteed by Apache.

Generally, the issuance of publicly traded securities would
    subject those subsidiaries to the reporting requirements of the
    Securities and Exchange Commission. Since these subsidiaries had
    no independent operations and qualified as “finance
    subsidiaries,” they were exempted from these requirements.

During 2001, Apache contributed stock of its Australian and
    Canadian operating subsidiaries to Apache Finance Australia and
    Apache Finance Canada, respectively. As a result of these
    contributions, they no longer qualify as finance subsidiaries.
    As allowed by the SEC rules, the following condensed
    consolidating financial statements are provided as an
    alternative to filing separate financial statements.

Each of the companies presented in the condensed consolidating
    financial statements is wholly owned and has been consolidated
    in Apache Corporation’s consolidated financial statements
    for all periods presented. As such, the condensed consolidating
    financial statements should be read in conjunction with the
    financial statements of Apache Corporation and subsidiaries and
    notes thereto of which this note is an integral part.
