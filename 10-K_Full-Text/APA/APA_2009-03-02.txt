BUSINESS
    AND PROPERTIES

General

Apache Corporation, a Delaware corporation formed in 1954, is an
    independent energy company that explores for, develops and
    produces natural gas, crude oil and natural gas liquids. In
    North America, our exploration and production interests are
    focused in the Gulf of Mexico, the Gulf Coast, East Texas, the
    Permian basin, the Anadarko basin and the Western Sedimentary
    basin of Canada. Outside of North America, we have exploration
    and production interests onshore Egypt, offshore Western
    Australia, offshore the United Kingdom (U.K.) in the North Sea
    (North Sea), and onshore Argentina. We also have exploration
    interests on the Chilean side of the island of Tierra del Fuego.
    Our common stock, par value $0.625 per share, has been listed on
    the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) since 1969, on the Chicago
    Stock Exchange (CHX) since 1960, and on the NASDAQ National
    Market (NASDAQ) since 2004. On May 23, 2008, we filed
    certifications of our compliance with the listing standards of
    the NYSE and the NASDAQ, including our principal executive
    officer’s certification of compliance with the NYSE
    standards. Through our website, www.apachecorp.com, you can
    access, free of charge, electronic copies of the charters of the
    committees of our Board of Directors, other documents related to
    Apache’s corporate governance (including our Code of
    Business Conduct and Governance Principles), and documents

Reports filed with the SEC are also made available on its
    website at www.sec.gov. From time to time, we also post
    announcements, updates and investor information on our website
    in addition to copies of all recent press releases.

We hold interests in many of our United States (U.S.), Canadian,
    and other international properties through subsidiaries,
    including Apache Canada Ltd., DEK Energy Company (DEKALB),
    Apache Energy Limited (AEL), Apache North America, Inc., and
    Apache Overseas, Inc. Properties which we refer in this document
    may be held by those subsidiaries. We treat all operations as
    one line of business. References to “Apache” or the
    “Company” include Apache Corporation and its
    consolidated subsidiaries unless otherwise specifically stated.

Growth
    Strategy

Apache’s mission is to grow a profitable upstream oil and
    gas company for the long-term benefit of our shareholders. Our
    strategy includes building a balanced portfolio of assets,
    maintaining financial flexibility, and maximizing earnings and
    cash flows by controlling costs.

We have a portfolio of core areas that provide long-term growth
    opportunities through organic drilling supplemented by strategic
    acquisitions. Two decades ago, recognizing that the United
    States was a mature oil and gas province, we launched an
    international exploration component to our portfolio approach.
    Our international locations provide additional diversity of
    geologic and geographic risk as well as exposure to larger
    reserve targets, which fuel production and reserve growth. We
    have exploration and production operations in six countries,
    comprising seven regions: the Gulf Coast and Central regions in
    the United States, Canada, Egypt, the North Sea, Australia and
    Argentina. We have exploration interests in Chile located
    adjacent to our Argentine operations in Tierra del Fuego. We
    have achieved a critical mass in each of our producing regions
    that support sustainable, lower-risk, repeatable drilling
    opportunities. This enables us to pursue higher-risk,
    higher-reward exploration primarily in our international
    regions, particularly our growth areas of Australia, Canada and
    Egypt. Our acreage positions, which include 39 million
    gross acres across the globe, also bring ample growth
    opportunities.



In 2008, we drilled or participated in 1,418 gross wells
    with an overall 93 percent success rate; 90 percent
    were developmental and 10 percent were exploratory. We
    carefully spread our risk among our regions. For instance, no
    single region contributed more than 23 percent of our
    production or reserves in 2008. Our multiple geological
    locations also provide us a mixture in reserve life, which
    translates into balance in the timing of returns on our
    investments. Reserve life (estimated reserves divided by annual
    production) in our regions ranges from as short as seven years
    to as long as 27 years.

In addition, our goal is to balance our mix of hydrocarbons,
    which provides some measure of protection against price
    deterioration in a given product while retaining upside
    potential through a significant increase in either commodity
    price. In 2008, crude oil and liquids provided 50 percent
    of our production and 68 percent of our revenue. We were
    well-positioned to realize the benefit of higher oil prices,
    which significantly outpaced natural gas price increases for
    much of the year, despite falling 70 percent from their
    June 2008 peak. Our year-end estimated proved reserves were
    balanced at 55 percent natural gas and 45 percent
    crude oil and liquids.

Preserving financial flexibility and a strong balance sheet are
    also key to our overall business philosophy. We ended 2008 with
    a

debt-to-capitalization

ratio of 23 percent, after current year capital investments
    of $6.3 billion, excluding asset retirement costs. We also
    had over $1.5 billion of cash and short-term investments.
    In tightening credit markets, we believe Apache’s single-A
    debt ratings provide a competitive advantage in accessing
    capital. Our 2008 return on capital employed and return on
    equity of four percent and five percent, respectively, was
    negatively impacted by a non-cash write-down (discussed in
    Item 7 of this

Form 10-K).

Another critical component of our overall strategy is
    maximization of earnings and cash flow. Both are significantly
    impacted by commodity prices, which fluctuate and are primarily
    influenced by factors beyond our control, including worldwide
    supply and demand, political stability and governmental actions
    and regulations. For example, demand for energy, once thought to
    be insatiable, waned, driving prices down. Prices began the year
    strong and soared to unprecedented levels in mid-2008, only to
    fall rapidly by year-end, as the financial markets and
    ultimately the world’s economies stalled.

We also strive to control costs of both adding and producing
    reserves. Operating regions are given the autonomy necessary to
    make drilling and operating decisions and to act quickly.
    Management and incentive systems underscore high cash flows and
    motivate appropriate risk taking to reach or exceed targeted
    hurdle rates of return. Results are measured monthly, reviewed
    with management quarterly and utilized to determine annual
    performance awards. We monitor capital allocations, at least
    quarterly, through a disciplined and focused process of
    analyzing current economic conditions in each of our regions,
    internally generated drilling prospects, opportunities for
    tactical acquisitions or, occasionally, new core areas which
    could enhance our portfolio. We also periodically evaluate our
    properties to determine whether sales of certain assets could
    provide opportunities to redeploy our capital resources to
    rebalance our portfolio and enhance prospective returns.

The global economic slowdown and decline in oil and gas prices
    create a difficult operating environment for 2009. In
    preparation, we have substantially reduced our capital budget
    for 2009 in an effort to keep our expenditures in line with our
    cash flow. In 2009, we plan to invest $3.5 to $4.0 billion
    on capital expenditures, which is 50 percent less than in
    2008. Our plan includes investments for drilling and
    recompleting wells, development projects, waterflood projects,
    equipment upgrades, production enhancement projects and seismic
    acquisition. Also included is $300 million for gathering,
    transmission and processing (GTP) assets and $500 million
    for plugging and abandonment work, of which $250 million is
    for damage caused by Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Ike. As is our
    custom, we will review and revise our capital expenditure
    estimates throughout the year based on changing industry
    conditions and

results-to-date.

Additionally, we plan to step up our search for opportunities to
    acquire oil and gas properties where we believe we can add value
    and earn adequate rates of return.

During our 54 years in business and throughout the cycles
    of our industry, these strategies have underpinned our ability
    to deliver long-term production growth, increase proved reserves
    at a reasonable economic cost and achieve competitive investment
    rates of return for the benefit of our shareholders. We
    increased reserves 22 out of 23 years and increased
    production 28 out of the past 30 years, a testament to our
    longevity. While the business environment in 2009 is likely to
    be challenging, we believe we are in a strong financial position
    and are well-positioned to take advantage of what could be some
    of the most attractive acquisition opportunities in years.



Region
    Overviews

We currently have exploration and production interests in six
    countries, divided into seven operating regions: the United
    States (Gulf Coast and Central regions), Canada, Egypt,
    Australia, offshore the United Kingdom in the North Sea and
    Argentina. We also have exploration interests on the Chilean
    side of the island of Tierra del Fuego, which we acquired in the
    second quarter of 2008.

The following table sets out a brief comparative summary of
    certain key 2008 data for each of our operating areas.

In the U.S., the Gulf Coast region historically generates high
    returns on invested capital and cash flow significantly in
    excess of its exploration and development spending. Occasional
    acquisitions have played an important role, as steep decline
    rates mean offshore reserves are generally shorter-lived and
    difficult to replace on a cost-effective basis through drilling
    alone. The Central region brings the balance of long-lived
    reserves and consistent drilling results to the portfolio.
    Apache’s future growth in the U.S. is more likely to
    be achieved through a combination of drilling and acquisitions
    than through drilling activity alone.

Gulf Coast Region

The region comprises our
    interests in and along the Gulf of Mexico, in the areas on and
    offshore Louisiana and Texas. In waters less than
    1,200 feet deep in the Gulf of Mexico, Apache is the
    largest producer and, since 2004, has been the largest

held-by-production

acreage holder. In 2008, the region contributed approximately
    22 percent of our production and approximately
    25 percent of our revenues and, at year-end, held
    approximately 14 percent of our estimated proved reserves.

The region had a productive year even though a considerable
    amount of effort was expended on evacuations and repair related
    to Hurricanes Gustav and Ike. We drilled 116 wells, 90 of
    which were completed as producers, and performed 358
    workover and recompletions. In June 2008, we had a key discovery
    at the Geauxpher prospect located on Garden Banks Block 462
    in deepwater Gulf of Mexico. Apache generated the prospect and
    has a 40 percent working interest. Mariner Energy, Inc. is the
    designated operator of the block with a 60 percent working
    interest. A delineation well was drilled in December 2008,
    extending the productive reservoir limits. We project the
    initial discovery to be online in the second quarter of 2009.
    Additional potential on the block is expected to be tested by
    further drilling. At Ewing Banks 826, we completed four wells
    during the first half of 2008 and increased



production to 6,315 b/d from 700 b/d at the beginning of
    the year. We own a 100 percent working interest in the field. In
    addition, significant progress was achieved toward wrapping up
    remaining abandonments associated with Hurricanes Katrina and
    Rita in 2005 and repairing damage and restoring shut-in
    production attributable to Hurricanes Gustav and Ike in 2008.

Central Region

The Central region includes
    assets in East Texas, the Permian basin of West Texas and New
    Mexico and the Anadarko basin of western Oklahoma and the Texas
    Panhandle, where the Company got its start over 50 years
    ago. At year-end 2008, the Central region accounted for
    approximately 25 percent of our estimated proved reserves,
    the largest concentration in the Company. During 2008, we
    participated in drilling 415 wells in the Central region,
    404 of which were completed as producers. Apache also performed
    1,210 workovers and recompletions in the region during the year.

Marketing

In general, most of our
    U.S. gas is sold at either monthly or daily market prices.
    Our natural gas is sold primarily to Local Distribution
    Companies (LDCs), utilities, end-users, integrated major oil and
    gas companies and marketers. Approximately two percent of our
    2008 U.S. natural gas production was sold under physical
    long-term fixed-price contracts, all of which expired in 2008.
    See Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
    about Market Risk Commodity Risk” in this

Form 10-K.

Apache primarily markets its U.S. crude oil to integrated
    major oil companies, purchasers, transporters and refiners. The
    objective is to maximize the value of crude oil sold by
    identifying the best markets and most economical transportation
    routes available to move the product. Sales contracts are
    generally

30-day

evergreen contracts that renew automatically until canceled by
    either party. These contracts provide for sales that are priced
    daily at market prevailing prices.

We manage our credit risk by selling our oil and gas to diverse
    counterparties and monitoring our exposure on a daily basis.

Canada

In our Canadian region, we have 4.9 million net acres
    across the provinces of British Columbia, Alberta and
    Saskatchewan, which provide a significant inventory of both
    low-risk development drilling opportunities in and around a
    number of Apache fields and higher-risk, higher-reward
    exploration opportunities. In 2008, we drilled 484 wells in
    Canada, with 471 completed as producers. Three percent of the
    wells drilled during the year were exploration wells, half of
    which were productive. We performed 531 workover and
    recompletion projects. The region comprises approximately
    22 percent of our estimated proved reserves, the second
    largest concentration in the Company.

In 2009, we will continue our pursuit of the emerging shale-gas
    play in northeast British Columbia, where we have over 217,000
    highly prospective net acres. Apache completed seven horizontal
    wells at the Ootla shale-gas play in the Horn River Basin during
    2008. The last completed well utilized a 10-stage fracture
    stimulation. Apache plans to continue to develop the optimum
    strategy for Ootla well completions in 2009. In addition, we
    plan to drill exploratory wells to test other emerging plays in
    both Alberta and northeast British Columbia during 2009.

We will also continue to target shallow gas, including coal bed
    methane (CBM), in the Provost, North Grant Land and Nevis areas.
    As a result of these efforts, we believe Apache has emerged as
    one of Canada’s largest producers of CBM. We are also
    utilizing horizontal well technology to develop waterflood and
    enhanced oil recovery projects in the Midale field located in
    southeast Saskatchewan, and the Zama and House Mountain fields
    located in Alberta. Intermediate depth gas development drilling
    continues in the Kaybob, West 5 and South Grant Land areas of
    central and southern Alberta.

Marketing

Our Canadian natural gas marketing
    activities focus on sales to LDCs, utilities, end-users,
    integrated major oil companies, supply aggregators and
    marketers. Our composite client portfolio is diverse with the
    intent of reducing the concentration of credit risk in our
    portfolio. Improved North American natural gas pipeline
    connectivity over the years has led to a closer correlation
    between Canadian and U.S. natural gas prices. To diversify
    our market exposure and optimize pricing differences in the
    U.S. and Canada, we transport natural gas via our firm
    transportation contracts to California, the Chicago area, and
    eastern Canada. We sell the majority of our Canadian



production on a monthly basis, either into the first-

of-the-month

market or the daily market. In 2008, approximately two percent
    of our gas sales were subject to long-term fixed-price contracts
    with the latest expiration in 2011.

Our Canadian crude oil is primarily sold to refiners, integrated
    major oil companies and marketers. To increase the market value
    of our condensate and heavier crudes, our condensate is
    generally either used or sold for blending purposes. We sell our
    oil and natural gas liquids (NGLs) on crude oil postings, which
    are market-reflective prices that depend on worldwide crude oil
    prices and are adjusted for transportation and quality. In order
    to reach more purchasers and diversify our market, we transport
    crude oil on 12 pipelines to the major trading hubs within
    Alberta and Saskatchewan.

Egypt

Egypt holds our largest acreage position with more than
    11 million gross acres, following relinquishments in
    January 2009, in 23 separate concessions (19 producing
    concessions) that provide a sizable resource in the Cretaceous
    Upper Bahariya formations and outstanding exploration potential
    in deeper intervals from Lower Cretaceous to Jurassic. In
    addition to being the largest acreage holder in Egypt, we
    believe that Apache is the largest producer of liquid
    hydrocarbons and natural gas in the Western Desert and the third
    largest in all of Egypt. In 2008, our Egypt region contributed
    22 percent of Apache’s production revenue,
    21 percent of total production, and 14 percent of
    total estimated proved reserves. The Company reports all
    estimated proved reserves held under production sharing
    agreements utilizing the economic interest method, which
    excludes the host country’s share of reserves. In 2008,
    Apache had an active drilling program in Egypt, completing 236
    of 260 wells, a 91 percent success rate, and conducted
    701 workovers and recompletions. Historically, our growth in
    Egypt has been driven by drilling; we are the most active
    driller in Egypt.

In the Khalda concession two additional Salam gas processing
    trains, three and four, and an associated Apache pipeline
    compression project on the Western Desert Northern Gas Pipeline
    are forecasted to add additional net production of 100 MMcf/d
    and 5,000 b/d when fully operational in the second quarter of
    2009. The third processing train commenced operations on
    December 4, 2008. Commissioning with first gas from the
    fourth processing train is projected to commence during the
    first quarter of 2009.

In Egypt, our operations are conducted pursuant to production
    sharing contracts under which the contractor partner pays all
    operating and capital expenditure costs for exploration and
    development. A percentage of the production, usually up to
    40 percent, is available to the contractor partners to
    recover operating and capital expenditure costs. In general, the
    balance of the production is allocated between the contractor
    partners and Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation (EGPC) on a
    contractually defined basis. Development leases within
    concessions generally have a

25-year

life
    with extensions possible for additional commercial discoveries
    or on a negotiated basis.

Marketing

Our gas production is sold to EGPC
    under an industry-pricing formula, a sliding scale based on
    Dated-Brent crude oil with a minimum of $1.50 per MMbtu and a
    maximum of $2.65 per MMbtu, which corresponds to a Dated-Brent
    price of $21.00 per barrel. Generally, the industry-pricing
    formula applies to all new gas discovered and produced. In
    exchange for extension of the Khalda Concession lease in July
    2004, Apache agreed to accept the industry-pricing formula on a
    majority of gas sold but retained the previous gas-price formula
    (without a price cap) until 2013 for up to

100 MMcf/d

gross.

Oil from the Khalda Concession, the Qarun Concession and other
    nearby Western Desert blocks is sold directly to EGPC or other
    third parties. Oil sales are made either directly into the
    Egyptian oil pipeline grid, exported or sold at one of two
    terminals on the northern coast of Egypt or sold to
    non-governmental third parties including the Middle East Oil
    Refinery located in northern Egypt. Oil production that is
    presently sold to EGPC is sold on a spot basis at the monthly
    EGPC quoted price (indexed to Brent). In 2008, we sold 34
    cargoes (approximately 10.1 million barrels) of Western
    Desert crude oil from the El Hamra terminal located on the
    northern coast of Egypt into the export market. These export
    cargoes were sold to EGPC at market prices above our domestic
    sales. Additionally, Apache sold Qarun quality oil
    (approximately 7.6 million barrels) at the Sidi Kerir
    terminal, also located on the northern coast of Egypt. This
    Qarun oil was sold at prevailing market prices into the domestic
    market to non-governmental purchasers (three million
    barrels) or exported to buyers in the Mediterranean markets (11



cargoes for approximately 4.6 million barrels). We expect
    sales to the export market from both the Khalda and Qarun areas
    in the Western Desert to continue in 2009.

    activity is focused in the offshore Carnarvon, Gippsland and
    Browse basins, where Apache holds 5.2 million net acres in
    34 exploration permits, 11 production licenses and five
    retention leases.

Production operations are concentrated in the Carnarvon and
    Exmouth basins, the location of Apache’s 11 production
    licenses, all of which are Apache operated. In 2008, the region
    generated $372 million of production revenues from the sale
    of 10.5 MMboe, approximately five percent of our total
    production. Australia held 12 percent of our year-end
    estimated proved reserves. During the year, the region
    participated in drilling 46 wells, which generated 25
    productive oil wells and nine productive gas wells.

Our growth strategy includes development in the Carnarvon basin
    and in areas adjacent to this core area. As of the end of 2008,
    our Van Gogh and Pyrenees projects in the Exmouth basin were
    under active development. We had also initiated a development
    project related to our 2008 Halyard discovery (discussed below)
    and began appraising our large Julimar discovery (also discussed
    below). We completed planned development drilling at our
    Reindeer field.

Van Gogh is Apache-operated, while Pyrenees is operated by BHP
    Billiton. Van Gogh development drilling and

sub-sea

production equipment installation is well underway, with first
    oil production slated for mid-2009 through a floating production
    storage and offloading tanker. Additional development drilling
    is planned in 2009 prior to the start of production. Pyrenees
    development drilling is expected to commence in 2009 with first
    oil production expected in the first half of 2010. Production
    from each field is estimated at 20,000 b/d net to Apache.

In April 2008, we drilled the Halyard-1 well, which tested

68 MMcf/d

of gas and was completed as a producer. The Halyard field is
    expected to be tied-in to the nearby East Spar gas facilities
    once a market for the gas is under contract. Apache holds a
    55 percent interest in the field. Additional appraisal in
    2009 is necessary on the Julimar gas discovery before proceeding
    with a development plan. Based on current geological mapping, we
    believe that Julimar could be a multi-Tcf discovery. Apache owns
    a 65 percent interest in and operates the Julimar-Brunello
    complex.

During the fourth quarter of 2008, Apache completed a three-well
    development drilling campaign at the Reindeer field. On
    January 6, 2009, we secured a 154 Bcf,

7-year

gas
    sales contract that allowed us to reinstate our Reindeer
    development, which was suspended at the end of 2008 program
    because of a delay in gas sales contract negotiations.
    Negotiations were delayed by the onset of the global economic
    crisis and the resulting drop in metal prices. The gas will be
    supplied through a new

65-mile

offshore pipeline and a new onshore gas processing facility at
    Devil Creek. This sales contract is discussed in more detail
    below under “Subsequent Events.” Construction of
    pipeline and processing infrastructure is scheduled to commence
    in 2009 with first production anticipated in 2011. Apache owns a
    55-percent interest in the field.

We are currently evaluating the results of wells drilled in 2008
    and seismic information to assess the future potential in the
    Gippsland basin. All six wells drilled in 2008 were either dry
    or non-commercial.

Varanus Island — On June 3, 2008, subsidiaries of
    the Company reported a gas pipeline explosion at the Varanus
    Island gas processing and transportation hub offshore Western
    Australia, which shut-in production from the John Brookes field
    and Harriet Joint Venture. When fully operational, the
    Island’s operations process approximately

195 MMcf/d

and 5,400 b/d, net to Apache subsidiaries. On August 5,
    2008, partial production was reestablished from the John Brookes
    field and by year-end was at greater than 80 percent
    pre-incident levels. The Harriet Joint Venture gas facilities
    are located adjacent to the pipeline explosion and required more
    significant repairs to restore operation. A portion of the gas
    production from the Harriet Joint Venture was restored in
    December 2008 and is projected to be fully restored in the first
    half of 2009. Harriet Joint Venture oil production is projected
    to be fully restored in the first quarter of 2009. The John
    Brookes field accounted for approximately 60 percent and
    25 percent of the island’s pre-incident natural gas
    and oil production, respectively. Production from the Harriet
    Joint Venture accounted for the remaining 40 percent and
    75 percent of the island’s pre-incident natural gas
    and oil production,



respectively. Company subsidiaries operate the facilities and
    own a 68.5 percent interest in the Harriet Joint Venture
    and a 55 percent interest in the John Brookes field.
    Company subsidiaries maintain replacement cost insurance,
    subject to a deductible of approximately $7 million, with
    adequate limits to cover fully their share of the estimated cost
    of restoring the Varanus Island facilities.

During 2009, our Australian region plans to focus on its major
    field development projects and, to a lesser extent, its
    exploration and appraisal activities.

Marketing

As of December 31, 2008, Apache
    had a total of 18 active gas contracts in Australia with
    expiration dates ranging from March 2010 to July 2030.
    Generally, natural gas is sold in Western Australia under
    long-term, fixed-price contracts, many of which contain price
    escalation clauses based on the Australian consumer price index.

We continue to export all of our crude oil production into
    international markets at prices indexed to Asian benchmark crude
    oil prices, which typically track at or above New York
    Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) oil prices.

North
    Sea

Apache entered the North Sea in 2003 upon acquiring an
    approximate 97 percent working interest in the Forties
    field (Forties). Our drilling program and continued improvements
    in plant efficiencies led to an 11 percent increase in 2008
    production. We expect to increase our North Sea production in
    2009 relative to 2008. We also have several targeted facilities
    projects planned for 2009 to further improve the efficiency of
    our operations in the North Sea.

In 2008, the North Sea region produced 21.9 MMboe,
    approximately 11 percent of our total production,
    generating slightly more than $2.1 billion of revenue and
    accounting for approximately eight percent of our year-end
    estimated proved reserves. In 2008, we invested
    $459 million in the North Sea on drilling and recompleting
    wells and facility enhancement programs. We drilled
    14 wells in the North Sea during 2008, 12 of which were
    producers. We completed and commissioned a number of key
    projects in the North Sea region during 2008, including
    replacing the key import header on the Charlie platform that
    services the field export system, high-pressure gas-lift
    compression projects on the Alpha and Delta platforms, a large
    produced water reinjection system on the Charlie platform and
    replacement of the infield pipeline between the Bravo and
    Charlie platforms. Investments in facility upgrades and
    integrity-related projects over the past five years have
    continually increased the efficiency of our operations.

Drilling successes and improved platform operating efficiencies
    led to fourth-quarter 2008 production of 61,740 b/d. During
    2008, production averaged 59,494 b/d. The 2008 annual
    maintenance shut down on the Charlie platform impacted the field
    by 1,330 b/d, which was an improvement compared to 2,270 b/d
    impact in 2007. The new import header on the Charlie platform
    enabled the platform to be shut in for planned maintenance
    activities without impacting production export operations from
    the other field platforms.

Marketing

In 2008, we entered into two new
    term contracts for the physical sale of Forties crude at
    prevailing market prices. These term sales are composed of
    base-market indices, adjusted for the quality difference between
    the Forties crude and Brent, with a premium to reflect the
    higher market value for term arrangements. In addition to the
    term sales, Apache sold 11 spot cargoes of approximately
    600,000 barrels each and received value at or above the
    prevailing market prices.

Argentina

Argentina became our latest core area following two significant
    acquisitions in 2006 that substantially increased our presence
    in the country. In the second quarter of 2006, we completed our
    purchase of Pioneer’s operations in Argentina for
    $675 million, with estimated proved reserves of
    22 MMbbls of liquid hydrocarbons and 297 Bcf of
    natural gas. In the third quarter of 2006, we acquired
    additional interests in (and now operate) seven concessions in
    Tierra del Fuego (TdF) from Pan American for $429 million.
    With the addition of Mendoza CCyB Block 17B in 2008, our
    oil and gas assets are located in the Neuquén, Austral and
    Cuyo basins of Argentina. While Argentina presents unique
    challenges with evolving governmental regulations, we are
    optimistic about our ability to find additional hydrocarbons
    with the drill bit and to grow our reserves and production over
    the long-term.



In 2008, our Argentina region continued its broad drilling and
    recompletion programs. The region drilled 83 wells, 72 of
    which were productive. We produced 17.5 MMboe in 2008,
    which accounted for nine percent of Apache’s total
    production. Argentina holds approximately five percent of our
    total estimated proved reserves.

In December 2008, the Mendoza Province granted Apache an
    exploration permit for CCyB Block 17B in the Cuyo basin,
    increasing our Argentine acreage by 34 percent. The block
    is adjacent to and along a trend of existing producing fields.

We also completed a nearly 2,500 square kilometer
    three-dimensional (3-D) seismic mega shoot in Tierra del Fuego.
    which aided in the identification of prospects and increased
    Apache’s ability to drill productive wells. In the Austral
    Basin of Tierra del Fuego, Apache made discoveries on operated
    blocks in which we own a 70 percent working interest,
    including the San Sebastian area, where Apache successfully
    drilled three kilometers from the shore to test a new separate
    oil structure in the San Sebastian field. Apache also
    discovered a new field, Sección Veintinueve, and a field
    extension to the Sara Norte field. Apache believes that the new

3-D

seismic
    survey will continue to generate an inventory of drilling
    prospects.

On the mainland, we continued our drilling and recompletion
    campaigns in our established gas areas in the Neuquén
    basin. We drilled 11 new wells in our Estacion Fernandez Oro
    field, 10 new wells in our Guanaco field including a new deeper
    gas pool and 9 new wells in our Ranquil Co field, with a success
    rate of 100 percent. Apache plans to continue drilling in
    each of these fields in 2009. We also drilled a successful
    exploratory well on our Collon Cura exploration lease,
    fulfilling our license obligations.

Marketing

In 2008, 52 percent of our
    natural gas portfolio was regulated based upon certain market
    segments. We realized an average price of $.92 per Mcf on sales
    to regulated market segments in 2008. The remaining free market
    volumes were sold either on a monthly or daily basis or under
    term contracts, some of which extend through 2009. The average
    price received for free market volumes during the fourth quarter
    2008 was $2.28 per Mcf, versus a fourth-quarter 2007 price of
    $2.32, a decrease of two percent primarily because of lower spot
    price sales in Tierra del Fuego.

Taxes on exported oil effectively limits prices buyers are
    willing to pay for domestic sales. Domestic oil prices are
    currently based on $42 per barrel, plus quality adjustments, and
    producers realize a gradual increase or decrease as market
    prices deviate from the base price. In Tierra del Fuego, the
    price cap applies, but Apache retains the value-added tax
    collected from buyers, effectively increasing realized prices by
    21 percent. In 2008, we received an average price of $49.46
    per barrel for crude oil.

Chile

In November 2007, Apache was awarded exploration rights on two
    blocks comprising one million net acres in Tierra del Fuego,
    following a bid round. This acreage is adjacent to our
    552,000 net acres on the Argentine side of the island of
    Tierra del Fuego, and the additional acreage represents a
    natural extension of our expanding exploration and production
    operations. In 2008, Apache finalized the contracts with the
    Chilean government in July and shot a

3-D

seismic
    survey. In 2009, we plan to process and interpret this seismic
    data in order to validate prospects and identify initial
    drilling locations.

Major
    Customers

In 2008, purchases by Shell accounted for 17 percent of the
    company’s oil and gas production revenues.

Subsequent
    Events

Australian Gas Sales Contract

On
    January 6, 2009, Apache signed a contract to supply natural
    gas from its Reindeer field to CITIC Pacific’s Sino Iron
    project in Western Australia. Apache and its joint venture
    partner agreed to supply 154 billion cubic feet of gas over
    seven years, beginning in the second half of 2011. Apache owns a
    55-percent interest in the field.



The gas will be supplied through a new,

65-mile

offshore pipeline and a new onshore sales gas processing
    facility at Devil Creek, about 28 miles southwest of
    Dampier, with capacity to process

210 MMcf/d.

Apache plans to sell additional production from the Reindeer
    field to other domestic customers in Western Australia.

The contract price for the first three years is a fixed price
    adjusted periodically for changes in the Australian consumer
    price index. Beginning in the fourth year, the price is indexed
    to international oil prices. At an oil price of $50 per barrel,
    Apache’s net share of the revenue over the seven years of
    the contract would be approximately $700 million.

The gas sales agreement will not take effect unless Apache and
    its joint venture partner sign contracts for engineering and
    procurement of the gas plant and pipeline by mid-March 2009 (or
    a later date if agreed by all parties).

Management Changes

On January 15, 2009,
    Raymond Plank retired as Chairman of the Board, a director, and
    an employee of Apache. Mr. Plank founded Apache in 1954 and
    had served as an officer of the Company since 1954 (President

and/or

Chief
    Executive Officer from 1954 to 2002 and Chairman of the Board
    since 1979). He had been a director of the Company since 1954.
    G. Steven Farris, Apache’s president, chief executive
    officer and chief operating officer since 2002, succeeded
    Mr. Plank as chairman.

Also on January 15, 2009, Apache and Mr. Plank entered
    into an amendment and restatement of his employment agreement
    dated December 5, 1990, pursuant to which he agreed to
    provide consulting services to the Company for the remainder of
    his life.

On February 12, 2009, Mr. Farris formed an office of
    the chief executive with three key executives reporting to him.
    Messrs. Roger B. Plank, John A. Crum and Rodney J. Eichler
    were appointed to new positions effective as of
    February 12, 2009. Mr. Roger Plank now serves as
    president, Mr. Crum serves as co-chief operating officer
    and president — North America, and Mr. Eichler
    serves as co-chief operating officer and president —
    International. Although Messrs. Roger Plank, Crum and
    Eichler have separate functional responsibilities, they have
    joint and equal roles in the daily decision-making and direction
    of Apache. Mr. Farris continues to serve as chairman and
    chief executive officer of Apache and has resigned from his
    positions of president and chief operating officer of Apache
    effective February 12, 2009. Mr. Farris continues to
    serve as Apache’s principal executive officer and, in his
    new role as president, Mr. Roger Plank continues to serve
    as Apache’s principal financial officer.

Canadian Gas Pipeline Contract

On
    February 10, 2009, Apache’s wholly-owned subsidiary,
    Apache Canada Ltd entered into an agreement with TransCanada
    Pipelines Limited (TCPL) pursuant to which TCPL will construct
    and install a gas pipeline from northeastern British Columbia to
    the existing NOVA pipeline system located in the Ekwan area of
    Alberta. Apache Canada intends to ship gas produced from the
    Ootla basin on the new pipeline.

The construction, operation and transportation rates of the new
    pipeline are subject to regulatory approval. We expect to
    receive authority to construct the pipeline, and construction is
    expected to be complete on or before April 1, 2011. Upon
    completion of the pipeline, Apache Canada will have a

ship-or-pay

commitment to ship 100 MMBtu/d for either a four-year
    period or a ten-year period, depending on the rate structure
    determined and approved by the regulatory agency. Apache Canada
    has the right to terminate the agreement before October 1,
    2009. If Apache Canada elects to terminate the agreement or TCPL
    terminates for reasons set forth in the agreement, Apache Canada
    must reimburse TCPL for certain costs and expenses up to CDN
    $90 million plus certain taxes.

Drilling
    Statistics

Worldwide, in 2008, we participated in drilling 1,418 gross
    wells, with 1,319 (93 percent) completed as producers. We
    also performed more than 2,800 workovers and recompletions
    during the year. Historically, our drilling activities in the
    U.S. have generally concentrated on exploitation and
    extension of existing, producing fields rather than exploration.
    As a general matter, our operations outside of the
    U.S. focus on a mix of exploration and exploitation wells.
    In addition to our completed wells, at year-end several wells
    had not yet reached completion: 91 in the U.S. (56.3 net);
    10 in Canada (9.7 net); 36 in Egypt (33.5 net); 2 in Australia
    (1.6 net); 2 in the North Sea (1.9 net); and 9 in Argentina (8.7
    net).

As of December 31, 2008, we had 4,933,430, 3,270,055 and
    8,474,094 net acres scheduled to expire by
    December 31, 2009, 2010 and 2011, respectively, if
    production is not established or we take no other action to
    extend the terms. Approximately two million net acres (four
    million gross acres) of the 2009 expiration total expired in
    Egypt in January 2009. We plan to continue the terms of many of
    these licenses and concession areas through operational or
    administrative actions and do not expect a significant portion
    of our net acreage position to expire before such actions occur.

Estimated
    Proved Reserves and Future Net Cash Flows

As of December 31, 2008, Apache had total estimated proved
    reserves of 1,081 MMbbls of crude oil, condensate and NGLs
    and 7.9 Tcf of natural gas. Combined, these total estimated
    proved reserves are equivalent to 2.4 billion barrels of
    oil equivalent or 14.4 Tcf of natural gas. As a result of
    prices in effect at the end of 2008, we experienced significant
    negative revisions to our reserves, causing 2008 to be the first
    year in the last 23 in which reserves did not grow.

Proved oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities of
    natural gas, crude oil, condensate and NGLs that geological and
    engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be
    recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing
    economic and operating conditions. The Company reports all
    estimated proved reserves held under production sharing
    arrangements utilizing the “economic interest” method,
    which excludes the host country’s share of reserves.
    Reserve estimates are considered proved if economical
    productivity is supported by either actual production or
    conclusive formation tests. Estimated reserves that can be
    produced economically through application of improved recovery
    techniques are included in the “proved” classification
    when successful testing by a pilot project or the operation of
    an active, improved recovery program in the reservoir provides
    support for the engineering analysis on which the project or
    program is based. Estimated proved developed oil and gas
    reserves can be expected to be recovered through existing wells
    with existing equipment and operating methods.

Apache emphasizes that its reported reserves are estimates
    which, by their nature, are subject to revision. The estimates
    are made using available geological and reservoir data, as well
    as production performance data. These estimates are reviewed
    throughout the year and revised either upward or downward, as
    warranted by additional performance data.

Apache’s proved reserves are estimated at the property
    level and compiled for reporting purposes by a centralized group
    of experienced reservoir engineers that is independent of the
    operating groups. These engineers interact with engineering and
    geoscience personnel in each of Apache’s operating areas
    and with accounting and marketing employees to obtain the
    necessary data for projecting future production, costs, net
    revenues and ultimate recoverable reserves. Reserves are
    reviewed internally with senior management and presented to
    Apache’s Board of Directors in summary form on a quarterly
    basis. Annually, each property is reviewed in detail by our
    centralized and operating region engineers to ensure forecasts
    of operating expenses, netback prices, production trends and
    development timing are reasonable.



The estimate of reserves disclosed in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

are prepared by the Company’s internal staff, and the
    Company is responsible for the adequacy and accuracy of those
    estimates. However, we engage Ryder Scott Company, L.P.
    Petroleum Consultants (Ryder Scott) to review our processes and
    the reasonableness of our estimates of proved hydrocarbon liquid
    and gas reserves. We selected the properties for review by Ryder
    Scott. These properties represented all material fields,
    approximately 90 percent of international properties and
    over 80 percent of each country’s reserve value for
    new wells drilled during the year. During 2008, 2007 and 2006,
    Ryder Scott’s review covered 82, 77 and 75 percent of
    the Company’s worldwide estimated reserves value,
    respectively.

Ryder Scott opined that the overall proved reserves for the
    reviewed properties as estimated by the Company are, in the
    aggregate, reasonable, prepared in accordance with generally
    accepted petroleum engineering and evaluation principles and
    conform to the SEC’s definition of proved reserves as set
    forth in

Rule 210.4-10(a)

of

Regulation S-X.

Ryder Scott has informed the Company that the tests and
    procedures used during its reserves audit conform to the
    Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and
    Gas Reserves Information approved by the Society of Petroleum
    Engineers. Paragraph 2.2(f) of the Standards Pertaining to
    the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information
    defines a reserves audit as the process of reviewing certain of
    the pertinent facts interpreted and assumptions made that have
    resulted in an estimate of reserves prepared by others and the
    rendering of an opinion about (1) the appropriateness of
    the methodologies employed, (2) the adequacy and quality of
    the data relied upon, (3) the depth and thoroughness of the
    reserves estimation process, (4) the classification of
    reserves appropriate to the relevant definitions used, and
    (5) the reasonableness of the estimated reserve quantities.
    A reserve audit is not the same as a financial audit and is less
    rigorous in nature than an independent reserve report where the
    independent reserve engineer determines the reserves on his or
    her own.

The Company’s estimates of proved reserves and proved
    developed reserves as of December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006,
    changes in estimated proved reserves during the last three years
    and estimates of future net cash flows and discounted future net
    cash flows from estimated proved reserves are contained in
    Note 13 — Supplemental Oil and Gas Disclosures of
    Item 15 in this

Form 10-K.

These estimated future net cash flows are based on prices on the
    last day of the year and are calculated in accordance with
    Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 69,
    “Disclosures about Oil and Gas Producing Activities.”
    Disclosure of this value and related reserves has been prepared
    in accordance with SEC

Regulation S-X

Rule 4-10.

In December 2008, the SEC released the final rule for
    “Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting”
    (Modernization). The Modernization disclosure requirements will
    permit reporting of oil and gas reserves using an average price
    based upon the prior

12-month

period rather than year-end prices and the use of new
    technologies to determine proved reserves, if those technologies
    have been demonstrated to result in reliable conclusions about
    reserves volumes. Companies will also be allowed to disclose
    probable and possible reserves in SEC filed documents. In
    addition, companies will be required to report the independence
    and qualifications of its reserves preparer or auditor and file
    reports when a third party is relied upon to prepare reserves
    estimates or conduct a reserves audit. The Modernization
    disclosure requirements become effective for Apache’s
    Annual Report on

Form 10-K

for the year ended December 31, 2009.

Employees

On December 31, 2008, we had 3,639 employees.

Offices

Our principal executive offices are located at One Post Oak
    Central, 2000 Post Oak Boulevard, Suite 100, Houston, Texas

77056-4400.

At year-end 2008, we maintained regional exploration

and/or

production offices in Tulsa, Oklahoma; Houston, Texas; Calgary,
    Alberta; Cairo, Egypt; Perth, Western Australia; Aberdeen,
    Scotland; and Buenos Aires, Argentina. Apache leases all of its
    primary office space. The current lease on our principal
    executive offices runs through December 31, 2013. For
    information regarding the Company’s obligations under its
    office leases, see the table in Item 7 —

Title
    to Interests

As is customary in our industry, a preliminary review of title
    records, which may include opinions or reports of appropriate
    professionals or counsel, is made at the time we acquire
    properties. We believe that our title to all of the various
    interests set forth above is satisfactory and consistent with
    the standards generally accepted in the oil and gas industry,
    subject only to immaterial exceptions that do not detract
    substantially from the value of the interests or materially
    interfere with their use in our operations. The interests owned
    by us may be subject to one or more royalty, overriding royalty,
    and other outstanding interests (including disputes related to
    such interests) customary in the industry. The interests may
    additionally be subject to obligations or duties under
    applicable laws, ordinances, rules, regulations, and orders of
    arbitral or governmental authorities. In addition, the interests
    may be subject to burdens such as production payments, net
    profits interests, liens incident to operating agreements and
    current taxes, development obligations under oil and gas leases,
    and other encumbrances, easements, and restrictions, none of
    which detract substantially from the value of the interests or
    materially interfere with their use in our operations.

ITEM 1A.

RISK
    FACTORS

Our business activities and the value of our securities are
    subject to significant hazards and risks, including those
    described below. If any of such events should occur, our
    business, financial condition, liquidity

and/or

results of operations could be materially harmed, and holders
    and purchasers of our securities could lose part or all of their
    investments. Additional risks relating to our securities may be
    included in the prospectuses for securities we issue in the
    future.

Our
    profitability and the carrying value of our properties is highly
    dependent on the prices of crude oil, natural gas and natural
    gas liquids, which have historically been very
    volatile

Our estimated proved reserves, revenues, profitability,
    operating cash flows and future rate of growth are highly
    dependent on the prices of crude oil, natural gas and NGLs,
    which are affected by numerous factors beyond our control. These
    prices have historically been very volatile and are likely to
    remain volatile in the future. A significant and extended
    downward trend in commodity prices would have a material adverse
    effect on our revenues, profitability and cash flow and could
    result in a reduction in the carrying value of our oil and gas
    properties and the amounts of our estimated proved oil and gas
    reserves. To the extent that we have not hedged our production
    with derivative contracts or fixed-price contracts, any
    significant and extended decline in oil and natural gas prices
    adversely affects our financial position.

Under the full-cost method of accounting as allowed by the SEC,
    the Company is required to review the carrying value of its
    proved oil and gas properties each quarter on a

country-by-country

basis. Under these rules, capitalized costs of proved oil and
    gas properties, net of accumulated DD&A and deferred income
    taxes, may not exceed the present value of estimated future net
    cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves, discounted
    10 percent, net of related tax effects. These rules
    generally require pricing future oil and gas production at the
    unescalated oil and gas prices in effect at the end of each
    fiscal quarter and require a write-down if the
    “ceiling” is exceeded, even if prices declined for
    only a short period of time. The Company recorded a
    $5.3 billion ($3.6 billion net of tax) non-cash
    write-down of the carrying value of the Company’s U.S.,
    U.K. North Sea, Canadian and Argentine proved oil and gas
    properties as of December 31, 2008, as a result of the
    ceiling test limitations. If oil and gas prices deteriorate from
    the Company’s year-end realized prices, it is likely that
    additional write-downs will occur in 2009.

A
    downgrade in our credit rating could negatively impact our cost
    of and ability to access capital

We receive debt ratings from the major credit rating agencies in
    the United States. Factors that may impact our credit ratings
    include debt levels, planned asset purchases or sales and
    near-term and long-term production growth opportunities.
    Liquidity, asset quality, cost structure, reserve mix and
    commodity pricing levels could also be considered by the rating
    agencies. Apache’s senior unsecured long-term debt is
    currently rated A3 by Moody’s, A- by Standard &
    Poor’s and A by Fitch. Apache’s short-term debt rating
    for its commercial paper program is currently P-2 by
    Moody’s, A-2 by Standard & Poor’s and F1 by
    Fitch. The outlook is stable from Moody’s and Standard
    & Poor’s and negative from Fitch. A ratings downgrade
    could adversely impact our ability to access debt markets in



the future, increase the cost of future debt and potentially
    require the Company to post letters of credit in certain
    circumstances.

Declining
    general economic, business or industry conditions may have a
    material adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity
    and financial condition

Recently, concerns over inflation, energy costs, geopolitical
    issues, the availability and cost of credit, the United States
    mortgage market and a declining real estate market in the United
    States have contributed to increased economic uncertainty and
    diminished expectations for the global economy.

These factors, combined with volatile oil, natural gas and NGLs
    prices, declining business and consumer confidence and increased
    unemployment, have precipitated an economic slowdown and a
    recession. Concerns about global economic growth have had a
    significant adverse impact on global financial markets and
    commodity prices. If the economic climate in the United States
    or abroad continues to deteriorate, demand for petroleum
    products could continue to diminish, which could impact the
    price at which we can sell our oil, natural gas and NGLs, affect
    our vendors, suppliers and customers ability to continue
    operations, and ultimately, adversely impact our results of
    operations, liquidity and financial condition.

Our
    commodity price risk management and trading activities may
    prevent us from benefiting fully from price increases and may
    expose us to other risks

To the extent that we engage in price risk management activities
    to protect ourselves from commodity price declines, we may be
    prevented from realizing the full benefits of price increases
    above the levels of the derivative instruments used to manage
    price risk. In addition, our hedging arrangements may expose us
    to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances,
    including instances in which:

•

our production falls short of the hedged volumes;

•

there is a widening of price basis differentials between
    delivery points for our production and the delivery point
    assumed in the hedge arrangement;

•

the counterparties to our hedging or other price risk management
    contracts fail to perform under those arrangements; or

•

a sudden unexpected event materially impacts oil and natural gas
    prices.

The
    credit risk of financial institutions could adversely affect
    us

We have exposure to different counterparties, and we have
    entered into transactions with counterparties in the financial
    services industry, including commercial banks, investment banks,
    insurance companies, other investment funds and other
    institutions. These transactions expose us to credit risk in the
    event of default of our counterparty. Continued deterioration in
    the credit markets may continue to impact the credit ratings of
    our current and potential counterparties and affect their
    ability to fulfill their existing obligations to us and their
    willingness to enter into future transactions with us. We have
    exposure to these financial institutions in the form of
    derivative transactions in connection with our hedges. We also
    maintain insurance policies with insurance companies to protect
    us against certain risks inherent in our business. In addition,
    if any lender under our credit facility is unable to fund its
    commitment, our liquidity will be reduced by an amount up to the
    aggregate amount of such lender’s commitment under our
    credit facility.

Certain
    of our undeveloped leasehold acreage is subject to leases that
    will expire over the next several years unless production is
    established on units containing the acreage

A sizeable portion of our acreage is currently undeveloped.
    Unless production in paying quantities is established on units
    containing certain of these leases during their terms, the
    leases will expire. If our leases expire, we will lose our right
    to develop the related properties. Our drilling plans for these
    areas are subject to



change based upon various factors, including drilling results,
    oil and natural gas prices, the availability and cost of
    capital, drilling and production costs, availability of drilling
    services and equipment, gathering system and pipeline
    transportation constraints and regulatory approvals.

Our
    ability to sell natural gas and/or receive market prices for our
    gas may be adversely affected by pipeline and gathering system
    capacity constraints and various transportation
    interruptions

A portion of our natural gas and oil production in any region
    may be interrupted, or shut in, from time to time for numerous
    reasons, including as a result of weather conditions, accidents,
    loss of pipeline or gathering system access, field labor issues
    or strikes, or capital constraints that limit the ability of
    third parties to construct gathering systems, processing
    facilities or interstate pipelines to transport our production,
    or we might voluntarily curtail production in response to market
    conditions. If a substantial amount of our production is
    interrupted at the same time, it could temporarily adversely
    affect our cash flow.

Acquisitions
    or discoveries of additional reserves are needed to avoid a
    material decline in reserves and production

The production rate from oil and gas properties generally
    declines as reserves are depleted, while related

per-unit

production costs generally increase as a result of decreasing
    reservoir pressures and other factors. Therefore, unless we add
    reserves through exploration and development activities or,
    through engineering studies, identify additional behind-pipe
    zones, secondary recovery reserves or tertiary recovery
    reserves, or acquire additional properties containing proved
    reserves, our estimated proved reserves will decline materially
    as reserves are produced. Future oil and gas production is,
    therefore, highly dependent upon our level of success in
    acquiring or finding additional reserves on an economic basis.
    Furthermore, if oil or gas prices increase, our cost for
    additional reserves could also increase.

We may
    not realize an adequate return on wells that we
    drill

Drilling for oil and gas involves numerous risks, including the
    risk that we will not encounter commercially productive oil or
    gas reservoirs. The wells we drill or participate in may not be
    productive, and we may not recover all or any portion of our
    investment in those wells. The seismic data and other
    technologies we use do not allow us to know conclusively prior
    to drilling a well that crude or natural gas is present or may
    be produced economically. The costs of drilling, completing and
    operating wells are often uncertain, and drilling operations may
    be curtailed, delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of
    factors including, but not limited to:

•

unexpected drilling conditions;

•

pressure or irregularities in formations;

•

equipment failures or accidents;

•

fires, explosions, blowouts and surface cratering;

•

marine risks such as capsizing, collisions and hurricanes;

•

other adverse weather conditions; and

•

increase in the cost of, or shortages or delays in the
    availability of, drilling rigs and equipment.

Future drilling activities may not be successful and, if
    unsuccessful, this failure could have an adverse effect on our
    future results of operations and financial condition. While all
    drilling, whether developmental or exploratory, involves these
    risks, exploratory drilling involves greater risks of dry holes
    or failure to find commercial quantities of hydrocarbons.

We may
    fail to fully identify potential problems related to acquired
    reserves or to properly estimate those reserves

Although we perform a review of properties that we acquire that
    we believe is consistent with industry practices, such reviews
    are inherently incomplete. It generally is not feasible to
    review in depth every individual



property involved in each acquisition. Ordinarily, we will focus
    our review efforts on the higher-value properties and will
    sample the remainder. However, even a detailed review of records
    and properties may not necessarily reveal existing or potential
    problems, nor will it permit us as a buyer to become
    sufficiently familiar with the properties to assess fully and
    accurately their deficiencies and potential. Inspections may not
    always be performed on every well, and environmental problems,
    such as ground water contamination, are not necessarily
    observable even when an inspection is undertaken. Even when
    problems are identified, we often assume certain environmental
    and other risks and liabilities in connection with acquired
    properties. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in
    estimating quantities of proved oil and gas reserves and future
    production rates and associated costs with respect to acquired
    properties, and actual results may vary substantially from those
    assumed in the estimates. In addition, there can be no assurance
    that acquisitions will not have an adverse effect upon our
    operating results, particularly during the periods in which the
    operations of acquired businesses are being integrated into our
    ongoing operations.

Our
    North American operations are subject to governmental risks that
    may impact our operations

Our North American operations have been, and at times in the
    future may be, affected by political developments and by
    federal, state, provincial and local laws and regulations such
    as restrictions on production, changes in taxes, royalties and
    other amounts payable to governments or governmental agencies,
    price or gathering rate controls and environmental protection
    laws and regulations. New political developments, laws and
    regulations may adversely impact our results on operations.

International
    operations have uncertain political, economic and other
    risks

Our operations outside North America are based primarily in
    Egypt, Australia, the United Kingdom and Argentina. On a barrel
    equivalent basis, approximately 46 percent of our 2008
    production was outside North America and approximately
    39 percent of our estimated proved oil and gas reserves on
    December 31, 2008 were located outside North America. As a
    result, a significant portion of our production and resources
    are subject to increased political and economic risks and other
    factors including, but not limited to:

•

general strikes and civil unrest;

•

the risk of war, acts of terrorism, expropriation, forced
    renegotiation or modification of existing contracts;

•

import and export regulations;

•

taxation policies, including royalty and tax increases and
    retroactive tax claims, and investment restrictions;

•

price control;

•

transportation regulations and tariffs;

•

constrained natural gas markets dependent on demand in a single
    or limited geographical area;

•

exchange controls, currency fluctuations, devaluation or other
    activities that limit or disrupt markets and restrict payments
    or the movement of funds;

•

laws and policies of the United States affecting foreign trade,
    including trade sanctions;

•

the possibility of being subject to exclusive jurisdiction of
    foreign courts in connection with legal disputes relating to
    licenses to operate and concession rights in countries where we
    currently operate;

•

the possible inability to subject foreign persons to the
    jurisdiction of courts in the United States; and

•

difficulties in enforcing our rights against a governmental
    agency because of the doctrine of sovereign immunity and foreign
    sovereignty over international operations.

Foreign countries have occasionally asserted rights to oil and
    gas properties through border disputes. If a country claims
    superior rights to oil and gas leases or concessions granted to
    us by another country, our interests could decrease in value or
    be lost. Even our smaller international assets may affect our
    overall business and results of operations by distracting
    management’s attention from our more significant assets.
    Various regions of the world in which we operate have a history
    of political and economic instability. This instability could
    result in new



governments or the adoption of new policies that might result in
    a substantially more hostile attitude toward foreign investments
    such as ours. In an extreme case, such a change could result in
    termination of contract rights and expropriation of our assets.
    This could adversely affect our interests and our future
    profitability.

The impact that future terrorist attacks or regional hostilities
    may have on the oil and gas industry in general, and on our
    operations in particular, is not known at this time. Uncertainty
    surrounding military strikes or a sustained military campaign
    may affect operations in unpredictable ways, including
    disruptions of fuel supplies and markets, particularly oil, and
    the possibility that infrastructure facilities, including
    pipelines, production facilities, processing plants and
    refineries, could be direct targets of, or indirect casualties
    of, an act of terror or war. We may be required to incur
    significant costs in the future to safeguard our assets against
    terrorist activities.

Material
    differences between the estimated and actual timing of critical
    events may affect the completion and commencement of production
    from development projects

We are involved in several large development projects whose
    completion may be delayed beyond our anticipated completion
    dates. Our projects may be delayed by project approvals from
    joint venture partners; timely issuances of permits and licenses
    by governmental agencies; weather conditions; manufacturing and
    delivery schedules of critical equipment; and other unforeseen
    events. Delays and differences between estimated and actual
    timing of critical events may adversely affect our large
    development projects and our ability to participate in large
    scale development projects in the future.

Our
    operations are sensitive to currency rate
    fluctuations

Our operations are sensitive to fluctuations in foreign currency
    exchange rates, particularly between the U.S. dollar with
    the Canadian dollar, the Australian dollar and the British
    Pound. Our financial statements, presented in U.S. dollars,
    are affected by foreign currency fluctuations through both
    translation risk and transaction risk. Volatility in exchange
    rates may adversely affect our results of operation,
    particularly through the weakening of the U.S. dollar
    relative to other currencies.

Weather
    and climate may have a significant adverse impact on our
    revenues and productivity

Demand for oil and natural gas are, to a significant degree,
    dependent on weather and climate, which impact the price we
    receive for the commodities we produce. In addition, our
    exploration and development activities and equipment can be
    adversely affected by severe weather, such as hurricanes in the
    Gulf of Mexico or cyclones offshore Australia, which may cause a
    loss of production from temporary cessation of activity or lost
    or damaged equipment. Our planning for normal climatic
    variation, insurance programs, and emergency recovery plans may
    inadequately mitigate the effects of such weather, and not all
    such effects can be predicted, eliminated or insured against.

We may
    incur significant costs related to environmental
    matters

As an owner or lessee and operator of oil and gas properties, we
    are subject to various federal, provincial, state, local and
    foreign country laws and regulations relating to discharge of
    materials into, and protection of, the environment. These laws
    and regulations may, among other things, impose liability on the
    lessee under an oil and gas lease for the cost of pollution

clean-up

resulting from operations, subject the lessee to liability for
    pollution damages and require suspension or cessation of
    operations in affected areas. Our efforts to limit our exposure
    to such liability and cost may prove inadequate and result in
    significant adverse affect on our results of operations. In
    addition, it is possible that the increasingly strict
    requirements imposed by environmental laws and enforcement
    policies could require us to make significant capital
    expenditures. Such capital expenditures could adversely impact
    our cash flows and our financial condition.

We
    face strong industry competition that may have a significant
    negative impact on our result of operations

Strong competition exists in all sectors of the oil and gas
    exploration and production industry. We compete with major
    integrated and other independent oil and gas companies for
    acquisition of oil and gas leases, properties and



reserves, equipment and labor required to explore, develop and
    operate those properties and marketing of oil and natural gas
    production. Crude oil and natural gas prices impact the costs of
    properties available for acquisition and the number of companies
    with the financial resources to pursue acquisition
    opportunities. Many of our competitors have financial and other
    resources substantially larger than we possess and have
    established strategic long-term positions and maintain strong
    governmental relationships in countries in which we may seek new
    entry. As a consequence, we may be at a competitive disadvantage
    in bidding for drilling rights. In addition, many of our larger
    competitors may have a competitive advantage when responding to
    factors that affect demand for oil and natural gas production,
    such as fluctuating worldwide commodity prices and levels of
    production, the cost and availability of alternative fuels and
    the application of government regulations. We also compete in
    attracting and retaining personnel, including geologists,
    geo-physicists, engineers and other specialists. These
    competitive pressures may have a significant negative impact on
    our results of operations.

Our
    insurance policies do not cover all risks

Exploration for and production of oil and natural gas can be
    hazardous, involving unforeseen occurrences such as blowouts,
    cratering, fires and loss of well control, which can result in
    damage to or destruction of wells or production facilities,
    injury to persons, loss of life, or damage to property or the
    environment. The insurance coverage that we maintain against
    certain losses or liabilities arising from our operations may be
    inadequate to cover any such resulting liability; moreover,
    insurance is not available to us against all operational risks.

    334,753,638 shares of our common stock outstanding held by
    approximately 6,000 stockholders of record and approximately
    448,000 beneficial owners.

We have paid cash dividends on our common stock for 44
    consecutive years through December 31, 2008. When, and if,
    declared by our Board of Directors, future dividend payments
    will depend upon our level of earnings, financial requirements
    and other relevant factors.

In 1995, under our stockholder rights plan, each of our common
    stockholders received a dividend of one preferred stock purchase
    right (a “right”) for each 2.310 outstanding shares of
    common stock (adjusted for subsequent stock dividends and a
    two-for-one stock split) that the stockholder owned. These
    rights were originally scheduled to expire on January 31,
    2006. Effective as of that date, the rights were reset to one
    right per share of common stock, and the expiration was extended
    to January 31, 2016. Unless the rights have been previously
    redeemed, all shares of Apache common stock are issued with
    rights, which trade automatically with our shares of common
    stock. For a description of the rights, please refer to

ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S
    DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
    OPERATIONS

Apache Corporation, a Delaware corporation formed in 1954, is an
    independent energy company that explores for, develops and
    produces natural gas, crude oil and natural gas liquids. In
    North America, our exploration and production operations are
    focused in the Gulf of Mexico, the Gulf Coast, East Texas, the
    Permian basin, the Anadarko basin and the Western Sedimentary
    basin of Canada. Outside of North America, we have exploration
    and production operations onshore Egypt, offshore Western
    Australia, offshore the United Kingdom (U.K.) in the North Sea
    (North Sea), and onshore Argentina. We also have exploration
    interests on the Chilean side of the island of Tierra del Fuego.

The following discussion should be read together with the
    Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements, which are included in Item 8 of this

Form 10-K,

and the Risk Factors information, which are set forth in
    Item 1A of this

Form 10-K.

Overview

Apache’s 2008 results were significantly impacted by
    several events:

•

A drop in demand related to the slowing global economy caused
    fourth-quarter oil and gas prices to drop sharply.

•

Two major uncontrollable events curtailed our production:

•

hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico, and

•

an explosion on a pipeline that transports all of our gas
    production in Australia.

•

A non-cash write-down of the carrying value of our U.S., U.K.
    North Sea, Canadian and Argentine proved oil and gas properties,
    necessitated by low commodity prices in effect at year-end
    (discussed below).

Crude
    Oil and Natural Gas Prices

The oil and gas industry as a whole experienced a year of
    extremes during 2008. Crude oil and natural gas prices climbed
    precipitously in the first half of the year, only to pull back
    in the third quarter before collapsing in the fourth quarter.
    Apache monthly average realized prices during the summer reached
    $118.38 per barrel and $9.12 per thousand cubic feet (Mcf). Our
    December average realized prices were $36.45 per barrel and
    $4.75 per Mcf. February 2009 indices indicate that prices are
    trending below December’s averages as the global economy
    and demand continue to weaken.

Crude
    Oil and Natural Gas Production

Apache’s 2008 consolidated production declined five percent
    from 2007 on a barrel of oil equivalent (boe) basis. Our
    production would have increased over 2007 levels had it not been
    for the impact of the following:

•

U.S. production was affected by wells shut-in because of,
    and damage caused by, Hurricanes Gustav and Ike. While we plan
    to restore nearly all of the production during the second
    quarter of 2009, the timing in many instances is pipeline
    dependent and, therefore, beyond our control. See Operating
    Highlights in this Item 7.

•

In June 2008, a pipeline explosion at the Varanus Island gas
    processing and transportation hub offshore Western Australia
    disrupted gas and oil sales, reducing 2008 production. We plan
    to have all of the volumes restored in the first half of 2009.
    See Operating Highlights in this Item 7.

Earnings
    and Cash Flow

From an earnings perspective, we had our historical best and
    worst quarters ever, just one quarter apart. The fourth-quarter
    price collapse and associated $3.6 billion non-cash
    after-tax write-down nearly eliminated 2008 nine-month earnings
    that totaled $3.7 billion dollars or $10.84 per common
    diluted share. The write-down reduced earnings for the year to
    $706 million, or $2.09 per share.



Record commodity prices in the first half of 2008 drove record
    cash provided by operating activities of $7.1 billion and
    record oil and gas revenues of $12.4 billion, both of which
    were unaffected by the

write-down.

They were, however, affected by falling commodity prices, most
    notably in the fourth quarter of 2008. Key financial indicators
    for each quarter and the year of 2008 are noted below:

Operating
    and Drilling Costs

Costs were a challenge for Apache and our industry in 2008 and
    are expected to remain so in 2009. Drilling, service and
    acquisition costs, which have increased steadily since the
    industry’s last downturn in 2001, reached unprecedented
    levels in 2008. Also, in the U.S., activity to repair damage
    caused by Gulf of Mexico hurricanes over the last few years has
    contributed to increased demand and costs. Even though we have
    seen a sharp drop in commodity prices, costs have fallen less
    rapidly pressuring operating margins. We believe costs will
    ultimately adjust to the current oil and gas price environment,
    but until they do, our operating margins and drilling costs will
    continue to be pressured.

Financial
    Position and 2009

We believe we are well positioned to take advantage of
    opportunities that will invariably present themselves in the
    current business environment. We enter 2009 with a
    debt-to-capitalization ratio of 23 percent, after
    consideration of the non-cash write-down. We had
    over $1.5 billion in cash and short-term investments
    and $2.3 billion availability on our lines of credit at the
    close of the year. In a tightening credit market, we believe
    Apache’s single-A debt ratings will provide a competitive
    advantage in accessing capital. Our 2008 return on capital
    employed and return on equity were four percent and five
    percent, respectively, after taking into effect the
    $5.3 million non-cash write-down.

In 2009, we are projecting production growth driven by
    multi-year projects coming on-line during the year (discussed
    below in Operational Highlights). We plan to hold our capital
    expenditures, currently planned at 50 percent below 2008
    spending levels, in line with our operating cash flows. We will
    continue to monitor capital spending closely based on actual and
    projected cash flow estimates and intend to scale back spending
    further should commodity prices remain at current levels or fall
    further.

For an in-depth discussion of Apache’s long-term growth
    strategy, please refer to Part 1, Items 1 and 2.
    Business and Properties of this

Form 10-K.

Full-Cost
    Accounting and 2008 Write-down in Net Oil and Gas Property
    Assets

The Company follows the full-cost method of accounting as
    allowed by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Under
    the full-cost method of accounting, a ceiling test must be
    performed each quarter, for each country. The test establishes a
    limit (ceiling), on the carrying value of proved oil and gas
    properties. This carrying value (net book value and the related
    deferred income taxes) may not exceed the ceiling. The ceiling
    limitation is the estimated after-tax future net cash flows from
    proved oil and gas reserves, excluding future



expected cash outflows associated with settling asset retirement
    obligations accrued on the balance sheet. The estimate of
    after-tax future net cash flows is discounted at 10 percent
    per annum and calculated using both commodity prices and costs
    in effect at the end of the period, held flat for the life of
    the properties, except where future oil and gas sales are
    covered by physical contract terms or by derivative instruments
    that qualify, and are accounted for, as cash flow hedges. If
    capitalized costs (carrying value) exceed this limit, the excess
    is charged to expense and reflected as additional Depletion,
    Depreciation and Amortization (DD&A) during the period.

In December 2008, the SEC released the final rule for
    “Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting,” which will
    permit reporting of oil and gas reserves using an average price
    based upon the prior 12-month period rather than year-end
    prices. The new rule becomes effective for the quarter ended
    December 31, 2009. See Note 1— Summary of
    Significant Accounting Policies in this

Form 10-K.

Despite record realized prices and record revenues for 2008, the
    low oil and gas prices in effect at the end of the year resulted
    in an aggregate $5.3 billion ($3.6 billion net of tax)
    non-cash write-down of the carrying value of Company’s
    U.S., U.K. North Sea, Canadian and Argentine proved oil and gas
    properties. If oil and gas prices fall below year-end levels,
    additional write-downs of oil and gas properties may occur. See
    Note 1 — Summary of Significant Accounting
    Policies in this

Form 10-K.

Operating
    Highlights

We made considerable operational progress during the year, which
    we believe adds to our platform for long-term profitable growth
    in spite of hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico and a gas pipeline
    explosion at the Varanus Island gas processing and
    transportation hub offshore Western Australia. Key operational
    highlights include:

U.S.
    Gulf Coast

Gulf Coast focused on an active drilling program and restoring
    production impacted by the 2005 and 2008 hurricanes. In addition
    to drilling wells, the region also performed 358 workover and
    recompletion operations during 2008. Significant events
    affecting Gulf Coast operations include:

Development
    Projects

•

At Ewing Banks 826, we completed four wells during the first
    half of 2008 and increased production to 6,315 b/d, up from 700
    b/d at the beginning of the year. We own a 100 percent
    working interest in the field.

Exploration
    Projects

•

In June 2008, we had a key discovery at the Geauxpher prospect
    located on Garden Banks Block 462 in deepwater Gulf of
    Mexico. Apache generated the prospect and has a 40-percent
    working interest. Mariner Energy, Inc. is the designated
    operator of the block with a 60-percent working interest. A
    delineation well was drilled in December 2008, extending the
    productive reservoir limits. We forecast the initial discovery
    to be online in the second quarter of 2009. Additional potential
    on the block is expected to be tested by further drilling.

Hurricanes

•

During the third quarter of 2008, Hurricanes Gustav and Ike
    damaged onshore and offshore production and transportation
    facilities in our Gulf Coast region. Although most of our
    offshore operated platforms escaped with minor damage, we did
    lose four Apache-operated and two non-operated platforms. Our
    ability to transport and process our crude oil and natural gas
    production was also impacted by damages to third-party pipelines
    and processing facilities. The impact of the hurricanes on 2008
    operations and results follows:

Production

— Wells shut-in as a result of the
    hurricanes reduced 2008 production by an estimated

54.6 MMcf/d

and 6,941 b/d. A substantial part of Apache’s net
    production shut-in by the storm was restored by the end of 2008,
    with only 7,700 b/d and

83 MMcf/d

remaining offline. While we plan to restore nearly all of the
    production by mid-year 2009, the timing in many instances is
    beyond our control since we



are awaiting repairs to third-party pipelines and facilities.
    All but approximately 1,100 boe per day of production will
    ultimately be restored.

Financial Results

— The impact of the
    hurricanes on our 2008 financial results was an estimated
    $410 million of lower crude oil and natural gas revenues.
    We also incurred approximately $75 million of expenditures
    for repair, redevelopment and abandonment of properties damaged
    by the hurricanes. The Company anticipates an additional $170 to
    $190 million of costs, most of which are likely to occur in
    2009. A majority of these costs will be recovered through
    insurance, as discussed below.

Insurance Coverage

— The Company carries
    property damage insurance through Oil Insurance Limited (OIL)
    for windstorm damage in the Gulf of Mexico of $250 million
    after reaching a $100 million deductible per event. The
    deductible will be scaled down based on the Company’s
    working interest in the damaged properties and is anticipated to
    be $80 million. The $250 million in coverage will be
    prorated downward if total claims received by OIL for Hurricane
    Ike exceed their aggregate limit per event of $750 million.
    In December 2008, OIL indicated that losses for Hurricane
    Ike will likely exceed the aggregate limit by an amount that
    would cause insurance payments to be 80 percent of amounts
    claimed; however, the final percentage will not be known until
    all claims have been submitted to OIL. In addition, Apache has
    $150 million of property damage and business interruption
    insurance through the London market subject to a
    $350 million deductible that can be met with property
    damage and qualifying business interruption losses.

Egypt

In Egypt, we had a steady stream of significant discoveries
    during the year across basins and plays, completing 236 of
    260 wells for a 91-percent success rate. The region also
    conducted 701 workovers and recompletions and made significant
    progress on the completion of several major growth projects that
    will underpin future production growth. Notable successes during
    the year include:

Development
    Projects

•

In the Khalda concession, two additional Salam gas processing
    trains, trains three and four, and an associated Apache pipeline
    compression project on the Western Desert Northern Gas Pipeline
    are forecasted to add additional net production of

100 MMcf/d

and 5,000 b/d when fully operational in the second quarter of
    2009. The third processing train commenced operation on
    December 4, 2008. Commissioning with first gas from the
    fourth processing train is projected to commence during the
    first quarter of 2009.

•

We drilled 203 waterflood wells across several concessions
    during 2008, increasing gross oil production from these
    waterflood projects 55 percent or 27,000 b/d when compared
    to 2007 production levels. Also, we believe that several
    discoveries (discussed below) in a new area called the Heba
    Ridge, which is adjacent to the Asala Ridge waterflood area in
    the East Bahariya concession, will add significantly to our
    inventory of waterflood projects in the concession.

Exploration
    Discoveries

•

During 2008, Apache announced that the Hydra-1X exploration well
    in Egypt’s Western Desert test-flowed

76.6 MMcf/d

and 2,813 b/d from the Deep Jurassic and overlying AEB-6
    formations. The Hydra 4X well appraised this discovery. Apache
    has a 100-percent contractor interest in the Shushan
    “C” concession and is in the process of negotiating a
    Gas Sales Agreement with the Egyptian General Petroleum
    Corporation (EGPC) and, when completed, will file to establish a
    development lease.

•

On July 30, 2008, Apache announced that the
    Heqet-2 well in the Greater Khalda area in Egypt’s
    Western Desert tested 2,100 b/d from the Jurassic Safa formation
    at a depth of 14,700 feet. We also announced that the
    Umbarka-174 well tested 4,300 b/d in the main AEB field in
    the north central portion of the Greater Khalda area. Both wells
    are currently producing, and development of these fields
    continues. In October 2008, we announced the WKAL-C-1X discovery
    on the West Kalabsha concession. The well tested 4,746 b/d and

4.4 MMcf/d

in the Jurassic Safa formation. The WKAL-C-1X discovery
    represents the westernmost oil ever



discovered in Egypt, confirming our exploration model for this
    area of the Faghur Basin. Apache has a 100 percent
    contractor interest in both the Khalda and West Kalabsha
    concessions.

•

During 2008, several new oil fields were discovered in the
    Bahariya formation in the East Bahariya concession. The
    EBAH-C-1X oil discovery identified a new area called the Heba
    Ridge. The initial discovery and three additional development
    wells were drilled in the EBAH-C field during 2008 and all were
    producing at year-end. A total of 40 wells are planned to
    fully develop the EBAH-C field. Three additional exploration
    discoveries in the East Bahariya concession found Bahariya oil
    pay in separate fields. The initial wells are expected to
    commence production during early 2009. Each of these discoveries
    will add significantly to our inventory of water-flood projects
    in the concession.

•

Also in 2008, the Phiops-1X exploration well on the Kalabsha
    development lease in the Khalda area encountered a potential 374
    foot oil column with 173 feet of logged pay in a secondary
    objective, the Cretaceous Alam El Bueib formation. The well will
    be tested in early 2009 and is expected to provide a significant
    oil reserve addition.

•

In early 2009, we formally announced three new December 2008
    field discoveries in Egypt’s Western Desert that tested an
    aggregate

80 MMcf/d

and 5,909 b/d. The Sultan-3X located on the Khalda Offset
    Concession test-flowed 5,021 b/d and

11 MMcf/d

from three commingled intervals in the Safa formation. The two
    other discoveries, the Adam-1X and the Maggie-1X, discovered new
    gas-condensate fields on the Matruh development lease north of
    the Sultan discovery. Apache has a 100-percent contractor
    interest in both of the concessions. We anticipate completion of
    Sultan-3X as an oil well prior to the end of first-quarter 2009,
    and completion of Adam-1X and Maggie-1X by year-end 2009.

Australia

In Australia, we had two notable discoveries, the Halyard-1 and
    Brulimar-1 as well as continued appraisal success at Julimar and
    Bambra. We also progressed on several major long lead-time
    development growth projects, including the Van Gogh and Pyrenees
    developments. In the Julimar-Brunello area on Australia’s
    Northwest Shelf, we drilled three successful appraisal wells
    that will allow us to pursue a development strategy after
    completing our assessment of commercial options. Also, our
    subsidiaries made considerable progress in restoring operations
    at the Varanus Island gas processing and transportation hub,
    which sustained damage from a gas pipeline explosion in June
    2008. Lastly, on January 6, 2009, we secured a
    154 Bcf,

seven-year

gas sales contract that enabled us to reinstate our Reindeer
    development program. These discoveries and developments are
    discussed in more detail below.

Development
    and Appraisal Projects

•

We have several large development projects underway in
    Australia. The Van Gogh and Pyrenees developments remain on
    schedule to deliver first production in 2009 and 2010,
    respectively, each with projected net rates of 20,000 b/d. Our
    Reindeer development program was reinstated following signing of
    a gas-supply contract (discussed below) and is scheduled to
    deliver approximately

60 MMcf/d

net to Apache in late 2011. Construction of pipeline and
    processing infrastructure is scheduled to commence in 2009.

•

On January 6, 2009, the Company announced that it had
    signed a contract to supply natural gas from the Reindeer field
    to CITIC Pacific’s Sino Iron project in Western Australia.
    The terms call for Apache and its joint venture partner to
    supply 154 billion cubic feet of gas over seven years
    beginning in the second half of 2011. Apache owns a
    55 percent interest in the field. The gas will be supplied
    through a new

65-mile

offshore pipeline and a new onshore sales gas processing
    facility at Devil Creek.

•

Appraisal of the Julimar-Brunello area on Australia’s
    Northwest Shelf progressed with three appraisal wells. In
    January 2008, we announced the Brulimar-1 discovery, which
    encountered 113 feet of net pay in the Upper Triassic
    Mungaroo sandstone. In April, we announced the Julimar
    Southeast-1 discovery, which logged 195 feet of net pay
    across five intervals of the Triassic Mungaroo sandstone. In
    May, we announced the Julimar Northwest-1 discovery, which
    logged 43 feet of net pay in the J-17 Triassic Mungaroo
    sandstone. We have now drilled seven discoveries in the complex.
    We plan to complete our appraisal program by mid-



year and pursue a development strategy in the second half of
    2009 after completing our assessment of commercial options. The
    Julimar development will not require funding until we determine
    which market is best suited for the asset. Apache is evaluating
    LNG options as well as domestic-market options for Julimar gas.
    Apache owns a 65 percent interest in and operates the
    Julimar-Brunello complex.

Exploration
    Discoveries

•

In April, we announced the Halyard-1 discovery on
    Australia’s WA-13-L block, which test-flowed

68 MMcf/d.

We are currently in the development design phase that includes
    consideration of a sub-sea gathering line from Halyard to an
    existing pipeline at our East Spar field, 10 miles to the
    southeast, from which the gas can be transported to Varanus
    Island for processing. Using our existing infrastructure would
    accelerate development of the field and first sales. Apache
    obtained governmental approval for the Halyard Field development
    during the third quarter of 2008, and we are working toward
    first production in 2010. Apache has a 55 percent interest
    in and operates the block.

•

We are currently evaluating the results of wells drilled in 2008
    and seismic information to assess the future potential in the
    Gippsland basin. All six wells drilled in 2008 were either dry
    or

non-commercial.

Varanus
    Island

•

On June 3, 2008, subsidiaries of the Company reported a gas
    pipeline explosion at the Varanus Island gas processing and
    transportation hub offshore Western Australia, which shut-in
    production at the John Brookes field and Harriet Joint Venture.
    When fully operational, the Island’s operations process
    approximately 195 MMcf/d and 5,400 b/d, net to Apache
    subsidiaries. On August 5, 2008, partial production was
    reestablished from the John Brookes field, and by year-end was
    at greater than 80 percent pre-incident levels. The Harriet
    Joint Venture gas facilities are located adjacent to the
    pipeline explosion and required more significant repairs to
    restore operation. A portion of our gas production from the
    Harriet Joint Venture was restored in December 2008 and is
    projected to be fully restored in the first half of 2009.
    Harriet Joint Venture oil production is projected to be fully
    restored in the first quarter of 2009. The John Brookes field
    accounted for approximately 60 percent and 25 percent
    of the island’s pre-incident natural gas and oil
    production, respectively. Production from the Harriet Joint
    Venture accounted for the remaining 40 percent and
    75 percent of the island’s pre-incident natural gas
    and oil production, respectively. Company subsidiaries operate
    the facilities and own a 68.5 percent interest in the
    Harriet Joint Venture and a 55 percent interest in the John
    Brookes field. Company subsidiaries maintain replacement cost
    insurance, subject to a deductible of approximately
    $7 million, with adequate limits to cover fully their share
    of the estimated cost of restoring the Varanus Island facilities.

Canada

During 2008, the Canadian region had an active development
    drilling program and commenced pursuit of an emerging shale-gas
    play in northeast British Columbia. Notable activities during
    the year include:

Exploration
    Projects

•

During 2008, the Company completed a total of seven horizontal
    wells in the Ootla shale-gas play, located in northeast British
    Columbia. December gross production averaged

2.5 MMcf/d.

Current plans for the Ootla development in 2009 include drilling
    31 gross horizontal wells and construction of compression
    and gathering infrastructure required to take the additional
    production to existing processing facilities. Based on
    information obtained from these wells, Apache expects to achieve
    significant improvements in both production rate and reserves
    per well. Apache has a 50 percent interest and operates
    approximately one-half of its 400,000 gross acreage
    position in the play.



Development
    Projects

•

Apache continues to target shallow gas, including coal bed
    methane (CBM), in areas such as Nevis, North Grant Lands and
    Provost. Intermediate-depth drilling continued in the Kaybob,
    West 5 and South Grant Land areas of central and southern
    Alberta.

North
    Sea

Throughout 2008, the North Sea region invested in drilling and
    recompleting wells and facility enhancement programs. Key
    activities include:

Development
    Projects

•

During 2008, we completed 12 new development wells in the
    Forties field, which flowed at a combined rate of 18,900 b/d.

•

Investments in facility upgrades and integrity-related projects
    over the past five years have significantly reduced platform
    downtime. Coupled with production from new wells, these improved
    platform operating efficiencies enabled the region’s
    fourth-quarter 2008 production to reach an average 61,740 b/d.
    Annual production averaged 59,494 b/d, an 11 percent
    increase from 2007.

Argentina

During 2008, the Argentina region pursued active drilling and
    recompletion programs. In total, the region drilled
    83 wells, 72 of which were productive. Significant
    activities include:

Development
    Projects

•

Apache drilled 30 new wells in the Neuquén basin, with a
    success rate of 100 percent, and continued to exploit two
    new plays with an aggressive drilling and recompletion campaign.

Exploration
    Projects

•

In 2008, Apache completed a nearly 2,500 square kilometer

3-D

seismic
    mega shoot in Tierra del Fuego. Twenty-nine wells were drilled
    in Tierra del Fuego, resulting in a number of new exploration
    discoveries and field extensions. Notable successes included the
    completion of the first phase appraisal campaign in the 2008
    Sección Baños block and the successful appraisal of
    La Sara Norte. We also made exploration discoveries at Las
    Flechas, Sección Veintinueve, Camino Real and Perla.

•

In the Cuyo basin, Apache was awarded the 4,710 square
    kilometer CC&B-17 B block adjacent to and along a trend of
    existing producing fields, which increased our Argentine acreage
    portfolio by 34 percent.

Chile

•

During the third quarter of 2008, we commenced a seismic program
    on the two exploration blocks acquired in 2008.

Oil
    and Natural Gas Prices

Crude Oil Prices

— A substantial portion of our oil
    production is sold at prevailing market prices, which fluctuate
    in response to many factors that are outside of our control.
    Apache’s oil realizations climbed precipitously in the
    first half of the year reaching a record $118.38 per barrel in
    June, before collapsing in the fourth quarter. Our realized oil
    price in December averaged nearly 70 percent lower than
    June’s peak, as demand for energy dropped following the
    onset of the global financial crisis. Apache manages a portion
    of its exposure to fluctuations in crude oil prices, primarily
    in North America, using financial instruments. In 2008, the
    19 percent of our oil production that was subject to
    financial derivative hedges reduced revenues by
    $451 million, which comprised a $472 million loss in
    the first nine months and a $21 million gain in the fourth
    quarter of 2008. Refer to Note 3 — Hedging and
    Derivative Instruments for the year-end status of our
    derivatives.

While the market price received for crude oil and natural gas
    varies among geographic areas, crude oil trades in a worldwide
    market. With the exception of Argentina, price movements for all
    types and grades of crude oil generally move in the same
    direction. In Argentina, we are currently selling our oil in the
    domestic market. The Argentine government previously imposed a
    sliding-scale tax on oil exports, which effectively limits
    prices buyers are wiling to pay. Domestic oil prices are
    currently based on a $42 per barrel price, subject to quality
    adjustments, and producers realize a gradual increase or
    decrease as market prices deviate from the base price. In Tierra
    del Fuego, similar price formulas exist, but producers retain
    value-added tax collected from buyers, effectively increasing
    price realizations by 21 percent.

Natural Gas Prices —

Natural gas, which has a
    limited global transportation system, is subject to price
    variances stemming from local supply and demand conditions. The
    majority of our gas sales contracts are indexed to prevailing
    local market prices. Apache uses a variety of strategies to
    manage its exposure to fluctuations in natural gas prices,
    primarily in North America, including fixed-price contracts and
    derivatives. In 2008, the 20 percent of our gas production
    that was subject to financial derivative hedges reduced revenues
    by $8 million, which comprised a $29 million loss for
    the first nine months and a gain of $21 million in the
    fourth quarter of 2008. Refer to Note 3 — Hedging
    and Derivative Instruments for the year-end status of our
    derivatives.

Apache primarily sells natural gas into four markets:

1) North America, which has a common market and where most
    of our gas is sold on a monthly or daily basis at either monthly
    or daily market prices.



2) Egypt, where the majority of our gas is sold to Egyptian
    General Petroleum Corporation (EGPC) under an industry pricing
    formula indexed to Dated-Brent crude oil with a maximum gas
    price of $2.65 per MMbtu. On up to

100 MMcf/d

gross, there is  no price cap for our gas under a legacy
    contract which expires in 2013.

3) Australia, which has a local market with mostly
    long-term fixed-price contracts that are periodically adjusted
    for changes in Australia’s consumer price index. Subsequent
    to

year-end,

however, Apache signed a contract on 85 bcf (net) that is
    indexed to oil prices following an initial period of fixed
    prices.

4) Argentina, where we receive low government-regulated
    pricing on a substantial portion of our production. The volumes
    we are required to sell at regulated prices are set by the
    government and vary with seasonal factors and industry category.
    During the year, we realized an average price of $.92 per Mcf on
    government regulated sales. The majority of the remaining
    volumes were sold at market-driven prices, which exceeded $2.00
    per Mcf at year-end. Our average price for 2008 was $1.61 per
    Mcf.

Year 2008
    Compared to Year 2007

Crude Oil
    Revenues

Apache’s 2008 consolidated crude oil revenues increased
    $1.9 billion on a 28 percent increase in average
    realized price and a two percent increase in daily production.

U.S. oil revenues were up $549 million, driven by a
    26 percent increase in realized crude oil prices, more than
    offsetting one percent lower production. Prices in the
    U.S. averaged $83.70 per barrel in 2008, up 26 percent
    from 2007. Gulf Coast region oil was 2,700 b/d lower, reflecting
    the impact of hurricanes, which reduced the region’s 2008
    production by 6,941 b/d. Central region production was up five
    percent resulting primarily from production increases on the
    Permian basin properties acquired at the end of March 2007 and
    new drilling and recompletion activity in 2008.

Egypt’s crude oil revenues increased $625 million on a
    26 percent increase in realized price and a 10 percent
    increase in production. Price realizations averaged $91.37 per
    barrel, up from $72.51 per barrel in the prior year. Increases
    in oil production came from wells at El Diyur, Umbarka and East
    Bahariya, as well as higher cost recovery



volumes related to accelerated capital spending on the Salam gas
    plant expansion. These increases more than offset lower
    condensate volumes at Khalda because of scheduled Obayed and
    Salam plant shutdowns.

North Sea oil revenues increased $697 million, a
    50 percent increase over last year. Revenue gains were
    driven by a 35 percent increase in realized price and an
    11 percent increase in production. Oil price realizations
    averaged $95.76, up $24.83 per barrel. Production was higher on
    a successful drilling and workover program and a reduction in
    platform downtime.

Canada’s oil revenues increased $120 million. Realized
    prices were up 37 percent and averaged $93.53 per barrel.
    Daily production declined nine percent on natural decline in
    various fields and divested properties, which more than offset
    drilling and recompletion activity.

Argentina’s crude oil revenues increased $33 million,
    with both production and realized prices up eight percent.
    Higher production was related to successful drilling, workover
    and recompletion activities, particularly in Tierra del Fuego.
    Realized prices increased on favorable quality adjustments
    received for oil which remains subject to price restrictions, as
    well as increased production from Tierra del Fuego, a tax
    favored area where producers retain the 21 percent
    value-added tax collected from buyers.

Australia’s 2008 oil revenues fell $124 million from
    2007 on a 40 percent decline in production, which more than
    offset a 15 percent increase in realized prices. Nearly
    half of the production decline resulted from wells shut-in
    following a pipeline explosion on June 3, 2008 at the
    Varanus Island gas processing and transportation hub. The
    remaining decrease is related to a natural decline. Partial
    production from our John Brookes field, and the associated
    condensate yields, was brought back on-line in August, and by
    year-end the field was at 80 percent pre-incident levels.
    Harriet field oil production was mostly restored by year-end and
    should be fully restored in early 2009. Condensate yields
    associated with Harriet gas production, which recommenced in
    December 2008, are expected to be fully restored in the first
    half of 2009 when repairs to the Harriet Joint Venture facility
    are completed.

Natural
    Gas Revenues

Apache’s 2008 consolidated natural gas revenues increased
    $461 million, driven by a 25 percent increase in
    realized natural gas prices. Worldwide daily production was down
    10 percent from 2007.

U.S. natural gas revenues increased $227 million on
    higher prices as production declined 12 percent. Natural
    gas prices averaged $8.86, up $1.82 per Mcf. Central region gas
    production was up three percent on drilling and recompletion
    activities and incremental volumes from Permian basin properties
    acquired at the end of March 2007. Gulf Coast daily production
    was 21 percent lower on downtime, natural decline and a
    delay in Apache’s drilling program related to the
    hurricanes.

Canada’s natural gas revenues rose $134 million on a
    26 percent increase in realized natural gas prices. Gas
    price realizations climbed $1.64 to $7.94 per Mcf. Natural gas
    production decreased nine percent because of natural decline in
    various areas and property divestitures in early 2008.

Egyptian gas revenues were up $103 million over 2007 on a
    14 percent increase in price realizations and a
    10 percent rise in production. Production rose on
    successful recompletions at our Matruh concession, new wells
    brought online at the Northeast Abu Gharadig concession and
    higher cost recovery volumes associated with an increase in
    capital spending related to the Salam gas plant expansion.

Argentina’s natural gas revenues increased $30 million
    on a 38 percent increase in realized price, offset by a
    three percent decline in daily production. Gas production was
    negatively impacted by gas re-injections at Tierra del Fuego
    resulting from gas export and pipeline restrictions. Realized
    gas prices increased given the more favorable sales mix attained
    during the year. Relative to last year, we were able to deliver
    more volumes under higher priced industry contracts. We also
    benefited from a year over year increase in residential gas
    prices.

Australia’s natural gas revenues fell $40 million on a
    37 percent drop in production. Volumes were impacted by
    production shut-in after an explosion on the pipeline that
    transports all of our gas production in Australia and resulting
    fire that damaged our processing facilities, as previously
    discussed. Following the incident, both the John Brookes and
    Harriet fields were shut-in for approximately two months. John
    Brookes was the first field to come back online, with volumes
    partially restored in August and ramping up in subsequent
    months. Harriet production



came back online in December at reduced rates. At year-end, John
    Brookes produced 80 percent of pre-incident levels, while
    Harriet saw approximately

one-third

of
    its pre-incident volumes restored. Repairs are expected to be
    completed late in the first half of 2009.

Year 2007
    Compared to Year 2006

Crude Oil
    Revenues

Apache’s 2007 consolidated crude oil revenues totaled
    $6.3 billion, $1.3 billion above 2006, with nearly
    equal contributions from an 11 percent rise in production
    and a 15 percent increase in our realized oil price. On the
    whole, production increased an average 24,523 b/d, driven by the
    U.S. which was up 23,927 b/d. Crude oil price realizations
    averaged $68.84 per barrel for the year, $83.00 in the fourth
    quarter alone.

U.S. oil revenues were up $879 million to
    $2.2 billion with $580 million, or two-thirds of the
    increase, attributable to a 36 percent increase in
    production. A 23 percent increase in realized prices added
    the remaining $299 million. Gulf Coast production climbed
    48 percent to 53,842 b/d, mainly on production restored
    from hurricane-damaged properties, a full year of production
    from Gulf of Mexico properties acquired in June 2006 and
    successful drilling and recompletion activities. Central region
    production grew 21 percent to 36,917 b/d, with the addition
    of Permian basin properties acquired from Anadarko Petroleum
    Corporation (Anadarko) in March 2007 and successful drilling and
    recompletion activities.

In Egypt, crude oil revenues rose $294 million, to
    $1.6 billion, with increased production generating an
    additional $110 million of revenues. The balance of the
    increase in revenues, $184 million, came from a
    14 percent increase in realized prices, which were up $8.91
    to $72.51 per barrel. Daily production averaged 60,735 b/d, up
    seven percent. Production gains were associated with development
    drilling in the Khalda and Matruh concessions as well as the
    East Bahariya, Umbarka, El Diyur and North El Diyur concessions.

Australia’s crude oil revenues of $401 million
    increased 35 percent, or $105 million. Production was
    16 percent higher generating $55 million of the
    increase. Production growth resulted from an additional interest
    acquired in the Legendre field, completion of West Cycad wells
    and increased liquids from the Bambra, Wonnich Deep, Doric and
    Lee gas wells. Australia’s price realizations rose
    17 percent to $79.79 per barrel, the highest in the
    Company, generating an additional $50 million of revenue.

Argentina’s oil revenues increased $85 million to
    $192 million, with over 90 percent of the increase
    associated with 67 percent higher production. The year 2007
    benefited from a full year of production from acquisitions made
    in 2006, as well as successful drilling, workover and
    recompletion activity during the year. Higher volumes added
    $77 million to revenues, with price increases adding
    $8 million. Argentina’s realized oil prices averaged
    $45.99 per barrel, up seven percent from the prior year.

North Sea oil revenues increased $41 million to
    $1.4 billion. Oil prices averaged $70.93 per barrel, up
    13 percent, adding $168 million in revenues.
    Production averaged 53,632 b/d, down eight percent, reducing
    revenues by $127 million. Production increases on three of
    our platforms were more than offset by declines from wells at
    the Alpha and Echo platforms while drilling operations were
    suspended for facility upgrades.

Canada’s oil revenues increased $15 million to
    $467 million, with a 14 percent price increase mostly
    offset by a nine percent decline in production. Prices averaged
    $68.29 per barrel, up from $59.90 in 2006. Production dropped in
    2007 primarily because of natural decline resulting from a
    38 percent reduction in exploration and development capital
    invested in Canada compared to 2006.

China had no crude oil revenues in 2007 compared to
    $73 million in the prior year, a result of our August 2006
    asset divestiture and exit from China.

Natural
    Gas Revenues

Apache’s natural gas revenues increased 17 percent, or
    $503 million, to $3.5 billion. Higher production
    contributed $405 million of the additional revenues. Gas
    production averaged

1,796 MMcf/d,

up 13 percent from 2006. Natural gas prices increased $.17
    to an average $5.34 per Mcf, generating an additional
    $98 million in revenue.



U.S. natural gas revenues grew by $385 million to
    nearly $2 billion. U.S. production rose
    15 percent, boosting revenues $264 million. Gulf Coast
    production increased 16 percent, boosted by final
    production restoration on hurricane-damaged properties, a full
    year of production from Gulf of Mexico properties acquired in
    June 2006 and successful drilling and recompletion activities.
    Central region production climbed 14 percent on successful
    drilling and recompletion activities and the addition of Permian
    basin properties acquired in March 2007. Higher natural gas
    prices, which averaged $7.04 per Mcf compared to $6.54 in 2006,
    added $121 million to revenues.

Gas revenues in Egypt were up $53 million, to
    $404 million, on an 11 percent increase in production
    and a four percent increase in price realizations. Production
    gains of

23 MMcf/d

boosted the region’s average output to

241 MMcf/d,

generating an additional $39 million in revenues.
    Production gains resulted from higher throughput and less
    downtime at the Obaiyed plant compared to 2006 and new wells in
    the North East Abu Gharadig (NEAG) concession. Higher prices
    added another $14 million.

Australia’s natural gas revenues increased $22 million
    to $134 million on higher price realizations and production
    gains. Price realizations improved 15 percent, adding
    $16 million to revenues. A five percent demand-driven rise
    in production generated another $6 million of revenues.

Argentina’s natural gas revenues more than doubled to
    $86 million, bolstered by a full year of production from
    2006 property acquisitions, successful drilling and recompletion
    activities and a 21 percent increase in price realizations.
    Production grew

89 MMcf/d,

or 79 percent, generating $38 million of new revenues.
    The price gain added another $8 million.

Canada’s natural gas revenues decreased $6 million to
    $892 million on a four percent decline in production.
    Production, which averaged

388 MMcf/d,

was impacted by natural decline, which more than offset
    increases from drilling and recompletion activities. Our
    exploration and development capital investment in Canada was
    38 percent lower than 2006. Lower production reduced
    revenues by $37 million. Natural gas prices rose $.21, to
    $6.30 per Mcf, increasing revenues $31 million.

Recurring full-cost depletion expense increased
    $150 million, $277 million on rate partially offset by
    $127 million on lower volumes. Our full-cost depletion rate
    increased $1.28 to $12.06 per boe on drilling and finding costs
    that exceeded our historical cost basis. The higher
    industry-wide costs, which also impact estimates of future
    development costs, have been driven by increased demand for
    drilling services, a consequence of higher oil and gas prices.

In addition, we recorded a $5.3 billion ($3.6 billion
    net of tax) non-cash

write-down

of the carrying value of our December 31, 2008 proved
    property balances in the U.S., U.K. North Sea, Canada and
    Argentina proved oil and gas properties. Under the full-cost
    method of accounting, the Company is required to review the
    carrying value of its proved oil and gas properties each quarter
    on a

country-by-country

basis. Under these rules, capitalized costs of oil and gas
    properties, net of accumulated DD&A and deferred income
    taxes, may not exceed the present value of estimated future net
    cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves, discounted
    10 percent, net of related tax effects. These rules
    generally require pricing future oil and gas production at the
    unescalated oil and gas prices and costs in effect at the end of
    each fiscal quarter and require a write-down if the
    “ceiling” is exceeded, even if prices declined for
    only a short period of time. Write-downs required by these rules
    do not impact cash flow from operating activities. If oil and
    gas prices deteriorate from the Company’s year-end levels,
    additional write-downs may occur.

Lease
    Operating Expenses

Lease operating expenses (LOE) include several components:
    direct operating costs, repair and maintenance, and workover
    costs.

Direct operating costs generally trend with commodity price
    levels and are impacted by the type of commodity produced and
    the location of properties (i.e. offshore, onshore, remote
    locations, etc). Rising commodity prices impact operating cost
    elements both directly and indirectly. They directly impact
    costs such as power, fuel, and chemicals, which are commodity
    price based. Other items such as labor, boats, helicopters and
    materials and supplies are indirectly impacted as high prices
    increase industry activity and demand and thus, costs. Oil,
    which contributed nearly half of our production, is inherently
    more expensive to produce than natural gas. Repair and
    maintenance costs are higher on offshore properties and in areas
    with remote plants and facilities. All production in Australia
    and the North Sea and nearly 90 percent from the
    U.S. Gulf Coast region comes from offshore properties.
    Workovers accelerate production; hence, activity generally
    increases with higher commodity prices. Fluctuations in exchange
    rates impact the Company’s LOE, with a weakening
    U.S. dollar adding to

per-unit

costs and a strengthening U.S. dollar lowering per unit
    costs in our international regions.

LOE increased 15 percent on an absolute dollar basis. On a

per-unit

basis LOE was up 21 percent, or $1.69 per boe. The
    following discussion focuses on

per-unit

costs which we believe to be the most meaningful measure for
    analyzing LOE.

•

Higher operating costs in all regions, including increased power
    costs in the U.S. and Egypt along with increased labor
    costs in the North Sea and Argentina, drove the rate up $.33.

•

Increased workover activity, primarily in the U.S. and
    Egypt, resulted in an increase of $.29.



•

Hurricane repairs in the U.S. contributed $.07 to increased
    cost.

•

Repairs related to the pipeline explosion at Varanus Island in
    Australia added $.03.

•

Non-recurring repairs and maintenance in Egypt, Australia, the
    North Sea and Argentina increased $.07.

•

Overall production declines resulted in an increase of $.45,
    with the impact from a combined 12 percent production
    decline in the U.S., Canada and Australia partially offset by
    increased production in Egypt, the North Sea and Argentina. The
    main contributors were decreased production in Australia, $.30,
    and production shut-in because of the hurricanes, $.29.

Gathering
    and Transportation

We generally sell oil and natural gas under two common types of
    agreements, both of which include a transportation charge. One
    is a netback arrangement, under which we sell oil or natural gas
    at the wellhead and collect a lower relative price to reflect
    transportation costs to be incurred by the purchaser. In this
    case, we record sales at the netback price received from the
    purchaser. Alternatively, we sell oil or natural gas at a
    specific delivery point, pay our own transportation to a
    third-party carrier and receive a price with no transportation
    deduction. In this case we record the separate transportation
    cost as gathering and transportation costs.

In both the U.S. and Canada, we sell oil and natural gas
    under both types of arrangements. In the North Sea, we pay
    transportation to a third-party carrier. In Australia, oil and
    natural gas are sold under netback arrangements. In Egypt, our
    oil and natural gas production is primarily sold to EGPC under
    netback arrangements; however, we also export crude oil under
    both types of arrangements. In Argentina, we sell oil and
    natural gas under both types of arrangements.

The following table presents gathering and transportation costs
    we paid directly to third-party carriers for each of the periods
    presented:

These costs are primarily related to the portion of natural gas
    in our U.S. and Canadian operation sold under arrangements
    where we pay transportation directly to third parties North Sea
    crude oil sales and our Egyptian crude oil exports not sold
    under netback arrangements. The $20 million increase was
    driven primarily by higher transportation tariffs in Canada and
    an increase in Egyptian export volumes.

Taxes
    other than Income

Taxes other than income primarily comprises United Kingdom
    (U.K.) Petroleum Revenue Tax (PRT), severance taxes on
    properties onshore and in state or provincial waters in the
    U.S. and Australia and ad valorem taxes on properties in
    the U.S. and Canada. Severance taxes are generally based on
    a percentage of oil and gas production revenues, while the U.K.
    PRT is assessed on net receipts (revenues less qualifying
    operating costs and capital spending) from the Forties field in
    the U.K. North Sea. We are subject to a variety of other taxes
    including U.S. franchise taxes, Australian Petroleum
    Resources Rent tax and various Canadian taxes including:
    Freehold



Mineral tax, Saskatchewan Capital tax and Saskatchewan Resources
    Surtax. We also pay taxes on invoices and bank transactions in
    Argentina. The table below presents a comparison of these
    expenses:

U.K. PRT was $349 million more than 2007 on a
    98 percent increase in net profits, driven by higher oil
    revenues. The increase in severance taxes resulted from higher
    taxable revenues in the U.S., consistent with the higher
    realized oil and natural gas prices in the first nine months of
    the year. The $15 million increase in ad valorem taxes
    resulted from higher taxable valuations associated with
    increases in oil and natural gas prices at the time the taxes
    were assessed and a full year of taxes on the Permian Basin
    properties acquired in the first quarter of 2007.

General
    and Administrative Expenses

General and administrative expenses (G&A) were
    $14 million higher. On a boe basis, G&A averaged
    $1.48, up $.14 per boe on a combination of increased costs and
    lower volumes, each of which added $.07 to the rate. The cost
    increase was driven by higher legal fees, especially in our
    international operations, increased incentive compensation
    expenses and miscellaneous higher costs in several departments,
    partially offset by a decrease in stock-based compensation
    expenses related to cash settled stock appreciation rights.

Financing
    Costs, Net

The major components of financing costs, net, include interest
    expense and capitalized interest. Net financing costs for 2008
    decreased $54 million or $.22 per boe, on lower average
    outstanding debt balances. Interest expense was down
    $28 million on lower average debt. Capitalized interest was
    up primarily because of higher expenditures associated with
    long-term construction projects that are under development.

Provision
    for Income Taxes

There were no significant changes in statutory tax rates in the
    major jurisdictions in which the Company operates during 2008.
    In 2007 we saw a significant reduction to deferred income taxes
    resulting from Canadian tax rate reductions.

The provision for income taxes decreased $1.6 billion from
    2007 to $220 million, as income before taxes decreased
    80 percent as a result of the $5.3 billion in
    additional DD&A recorded in conjunction with the ceiling
    test write-down. The effective income tax rate for the year was
    23.6 percent compared to 39.8 percent in 2007. The
    2008 effective rate was impacted by the magnitude of the taxes
    related to the write-down, non-cash benefits related to the
    effect of the strengthening U.S. dollar on our foreign
    deferred tax liabilities and other net tax settlements.
    Excluding these items, the 2008 effective rate would have been
    comparable to the 2007 effective rate. The 2007 effective rate
    was impacted by a non-cash charge related to the effect of the
    weakening U.S. dollar on our foreign deferred tax
    liabilities. Partially offsetting this charge was an out of
    period benefit from Canadian federal tax rate reductions enacted
    in the second and fourth quarters of 2007.

Full-cost DD&A expense totaled $2.2 billion,
    $509 million more than 2006. Production growth drove
    $210 million of the increase; the remainder is a
    consequence of higher costs. DD&A per boe averaged $10.78,
    $1.49 higher than 2006 as the costs to acquire, find and develop
    reserves continued to exceed our historical cost basis.
    Increasing costs also impact our estimates for future
    development of known reserves and estimates to abandon
    properties, both of which impact our full-cost depletion rate.

DD&A on other assets increased $22 million to
    $140 million with facilities coming online, in Canada,
    Egypt and the U.S. A full year of DD&A on assets
    acquired during 2006 in Argentina also contributed to the
    year-over-year increase.

Lease
    Operating Expenses

Lease operating expenses (LOE) increased 25 percent on an
    absolute dollar basis. On a

per-unit

basis LOE was up 12 percent, or $.84 per boe. Almost
    two-thirds of the increase was from additional workover activity
    ($.16), a weakening U.S. dollar ($.16), hurricane repair
    activity ($.15) and incentive-based compensation ($.07). The
    remaining increase is the result of the inflationary impact of
    higher commodity prices on all other operating costs, as
    described above.

The U.S. contributed $.47 to the $.84 per boe increase.
    Driving factors in the increase were additional hurricane
    repairs ($.15), more workover activity ($.13), acquired Permian
    basin oil properties which carry a higher rate than our
    historical average ($.05), incremental incentive-based
    compensation with Apache’s rising stock price ($.04) and
    the inflationary impact higher commodity prices have on
    operating costs ($.05). Over two-thirds of the increase in
    workover activity occurred on properties acquired in March 2007
    in the Permian basin of West Texas.

Canada added $.30 per boe to the consolidated rate, $.09 of
    which was attributed to a decline in relative production. A
    weakening U.S. dollar negatively impacted the rate an
    additional $.09. The balance of the increase related to higher
    levels of workover activity ($.03), lease rentals ($.02),
    company labor ($.02) and generally higher costs.

The North Sea increased the consolidated rate $.09 per boe: the
    net impact of a $.10 per boe increase on a decline in production
    volumes and a reduction of $.01 on lower costs. The benefit of
    decreases in diesel fuel consumption ($.08) and lower turnaround
    expenses more than offset increases from the impact of the
    weakening U.S. dollar ($.05), higher standby and supply
    boat costs ($.01) and higher contract labor ($.01). We are
    seeing the benefits of several years of facility upgrades to
    reduce the operating costs, including completion of our power
    generation ring.

Australia increased the consolidated rate $.09 per boe over
    2006. The increase was primarily a result of our acquisition of
    an additional interest in Legendre, an oil field which carries a
    higher cost per barrel than our existing blended Australian rate
    ($.06), and appreciation of the Australian dollar relative to
    the U.S. dollar ($.02).

Two Argentine acquisitions, in April and September 2006, lowered
    the 2007 consolidated rate $.13 per boe. The LOE rate on these
    properties was lower than our existing consolidated rate.



Egypt had no impact on the consolidated rate. Our 2006 exit from
    China increased the 2007 consolidated rate $.04 per boe.

Gathering
    and transportation

Gathering and transportation costs totaled $137 million, up
    $17 million. The following table presents gathering and
    transportation costs paid by Apache to third-party carriers for
    each of the periods presented.

These costs are primarily related to the portion of natural gas
    in our U.S. and Canadian operation sold under arrangements
    where we pay transportation directly to third parties, and North
    Sea crude oil sales and our Egyptian crude oil exports not sold
    under netback arrangements. The $17 million increase was
    driven primarily by U.S. production growth, an increase in
    Egyptian crude exports not sold under netback arrangements and a
    full year of transportation costs paid to third parties in
    Argentina.

Taxes
    other than Income

Taxes other than income totaled $598 million for 2007 and
    2006.

On a

per-unit

basis taxes other than income decreased $.35, or
    12 percent, reflecting the 12 percent increase in
    equivalent production. The increase in severance taxes was
    driven by higher production and prices on U.S. and
    Australian properties burdened by such taxes. U.K. PRT was
    12 percent below 2006, largely driven by lower comparable
    revenues on less production and slightly higher deductible
    costs. Deductible costs include capital expenditures, LOE,
    general and administrative expenses (G&A) and
    transportation tariffs. Ad valorem taxes increased
    $12 million. Oil and liquids were 47 percent of our
    production in both 2007 and 2006. A significant portion of our
    ad valorem taxes are reserve based and increase when prices
    rise. Other taxes increased with a full year of taxes on invoice
    and bank transactions in Argentina.



General
    and Administrative Expenses

General and administrative expenses (G&A) were
    $64 million, or $.18 per boe, higher than 2006.
    Incentive-based compensation added $.12 per boe to the rate, a
    consequence of a strong stock price appreciation during the
    year, while insurance costs added $.11 per boe, a consequence of
    industry-wide premium increases after the 2005 hurricanes. These
    increases were partially offset by a decrease in rate stemming
    from higher production.

Financing
    Costs, Net

The major components of financing costs, net, include interest
    expense and capitalized interest. Net financing costs for 2007
    increased $78 million or $.29 per boe, on higher average
    outstanding debt balances, which offset a slightly lower average
    interest rate.

Provision
    for Income Taxes

The 2007 provision for income taxes was $1.9 billion,
    $403 million above 2006 on both higher taxable income and a
    higher effective tax rate. Apache’s 2007 effective tax rate
    was 39.8 percent compared to 36.3 percent in 2006. The
    2007 effective rate was impacted by a non-cash charge related to
    the effect of the weakening U.S. dollar on our foreign
    deferred tax liabilities. Partially offsetting this charge was
    an out of period benefit from Canadian federal tax rate
    reductions enacted in the second and fourth quarters of 2007.
    The 2006 effective tax rate was impacted by a charge related to
    retroactive application of a 10 percent increase in the oil
    and gas company supplemental tax enacted by the U.K., a benefit
    from a Canadian federal provincial tax rate reduction enacted in
    the second quarter of 2006 and a gain recognized on the sale of
    China. Foreign currency fluctuations had a negligible impact on
    the 2006 rate.

Acquisitions
    and Divestitures

    Activity

There was no major acquisition activity during 2008; however,
    the Company completed several divestiture transactions. On
    January 29, 2008, the Company completed the sale of its
    interest in Ship Shoal blocks 349 and 359 on the outer
    continental shelf of the Gulf of Mexico to W&T Offshore,
    Inc. for $116 million. On January 31, 2008, the
    Company completed the sale of non-strategic oil and gas
    properties in the Permian Basin of West Texas to Vanguard
    Permian, LLC for $78 million. On April 2, 2008, the
    Company completed the sale of

non-strategic

Canadian properties to Central Global Resources for
    $112 million. These divestitures are subject to normal

post-closing

adjustments.

    Activity

U.S. Gulf Coast Farm-in

On
    September 6, 2007, Apache entered into an Exploration
    Agreement with various EnerVest Partnerships (“EVP”)
    for an initial term of four years whereby Apache committed to
    spend $30 million in qualified expenditures to explore,
    drill, produce and market hydrocarbons from specified
    undeveloped formations across 400,000 net acres in Central
    and East Texas. As of December 31, 2008, Apache has
    fulfilled the $30 million commitment.

U.S. Permian Basin

On March 29,
    2007, the Company closed its acquisition of controlling interest
    in 28 oil and gas fields in the Permian basin of West Texas from
    Anadarko for $1 billion. Apache estimates that these fields
    had proved reserves of 57 million barrels (MMbbls) of
    liquid hydrocarbons and 78 billion cubic feet (Bcf) of
    natural gas as of year-end 2006. The Company funded the
    acquisition with debt. Apache and Anadarko entered into a
    joint-venture arrangement to effect the transaction. The Company
    entered into cash flow hedges for a portion of the crude oil and
    the natural gas production.

    Activity

U.S. Permian Basin

On January 5,
    2007, the Company purchased Amerada Hess’s interest in
    eight fields located in the Permian basin of West Texas and New
    Mexico. The original purchase price was reduced from
    $404 million to $269 million because other interest
    owners exercised their preferential rights to purchase a number
    of the properties. The settlement price at closing of
    $239 million was adjusted for revenues and expenditures



occurring between the effective date and the closing date of the
    acquisition. The acquired fields had estimated proved reserves
    of 27 MMbbls of liquid hydrocarbons and 27 Bcf of
    natural gas as of year-end 2005.

Argentina

On April 25, 2006, the Company
    acquired the operations of Pioneer Natural Resources (Pioneer)
    in Argentina for $675 million. The settlement price at
    closing, of $703 million, was adjusted for revenues and
    expenditures occurring between the effective date and closing
    date of the acquisition. The properties are located in the
    Neuquén, San Jorge and Austral basins of Argentina and
    had estimated net proved reserves of approximately
    22 MMbbls of liquid hydrocarbons and 297 Bcf of
    natural gas as of December 31, 2005. Eight gas processing
    plants (five operated and three non-operated), 112 miles of
    operated pipelines in the Neuquén basin and
    2,200 square miles of three-dimensional

(3-D)

seismic data were also included in the transaction. Apache
    financed the purchase with cash on hand and commercial paper.

The purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired and
    liabilities assumed based upon the estimated fair values as of
    the date of acquisition, as follows (in thousands):

On September 19, 2006, Apache acquired additional interests
    in (and now operates) seven concessions in the Tierra del Fuego
    Province from Pan American Fueguina S.R.L. (Pan American) for
    total consideration of $429 million. The settlement price
    at closing of $396 million was adjusted for normal closing
    items, including revenues and expenses between the effective
    date and the closing date of the acquisition. Apache financed
    the purchase with cash on hand and commercial paper.

The total cash consideration allocated below includes working
    capital balances purchased, asset retirement obligations assumed

U.S. Gulf Coast

In June 2006, the Company
    acquired the remaining producing properties of BP plc (BP) on
    the Outer Continental Shelf of the Gulf of Mexico. The original
    purchase price was reduced from $1.3 billion for 18
    producing fields to $845 million because other interest
    owners exercised their preferential rights to purchase five of
    the 18 fields. The purchase price consisted of $747 million
    of proved property, $42 million of unproved property and
    $56 million of facilities. The settlement price on the date
    of closing of $821 million was adjusted primarily for
    revenues and expenditures occurring between the April 1,
    2006 effective date and the closing date of the acquisition. The
    acquired properties include 13 producing fields (nine of which
    are operated) with estimated proved reserves of 19.5 MMbbls
    of liquid hydrocarbons and 148 Bcf of natural gas. Apache
    financed the purchase with cash on hand and commercial paper.



Divestitures

On January 6, 2006, the
    Company completed the sale of its 55 percent interest in
    the deepwater section of Egypt’s West Mediterranean
    Concession to Amerada Hess for $413 million. Apache did not
    have any proved reserves booked for these properties.

On August 8, 2006, the Company completed the sale of its
    24.5 percent interest in the Zhao Dong block, offshore the
    People’s Republic of China, to Australia-based ROC Oil
    Company Limited for $260 million, marking Apache’s
    exit from China. The effective date of the transaction was
    July 1, 2006. The Company recorded a gain of
    $174 million in the third quarter of 2006.

Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities

Net
    cash provided by operating activities (“operating cash
    flows”) is our primary source of capital and liquidity.
    Factors affecting changes in operating cash flows are largely
    the same as those that affect net earnings, with the exception
    of non-cash expenses such as DD&A and deferred income tax
    expense. Factors affecting our operating cash flows are
    discussed in the “Results of Operations” section of
    this report. Operating cash flows in 2008 increased from 2007.

Fixed-Rate

Debt Issuances

On October 1, 2008, the
    Company issued $400 million principal amount,
    $398 million net of discount, of senior unsecured
    6.0-percent notes maturing September 15, 2013, and
    $400 million principal amount, $398 million net of
    discount, of senior unsecured 6.9-percent notes maturing
    September 15, 2018. The notes are redeemable, as a whole or
    in part, at Apache’s option, subject to a make-whole
    premium. The



proceeds are presently invested in U.S. Treasury Bills and
    will be used for general corporate purposes or, possibly, future
    acquisitions.

Project Financing Draw-downs

On
    December 5, 2008, one of the Company’s Australian
    subsidiaries entered into a secured revolving syndicated credit
    facility for the Van Gogh and Pyrenees oil developments. The
    facility provides for total commitments of $350 million
    with availability determined by a borrowing base formula. The
    borrowing base was set at $350 million and will be
    redetermined at completion and semi-annually thereafter. The
    facility is secured by certain assets associated with the Van
    Gogh and Pyrenees oil developments, including the shares of
    stock of the Company’s subsidiary holding the assets. The
    Company has agreed to guarantee the credit facility until
    completion occurs pursuant to terms of the facility, which is
    expected in 2010. The commitments under the facility will be
    reduced by scheduled increments every six months beginning
    June 30, 2010, with final maturity on March 31, 2014.
    Interest is based on LIBOR, which may be subject to change under
    certain market disruption conditions, plus a margin of
    1.00 percent pre-completion and 1.75 percent
    post-completion. The pre-completion margin increases to
    1.125 percent in the event the Company’s ratings are
    downgraded to BBB+ or below by at least two major rating
    agencies. As of December 31, 2008 there was
    $100 million outstanding under the facility.

Capital Expenditures

We fund exploration and
    development activities primarily through net cash provided by
    operating activities and budget capital expenditures based on
    projected operating cash flows. Our operating cash flows, both
    in the short- and long-term, is impacted by highly volatile oil
    and natural gas prices, production levels, industry trends
    impacting operating expenses and our ability to continue to
    acquire or find high-margin reserves at competitive prices. For
    these reasons, management primarily relies on annual operating
    cash flow forecasts. Annual operating cash flow forecasts are
    revised monthly in response to changing market conditions and
    production projections. Apache routinely adjusts capital
    expenditure budgets in response to these adjusted operating cash
    flow forecasts and market trends in drilling and acquisitions
    costs. Longer-term operating cash flows and capital spending
    projections are rarely used by management to operate the
    business.

Historically, we have used a combination of our operating cash
    flow, borrowings under the our lines of credit and commercial
    paper program and, from time to time, issues of public debt or
    common stock to fund significant acquisitions.

The following table details capital expenditures for each
    country in which we do business.

Exploration and Development (E&D)

—
    Increases in our 2008 operating cash flows, year-over-year,
    enabled us to invest larger amounts on E&D capital
    projects. We invested $5.4 billion on drilling,
    recompletions and



platform and production support facilities in 2008, up
    28 percent from 2007. Our 2007 E&D capital
    expenditures were $546 million above 2006.

Acquisitions

— We completed $150 million
    of acquisitions in 2008 compared to $1 billion in 2007.
    Acquisition capital expenditures occur as attractive
    opportunities arise and, therefore, vary from year to year.

Asset Retirement Costs

— In 2008, we recorded
    $514 million of additional asset retirement costs. The
    increase is primarily related to revisions of our cost
    estimates. Rising estimates for service costs and the high level
    of abandonment activities in the Gulf Coast region have
    accelerated some obligations. Continued worldwide drilling
    programs, acquisition activity and damage from Hurricane Ike
    also contributed to the increased abandonment costs.

Gathering, Transmission and Processing Facilities
    (GTP)

— We invested $659 million in GTP
    facilities in 2008 compared to $473 million in 2007. In
    Egypt, we invested $571 million in gas processing
    facilities to alleviate capacity constraints, which are
    restricting production. We also invested $55 million in
    Australia on GTP projects currently in process. In Canada, we
    invested $29 million in processing plants.

2009 Outlook

— In light of a collapse in
    commodity prices and uncertainties surrounding the worldwide
    financial crisis, we seek to keep capital spending in line with
    2009 operating cash flows in order to preserve our strong
    balance sheet and financial flexibility. We will closely monitor
    commodity prices, service cost levels and predicted operating
    cash and will adjust our exploration and development budgets
    accordingly. While certain long-lead development projects are
    committed in 2009, the majority of our drilling and development
    projects are discretionary and subject to deferral or
    cancellation as conditions warrant. Because we revise our
    exploration and development capital budgets frequently
    throughout the year, projecting future expenditures is difficult
    at best. Our 2009 preliminary plan includes exploration and
    development capital of approximately $3.5 to $4.0 billion,
    including GTP. We generally do not project estimates for
    acquisitions because their occurrence and timing is
    unpredictable. Any acquisitions would be funded from operating
    cash flow, credit facilities, issuing new equity, or a
    combination thereof.

Repurchases of Common Stock

On April 19,
    2006, the Company announced that its Board of Directors
    authorized the purchase of up to 15 million shares of the
    Company’s common stock, representing a market value of
    approximately $1 billion on the date of announcement. The
    Company may buy shares from time to time on the open market, in
    privately negotiated transactions, or a combination of both. The
    timing and amounts of any purchases will be at the discretion of
    Apache’s management. The Company initiated the purchase
    program on May 1, 2006, after the Company’s
    first-quarter 2006 earnings information was disseminated in the
    market. During 2006, the Company purchased 2,500,000 shares
    at an average price of $69.74 per share. No stock purchases were
    made in 2007 or 2008, and we currently have no plans to purchase
    any shares in 2009.

Dividends

The Company has paid cash dividends
    on its common stock for 44 consecutive years through 2008.
    Future dividend payments will depend on the Company’s level
    of earnings, financial requirements and other relevant factors.
    Common dividends paid during 2008 rose 17 percent to
    $234 million, reflecting the special cash dividend of 10
    cents per common share paid on March 18, 2008 and an
    increase in common shares outstanding. Common dividends paid
    during 2007 rose 34 percent to $199 million,
    reflecting the increase in common shares outstanding and an
    increase in the common stock dividend rate. The Company
    increased its quarterly cash dividend 50 percent, to 15
    cents per share from 10 cents per share, effective with the
    November 2006 dividend payment.

During 2008 and 2007, Apache paid a total of $6 million in
    dividends each year on its Series B Preferred Stock issued
    in August 1998. See Note 7 — Capital Stock of
    Item 15 in this

Thus far, our liquidity and financial position have not been
    affected by recent events in the credit markets. We believe that
    losses from non-performance are unlikely to occur; however, we
    are not able to predict sudden changes in the creditworthiness
    of the financial institutions with which we do business. The
    banks with lending commitments to the Company have credit
    ratings of at least single-A (or equivalent) which in some cases
    is based on government support. There is no assurance that the
    financial condition of these banks will not deteriorate or that
    the government guarantee will be maintained. We closely monitor
    the ratings of the 27 banks in our bank group. Having a
    large bank group allows the Company to mitigate the impact of
    any bank’s failure to honor its lending commitment.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

We had
    $1.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents at
    December 31, 2008, compared with $126 million at
    December 31, 2007. The majority of this cash is in our
    foreign subsidiaries ($146 million was in U.S.) and is
    subject to additional U.S. income taxes if repatriated.
    Almost all of the cash is denominated in U.S. dollars and,
    at times, is invested in highly liquid, investment-grade
    securities, with maturities of three months or less at the time
    of purchase. We intend to use cash from our international
    subsidiaries to fund international projects.

Short-term Investments

The Company
    occasionally invests in highly-liquid, short-term investments in
    order to maximize our income on available cash balances. As
    needed, we may reduce such short-term investment balances to
    further supplement our operating cash flows. At
    December 31, 2008, we had $792 million invested in
    obligations of the U.S. Government with original maturities
    greater than three months but less than a year.

Restricted Cash

The Company classifies cash
    balances as restricted cash when it is restricted as to
    withdrawal or usage. As of December 31, 2008, the Company
    had approximately $14 million of property divestiture
    proceeds classified as restricted cash and held in escrow
    available for use in a like-kind exchange under
    Section 1031 of the U.S. federal income tax code. The
    Company expected to use these funds to purchase noncurrent
    assets. Accordingly, the restricted cash was classified as
    long-term at

year-end.

Subsequent to

year-end,

the time limits pursuant to Section 1031 expired and the
    funds were transferred to cash.

Debt

At year-end 2008, outstanding debt, which
    consisted of notes, debentures and uncommitted bank lines,
    totaled $4.9 billion. Current debt includes
    $100 million of Apache Finance Pty Limited 7.0-percent
    notes due March 2009 and $13 million borrowed under
    uncommitted overdraft lines in Argentina. We have no debt
    maturing in 2010 or 2011, $439 million maturing in 2012,
    $942 million maturing in 2013 and the remaining
    $3.4 billion maturing intermittently in years 2014 through
    2096.

Debt-to-Capitalization Ratio

The
    Company’s debt-to-capitalization ratio as of
    December 31, 2008 was 23 percent.

Available Credit Facilities

The Company had
    available borrowing capacity under our total credit facilities
    of approximately $2.6 billion at December 31, 2008;
    $2.3 billion of unsecured revolving syndicated bank credit
    facilities and $250 million under one of the Company’s
    Australian subsidiaries secured revolving syndicated credit
    facility for the Van Gogh and Pyrenees oil developments, entered
    into in December 2008. The Company was in compliance with the
    terms of all credit facilities as of December 31, 2008.



The $2.3 billion of unsecured revolving syndicated bank
    credit facilities mature in May 2013. Since there were no
    outstanding borrowings or commercial paper at year-end, the full
    $2.3 billion of unsecured credit facilities were available
    to the Company. These facilities consist of a $1.5 billion
    facility and a $450 million facility in the U.S., a
    $200 million facility in Australia and a $150 million
    facility in Canada. The financial covenants of the credit
    facilities require the Company to maintain a
    debt-to-capitalization ratio of not greater than 60 percent
    at the end of any fiscal quarter. The negative covenants include
    restrictions on the Company’s ability to create liens and
    security interests on our assets, with exceptions for liens
    typically arising in the oil and gas industry, purchase money
    liens and liens arising as a matter of law, such as tax and
    mechanics’ liens. The Company may incur liens on assets
    located in the U.S. and Canada of up to five percent of the
    Company’s consolidated assets, which approximated
    $1.5 billion as of December 31, 2008. There are no
    restrictions on incurring liens in countries other than
    U.S. and Canada. There are also restrictions on
    Apache’s ability to merge with another entity, unless the
    Company is the surviving entity, and a restriction on our
    ability to guarantee debt of entities not within our
    consolidated group. Furthermore, our non-cash write-down of oil
    and gas properties in 2008 does not impact the availability of
    credit lines or result in non-compliance with any covenants.

There are no clauses in the facilities that permit the lenders
    to accelerate payments or refuse to lend based on unspecified
    material adverse changes (MAC clauses). The credit facility
    agreements do not have drawdown restrictions or prepayment
    obligations in the event of a decline in credit ratings.
    However, the agreements allow the lenders to accelerate payments
    and terminate lending commitments if Apache Corporation, or any
    of its U.S. or Canadian subsidiaries, defaults on any
    direct payment obligation in excess of $100 million or has
    any unpaid, non-appealable judgment against it in excess of
    $100 million. The Company was in compliance with the terms
    of the credit facilities as of December 31, 2008.

At the Company’s option, the interest rate for the
    facilities is based on (i) the greater of (a) the JP
    Morgan Chase Bank prime rate or (b) the federal funds rate
    plus one-half of one percent or (ii) the London Inter-bank
    Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a margin determined by the
    Company’s senior long-term debt rating. The
    $1.5 billion and the $450 million credit facilities
    (U.S. credit facilities) also allow the company to borrow
    under competitive auctions.

At December 31, 2008, the margin over LIBOR for committed
    loans was .19 percent on the $1.5 billion facility and
    .23 percent on the other three facilities. If the total
    amount of the loans borrowed under the $1.5 billion
    facility equals or exceeds 50 percent of the total facility
    commitments, then an additional .05 percent will be added
    to the margins over LIBOR. If the total amount of the loans
    borrowed under all of the other three facilities equals or
    exceeds 50 percent of the total facility commitments, then
    an additional .10 percent will be added to the margins over
    LIBOR. The Company also pays quarterly facility fees of
    .06 percent on the total amount of the $1.5 billion
    facility and .07 percent on the total amount of the other
    three facilities. The facility fees vary based upon the
    Company’s senior long-term debt rating. The
    U.S. credit facilities are used to support Apache’s
    commercial paper program.

On December 5, 2008, one of the Company’s Australian
    subsidiaries entered into a secured revolving syndicated credit
    facility for the Van Gogh and Pyrenees oil developments. The
    facility provides for total commitments of $350 million
    with availability determined by a borrowing base formula. The
    borrowing base was set at $350 million and will be
    redetermined at project completion and

semi-annually

thereafter. The facility is secured by certain assets associated
    with the Van Gogh and Pyrenees oil developments, including the
    shares of stock of the Company’s subsidiary holding the
    assets. The Company has agreed to guarantee the credit facility
    until completion occurs pursuant to terms of the facility, which
    is expected in 2010. The commitments under the facility
    will be reduced by scheduled increments every six months
    beginning June 30, 2010, with final maturity on
    March 31, 2014. Interest is based on LIBOR, which may be
    subject to change under certain market disruption conditions,
    plus a margin of 1.00 percent

pre-completion

and 1.75 percent

post-completion.

The

pre-completion

margin increases to 1.125 percent in the event the
    Company’s ratings are downgraded to BBB+ or below by at
    least two major rating agencies. As of December 31, 2008,
    there is $100 million outstanding under the facility.

Commercial Paper Program

The Company has
    available a $1.95 billion commercial paper program, which
    generally enables Apache to borrow funds for up to 270 days
    at competitive interest rates. As of December 31, 2008,
    Apache had no commercial paper outstanding. Our weighted-average
    interest rate for commercial paper was 5.65 percent and
    3.85 percent for 2008 and 2007, respectively. If the
    Company is unable to issue commercial paper



following a significant credit downgrade or dislocation in the
    market

,

the Company’s U.S. credit facilities
    are available as a 100 percent backstop.

Credit Ratings

We receive debt ratings from
    the major credit rating agencies in the United States. Factors
    that may impact our credit ratings include debt levels, planned
    asset purchases or sales and near-term and long-term production
    growth opportunities. Liquidity, asset quality, cost structure,
    reserve mix and commodity pricing levels could also be
    considered by the rating agencies. Apache’s senior
    unsecured long term debt is currently rated A3 by Moody’s,
    A- by Standard & Poor’s and A by Fitch. Apache’s
    short-term debt rating for its commercial paper program is
    currently P-2 by Moody’s, A-2 by Standard &
    Poor’s and F1 by Fitch. The outlook is stable from
    Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s and negative from
    Fitch. A ratings downgrade could adversely impact our ability to
    access debt markets in the future, increase the cost of future
    debt and potentially require the Company to post letters of
    credit in certain circumstances. We cannot predict, nor can we
    assure, that we will not receive a ratings downgrade in the
    future.

Pricing Trends.

For 2008, the Company’s
    average realized prices were substantially higher than the
    previous year’s prices. In fact, prices continued a general
    upward trend until July of this year, at which time prices began
    to decline significantly. Crude oil trades in global market;
    consequently, prices for all types and grades of crude oil
    generally move in the same direction. Natural gas has a limited
    global transportation system and, therefore, is subject to local
    supply and demand conditions. Approximately two-thirds of our
    natural gas is sold in the North American market, which tracks
    New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) prices, while the remaining
    is sold under fixed-price contracts in regulated markets.
    Following is a table of the published monthly average NYMEX
    prices in 2008:

While we are presently in a strong financial position, continued
    lower prices would negatively impact our future oil and gas
    production revenues, earnings and liquidity. Commodity prices
    are volatile and future prices cannot be accurately predicted.
    Apache’s investment decisions are based on longer-term
    commodity prices. For these reasons, we have historically based
    our capital expenditure budget on projected cash flows,
    modifying initial budgets in the event of significant changes in
    commodity prices. Given the recent commodity price levels, our
    initial 2009 budgeted expenditures is substantially less than
    projected 2008 levels. We also believe that certain service
    costs will be reduced, but historically there has been a lag
    between a precipitous drop in commodity prices and the
    underlying service costs necessary to find, develop and produce
    oil and natural gas.

Contractual
    Obligations

We are subject to various financial obligations and commitments
    in the normal course of operations. These contractual
    obligations represent known future cash payments that we are
    required to make and relate primarily to long-term debt,
    operating leases, pipeline transportation commitments and
    international commitments. The Company expects to fund these
    contractual obligations with cash generated from operating
    activities.



The following table summarizes the Company’s contractual
    obligations as of December 31, 2008. See

Apache is also subject to various contingent obligations that
    become payable only if certain events or rulings were to occur.
    The inherent uncertainty surrounding the timing of and monetary
    impact associated with these events or rulings prevents any
    meaningful accurate measurement, which is necessary to assess
    settlements resulting from litigation. Apache’s management
    feels that it has adequately reserved for its contingent
    obligations, including approximately $27 million for
    environmental remediation and approximately $25 million for
    various legal liabilities. See Note 9 —
    Commitments and Contingencies of Item 15 in this

Form 10-K

for a detailed discussion of the Company’s environmental
    and legal contingencies.

The Company also accrued approximately $74 million as of
    December 31, 2008, for an insurance contingency because of
    our involvement with Oil Insurance Limited (OIL). Apache is a
    member of this insurance pool, which insures specific property,
    pollution liability and other catastrophic risks of the Company.
    As part of its membership, the Company is contractually
    committed to pay termination fees were we to elect to withdraw
    from OIL. Apache does not anticipate withdrawal from the
    insurance pool; however, the potential termination fee is
    calculated annually based on past losses, and the liability
    reflecting this potential charge has been accrued as required.

Subsequent Event

On February 10, 2009,
    Apache’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Apache Canada Ltd.
    entered into an agreement with TransCanada Pipelines Limited
    (TCPL) pursuant to which TCPL will construct and install a gas
    pipeline from northeastern British Columbia to the existing NOVA
    pipeline system located in the Ekwan area of Alberta. Apache
    Canada intends to ship gas produced from the Ootla basin on the
    new pipeline.

The construction, operation and transportation rates of the new
    pipeline are subject to regulatory approval. Authority to
    construct the pipeline is expected, and construction is
    anticipated to be complete on or before April 1, 2011. Upon
    completion of the pipeline, Apache Canada will have a
    ship-or-pay commitment of 100 MMBtu of gas



for either a four-year period or a ten-year period depending on
    the rate structure determined and approved by the regulatory
    agency. Apache Canada has the right to terminate the agreement
    before October 1, 2009. If Apache Canada elects to
    terminate the agreement or TCPL terminates for reasons set forth
    in the agreement, Apache Canada must reimburse TCPL for certain
    costs and expenses up to approximately CDN $90 million plus
    certain taxes.

Off-Balance
    Sheet Arrangements

Apache does not currently utilize any off-balance sheet
    arrangements with unconsolidated entities to enhance liquidity
    and capital resource positions.

Critical
    Accounting Policies and Estimates

Apache prepares its financial statements and the accompanying
    notes in conformity with accounting principles generally
    accepted in the United States of America, which require
    management to make estimates and assumptions about future events
    that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and
    the accompanying notes. Apache identifies certain accounting
    policies as critical based on, among other things, their impact
    on the portrayal of Apache’s financial condition, results
    of operations or liquidity and the degree of difficulty,
    subjectivity and complexity in their deployment. Critical
    accounting policies cover accounting matters that are inherently
    uncertain because the future resolution of such matters is
    unknown. Management routinely discusses the development,
    selection and disclosure of each of the critical accounting
    policies. Following is a discussion of Apache’s most
    critical accounting policies:

Reserve Estimates

Our estimate of proved
    reserves is based on the quantities of oil and gas that
    geological and engineering data demonstrate, with reasonable
    certainty, to be recoverable in future years from known
    reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions. The
    Company reports all estimated proved reserves held under
    production-sharing arrangements utilizing the “economic
    interest” method, which excludes the host country’s
    share of reserves. The accuracy of any reserve estimate is a
    function of the quality of available data, engineering and
    geological interpretation and judgment. For example, we must
    estimate the amount and timing of future operating costs,
    severance taxes, development costs and workover costs, all of
    which may in fact vary considerably from actual results. In
    addition, as prices and cost levels change from year to year,
    the estimate of proved reserves also changes. Any significant
    variance in these assumptions could materially affect the
    estimated quantity and value of our reserves. As such, our
    reserve engineers review and revise the Company’s reserve
    estimates at least annually.

Despite the inherent imprecision in these engineering estimates,
    our reserves are used throughout our financial statements. For
    example, since we use the units-of-production method to amortize
    our oil and gas properties, the quantity of reserves could
    significantly impact our DD&A expense. Our oil and gas
    properties are also subject to a “ceiling” limitation
    based in part on the quantity of our proved reserves. Finally,
    these reserves are the basis for our supplemental oil and gas
    disclosures.

Asset Retirement Obligation (ARO)

The Company
    has significant obligations to remove tangible equipment and
    restore land or seabed at the end of oil and gas production
    operations. Apache’s removal and restoration obligations
    are primarily associated with plugging and abandoning wells and
    removing and disposing of offshore oil and gas platforms.
    Estimating the future restoration and removal costs is difficult
    and requires management to make estimates and judgments because
    most of the removal obligations are many years in the future,
    and contracts and regulation often have vague descriptions of
    what constitutes removal. Asset removal technologies and costs
    are constantly changing, as are regulatory, political,
    environmental, safety and public relations considerations.

ARO associated with retiring tangible long-lived assets is
    recognized as a liability in the period in which the legal
    obligation is incurred and becomes determinable. The liability
    is offset by a corresponding increase in the underlying asset.
    The ARO is recorded at fair value, and accretion expense is
    recognized over time as the discounted liability is accreted to
    its expected settlement value.

Inherent in the present value calculation are numerous
    assumptions and judgments including the ultimate settlement
    amounts, inflation factors, credit adjusted discount rates,
    timing of settlement and changes in the legal,



regulatory, environmental and political environments. To the
    extent future revisions to these assumptions impact the present
    value of the existing ARO liability, a corresponding adjustment
    is made to the oil and gas property balance.

Income Taxes

Our oil and gas exploration and
    production operations are currently located in six countries. As
    a result, we are subject to taxation on our income in numerous
    jurisdictions. We record deferred tax assets and liabilities to
    account for the expected future tax consequences of events that
    have been recognized in our financial statements and our tax
    returns. We routinely assess the realizability of our deferred
    tax assets. If we conclude that it is more likely than not that
    some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be
    realized under accounting standards, the tax asset would be
    reduced by a valuation allowance. We consider future taxable
    income in making such assessments. Numerous judgments and
    assumptions are inherent in the determination of future taxable
    income, including factors such as future operating conditions
    (particularly as related to prevailing oil and gas prices).

The Company regularly assesses and, if required, establishes
    accruals for tax contingencies that could result from
    assessments of additional tax by taxing jurisdictions in
    countries where the Company operates. Tax reserves have been
    established and include any related interest, despite the belief
    by the Company that certain tax positions have been fully
    documented in the Company’s tax returns. These reserves are
    subject to a significant amount of judgment and are reviewed and
    adjusted on a periodic basis in light of changing facts and
    circumstances considering the progress of ongoing tax audits,
    case law and any new legislation. The Company believes that the
    reserves established are adequate in relation to the potential
    for any additional tax assessments.

ITEM 7A.

QUANTITATIVE
    AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

The primary objective of the following information is to provide
    forward-looking quantitative and qualitative information about
    our exposure to market risk. The term market risk relates to the
    risk of loss arising from adverse changes in oil, gas and NGL
    prices, interest rates, foreign currency and adverse
    governmental actions. The disclosures are not meant to be
    precise indicators of expected future losses, but rather
    indicators of reasonably possible losses. The forward-looking
    information provides indicators of how we view and manage our
    ongoing market risk exposures.

Commodity
    Risk

The Company’s revenues, earnings, cash flow, capital
    investments and, ultimately, future rate of growth are highly
    dependent on the prices we receive for our crude oil, natural
    gas and NGLs, which have historically been very volatile due to
    unpredictable events such as economical growth or retraction,
    weather and climate. Crude oil prices in 2008 began the year
    strong and increased rapidly to unprecedented levels in the
    summer, before decreasing to below first quarter 2008 prices by
    the end of the year. West Texas Intermediate (WTI), an industry
    benchmark crude oil, peaked above $147 per barrel in July before
    falling to nearly $40 at year-end as a result of decreased
    demand for energy as world economies slowed. Natural gas prices,
    especially in the U.S. where we have fewer long-term supply
    contracts, followed a similar path.

We periodically enter into hedging activities on a portion of
    our projected oil and natural gas production through a variety
    of financial and physical arrangements intended to support oil
    and natural gas prices at targeted levels and to manage our
    overall exposure to oil and gas price fluctuations. Apache may
    use futures contracts, swaps, options and fixed-price physical
    contracts to hedge its commodity prices. Realized gains or
    losses from the Company’s price risk management activities
    are recognized in oil and gas production revenues when the
    associated production occurs. Apache does not generally hold or
    issue derivative instruments for trading purposes.

Apache historically only hedged long-term oil and gas prices
    related to a portion of its expected production associated with
    acquisitions; however, in 2007 and 2008, the Company’s
    Board of Directors authorized management to hedge a portion of
    production generated from the Company’s drilling program.
    Approximately 20 percent of our 2008 natural gas production
    and 19 percent of our crude oil production were subjected
    to financial derivative hedges.



On December 31, 2008, the Company had open natural gas
    derivative hedges in an asset position with a fair value of
    $47 million. A 10 percent increase in natural gas
    prices would reduce the fair value by approximately
    $15 million, while a 10 percent decrease in prices
    would increase the fair value by approximately $18 million.
    The Company also had open oil derivatives in an asset position
    with a fair value of $165 million. A 10 percent
    increase in oil prices would decrease the asset by approximately
    $117 million, while a 10 percent decrease in prices
    would increase the asset by approximately $118 million.
    These fair value changes assume volatility based on prevailing
    market parameters at December 31, 2008. See
    Note 3 — Hedging and Derivative Instruments of
    Item 15 in this

Form 10-K

for notional volumes and terms associated with the
    Company’s derivative contracts.

Apache conducts its risk management activities for its
    commodities under the controls and governance of its risk
    management policy. The Risk Management Committee, comprising the
    President (principal financial officer), General Counsel,
    Treasurer and other key members of Apache’s management,
    approve and oversee these controls, which have been implemented
    by designated members of the treasury department. The treasury
    and accounting departments also provide separate checks and
    reviews on the results of hedging activities. Controls for our
    commodity risk management activities include limits on credit,
    limits on volume, segregation of duties, delegation of authority
    and a number of other policy and procedural controls.

Interest
    Rate Risk

On December 31, 2008, the Company’s debt with fixed
    interest rates represented approximately 98 percent of
    total debt. As a result, the interest expense on approximately
    two percent of Apache’s debt will fluctuate based on
    short-term interest rates. A 10 percent change in floating
    interest rates on year-end floating debt balances would change
    annual interest expense by approximately $707,000.

Foreign
    Currency Risk

The Company’s cash flow stream relating to certain
    international operations is based on the U.S. dollar
    equivalent of cash flows measured in foreign currencies. In
    Australia, oil production is sold under U.S. dollar
    contracts, and the majority of the gas production is sold under
    fixed-price Australian dollar contracts. Approximately half the
    costs incurred for Australian operations are paid in
    U.S. dollars. In Canada, the majority of oil and gas
    production is sold under Canadian dollar contracts. The majority
    of the costs incurred are paid in Canadian dollars. The North
    Sea production is sold under U.S. dollar contracts, and the
    majority of costs incurred are paid in British pounds. In Egypt,
    all oil and gas production is sold under U.S. dollar
    contracts, and the majority of the costs incurred are
    denominated in U.S. dollars. Argentine revenues and
    expenditures are largely denominated in U.S. dollars but
    converted into Argentine pesos at the time of payment. Revenue
    and disbursement transactions denominated in Australian dollars,
    Canadian dollars, British pounds, Egyptian pounds and Argentine
    pesos are converted to U.S. dollar equivalents based on the
    average exchange rates during the period.

Foreign currency gains and losses also arise when monetary
    assets and monetary liabilities denominated in foreign
    currencies are translated at the end of each month. Currency
    gains and losses are included as either a component of
    “Other” under “Revenues and Other” or, as is
    the case when we re-measure our foreign tax liabilities, as a
    component of the Company’s provision for income tax expense
    on the Statement of Consolidated Operations.

Forward-Looking
    Statements and Risk

This report includes “forward-looking statements”
    within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of
    1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities
    Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. All statements other than
    statements of historical facts included or incorporated by
    reference in this report, including, without limitation,
    statements regarding our future financial position, business
    strategy, budgets, projected revenues, projected costs and plans
    and objectives of management for future operations, are
    forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements are
    based on our examination of historical operating trends, the
    information that was used to prepare our estimate of proved
    reserves as of December 31, 2008 and other data in our
    possession or available from third parties. In addition,
    forward-looking statements generally can be identified by the
    use of forward-looking terminology such as “may,”
    “will,” “expect,” “intend,”
    “project,” “estimate,”
    “anticipate,” “believe,” or
    “continue” or similar terminology. Although we believe
    that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking
    statements are



reasonable, we can give no assurance that such expectations will
    prove to have been correct. Important factors that could cause
    actual results to differ materially from our expectations
    include, but are not limited to, our assumptions about:

•

the market prices of oil, natural gas, NGLs and other products
    or services;

•

our commodity hedging arrangements;

•

the supply and demand for oil, natural gas, NGLs and other
    products or services;

•

production and reserve levels;

•

drilling risks;

•

economic and competitive conditions;

•

the availability of capital resources;

•

capital expenditure and other contractual obligations;

•

currency exchange rates;

•

weather conditions;

•

inflation rates;

•

the availability of goods and services;

•

legislative or regulatory changes;

•

terrorism;

•

occurrence of property acquisitions or divestitures;

•

the securities or capital markets and related risks such as
    general credit, liquidity, market and interest-rate

    Controls and Procedures

G. Steven Farris, the Company’s Chairman and Chief
    Executive Officer, in his capacity as principal executive
    officer, and Roger B. Plank, the Company’s President, in
    his capacity as principal financial officer, evaluated the
    effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of
    December 31, 2008, the end of the period covered by this
    report. Based on that evaluation and as of the date of that
    evaluation, these officers concluded that the Company’s
    disclosure controls and procedures were effective, providing
    effective means to ensure that the information we are required
    to disclose under applicable laws and regulations is recorded,
    processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
    specified in the Commission’s rules and forms and
    communicated to our management, including our principal
    executive officer and principal financial officer, to allow
    timely decisions regarding required disclosure. We also made no
    changes in internal controls over financial reporting during the
    quarter ending December 31, 2008 that have materially
    affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

We periodically review the design and effectiveness of our
    disclosure controls, including compliance with various laws and
    regulations that apply to our operations both inside and outside
    the United States. We make modifications to improve the design
    and effectiveness of our disclosure controls and may take other
    corrective action, if our reviews identify deficiencies or
    weaknesses in our controls.

REPORT OF
    MANAGEMENT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL
    REPORTING

Management of the Company is responsible for the preparation and
    integrity of the consolidated financial statements appearing in
    this annual report on

Form 10-K.

The financial statements were prepared in conformity with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
    and include amounts that are based on management’s best
    estimates and judgments.

Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and
    maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting
    as such term is defined in

Rule 13a-15(f)

under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act). The
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting is
    designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the
    consolidated financial statements. Our internal control over
    financial reporting is supported by a program on internal audits
    and appropriate reviews by management, written policies and
    guidelines, careful selection and training of qualified
    personnel and a written code of business conduct adopted by our
    Company’s board of directors, applicable to all Company
    directors and all officers and employees of our Company and
    subsidiaries.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements and
    even when determined to be effective, can only provide
    reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement
    preparation and presentation. Also, projections of any
    evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the
    risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in
    conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or
    procedures may deteriorate.

Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s
    internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2008. In making this assessment, management
    used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in

Internal
    Control — Integrated Framework.

Based on our
    assessment, management believes that the Company maintained
    effective internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2008.

The Company’s independent auditors, Ernst & Young
    LLP, a registered public accounting firm, are appointed by the
    Audit Committee of the Company’s board of directors.
    Ernst & Young LLP have audited and reported on the
    consolidated financial statements of Apache Corporation and
    subsidiaries, and the effectiveness of the Company’s
    internal control over financial reporting. The reports of the
    independent auditors follow this report on pages F-2 and F-3.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Apache Corporation:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    Apache Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2008
    and 2007, and the related consolidated statements of operations,
    shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three
    years in the period ended December 31, 2008. These
    financial statements are the responsibility of the
    Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
    opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
    present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
    financial position of Apache Corporation and subsidiaries at
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, and the consolidated results of
    their operations and their cash flows for each of the three
    years ended December 31, 2008, in conformity with
    U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

As described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial
    statements, in 2007 the Company adopted the provisions of
    Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 48,
    “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes.”

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States),
    Apache Corporation’s internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2008, based on criteria
    established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by
    the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission and our report dated February 27, 2009,
    expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Apache Corporation:

We have audited Apache Corporation’s internal control over
    financial reporting as of December 31, 2008, based on
    criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
    the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Apache
    Corporation’s management is responsible for maintaining
    effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its
    assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
    financial reporting included in the accompanying Report of
    Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our
    responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s
    internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
    that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the
    design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
    the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we
    considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
    audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Apache Corporation maintained, in all material
    respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as
    of December 31, 2008, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated balance sheets of Apache Corporation and
    subsidiaries as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, and the
    related consolidated statements of operations,
    shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three
    years in the period ended December 31, 2008, and our report
    dated February 27, 2009, expressed an unqualified opinion
    thereon.

APACHE
    CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Nature of Operations

Apache Corporation
    (Apache or the Company) is an independent energy company that
    explores for, develops and produces natural gas, crude oil and
    natural gas liquids. The Company’s North American
    exploration and production activities are divided into two
    United States (U.S.) operating regions (Central and Gulf Coast)
    and a Canadian region. Approximately 61 percent of the
    Company’s proved reserves are located in North America.
    Outside of North America, Apache has exploration and production
    interests in Egypt, offshore Western Australia, offshore the
    United Kingdom in the North Sea (North Sea) and Argentina. In
    2008, we finalized contracts for two exploration blocks in Chile.

1.

SUMMARY
    OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Accounting policies used by Apache and its subsidiaries reflect
    industry practices and conform to accounting principles
    generally accepted in the U.S. (GAAP). Certain
    reclassifications have been made to prior periods to conform
    with the current presentations. Significant policies are
    discussed below.

Principles of Consolidation

The
    accompanying consolidated financial statements include the
    accounts of Apache and its subsidiaries after elimination of
    intercompany balances and transactions. The Company consolidates
    all investments in which the Company, either through direct or
    indirect ownership, has more than a 50 percent voting
    interest. In addition, Apache consolidates all variable interest
    entities where it is the primary beneficiary. The Company’s
    interest in oil and gas exploration and production ventures and
    partnerships are proportionately consolidated.

Use of Estimates

Preparation of
    financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management
    to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts
    of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets
    and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the
    reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
    period. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience
    and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable
    under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for
    making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities
    that are not readily apparent from other sources. Apache
    evaluates its estimates and assumptions on a regular basis.
    Actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions
    used in preparation of its financial statements and changes in
    these estimates are recorded when known. Significant estimates
    with regard to these financial statements include the estimate
    of proved oil and gas reserves and related present value
    estimates of future net cash flows there from (See
    Note 13 — Supplemental Oil and Gas Disclosure),
    asset retirement obligations, income taxes, valuation of
    derivative instruments and contingency obligations including
    legal and environmental risks and exposures.

Cash Equivalents

The Company considers
    all highly liquid short-term investments with a maturity of
    three months or less at time of purchase to be cash equivalents.
    These investments are carried at cost, which approximates fair
    value. At December 31, 2008, we had $1.2 billion of
    cash and cash equivalents.

Marketable Securities

The Company
    accounts for investments in debt and equity securities in
    accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    (SFAS) No. 115, “Accounting for Certain Investments in
    Debt and Equity Securities.” Investments in debt securities
    classified as “held to maturity” are recorded at cost.
    At December 31, 2008, we had $792 million invested in
    obligations of the U.S. government with original maturities
    greater than three months but less than a year.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

The
    Company routinely assesses the recoverability of all material
    trade and other receivables to determine their collectibility.
    Many of Apache’s receivables are from joint interest owners
    on properties Apache operates. Thus, Apache may have the ability
    to withhold future revenue disbursements to recover any
    non-payment of joint interest billings. Generally, the
    Company’s crude oil and natural gas receivables are
    collected within two months. The Company accrues a reserve on a
    receivable when, based on the judgment of management, it is
    probable that a receivable will not be collected and the amount
    of any reserve may be reasonably estimated. As of
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company had an allowance
    for doubtful accounts of $33 million and $23 million,
    respectively.

F-8


APACHE
    CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Apache experienced a decline in the timeliness of receipts from
    the Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation (EGPC) for oil and
    gas sales in the second half of 2008. Although the Company
    continues to collect on these receivables, albeit late,
    management does not believe there is an indication that the
    Company will not be able to collect the balance of our
    receivables from this customer.

Inventories

Inventories consist
    principally of tubular goods and equipment, stated at the lower
    of weighted-average cost or market, and oil produced but not
    sold, stated at the lower of cost or market.

Oil and Gas Property

The Company uses
    the full-cost method of accounting for its exploration and
    development activities. Under this method of accounting, the
    cost of both successful and unsuccessful exploration and
    development activities are capitalized as property and
    equipment. This includes any internal costs that are directly
    related to exploration and development activities, including
    salaries and benefits, but does not include any costs related to
    production, general corporate overhead or similar activities.
    Historically, total capitalized internal costs in any given year
    have not been material to total oil and gas costs capitalized in
    such year. Apache capitalized $236 million,
    $208 million and $146 million of these internal costs
    in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Proceeds from the sale or
    disposition of oil and gas properties are accounted for as a
    reduction to capitalized costs unless a significant portion
    (greater than 25 percent) of the Company’s reserve
    quantities in a particular country are sold, in which case a
    gain or loss is recognized.

Costs Excluded

Oil and gas unevaluated
    properties and properties under development include costs that
    are excluded from costs being depreciated or amortized. These
    costs represent investments in unproved properties and major
    development projects in which the Company owns a direct
    interest. Apache excludes these costs on a

country-by-country

basis until proved reserves are found, until it is determined
    that the costs are impaired, or major development projects are
    placed in service. All costs excluded are reviewed at least
    quarterly to determine if impairment has occurred. In countries
    where proved reserves exist, exploratory drilling costs
    associated with dry holes are transferred to proved properties
    immediately upon determination that a well is dry and amortized
    accordingly. Also, geological and geophysical (G&G) costs
    not associated with specific properties are recorded to proved
    property. For international operations where a reserve base has
    not yet been established, impairments are charged to earnings
    and are determined through an evaluation considering, among
    other factors, seismic data, requirements to relinquish acreage,
    drilling results, remaining time in the commitment period,
    remaining capital plan and political, economic and market
    conditions.

Ceiling Test

Under the full-cost method
    of accounting, a ceiling test is performed each quarter. The
    test establishes a limit (ceiling), on a

country-by-country

basis, on the book value of oil and gas properties. The
    capitalized costs of proved oil and gas properties, net of
    accumulated depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD&A)
    and the related deferred income taxes, may not exceed this
    “ceiling.” The ceiling limitation is the estimated
    after-tax future net cash flows from proved oil and gas
    reserves, excluding future cash outflows associated with
    settling asset retirement obligations accrued on the balance
    sheet. The estimate of after-tax future net cash flows is
    calculated using a discount rate of 10 percent per annum
    and both costs and commodity prices in effect at the end of the
    period held flat for the life of production, except where future
    oil and gas sales are covered by physical contract terms or by
    derivative instruments that qualify, and are accounted for, as
    cash flow hedges. If capitalized costs exceed this limit, the
    excess is charged to expense and reflected as additional
    DD&A. See Note 13 — Supplemental Oil and Gas
    Disclosures (Unaudited) for a discussion on calculation of
    estimated future net cash flows.

The Company recorded a $5.3 billion ($3.6 billion net
    of tax) non-cash write-down of the carrying value of the
    Company’s U.S., U.K. North Sea, Canadian and Argentine
    proved oil and gas properties as of December 31, 2008, as a
    result of the ceiling test limitations, which is reflected as
    additional DD&A expense in the accompanying statement of
    consolidated operations. Approximately nine percent of our
    future oil and gas production is being hedged in 2009, three
    percent in 2010 and 2011, two percent in 2012 and less than one
    percent in 2013. Excluding the effects of cash flow hedges in
    calculating the ceiling limitation, the write-down would have
    been $5.9 billion ($4.0 billion net of tax). See
    Note 12 — Business Segment Information.

F-9


APACHE
    CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

If oil and gas prices at the end of the first quarter are below
    year-end levels, additional write-downs of oil and gas
    properties are likely to occur.

Depreciation, Depletion and
    Amortization

DD&A of oil and gas
    properties is calculated quarterly, on a

country-by-country

basis, using the Units of Production Method (UOP). The UOP
    calculation, in simplest terms, multiplies the percentage of
    estimated proved reserves produced each quarter times the costs
    of those reserves. The result is to recognize expense at the
    same pace that the reservoirs are actually depleting. The
    amortization base in the UOP calculation includes the sum of
    proved property costs net of accumulated DD&A, estimated
    future development costs (future costs to access and develop
    reserves) and asset retirement costs which are not already
    included in oil and gas property, less related salvage value.

Gas gathering, transmission and processing facilities, buildings
    and equipment are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the
    estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from three to
    20 years. Accumulated depreciation for these assets totaled
    $870 million and $720 million at December 31,
    2008 and 2007, respectively.

Asset Retirement Obligation

The initial
    estimated retirement obligation of properties is recognized as a
    liability, with an associated increase in properties and
    equipment for the asset retirement cost. Accretion expense is
    recognized over the estimated productive life of the related
    assets. If the fair value of the estimated asset retirement
    obligation changes, an adjustment is recorded to both the asset
    retirement obligation and the asset retirement cost. Revisions
    in estimated liabilities can result from revisions of estimated
    inflation rates, changes in service and equipment costs and
    changes in the estimated timing of settling asset retirement
    obligations.

Capitalized Interest

Interest is
    capitalized on oil and gas investments in unproved properties
    and exploration and development activities that are in progress
    qualify for capitalized interest. Major construction projects
    also qualify for interest capitalization until the assets are
    ready for service. Capitalized interest is calculated by
    multiplying the Company’s weighted-average interest rate on
    debt by the amount of qualifying costs. For projects under
    construction that carry their own financing, interest is
    calculated using the interest rate related to the project
    financing. Interest and related costs are capitalized until each
    project is complete. Capitalized interest cannot exceed gross
    interest expense. As oil and gas costs excluded are transferred
    to unproved properties, any associated capitalized interest is
    also transferred. As major construction projects are completed,
    the associated capitalized interest is amortized over the useful
    life of the related asset. Capitalized interest totaled
    $94 million, $76 million and $61 million in 2008,
    2007, and 2006 respectively.

Goodwill

Goodwill represents the excess
    of the purchase price of an entity over the estimated fair value
    of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The Company
    assesses the carrying amount of goodwill by testing the goodwill
    for impairment annually and when impairment indicators arise.
    The impairment test requires allocating goodwill and all other
    assets and liabilities to assigned reporting units. The fair
    value of each unit is determined and compared to the book value
    of the reporting unit. If the fair value of the reporting unit
    is less than the book value, including goodwill, then goodwill
    is written down to the implied fair value of the goodwill
    through a charge to expense. Goodwill totaled $189 million
    at December 31, 2008 and 2007, with approximately
    $103 million and $86 million recorded in Canada and
    Egypt, respectively. Each country was assessed as a reporting
    unit. No impairment of goodwill was recognized during 2008, 2007
    or 2006.

Accounts Payable

Included in accounts
    payable at December 31, 2008 and 2007, are liabilities of
    approximately $164 million and $125 million,
    respectively, representing the amount by which checks issued,
    but not presented to the Company’s banks for collection,
    exceeded balances in applicable bank accounts.

Commitments and Contingencies

Accruals
    for loss contingencies arising from claims, assessments,
    litigation, environmental and other sources are recorded when it
    is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount
    can be reasonably estimated. These accruals are adjusted as
    additional information becomes available or circumstances change.

F-10


APACHE
    CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Revenue Recognition and Imbalances

Oil
    and gas revenues are recognized when production is sold to a
    purchaser at a fixed or determinable price, when delivery has
    occurred and title has transferred, and if collectibility of the
    revenue is probable. Cash received relating to future revenues
    is deferred and recognized when all revenue recognition criteria
    are met.

Apache uses the sales method of accounting for gas production
    imbalances. The volumes of gas sold may differ from the volumes
    to which Apache is entitled based on its interests in the
    properties. These differences create imbalances that are
    recognized as a liability only when the properties’
    estimated remaining reserves net to Apache will not be
    sufficient to enable the underproduced owner to recoup its
    entitled share through production. The Company’s recorded
    liability is generally reflected in other non-current
    liabilities. No receivables are recorded for those wells where
    Apache has taken less than its share of production. Gas
    imbalances are reflected as adjustments to estimates of proved
    gas reserves and future cash flows in the unaudited supplemental
    oil and gas disclosures.

The Company’s Egyptian operations are conducted pursuant to
    production sharing contracts under which contractor partners pay
    all operating and capital costs for exploring and developing the
    concessions. A percentage of the production, generally up to
    40 percent, is available to the contractor partners to
    recover these operating and capital costs. The balance of the
    production is split among the contractor partners and Egyptian
    General Petroleum Corporation (EGPC) on a contractually defined
    basis.

Apache markets its own U.S. natural gas production. As the
    Company’s production fluctuates because of operational
    issues, it is occasionally necessary to purchase gas
    (third-party gas) to fulfill its sales obligations and
    commitments. Both the costs and sales proceeds of this
    third-party gas are reported on a net basis in oil and gas
    production revenues. The costs of third-party gas netted against
    the related sales proceeds totaled $56 million,
    $123 million and $160 million, for 2008, 2007 and
    2006, respectively.

Derivative Instruments and Hedging
    Activities

Apache periodically enters into
    derivative contracts to manage its exposure to commodity price
    risk. These derivative contracts, which are generally placed
    with major financial institutions that the Company believes are
    minimal credit risks, may take the form of forward contracts,
    futures contracts, swaps or options. The oil and gas reference
    prices, upon which the commodity derivative contracts are based,
    reflect various market indices that have a high degree of
    historical correlation with actual prices received by the
    Company for its oil and gas production.

Apache accounts for its derivative instruments in accordance
    with SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative
    Instruments and Hedging Activities,” as amended.
    SFAS No. 133 establishes accounting and reporting
    standards requiring that all derivative instruments, other than
    those that meet the normal purchases and sales exception, be
    recorded on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability
    measured at fair value (which is generally based on information
    obtained from independent parties). SFAS No. 133 also
    requires that changes in fair value be recognized currently in
    earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met.
    Hedge accounting treatment allows unrealized gains and losses on
    cash flow hedges to be deferred in other comprehensive income.
    Realized gains and losses from the Company’s oil and gas
    cash flow hedges, including terminated contracts, are generally
    recognized in oil and gas production revenues when the
    forecasted transaction occurs. Gains and losses from the change
    in fair value of derivative instruments that do not qualify for
    hedge accounting are reported in current period income as
    “Other” under Revenues and Other in the Statement of
    Consolidated Operations. If at any time the likelihood of
    occurrence of a hedged forecasted transaction ceases to be
    “probable,” hedge accounting under
    SFAS No. 133 will cease on a prospective basis and all
    future changes in the fair value of the derivative will be
    recognized directly in earnings. Amounts recorded in other
    comprehensive income prior to the change in the likelihood of
    occurrence of the forecasted transaction will remain in other
    comprehensive income until such time as the forecasted
    transaction impacts earnings. If it becomes probable that the
    original forecasted production will not occur, then the
    derivative gain or loss would be reclassified from accumulated
    other comprehensive income into earnings immediately. Hedge
    effectiveness is measured at least quarterly based on the
    relative changes in fair value between the derivative contract
    and the hedged item over time, and any ineffectiveness is
    immediately reported as “Other” under Revenues and
    Other in the Statement of Consolidated Operations.

General and Administrative
    Expense

General and administrative expenses
    are reported net of recoveries from owners in properties
    operated by Apache and net of amounts related to lease operating
    activities or capitalized pursuant to the full-cost method of
    accounting.

Income Taxes

We record deferred tax
    assets and liabilities to account for the expected future tax
    consequences of events that have been recognized in our
    financial statements and our tax returns. We routinely assess
    the realizability of our deferred tax assets. If we conclude
    that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the
    deferred tax assets will not be realized under accounting
    standards, the tax asset is reduced by a valuation allowance. We
    consider future taxable income in making such assessments.
    Numerous judgments and assumptions are inherent in the
    determination of future taxable income, including factors such
    as future operating conditions (particularly as related to
    prevailing oil and gas prices).

Earnings from Apache’s international operations are
    permanently reinvested; therefore, the Company does not
    recognize U.S. deferred taxes on the unremitted earnings of
    its international subsidiaries. If it becomes apparent that some
    or all of the unremitted earnings will be remitted, the Company
    will then recognize taxes on those earnings.

Foreign Currency Translation

The
    U.S. dollar has been determined to be the functional
    currency for each of Apache’s international operations. The
    functional currency is determined

country-by-country

based on relevant facts and circumstances of the cash flows,
    commodity pricing environment and financing arrangements in each
    country. Foreign currency translation gains and losses arise
    when monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign
    currencies are remeasured to U.S. dollars at the exchange rate
    in effect at the end of each reporting period.

The Company accounts for foreign currency gains and losses in
    accordance with SFAS No. 52, “Foreign Currency
    Translation.” Foreign currency translation gains and losses
    related to deferred taxes are recorded as a component of
    provision for income taxes. The Company recorded a deferred tax
    benefit of $397 million in 2008, additional deferred tax
    expense of $228 million in 2007 and a deferred tax benefit
    of $5 million in 2006 (see Note 6 — Income
    Taxes). All other foreign currency translation gains and losses
    are reflected in “Other” under Revenues and Other in
    the Statement of Consolidated Operations. The Company’s
    other foreign currency gains and losses included in
    “Other” under Revenues and Other in the Statement of
    Consolidated Operations netted to a gain of $38 million in
    2008, a $9 million gain in 2007 and a loss of
    $15 million in 2006.

Foreign currency gains and losses also arise when revenue and
    disbursement transactions denominated in a country’s local
    currency are converted to U.S. equivalent dollars based on the
    average exchange rates during the reporting period.

Insurance Coverage

The Company
    recognizes an insurance receivable when collection of the
    receivable is deemed probable. Any recognition of an insurance
    receivable is recorded by crediting and offsetting the original
    charge. Any differential arising between insurance recoveries
    and insurance receivables is recorded as a capitalized cost or
    as an expense, consistent with its original treatment.

Earnings Per Share

The Company’s
    basic earnings per share (EPS) amounts have been computed based
    on the weighted-average number of shares of common stock
    outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS reflects the potential
    dilution, using the treasury stock method, which could occur if
    options were exercised and restricted stock were fully vested.

Diluted EPS also includes the impact of unvested Share
    Appreciation Plans. For awards in which the share price goals
    have already been achieved, shares are included in diluted EPS
    using the treasury stock method. For those awards in which the
    share price goals have not been achieved, the number of
    contingently issuable shares included in the diluted EPS is
    based on the number of shares, if any, using the treasury stock
    method, that would be issuable if the market price of the
    Company’s stock at the end of the reporting period exceeded
    the share price goals under the terms of the plan.

Stock-Based Compensation

The Company
    accounts for stock-based compensation under the fair value
    recognition provisions of

SFAS No. 123-R,

“Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,” as amended
    and revised.

F-12


APACHE
    CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The Company grants various types of stock-based awards including
    stock options, nonvested equity shares (restricted stock) and
    performance-based awards. In 2003 and 2004, the Company also
    granted cash-based stock appreciation rights. These plans and
    related accounting policies are defined and described more fully
    in Note 7 — Capital Stock. Stock compensation
    awards granted are valued on the date of grant and are expensed,
    net of estimated forfeitures, on a straight-line basis over the
    required service period.

Gathering, Transmission and Processing
    Facilities

The Company assesses the carrying
    amount of its gathering, transmission and processing facilities
    by testing the facilities annually and whenever events or
    changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may
    not be recoverable. If the carrying amount of these facilities
    is less than the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to
    result from their use and eventual disposition, an impairment
    loss is recorded through a charge to expense. Gathering,
    transmission and processing facilities totaled $2.9 billion
    and $2.2 billion at December 31, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively. No impairment of gathering, transmission and
    processing facilities was recognized during 2008, 2007 or 2006.

SFAS No. 123-R

also requires that benefits of tax deductions in excess of
    recognized compensation cost be reported as financing cash flows
    rather than as operating cash flows. The Company classified
    $47 million, $30 million and $49 million as
    financing cash inflows in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

Treasury Stock

The Company follows the
    weighted-average-cost method of accounting for treasury stock
    transactions.

Recently Issued Accounting Standards Not Yet
    Adopted

In December 2007, the Financial
    Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued a revision to
    SFAS No. 141, “Business Combinations”
    (SFAS No. 141(R)). The revision broadens the
    definition of a business combination to include all transactions
    or other events in which control of one or more businesses is
    obtained. Further, the statement establishes principles and
    requirements for how an acquirer recognizes assets acquired,
    liabilities assumed and any non-controlling interests acquired.
    Apache has adopted SFAS No. 141 (R) as of
    January 1, 2009.

Also in December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160,
    “Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial
    Statements.” This statement amends Accounting Research
    Bulletin No. 51, “Consolidated Financial
    Statements.” SFAS No. 160 establishes accounting
    and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interests in a
    subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. It
    clarifies that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary,
    sometimes called a minority interest, is an ownership interest
    in the consolidated entity that should be reported as equity in
    the consolidated financial statements. Additionally, the amounts
    of consolidated net income attributable to both the parent and
    the noncontrolling interest must be reported separately on the
    face of the income statement. Apache adopted
    SFAS No. 160 as of January 1, 2009. Adoption of
    this standard did not have an effect on our financial position
    or results of operations.

In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161,
    “Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging
    Activities,” an amendment to SFAS No. 133,
    “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
    Activities.” SFAS No. 161 changes the disclosure
    requirements for derivative instruments and hedging activities
    to include enhanced disclosures about how and why an entity uses
    derivative instruments, how derivative instruments and related
    hedged items are accounted for under SFAS No. 133 and
    how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an
    entity’s financial position, financial performance and cash
    flows. Apache adopted SFAS No. 161 as of
    January 1, 2009. Adoption of this standard did not have an
    effect on our financial position or results of operations.

In June 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) Emerging
    Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 03-6-1,
    “Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share-Based
    Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities.” FSP
    EITF No. 03-6-1 addresses whether instruments granted in
    share-based payment transactions should be considered
    participating securities for the purposes of applying the
    two-class method of calculating earnings per share (EPS)
    pursuant to FASB Statement No. 128, “Earnings Per
    Share.” This FSP concludes that unvested share-based
    payment awards that contain rights to receive nonforfeitable
    dividends or dividend equivalents are participating securities
    prior to vesting and, therefore, should be included in the
    earnings allocations in computing basic

F-13

EPS under the two-class method. This FSP is effective for
    financial statements issued beginning after December 15,
    2008, with prior-period retrospective allocation. Apache has
    adopted FSP EITF Issue No. 03-6-1 as of January 1,
    2009. Apache does not expect the effect of this FSP on its
    financial statements to be material.

In December 2008, the FASB issued FSP FAS 132(R)-1,
    “Employers’ Disclosures about Postretirement Benefit
    Plan Assets.” This FSP provides additional guidance
    regarding the application of SFAS No. 132(R),
    “Employers’ Disclosures about Pensions and Other
    Postretirement Benefits — An Amendment of FASB
    Statements No. 87, 88, and 106,” which requires
    additional disclosures about plan assets of a defined benefit
    pension or other postretirement plan, including investment
    strategies, major categories of plan assets, concentrations of
    risk within plan assets, inputs and valuation techniques used to
    measure the fair value of plan assets and the effect of
    fair-value measurements using significant unobservable inputs on
    changes in plan assets for the period. FSP 132(R)-1 is
    effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2009,
    with earlier application permitted. We do not expect the
    adoption of this standard to have an effect on our financial
    position or results of operations.

In January 2009, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)
    issued Release

No. 33-8995,

“Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting,” amending oil
    and gas reporting requirements under

Rule 4-10

of

Regulation S-X

and Industry Guide 2 in

Regulation S-K

and bringing full-cost accounting rules into alignment with the
    revised disclosure requirements. The new rules include changes
    to the pricing used to estimate reserves, the ability to include
    nontraditional resources in reserves, the use of new technology
    for determining reserves and permitting disclosure of probable
    and possible reserves. The final rules are effective for

SIGNIFICANT
    ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES

U.S. Permian
    Basin

On March 29, 2007, the Company closed its acquisition of
    controlling interest in 28 oil and gas fields in the Permian
    Basin of West Texas from Anadarko Petroleum Corporation
    (Anadarko) for $1 billion. Apache estimated that these
    fields had proved reserves of 57 million barrels (MMbbls)
    of liquid hydrocarbons and 78 billion cubic feet (Bcf) of
    natural gas as of year-end 2006. The Company funded the
    acquisition with debt. Apache and Anadarko entered into a
    joint-venture arrangement to effect the transaction. The Company
    entered into cash flow hedges for a portion of the crude oil and
    the natural gas production.

U.S. Permian
    Basin

On January 5, 2006, the Company purchased Amerada
    Hess’s interest in eight fields located in the Permian
    basin of West Texas and New Mexico. The original purchase price
    was reduced from $404 million to $269 million because
    other interest owners exercised their preferential rights to
    purchase a number of the properties. The settlement price at
    closing of $239 million was adjusted for revenues and
    expenditures occurring between the effective date and the
    closing date of the acquisition. The acquired fields had
    estimated proved reserves of 27 MMbbls of liquid
    hydrocarbons and 27 Bcf of natural gas as of year-end 2005.

Argentina

On April 25, 2006, the Company acquired the operations of
    Pioneer Natural Resources (Pioneer) in Argentina for
    $675 million. The settlement price at closing, of
    $703 million, was adjusted for revenues and expenditures
    occurring between the effective date and closing date of the
    acquisition. The properties are located in the Neuquén,
    San Jorge and Austral basins of Argentina and had estimated
    net proved reserves of approximately 22 MMbbls of liquid
    hydrocarbons and 297 Bcf of natural gas as of
    December 31, 2005. Eight gas processing plants (five
    operated and three non-operated), 112 miles of operated
    pipelines in the Neuquén basin and 2,200 square miles
    of three-dimensional

(3-D)

seismic data were also included in the transaction. Apache
    financed the purchase with cash on hand and commercial paper.

U.S. Gulf

In June 2006, the Company acquired the remaining producing
    properties of BP plc (BP) on the Outer Continental Shelf of the
    Gulf of Mexico. The original purchase price was reduced from
    $1.3 billion for 18 producing fields to $845 million
    because other interest owners exercised their preferential
    rights to purchase five of the 18 fields. The purchase price
    consisted of $747 million of proved property,
    $42 million of unproved property and $56 million of
    facilities. The settlement price on the date of closing of
    $821 million was adjusted primarily for revenues and
    expenditures occurring between the April 1, 2006 effective
    date and the closing date of the acquisition. The acquired
    properties include 13 producing fields (nine of which are
    operated) with estimated proved reserves of 19.5 MMbbls of
    liquid hydrocarbons and 148 Bcf of natural gas. Apache
    financed the purchase with cash on hand and commercial paper.

Divestitures

On January 6, 2006, the Company completed the sale of its
    55 percent interest in the deepwater section of
    Egypt’s West Mediterranean Concession to Amerada Hess for
    $413 million. Apache did not have any proved reserves
    booked for these properties.

On August 8, 2006, the Company completed the sale of its
    24.5 percent interest in the Zhao Dong block, offshore the
    People’s Republic of China, to Australia-based ROC Oil

HEDGING
    AND DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

The Company is exposed to fluctuations in crude oil and natural
    gas prices on the majority of its worldwide production.
    Management believes it is prudent to manage the variability in
    cash flows on a portion of its crude oil and natural gas
    production. The Company utilizes various types of derivative
    financial instruments to manage fluctuations in cash flows
    resulting from changes in commodity prices. Derivative
    instruments typically entered into by the Company and designated
    as cash flow hedges are swaps and options.

Commodity Derivative Activity in Accumulated Other

Based on market
    prices as of December 31, 2008, the Company’s net
    unrealized gain in accumulated OCI for commodity derivatives
    designated as cash flow hedges totaled $212 million
    ($138 million after tax). Gains and losses on these hedges
    will be realized in future earnings contemporaneously with the
    related sales of natural gas and crude oil production applicable
    to specific hedges, which will occur through mid-2013. Of the
    $212 million estimated unrealized gain on derivatives at

The majority of Apache’s asset retirement obligations (ARO)
    relate to plugging, abandonment and restoration of oil and gas
    properties. An abandonment liability is initially recorded in
    the period the related assets are placed in service, with an
    offsetting increase to properties and equipment. The liabilities
    incurred are recorded at fair value, and accretion expense is
    recognized over the life of the related assets, increasing the
    liability to its expected settlement value. Liabilities settled
    relate to individual properties plugged and abandoned or sold
    during the period and include the continued abandonment activity
    of platforms lost during Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Ike.
    Revisions in estimated liabilities during the period primarily
    related to escalating retirement costs, changes in property
    lives and the expected timing of settling asset retirement
    obligations.

All of the Company’s debt, excluding the PVG secured
    facility, is senior unsecured debt and has equal priority with
    respect to the payment of both principal and interest. The
    6.25%, 5.25%, 5.625%, 6.9% and both 6.0% notes are
    redeemable, as a whole or in part, at Apache’s option,
    subject to a make-whole premium. The remaining U.S. notes
    are not redeemable. Under certain conditions, the Company has
    the right to advance maturity on the 7.375% debentures and
    7.625% debentures.

The Company has $22 million of debt discounts as of
    December 31, 2008, which will be charged to interest
    expense over the life of the related debt issuances;
    $1.1 million, $1.0 million and $714,000 was recognized
    in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company had
    approximately $45 million and $33 million,
    respectively, of unamortized deferred loan costs associated with
    its various debt obligations. These costs are included in
    deferred charges and other in the accompanying consolidated
    balance sheet and are being charged to expense over the life of
    the related debt issuances.

The indentures for the notes described above place certain
    restrictions on the Company, including limits on Apache’s
    ability to incur debt secured by certain liens and its ability
    to enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions. Upon
    certain change in control, all of these debt instruments would
    be subject to mandatory repurchase, at the option of the
    holders. None of the indentures for the notes contain
    pre-payment obligations in the event of a decline in credit
    ratings.

Debt
    Issuances

On October 1, 2008, the Company issued $400 million
    principal amount, $398 million net of discount, of senior
    unsecured 6.0-percent notes maturing September 15, 2013,
    and $400 million principal amount, $398 million net of
    discount, of senior unsecured 6.9-percent notes maturing
    September 15, 2018. The notes are redeemable, as a whole or
    in part, at Apache’s option, subject to a make-whole
    premium. The proceeds are presently invested in
    U.S. Treasury Bills and will be used for general corporate
    purposes or, possible, future acquisitions when they mature.

Money
    Market and Overdraft Lines of Credit

The Company has certain uncommitted money market and overdraft
    lines of credit which are used from time to time for working
    capital purposes. As of December 31, 2008,
    $12.6 million was drawn on facilities in Argentina and
    nothing was drawn on U.S. facilities, compared with
    $76 million and $4 million in the prior year.

Commercial
    Paper Program

The Company has a $1.95 billion commercial paper program
    that enables Apache to borrow funds for up to 270 days at
    competitive interest rates. As of December 31, 2008, the
    Company had no outstanding commercial paper, compared to
    $135 million in the prior year. The commercial paper
    program is fully supported by available borrowing capacity under
    U.S. committed credit facilities, which expire in 2013.

Subsidiary
    Debt

The notes issued by Apache Finance Pty Limited (Apache Finance
    Australia) and Apache Finance Canada are irrevocably and
    unconditionally guaranteed by Apache and, in the case of Apache
    Finance Pty Limited, by Apache North America, Inc., an indirect
    wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. Under certain conditions
    related to changes in relevant tax laws, Apache Finance Pty
    Limited and Apache Finance Canada have the right to redeem the
    notes prior to maturity. The Apache Finance Canada
    4.375% notes may be redeemed at the Company’s option
    subject to a make-whole premium (see Note 15 —
    Supplemental Guarantor Information).

Credit
    Facilities

The company has $2.3 billion of unsecured revolving syndicated
    bank credit facilities which mature in May 2013. Since there
    were no outstanding borrowings or commercial paper at year-end,
    the full $2.3 billion of unsecured credit facilities were
    available to the Company. These facilities consist of a $1.5
    billion facility and a $450 million facility in the U.S., a $200
    million facility in Australia and a $150 million facility in
    Canada. The financial covenants of the credit facilities require
    the Company to maintain a debt-to-capitalization ratio of not
    greater than 60 percent at the end as any fiscal quarter. The
    negative covenants include restrictions on the Company’s
    ability to create liens and security interests on our assets,
    with exceptions for liens typically arising in the oil and gas
    industry, purchase money liens and liens arising as a matter of
    law, such as tax and mechanics’ liens.

NOTES TO

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The Company may incur liens on assets located in the U.S. and
    Canada of up to five percent of the Company’s consolidated
    assets, which approximated $1.5 billion as of December 31 ,
    2008. There are no restrictions on incurring liens in countries
    other than U.S. and Canada. There are also restrictions on
    Apache’s ability to merge with another entity, unless the
    Company is the surviving entity, and a restriction on our
    ability to guarantee debt of entities not within our
    consolidated group. Furthermore, our non-cash write-down of oil
    and gas properties in 2008 does not impact the availability of
    credit lines or result in non-compliance with any covenants.

There are no clauses in the facilities that permit the lenders
    to accelerate payments or refuse to lend based on unspecified
    material adverse changes (MAC clauses). The credit facility
    agreements do not have drawdown restrictions or prepayment
    obligations in the event of a decline in credit ratings.
    However, the agreements allow the lenders to accelerate payments
    and terminate lending commitments if Apache Corporation, or any
    of its U.S. or Canadian subsidiaries, defaults on any
    direct payment obligation in excess of $100 million or has
    any unpaid, non-appealable judgment against it in excess of
    $100 million. The Company was in compliance with the terms
    of the credit facilities as of December 31, 2008. The
    Company’s debt-to-capitalization ratio as of
    December 31, 2008 was 23 percent.

At the Company’s option, the interest rate for the
    facilities is based on (i) the greater of (a) the JP
    Morgan Chase Bank prime rate or (b) the federal funds rate
    plus one-half of one percent or (ii) the London Inter-bank
    Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a margin determined by the
    Company’s senior long-term debt rating. The
    $1.5 billion and the $450 million credit facilities
    (U.S. credit facilities) also allow the company to borrow
    under competitive auctions.

At December 31, 2008, the margin over LIBOR for committed
    loans was .19 percent on the $1.5 billion facility and
    .23 percent on the other three facilities. If the total
    amount of the loans borrowed under the $1.5 billion
    facility equals or exceeds 50 percent of the total facility
    commitments, then an additional .05 percent will be added
    to the margins over LIBOR. If the total amount of the loans
    borrowed under all of the other three facilities equals or
    exceeds 50 percent of the total facility commitments, then
    an additional .10 percent will be added to the margins over
    LIBOR. The Company also pays quarterly facility fees of
    .06 percent on the total amount of the $1.5 billion
    facility and .07 percent on the total amount of the other
    three facilities. The facility fees vary based upon the
    Company’s senior long-term debt rating. The
    U.S. credit facilities are used to support Apache’s
    commercial paper program.

On December 5, 2008, one of the Company’s Australian
    subsidiaries entered into a secured revolving syndicated credit
    facility for its Van Gogh and Pyrenees oil developments offshore
    Western Australia. The facility provides for total commitments
    of $350 million, with availability determined by a
    borrowing base formula. The borrowing base was set at
    $350 million and will be redetermined at project completion
    and semi-annually thereafter. The facility is secured by certain
    assets associated with the Van Gogh and Pyrenees oil
    developments, including the shares of stock of the
    Company’s subsidiary holding the assets. The Company has
    agreed to guarantee the credit facility until project completion
    occurs pursuant to terms of the facility, which is expected in
    2010. The commitments under the facility will be reduced by
    scheduled increments every six months beginning June 30,
    2010, with final maturity on March 31, 2014. Interest is
    based on LIBOR, which may be subject to change under certain
    market disruption conditions, plus a margin of 1.00 percent
    pre-completion and 1.75 percent post-completion. The
    pre-completion margin increases to 1.125 percent in the
    event the Company’s ratings are downgraded to BBB+ or below
    by at least two major rating agencies. As of December 31,
    2008 there was $100 million outstanding under the facility.

Credit
    Ratings

We receive debt ratings from the major credit rating agencies in
    the United States. Factors that may impact our credit ratings,
    include debt levels, planned asset-purchases or sales and
    near-term and long-term production growth opportunities.
    Liquidity, asset quality, cost structure, reserve mix and
    commodity pricing levels could also be considered by the rating
    agencies. Apache’s senior unsecured long-term debt is
    currently rated A3 by Moody’s, A- by Standard &
    Poor’s and A by Fitch. Apache’s short-term debt rating
    for its commercial paper program is currently

F-20

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

P-2 by Moody’s, A-2 by Standard & Poor’s and F1
    by Fitch. The outlook is stable from Moody’s and Standard
    & Poor’s and negative from Fitch. A ratings downgrade
    could adversely impact our ability to access debt markets in the
    future, increase the cost of future debt and potentially require
    the Company to post letters of credit in certain circumstances.
    We cannot predict, nor can we assure, that we will not receive a
    ratings downgrade in the future.

The Company has not recorded U.S. deferred income taxes on
    the undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries as
    management intends to permanently reinvest such earnings. As of
    December 31, 2008, the undistributed earnings of the
    foreign subsidiaries amounted to approximately
    $14.3 billion. Upon distribution of these earnings in the
    form of dividends or otherwise, the Company may be subject to
    U.S. income taxes and foreign withholding taxes. It is not
    practical, however, to estimate the amount of taxes that may be
    payable on the eventual remittance of these earnings after
    consideration of available foreign tax credits. Presently,
    limited foreign tax credits are available to reduce the
    U.S. taxes on such amounts if repatriated.

On December 31, 2008, the Company had state net operating
    loss carryforwards of $280 million and foreign net
    operating loss carryforwards of $4 million in Canada,
    $25 million in Argentina and $342 million in
    Australia. The Company also had $121 million of capital
    loss carryforwards in Canada. The state net operating losses
    will expire over the next 20 years if they are not
    otherwise utilized. The foreign net operating loss in Canada
    will begin to expire in 2014, the Argentina net operating loss
    will begin to expire in 2009, and the Australia net operating
    loss has an indefinite carryover period. The capital loss in
    Canada also has an indefinite carryover period.

The tax benefits of carryforwards are recorded as assets to the
    extent that management assesses the utilization of such
    carryforwards to be “more likely than not.” When the
    future utilization of some portion of the carryforwards is
    determined not to be “more likely than not,” a
    valuation allowance is provided to reduce the recorded tax
    benefits from such assets. The Company does not believe the
    utilization of the Canadian capital losses to be “more
    likely than not.” Accordingly, a valuation allowance was
    provided to reduce the tax benefit from this deferred tax asset.

Apache adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 48

    Taxes” as of January 1, 2007. FIN 48 clarifies
    the accounting for income taxes by prescribing a minimum
    recognition threshold a tax position must meet before being
    recognized in the financial statements. A reconciliation of the
    beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as

Included in the balance at December 31, 2008, are
    $37 million of tax positions for which the ultimate
    deductibility is highly certain, but for which there is
    uncertainty about the timing of such deductibility. Because of
    the impact of deferred tax accounting, other than penalties and
    interest, the disallowance of the shorter deductibility period
    would not affect the annual effective income tax rate but would
    accelerate the payment of cash to the taxing authority to an
    earlier period.

The Company records interest and penalties related to
    unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. During the
    years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, the Company
    recorded approximately $42 million, $43 million and
    $26 million, respectively, in interest and penalties. The
    Company had approximately $42 million and $128 million
    for the payment of interest and penalties accrued as of
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

During 2008, we settled tax audits in various jurisdictions.
    These settlements resulted in a $190 million reduction of
    previously recorded FIN 48 liabilities and associated
    interest.

The Company is in Administrative Appeals with the Internal
    Revenue Service (IRS) regarding the 2004 and 2005 tax years and
    under IRS Audit for the 2006 and 2007 tax years. Resolution of
    either of the above, which may occur in 2009, could result in a
    significant change to the balance of the FIN 48 reserve.
    However, the resolution of unagreed tax issues in the
    Company’s open tax years cannot be predicted with absolute
    certainty and differences between what has been recorded and the
    eventual outcomes may occur. Due to this uncertainty and the
    uncertain timing of the final resolution of the Appeals process
    and the 2006 and 2007 audits, an accurate estimate of the range
    of outcomes occurring during the next 12 months cannot be
    made at this time. Nevertheless, the Company believes that it
    has adequately provided for income taxes and any related
    interest and penalties for all open tax years.

Apache and its subsidiaries are subject to U.S. federal
    income tax as well as income tax in various states and foreign
    jurisdictions. While during 2008, the Company settled tax audits
    in various jurisdictions, our uncertain tax positions are
    related to tax years that may be subject to examination by the
    relevant taxing authority. The Company’s earliest open tax
    years in its key jurisdictions are as follows:

    Directors authorized the purchase of up to 15 million
    shares of the Company’s common stock, representing a market
    value of approximately $1 billion on the date of the
    announcement. The Company may buy shares from time to time on
    the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, or a
    combination of both. The timing and amounts of any purchases
    will be at the discretion of Apache’s management. The
    Company initiated the purchase program on May 1, 2006,
    after the Company’s first-quarter earnings information was
    disseminated in the market. During 2006, the Company purchased
    2,500,000 shares at an average price of $69.74 per share.
    No stock purchases were made in 2007 or 2008. Currently, the

For 2008, 2007 and 2006, stock-based compensation expensed was
    $52 million, $73 million and $35 million
    ($34 million, $47 million and $23 million
    after-tax), respectively. Costs related to the plans are
    capitalized or expensed based on the nature of the
    employee’s activities. A description of the Company’s

Stock
    Options

As of December 31, 2008, officers and employees held
    options to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock
    under one or more of the employee stock option plans adopted in
    1995, 1998, 2000, and 2005 (collectively, the Stock Option
    Plans), and under the 2007 Plan discussed above. New shares of
    Company stock will be issued for employee option exercises;
    however, under the 2000 Stock Option Plan, shares of treasury
    stock are used for employee option exercises to the extent
    treasury stock is held. Under the Stock Option Plans and the
    2007 Plan, the exercise price of each option equals the closing
    price of Apache’s common stock on the date of grant.
    Options generally become exercisable ratably over a four-year
    period and expire 10 years after granted. All of these
    plans allow for accelerated vesting if there is a change in
    control (as defined in each plan). The 2007 Plan and all of the
    Stock Option Plans, except for the 2000 Stock Option Plan, were
    submitted to and approved by the Company’s stockholders.

On October 31, 1996, the Company also established the 1996
    Performance Stock Option Plan (the Performance Plan) for
    substantially all full-time employees, excluding officers and
    certain other key employees. As of December 31, 2008, all
    options granted under the Performance Plan had been exercised or
    cancelled.

As of December 31, 2008, the weighted average remaining
    contractual life for options outstanding, expected to vest, and
    exercisable is 6.8 years, 8.0 years and
    5.5 years, respectively. The aggregate intrinsic value of
    options outstanding, expected to vest and exercisable at
    year-end was $78 million, $8 million and
    $70 million, respectively.

The fair value of each stock option award is estimated on the
    date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
    Assumptions used in the valuation are disclosed in the following
    table. Expected volatilities are based on implied volatilities
    of traded options on the Company’s common stock, historical
    volatility of the Company’s common stock and other factors.
    The expected dividend yield is based on historical yields on the
    date of grant. The expected term of stock options granted
    represents the period of time that the stock options are
    expected to be outstanding and is derived from historical
    exercise behavior, current trends and values derived from
    lattice-based models. The risk-free rate is based on the
    U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.

The intrinsic value of options exercised during 2008 was
    approximately $100 million, and the Company realized an
    additional tax benefit of approximately $28 million for the
    amount of intrinsic value in excess of compensation cost
    recognized. As of December 31, 2008, the total compensation
    cost related to non-vested options not yet recognized was
    $56 million, which will be recognized over the remaining
    vesting period of the options.

Stock
    Appreciation Rights

In 2003 and 2004, the Company issued a total of 1,802,210 and
    1,328,400, respectively, of stock appreciation rights (SARs) to
    non-executive employees in lieu of stock options. The SARs vest
    ratably over four years and will be settled in cash upon
    exercise throughout their

10-year

life. The weighted-average exercise price was $42.68 and $28.78
    for those issued in 2004 and 2003, respectively. The number of
    SARs outstanding and exercisable as of December 31, 2008
    was 907,589. The Company records compensation expense on the
    vested SARs outstanding

based on the fair value of the SARs at the end of each period
    because SARs are cash-settled. As of year-end, the
    weighted-average fair value of SARs outstanding was $41.73 based
    on the Black-Scholes valuation methodology using assumptions
    comparable to those discussed above. During 2008, 404,685 SARs
    were exercised and approximately 1,325 were forfeited. The
    aggregate of cash payments made to settle SARs exercised in 2008
    was $36 million.

Restricted
    Stock and Restricted Stock Units

The Company has restricted stock and restricted stock unit
    plans, including those awarded from the 2007 Plan, that are for
    all executive officers and certain other key employees. The
    plans have been approved by Apache’s Board of Directors.
    The Company awarded 806,396, 399,500 and 149,500 restricted
    stock units at a per share market price of $135.46, $77.31 and
    $71.52 in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The value of the
    stock issued was established by the market price on the date of
    grant and is being recorded as compensation expense ratably over
    the four-year vesting terms. During 2008, 2007 and 2006,
    $21.3 million ($13.7 million after tax),
    $8.2 million ($5.3 million after tax) and
    $6.1 million ($3.9 million after tax), respectively,
    was charged to expense as shares vested. In 2008 and 2007,
    $5.9 million and $1.0 million was capitalized,
    respectively. There were no amounts capitalized in 2006. As of
    December 31, 2008, there was $103 million of total
    unrecognized compensation cost related to approximately
    1,163,372 unvested shares. The weighted-average remaining life
    of unvested shares is approximately 3.1 years.

On May 7, 2008, the Stock Option Plan Committee of
    Apache’s Board of Directors awarded its Chief Executive
    Officer 250,000 restricted stock units, 50,000 of which will
    vest on July 1, 2009. The remaining 200,000 shares
    will vest ratably on the first business day of the years 2010,
    2011, 2012 and 2013. Upon vesting, the Company will issue one
    share of the Company’s common stock as settlement for each
    restricted stock unit. Thirty thousand of the shares vesting
    each year will not be eligible for sale by the executive until
    such time as he retires or otherwise terminates employment with
    the Company. This award was made under the terms of the
    Company’s 2007 Omnibus Equity Compensation Plan.

In August 2008, the Company established, pursuant to the
    Company’s 2007 Omnibus Equity Compensation Plan, the
    Non-Employee Directors’ Restricted Stock Units Program (the
    RSU Program). Each non-employee director was awarded 1,500
    restricted stock units on August 14, 2008 under the RSU
    Program, with half of the restricted stock units vesting thirty
    days after the grant and the other half vesting on the one-year
    anniversary date of the grant. Each year, all non-employee
    directors will be eligible to receive grants of restricted stock
    units comparable in value to the 2008 grant. Non-employee
    directors are required to choose, at the time of each award,
    whether such award will vest as 100 percent common stock or
    a combination of 40 percent cash and 60 percent common
    stock.

Subsequent
    Event

The Company appointed Roger B. Plank to President, John A. Crum
    to Co-chief Operating Officer and President — North
    America, and Rodney J. Eichler to Co-chief Operating Officer and
    President — International effective February 12,
    2009. On the same date, the Company awarded each of them 62,500
    restricted stock units pursuant to Apache’s 2007 Omnibus
    Equity Compensation Plan. 12,500 of such restricted stock units
    will vest on each of April 1, 2010, February 12, 2011,
    February 12, 2012, February 11, 2013 and
    February 11, 2014. Upon

vesting, Apache will issue one share of Apache’s common
    stock as settlement for each restricted stock unit. 7,500 of the
    shares vesting each year for each recipient will be subject to
    the restriction that none of such 7,500 shares will be
    eligible for sale by the recipient until such time as he retires
    or otherwise terminates employment with Apache.

Share
    Appreciation Plans

The Company utilizes share appreciation plans from time to time
    to provide incentives for substantially all full-time employees
    and officers to increase Apache’s share price within a
    stated measurement period. To achieve the payout, the
    Company’s stock price must close at or above a stated
    threshold for 10 out of any 30 consecutive trading days before
    the end of the stated period. Awards under the plans are payable
    in equal annual installments as specified by each plan,
    beginning on a date not more than 30 days after a threshold
    is attained for the required measurement period and on
    succeeding anniversaries of the attainment date. Shares issued
    to employees would be reduced by the required minimum tax
    withholding. Shares of Apache common stock contingently issuable
    under the plans are excluded from the computation of income per
    common share until the stated goals are met as described below.

Since 2000, three share appreciation plans have been approved. A
    summary of these plans is as follows:

•

On May 7, 2008, the Stock Option Plan Committee of the
    Company’s Board of Directors, pursuant to the
    Company’s 2007 Omnibus Equity Compensation Plan, approved
    the 2008 Share Appreciation Program with a target to
    increase Apache’s share price to $216 by the end of 2012,
    with an interim goal of $162 to be achieved by the end of 2010.
    Any awards under the plan would be payable in five equal annual
    installments. As of December 31, 2008, neither share price
    threshold had been met.

•

On May 5, 2005, the Company’s stockholders approved
    the 2005 Share Appreciation Plan with a target to increase
    Apache’s share price to $108 by the end of 2008, with an
    interim goal of $81 to be achieved by the end of 2007. Awards
    under the plan are payable in four equal annual installments to
    eligible employees remaining with the Company. Apache’s
    share price exceeded the interim $81 threshold for the

10-day

requirement as of June 14, 2007, and the first and second
    installments were awarded in July of 2007 and 2008.
    Apache’s share price exceeded the $108 threshold for the

10-day

requirement as of February 29, 2008, and the first
    installment was awarded in March of 2008.

•

In October 2000, the Company adopted the 2000 Share
    Appreciation Plan with goals to reach share price targets of
    $43.29, $51.95 and $77.92 prior to January 1, 2005. Any
    awards under the plan would be payable in three equal annual
    installments. The share price targets of $43.29 and $51.95 were
    met in 2004, and 3.2 million shares of common stock were
    issued to employees in equal installments in 2004, 2005 and
    2006. The third share price target of $77.92 was not met and the
    related grants were cancelled as of December 31, 2004.

Current accounting practices dictate that, regardless of whether
    these thresholds are ultimately achieved, the Company will
    recognize, over time, the fair value cost determined at the
    grant date based on numerous assumptions, including an estimate
    of the likelihood that Apache’s stock price will achieve
    these thresholds and the expected forfeiture rate. Over the
    expected service life of each program, the Company will
    recognize total expense and capitalized costs of approximately
    $197 million through 2014 and $82 million through 2011
    for the 2008 Share Appreciation Program and the
    2005 Share Appreciation Plan, respectively. A summary of

Preferred
    Stock

The Company has five million shares of no par preferred stock
    authorized, of which 25,000 shares have been designated as
    Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock (the
    Series A Preferred Stock) and 100,000 shares have been
    designated as the 5.68 percent Series B
    Cumulative Preferred Stock (the Series B Preferred Stock).

Series A
    Preferred Stock

In December 1995, the Company declared a dividend of one right
    (a Right) for each 2.31 shares (adjusted for subsequent
    stock dividends and a two-for-one stock split) of Apache common
    stock outstanding on January 31, 1996. Each full Right
    entitles the registered holder to purchase from the Company one
    ten-thousandth (1/10,000) of a share of Series A Preferred
    Stock at a price of $100 per one ten-thousandth of a share,
    subject to adjustment. The Rights are exercisable 10 calendar
    days following a public announcement that certain persons or
    groups have acquired 20 percent or more of the outstanding
    shares of Apache common stock or 10 business days following
    commencement of an offer for 30 percent or more of the
    outstanding shares of Apache’s outstanding common stock
    (flip in event); each Right will become exercisable for shares
    of Apache’s common stock at 50 percent of the
    then-market price of the common stock. If a 20 percent
    shareholder of Apache acquires Apache, by merger or otherwise,
    in a transaction where Apache does not survive or in which
    Apache’s common stock is changed or exchanged (flip over
    event), the Rights become exercisable for shares of the common
    stock of the Company acquiring Apache at 50 percent of the
    then-market price for Apache common stock. Any Rights that are
    or were beneficially owned by a person who has acquired
    20 percent or more of the outstanding shares of Apache
    common stock and who engages in certain transactions or realizes
    the benefits of certain transactions with the Company will
    become void. If an offer to acquire all of the Company’s
    outstanding shares of common stock is determined to be fair by
    Apache’s board of directors, the transaction will not
    trigger a flip in event or a flip-over event. The Company may
    also redeem the Rights at $.01 per Right at any time until 10
    business days after public announcement of a flip in event.
    These rights

F-31


APACHE
    CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

were originally scheduled to expire on January 31, 2006.
    Effective as of that date, the Rights were reset to one right
    per share of common stock and the expiration was extended to
    January 31, 2016. Unless the Rights have been previously
    redeemed, all shares of Apache common stock issued by the
    Company after January 31, 1996 will include Rights. Unless
    and until the Rights become exercisable, they will be
    transferred with and only with the shares of Apache common stock.

Series B
    Preferred Stock

In August 1998, Apache issued 100,000 shares
    ($100 million) of Series B Preferred Stock in the form
    of one million depositary shares, each representing one-tenth
    (1/10) of a share of Series B Preferred Stock, for net
    proceeds of $98 million. The Series B Preferred Stock
    has no stated maturity, is not subject to a sinking fund and is
    not convertible into Apache common stock or any other securities
    of the Company. Apache has the option to redeem the
    Series B Preferred Stock at $1,000 per preferred share on
    or after August 25, 2008. Holders of the shares are
    entitled to receive cumulative cash dividends at an annual rate
    of $5.68 per depositary share when, and if, declared by
    Apache’s Board of Directors. During 2008, 2007 and 2006,
    the Company paid $5.7 million of dividends in its
    Series B Preferred Stock. In the event of a liquidation of
    the Company, the holders of the shares will be entitled to
    receive liquidating distributions in the amount of $1,000 per
    preferred share plus any accrued or unpaid dividends before any
    distributions are made on the Company’s common stock.

The fair value of the notes and debentures is based upon an
    estimate provided to the Company by an independent investment
    banking firm. The carrying amount of the commercial paper and
    money market lines of credit approximated fair value because the
    interest rates are variable and reflective of market rates. The
    Company’s trade receivables, trade payables and short-term
    investments are by their very nature short-term. The carrying
    values included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet
    approximate fair value at December 31, 2008 and 2007.

COMMITMENTS
    AND CONTINGENCIES

Apache is party to various legal actions arising in the ordinary
    course of business including litigation and governmental and
    regulatory controls. The Company has an accrued liability of
    approximately $25 million for all legal contingencies that
    are deemed to be probable of occurring and can be reasonably
    estimated. Apache’s estimates are based on information
    known about the matters and its experience in contesting,
    litigating and settling similar matters. Although actual amounts
    could differ from management’s estimate, none of the
    actions are believed by management to involve future amounts
    that would be material to Apache’s financial position or
    results of operations after consideration of recorded accruals.
    It is management’s opinion that the loss for any other
    litigation matters and claims that are reasonably possible to
    occur will not have a material adverse affect on the
    Company’s financial position or results of operations.

Legal
    Matters

Grynberg

In 1997, Jack J. Grynberg began filing lawsuits against other
    natural gas producers, gatherers, and pipelines claiming that
    the defendants have under paid royalty to the federal government
    and Indian tribes by mis-measurement of the volume and heating
    content of natural gas and are responsible for acts of others
    who

mis-measured

natural gas. In 2005, Grynberg filed suit against Apache making
    the same claims he had made previously against others in the
    industry. With the addition of Apache, there are more than 300
    defendants to these actions. The Grynberg lawsuits were
    consolidated through a federal Multi-District Litigation
    (MDL) action located in Wyoming federal court for discovery
    and pre-trial purposes. Although Grynberg purports to be acting
    on behalf of the government, the federal government has declined
    to join in the cases. While an adverse judgment against Apache
    is possible, Apache does not believe the plaintiff’s claims
    have merit and plans to vigorously pursue its defenses against
    these claims. Exposure related to this lawsuit is not currently
    determinable. Apache and other defendants in the MDL filed
    motions to dismiss based upon Grynberg’s failure to prove
    statutory requirements for maintaining qui tam lawsuits. On
    October 20, 2006, the multi-district Judge ruled in favor
    of Apache and other defendants on these motions to dismiss,
    dismissing Grynberg’s lawsuits against Apache and others.
    Grynberg has appealed the ruling.

Argentine
    Environmental Claims

In connection with the Pioneer acquisition in 2006, the Company
    acquired a subsidiary of Pioneer in Argentina (PNRA) that is
    involved in various administrative proceedings with
    environmental authorities in the Neuquén Province relating
    to permits for and discharges from operations in that province.
    In addition, PNRA was named in a suit initiated against oil
    companies operating in the Neuquén basin entitled

Asociación de Superficiarios de la Patagonia v YPF S.A.,
    et. al.,

originally filed on August 21, 2003, in the
    Argentine National Supreme Court of Justice. The plaintiffs, a
    private group of landowners, have also named the national
    government and several provinces as third parties. The lawsuit
    alleges injury to the environment generally by the oil and gas
    industry. The plaintiffs principally seek from all defendants,
    jointly, (i) the remediation of contaminated sites, of the
    superficial and underground waters, and of soil that allegedly
    was degraded as a result of deforestation, (ii) if the
    remediation is not possible, payment of an indemnification for
    the material and moral damages claimed from defendants operating
    in the Neuquén basin, of which PNRA is a small portion,
    (iii) adoption of all the necessary measures to prevent
    future environmental damages, and (iv) the creation of a
    private restoration fund to provide coverage for remediation of
    potential future environmental damages. Much of the alleged
    damage relates to operations by the Argentine state oil company,
    which conducted oil and gas operations throughout Argentina
    prior to its privatization, which began in 1990. While the
    plaintiffs will seek to make all oil and gas companies operating
    in the Neuquén basin jointly liable for each others’
    actions, PNRA will defend on an individual basis and attempt to
    require the plaintiffs to delineate damages by company. PNRA
    intends to defend itself vigorously in the case. It is not
    certain exactly how or what the court will do in this matter as
    it is the first of its kind. While it is possible PNRA may incur
    liabilities related to the environmental claims, no reasonable
    prediction can be made as PNRA’s exposure related to this
    lawsuit is not currently determinable.

Louisiana
    Restoration

Numerous surface owners have filed claims or sent demand letters
    to various oil and gas companies, including Apache, claiming
    that, under either expressed or implied lease terms or Louisiana
    law, they are liable for damage measured by the cost of
    restoration of leased premises to their original condition as
    well as damages from contamination and cleanup. Many of these
    lawsuits claim small amounts, while others assert claims in
    excess of a million dollars. Also, some lawsuits or claims are
    being settled or resolved, while others are still being filed.
    Any exposure, therefore, related to these lawsuits and claims is
    not currently determinable. While an adverse judgment against
    Apache is possible, Apache intends to actively defend the cases.

Australia
    Gas Pipeline Force Majeure

The Company subsidiaries reported a pipeline explosion that
    interrupted deliveries of natural gas to customers under various
    long-term contracts. Company subsidiaries believe that the event
    was a force majeure and as a result, the subsidiaries and their
    joint venture participants have declared force majeure under
    those contracts. Although no litigation has been filed other
    than pre-action discovery proceedings by a single customer, a
    few customers have threatened to file suit challenging the
    declaration of force majeure under their contracts. Contract
    prices under their contracts are significantly below current
    spot prices for natural gas in Australia. In the event it is
    determined that the pipeline explosion was not a force majeure,
    Company subsidiaries believe that liquidated damages should be
    the extent of the damages under those long-term contracts with
    such provisions. Approximately 90 percent of the natural
    gas volumes were sold by Company subsidiaries under long-term
    contracts that have liquidated damages provisions. Contractual
    liquidated damages under the long-term contracts with such
    provisions would not be expected to exceed $200 million
    AUD. No assurance can be given that customers would not assert
    claims in excess of contractual liquidated damages and exposure
    related to such claims is not currently determinable. While an
    adverse judgment against Company subsidiaries is possible if
    litigation is filed, Company subsidiaries do not believe any
    such claims would have merit and plan to vigorously pursue their
    defenses against any such claims.

In December 2008, the Senate Economics Committee of the
    Parliament of Australia released its findings from public
    hearings concerning the economic impact of the gas shortage
    following the explosion on Varanus Island and the
    government’s response. The Committee concluded, among other
    things, that the macroeconomic impact to Western Australia will
    never be precisely known, but cited to a range of estimates from
    $300 million AUD to $2.5 billion AUD consisting in
    part of losses alleged by some parties who have long-term
    contracts with Company subsidiaries (as described above), but
    also losses alleged by third parties who do not have contracts
    with Company subsidiaries (but who may have purchased gas that
    was re-sold by customers or who may have paid more for energy
    following the explosion or who lost wages or sales due to the
    inability to obtain energy or the increased price of energy). A
    timber industry group, whose members do not have a contract with
    Company subsidiaries, has announced that it intends to seek
    compensation for its members and their subcontractors from
    Company subsidiaries for $20 million AUD in losses
    allegedly incurred as a result of the gas supply shortage
    following the explosion. In

Johnson Tiles Pty Ltd v.
    Esso Australia Pty Ltd

[2003] VSC 27 (Supreme Court of
    Victoria, Gillard J presiding), which concerned a 1998 explosion
    at an Esso natural gas processing plant at Longford in East
    Gippsland, Victoria, the Court held that Esso was not liable for
    $1.3 billion AUD of pure economic losses suffered by
    claimants that had no contract with Esso, but was liable to such
    claimants for reasonably foreseeable property damage which Esso
    settled for $32.5 million plus costs. In reaching this
    decision the Court held that third-party claimants should have
    protected themselves from pure economic losses, through the
    purchase of insurance or the installation of adequate backup
    measures, in case of an interruption in their gas supply from
    Esso. While an adverse judgment against Company subsidiaries is
    possible if litigation is filed, Company subsidiaries do not
    believe any such claims would have merit and plan to vigorously
    pursue their defenses against any such claims. Exposure related
    to any such potential claims is not currently determinable.

On October 10, 2008, the Australia National Offshore
    Petroleum Safety Authority (NOPSA) released a self-titled
    “Final Report” of the findings of its investigation
    into the pipeline explosion, prepared at the request of the
    Western Australian Department of Industry and Resources (DoIR).
    NOPSA concluded in its report that the evidence gathered to date
    indicates that the main causal factors in the incident were:
    (1) ineffective anti-corrosion coating at the beach
    crossing section of the 12” sales gas pipeline, due to
    damage

and/or

dis-bondment from the pipeline; (2) ineffective cathodic
    protection of the wet-dry transition zone of the beach crossing
    section of the 12” sales gas pipeline; and
    (3) ineffective inspection and monitoring by Company
    subsidiaries of the beach crossing and shallow water section of
    the 12” sales gas pipeline. NOPSA further concluded that
    the investigation identified that Apache Northwest Pty Ltd and
    its co-licensees may have committed offences under the Petroleum
    Pipelines Act 1969, Sections 36A & 38(b) and the
    Petroleum Pipelines Regulations 1970, Regulation 10, and
    that some findings may also constitute non-compliance with
    pipeline license conditions. NOPSA states in its report that an
    application for renewal of the pipeline license covering the
    area of the Varanus Island facility was granted in May 1985 with

F-35


APACHE
    CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

21 years validity, and an application for renewal of the
    license was submitted to DoIR by Company subsidiaries in
    December 2005 and remains pending.

Company subsidiaries disagree with NOPSA’s conclusions and
    believe that the NOPSA report is premature, based on an
    incomplete investigation and misleading. In a July 17, 2008
    media statement, DoIR acknowledged, “The pipelines and
    Varanus Island facilities have been the subject of an
    independent validation report [by Lloyd’s Register] which
    was received in August 2007. NOPSA has also undertaken a number
    of inspections between 2005 and the present.” These and
    numerous other inspections, audits and reviews conducted by top
    international consultants and regulators did not identify any
    warnings that the pipeline had a corrosion problem or other
    issues that could lead to its failure. Company subsidiaries
    believe that the explosion was not reasonably foreseeable, and
    was not within the reasonable control of Company’s
    subsidiaries or able to be reasonably prevented by Company
    subsidiaries, and will work thoroughly and methodically to
    determine the root cause of the explosion.

On January 9, 2009, the governments of Western Australia
    and the Commonwealth of Australia announced a joint inquiry to
    consider the effectiveness of the regulatory regime for
    occupational health and safety and integrity that applied to
    operations and facilities at Varanus Island and the role of
    DoIR, NOPSA and the Western Australian Department of Consumer
    and Employment Protection (DoCEP).

Environmental
    Matters

The Company, as an owner or lessee and operator of oil and gas
    properties, is subject to various federal, provincial, state,
    local and foreign country laws and regulations relating to
    discharge of materials into, and protection of, the environment.
    These laws and regulations may, among other things, impose
    liability on the lessee under an oil and gas lease for the cost
    of pollution

clean-up

resulting from operations and subject to the lessee to liability
    for pollution damages. In some instances, the Company may be
    directed to suspend or cease operations in the affected area. We
    maintain insurance coverage, which we believe is customary in
    the industry, although we are not fully insured against all
    environmental risks.

Apache manages its exposure to environmental liabilities on
    properties to be acquired by identifying existing problems and
    assessing the potential liability. The Company also conducts
    periodic reviews, on a Company-wide basis, to identify changes
    in its environmental risk profile. These reviews evaluate
    whether there is a probable liability, the amount, and the
    likelihood that the liability will be incurred. The amount of
    any potential liability is determined by considering, among
    other matters, incremental direct costs of any likely
    remediation and the proportionate cost of employees who are
    expected to devote a significant amount of time directly to any
    possible remediation effort. As it relates to evaluations of
    purchased properties, depending on the extent of an identified
    environmental problem, the Company may exclude a property from
    the acquisition, require the seller to remediate the property to
    Apache’s satisfaction, or agree to assume liability for the
    remediation of the property. The Company’s general policy
    is to limit any reserve additions to any incidents or sites that
    are considered probable to result in an expected remediation
    cost exceeding $300,000. Any environmental costs and liabilities
    that are not reserved for are treated as an expense when
    actually incurred. In our estimation, neither these expenses nor
    expenses related to training and compliance programs are likely
    to have a material impact on our financial condition. As of
    December 31, 2008, the Company had an undiscounted reserve
    for environmental remediation of approximately $27 million.
    Apache is not aware of any environmental claims existing as of
    December 31, 2008, which have not been provided for or
    would otherwise have a material impact on its financial position
    or results of operations. There can be no assurance however,
    that current regulatory requirements will not change or past
    non-compliance with environmental laws will not be discovered on
    the Company’s properties.

Retirement
    and Deferred Compensation Plans

Apache Corporation provides retirement benefits to its
    U.S. employees through the use of three types of plans: an
    IRC 401(k); a money purchase pension plan and a restorative
    non-qualified retirement savings plan. The 401(k) savings plan
    provides participating employees the ability to elect to
    contribute up to 50 percent of eligible

F-36


APACHE
    CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

compensation to the plan with the Company making matching
    contributions up to a maximum of six percent of each
    employee’s annual covered compensation. In addition, the
    Company annually contributes six percent of each participating
    employee’s compensation, as defined, to a money purchase
    retirement plan. The 401(k) plan and the money purchase
    retirement plan are subject to certain annually-adjusted,
    government-mandated restrictions that limit the amount of
    employee and Company contributions. For certain eligible
    employees, the Company also provides a non-qualified
    retirement/savings plan that allows the deferral of up to
    50 percent of each employee’s salary and that accepts
    employee contributions and the Company’s matching
    contributions in excess of the government mandated limitations
    imposed in the 401(k) savings plan and money purchase retirement
    plan.

Vesting in the Company’s contributions in the 401(k)
    savings plan, the money purchase retirement plan and the
    non-qualified retirement/savings plan occurs at the rate of
    20 percent for every full-year of employment. Upon a change
    in control of ownership, immediate and full vesting occurs.

Additionally, Apache Energy Limited, Apache Canada Ltd. and
    Apache North Sea Limited maintain separate retirement plans, as
    required under the laws of Australia, Canada and the United
    Kingdom, respectively. Total annual cost under the retirement
    plans were $52 million, $59 million and
    $41 million for 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

Apache also provides a funded noncontributory defined benefit
    pension plan (U.K. Pension Plan) covering certain employees of
    the Company’s North Sea operations. The plan provides
    defined pension benefits based on years of service and final
    average salary. The plan is closed to newly hired employees.

Additionally, the Company offers postretirement medical benefits
    to U.S. employees who meet certain eligibility
    requirements. Covered participants receive medical benefits up
    until the age of 65 provided the participant remits the required
    portion of the cost of coverage. The plan is contributory with
    participants’ contributions adjusted annually. The
    postretirement benefit plan does not cover benefit expenses once
    a covered participant becomes eligible for Medicare.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Included in the table above are leases for buildings, facilities
    and related equipment with varying expiration dates through
    2035. Net rental expense was $38 million, $31 million
    and $23 million for 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

Subsequent
    Event

On February 10, 2009, Apache’s wholly-owned
    subsidiary, Apache Canada Ltd. entered into an agreement with
    TransCanada Pipelines Limited (TCPL) pursuant to which TCPL will
    construct and install a gas pipeline from north eastern British
    Columbia to the existing NOVA pipeline system located in the
    Ekwan area of Alberta. Apache Canada intends to ship gas
    produced from the Ootla basin on the new pipeline.

The construction, operation and transportation rates of the new
    pipeline are subject to regulatory approval. Authority to
    construct the pipeline is expected, and construction is
    anticipated to be complete on or before April 1, 2011. Upon
    completion of the pipeline, Apache Canada will have a
    ship-or-pay commitment of 100 MMBtu of gas for either a
    four-year period or a ten-year period depending on the rate
    structure determined and approved by the regulatory agency.
    Apache Canada has the right to terminate the agreement before
    October 1, 2009. If Apache Canada elects to terminate the
    agreement or TCPL terminates for reasons set forth in the
    agreement, Apache Canada must reimburse TCPL for certain
    costs and expenses up to CDN $90 million plus certain taxes.

FAIR
    VALUE

Fair
    Value Measurement

The Company adopted SFAS No. 157, “Fair Value
    Measurements,” as of the beginning of 2008.
    SFAS No. 157 defines fair value and establishes
    disclosure requirements for assets and liabilities presented at
    fair value on the consolidated balance sheet. Fair value is the
    amount that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid
    for the transfer of a liability in an orderly transaction
    between market participants. A liability is quantified at the
    price it would take to transfer the liability to a new obligor,
    not at the amount that would be paid to settle the liability
    with the creditor.

To better quantify fair value, SFAS No. 157
    establishes a three-level hierarchy, prioritizing and defining
    the types of inputs used to measure fair value. Level 1
    inputs consist of unadjusted quoted prices for identical
    instruments in active markets. Level 2 inputs consist of
    quoted prices for similar instruments. Level 3 valuations
    are derived from inputs which are significant and unobservable
    and have the lowest priority.

The following table presents the Company’s material assets
    and liabilities measured at fair value for each hierarchy level
    as of December 31, 2008:

Derivative instruments are valued using forward commodity price
    curves provided by reputable third-party brokers. The fair value
    of derivative instruments are not actively quoted in the open
    markets and are valued using Level 2 inputs.

MAJOR
    CUSTOMERS

In 2008, purchases by Shell accounted for 17 percent of the
    Company’s oil and gas production revenues.

In 2007, purchases by Shell accounted for 12 percent of the
    Company’s oil and gas production revenues.

In 2006, purchases by BP accounted for 20 percent of the
    Company’s oil and gas production revenues.

Concentration
    of Credit Risk

We have experienced a decline in the timeliness of receipts from
    the Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation (EGPC) for our
    Egyptian oil and gas sales in the second half of 2008. We
    continue to collect on these receivables, albeit late, and there
    is no indication that we will not be able to collect the balance
    of our receivables from this customer.

BUSINESS
    SEGMENT INFORMATION

    States (Gulf Coast and Central Regions), Canada, Egypt,
    Australia, offshore the United Kingdom (U.K.) in the North Sea
    and Argentina. Early in the second quarter of 2008, we finalized
    contracts for two exploration blocks in Chile (reflected under
    “Other International”).

Oil and
    Gas Reserve Information

The estimate of reserves disclosed in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

are prepared by the Company’s internal staff and the
    Company is responsible for the adequacy and accuracy of those
    estimates. However, we engage Ryder Scott Company, L.P.
    Petroleum Consultants (Ryder Scott) to review our processes and
    the reasonableness of our estimates of proved hydrocarbon liquid
    and gas reserves. We selected the properties for review by Ryder
    Scott. These properties represented all material fields,
    approximately 90 percent of international properties and
    over 80 percent of each country’s reserve value for
    new wells drilled during the year. During 2008, 2007 and 2006,
    Ryder Scott’s review covered 82, 77 and 75 percent of
    the Company’s worldwide estimated reserves value,
    respectively.

Ryder Scott opined that the overall proved reserves for the
    reviewed properties as estimated by the Company are, in the
    aggregate, reasonable, prepared in accordance with generally
    accepted petroleum engineering and evaluation principles and
    conform to the SEC’s definition of proved reserves as set
    forth in

Rule 210.4-10(a)

of

Regulation S-X.

Ryder Scott has informed the Company that the tests and
    procedures used during its reserves audit conform to the
    Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and
    Gas Reserves Information approve by the Society of Petroleum
    Engineers. Paragraph 2.2(f) of the Standards Pertaining to
    the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information
    defines a reserves audit as the process of reviewing certain of
    the pertinent facts interpreted and assumptions made that have
    resulted in an estimate of reserves prepared by others and the
    rendering of an opinion about (1) the appropriateness of
    the methodologies employed, (2) the adequacy and quality of
    the data relied upon, (3) the depth and thoroughness of the
    reserves estimation process, (4) the classification of
    reserves appropriate to the relevant definitions used and
    (5) the reasonableness of the estimated reserve quantities.
    A reserve audit is not the same as a financial audit and is less
    rigorous in nature than an independent reserve report where the
    independent reserve engineer determines the reserves on his own.

As of December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, on a barrel of
    equivalent basis 28, 31 and 32 percent of our estimated
    worldwide reserves, respectively, were classified as proved
    undeveloped. Approximately 24 percent of our year-end 2008
    estimated proved developed reserves are classified as proved not
    producing. These reserves relate to zones that are either behind
    pipe, or that have been completed but not yet produced, or zones
    that have been produced in the past, but are not now producing
    because of mechanical reasons. These reserves are considered to
    be a lower tier of reserves than producing reserves because they
    are frequently based on volumetric calculations rather than
    performance data. Future production associated with behind pipe
    reserves is scheduled to follow depletion of the currently
    producing zones in the same wellbores. It should be noted that
    additional capital may have to be spent to access these
    reserves. The capital and economic impact of production timing
    are reflected in this Note 13, under “Future Net Cash
    Flows.”

Future
    Net Cash Flows

Future cash inflows are based on year-end oil and gas prices
    except in those instances where future natural gas or oil sales
    are covered by physical contract terms providing for higher or
    lower amounts. Operating costs, production and ad valorem taxes
    and future development costs are based on current costs with no
    escalation.

The following table sets forth unaudited information concerning
    future net cash flows for oil and gas reserves, net of income
    tax expense. Income tax expense has been computed using expected
    future tax rates and giving effect to tax deductions and credits
    available, under current laws, and which relate to oil and gas
    producing activities. This information does not purport to
    present the fair market value of the Company’s oil and gas
    assets, but does present a standardized disclosure concerning
    possible future net cash flows that would result under the
    assumptions used.

The sum of the individual quarterly net income per common share
    amounts may not agree with year-to-date net income per common
    share as each quarterly computation is based on the
    weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during that
    period. All potentially dilutive securities were included in
    each quarterly computation of diluted net income per common
    share, as none were antidilutive.

SUPPLEMENTAL
    GUARANTOR INFORMATION

Prior to 2001, Apache Finance Australia was a finance subsidiary
    of Apache with no independent operations. In this capacity, it
    issued approximately $270 million of publicly traded notes
    that are fully and unconditionally

F-50

guaranteed by Apache and, beginning in 2001, Apache North
    America, Inc. In 2007, $170 million of these notes matured
    and were repaid. The guarantors of Apache Finance Australia have
    joint and several liabilities. Similarly, Apache Finance Canada
    was also a finance subsidiary of Apache and had issued
    approximately $300 million of publicly traded notes that
    were fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Apache. In 2008,
    Apache Finance Canada issued an additional $350 million in
    notes that were fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Apache.

Generally, the issuance of publicly traded securities would
    subject those subsidiaries to the reporting requirements of the
    Securities and Exchange Commission. Since these subsidiaries had
    no independent operations and qualified as “finance
    subsidiaries,” they were exempted from these requirements.

During 2001, Apache contributed stock of its Australian and
    Canadian operating subsidiaries to Apache Finance Australia and
    Apache Finance Canada, respectively. As a result of these
    contributions, they no longer qualify as finance subsidiaries.
    As allowed by the SEC rules, the following condensed
    consolidating financial statements are provided as an
    alternative to filing separate financial statements.

Each of the companies presented in the condensed consolidating
    financial statements is wholly owned and has been consolidated
    in Apache Corporation’s consolidated financial statements
    for all periods presented. As such, the condensed consolidating
    financial statements should be read in conjunction with the
    financial statements of Apache Corporation and subsidiaries and
    notes thereto of which this note is an integral part.
