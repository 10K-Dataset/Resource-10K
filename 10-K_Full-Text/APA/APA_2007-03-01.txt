shall have their statutorily prescribed meanings when used in
    this report. Quantities of natural gas are expressed in this
    report in terms of thousand cubic feet (Mcf), million cubic feet
    (MMcf), billion cubic feet (Bcf) or trillion cubic feet (Tcf).
    Oil is quantified in terms of barrels (bbls); thousands of
    barrels (Mbbls) and millions of barrels (MMbbls). Natural gas is
    compared to oil in terms of barrels of oil equivalent (boe) or
    million barrels of oil equivalent (MMboe). Oil and natural gas
    liquids are compared with natural gas in terms of million cubic
    feet equivalent (MMcfe) and billion cubic feet equivalent
    (Bcfe). One barrel of oil is the energy equivalent of six Mcf of
    natural gas. Daily oil and gas production is expressed in terms
    of barrels of oil per day (b/d) and thousands or millions of
    cubic feet of gas per day (Mcf/d and MMcf/d, respectively) or
    millions of British thermal units per day (MMBtu/d). Gas sales
    volumes may be expressed in terms of one million British thermal
    units (MMBtu), which is approximately equal to one Mcf. With
    respect to information relating to our working interest in wells
    or acreage, “net” oil and gas wells or acreage is
    determined by multiplying gross wells or acreage by our working
    interest therein. Unless otherwise specified, all references to
    wells and acres are gross.

PART I

ITEMS 1
    AND 2. BUSINESS AND PROPERTIES

General

Apache Corporation, a Delaware corporation formed in 1954, is an
    independent energy company that explores for, develops and
    produces natural gas, crude oil and natural gas liquids. In
    North America, our exploration and production interests are
    focused in the Gulf of Mexico, the Gulf Coast, East Texas, the
    Permian basin, the Anadarko basin and the Western Sedimentary
    basin of Canada. Outside of North America, we have exploration
    and production interests onshore Egypt, offshore Western
    Australia, offshore the United Kingdom in the North Sea (North
    Sea), and onshore Argentina. Our common stock, par value
    $0.625 per share, has been listed on the New York Stock
    Exchange (NYSE) since 1969, on the Chicago Stock Exchange (CHX)
    since 1960, and on the NASDAQ National Market (NASDAQ) since
    January 2004. On May 18, 2006, we filed certifications of
    our compliance with the listing standards of the NYSE and the
    NASDAQ, including our chief executive officer’s
    certification of compliance with the NYSE standards. Through our
    website, http://www.apachecorp.com, you can access electronic
    copies of the charters of the committees of our Board of
    Directors, other documents related to Apache’s corporate
    governance (including our Code of Business Conduct and
    Governance Principles), and documents Apache files with the
    Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), including our annual
    reports on

Form 10-K,

quarterly reports on

Form 10-Q,

and current reports on

Form 8-K,

as well as any amendments to these reports. Included in our
    annual and quarterly reports are the certifications of our chief
    executive officer and our chief financial officer that are
    required by applicable laws and regulations. Access to these
    electronic filings is available as soon as practicable after
    filing with the SEC. You may also request printed copies of our
    committee charters or other governance documents by writing to
    our corporate secretary at the address on the cover of this
    report.

We hold interests in many of our U.S., Canadian, and other
    International properties through subsidiaries, including Apache
    Canada Ltd., DEK Energy Company (DEKALB), Apache Energy Limited
    (AEL), Apache North America, Inc., and Apache Overseas, Inc.
    Properties referred to in this document may be held by those
    subsidiaries. We treat all operations as one line of business.

Our
    Growth Strategy

Apache’s goal is to grow a profitable oil and gas company
    for the long-term benefit of our shareholders. Our strategy is
    to build a portfolio of core areas which provide growth
    opportunities through both grass-roots drilling and acquisition
    activity. We now have operations in six countries —
    the United States, Canada, Egypt, the United Kingdom sector of
    the North Sea, Australia, and our newest core area —
    Argentina. Whether in our oldest region, the U.S. Central
    region, or our newest, we seek to grow profitably while building
    critical mass that supports sustainable, lower-risk, repeatable
    drilling opportunities, balanced by higher-risk, higher-reward
    exploration. We also seek a balance in terms of gas vs. oil,
    geologic risk, reserve life and political risk.

When acquisition opportunities are identified, operational and
    technical teams participate in the evaluation process, enabling
    our personnel to move in quickly to execute exploitation
    activities (including workovers, recompletions and drilling)
    that will increase production and reserves, reduce costs per
    unit produced and enhance profitability. Over time, we build
    teams that have the technical knowledge and sense of urgency to
    maximize value. Our local knowledge of producing basins and our
    proactive culture provide a platform for continued growth
    through strategic acquisitions and drilling.

We also periodically evaluate our existing assets to determine
    whether sales of certain assets will provide opportunities to
    redeploy our capital resources to rebalance our portfolio and
    generate better prospective rates of return. As a result of this
    process, in January 2006, we sold our 55 percent interest
    in the deepwater section of Egypt’s West Mediterranean
    Concession to Amerada Hess for $413 million, and in August
    we sold our China holdings to Australia-based ROC Oil Company
    Limited for $260 million. We reinvested these proceeds and
    purchased estimated proved reserves of 109 MMboe in
    Argentina.

More than a decade ago, recognizing that the United States was a
    mature oil and gas country, we added an international
    exploration component to our portfolio strategy, which provides
    exposure to larger reserve targets with


which to grow production and reserves through drilling. Apache
    is also one of the leading acquirers of three-dimensional

(3-D)

seismic data in the industry today. Our technology experts have
    developed strategies for rapid and cost-effective acquisition
    and processing of

3-D

data,
    enabling our technical teams to analyze large swaths of acreage
    and generate drilling prospects on an accelerated timetable.

Operating regions are given the autonomy necessary to make
    drilling and operating decisions and to act quickly. Management
    and incentive systems underscore high cash flow and

rate-of-return

targets, which are measured monthly, reviewed with senior
    management quarterly and utilized to determine annual
    performance rewards.

In the United States, the Gulf Coast region consistently
    delivers high returns on capital invested, as well as cash flow
    significantly in excess of our exploration and development
    spending there. Acquisitions play an important role because with
    steep decline rates, offshore reserves are generally short-lived
    and difficult to replace through drilling alone. The Central
    region brings the balance of long-lived reserves and consistent
    drilling results in the Permian basin of West Texas and New
    Mexico, East Texas and the Anadarko basin of western Oklahoma.
    Apache’s future growth in the United States is more likely
    to be achieved through a combination of drilling and
    acquisitions, rather than through drilling activity alone. Our
    $821 million Gulf of Mexico acquisition from BP and
    $269 million Permian basin acquisition from Amerada Hess,
    for example, complimented our active drilling program in 2006
    and buttressed our growth in the U.S.

In Canada, we have almost seven million gross acres across the
    Provinces of British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan and the
    Northwest Territories. We have a multi-year inventory of
    low-risk drilling opportunities in a number of Apache fields in
    Central Alberta, including Provost, Hatton and Nevis, and on
    acreage acquired in the Exxon Mobil Corporation (ExxonMobil)
    farm-in agreements of 2004 and 2005. With acquisition and land
    costs having risen significantly in Canada, these farm-ins
    provide a way for Apache to earn acreage through drilling with
    no upfront costs. ExxonMobil retains a royalty on fee lands and
    a convertible working interest on leasehold acreage, both of
    which vary dependent on activity levels. We also have
    opportunities to drill deeper exploration targets with higher
    reserve potential in Northwest Alberta and Northeast British
    Columbia.

In Egypt’s Western Desert, Apache’s 10.2 million
    gross acres encompass a sizable resource in the Cretaceous Upper
    Bahariya formations and outstanding exploration potential in
    deeper intervals from lower Cretaceous to Jurassic, established
    producing trends. The Qasr gas/condensate field, discovered in
    2003, is the largest field ever found by Apache with more than 2
    trillion cubic feet of gas and 60 million barrels of
    estimated recoverable reserves.

In Australia, we have expanded our exploration program to the
    high-potential Exmouth, Browse and Gippsland basins while
    continuing to exploit our acreage position and control of key
    infrastructure in the Carnarvon basin. In the Gippsland basin we
    actively acquired almost 1.8 million acres over the past
    three years and have generated a

10-well

inventory of high potential exploration prospects to be drilled
    in 2008. Additionally, Apache and its partners are designing
    three development projects in the Exmouth basin that are in
    process of being sanctioned and approved by all parties.

Apache entered the North Sea in 2003 with our acquisition of the
    Forties field (Forties), the largest field ever discovered in
    the United Kingdom. As operator, through drilling and extensive
    improvements to the production infrastructure, we virtually
    doubled production — and significantly reduced

per-unit

operating costs — from the second quarter of 2003. Our
    2007 plans include infill and extentional drilling activity at
    Forties to determine if we can extend the field to the west, as
    well as exploration drilling on acreage blocks obtained over the
    past couple of years. We currently have around 100 Forties
    field drilling locations in our inventory.

For several years we held small interests in Argentina with the
    long-term view of expanding there through acquisitions. In April
    2006, we purchased Pioneer Natural Resources’ (Pioneer)
    interests in Neuquén and the Austral basins for
    $675 million and subsequently purchased our partner’s,
    Pan American Fueguina S.R.L. (Pan American), interests in Tierra
    del Fuego, gaining operatorship in the under-exploited, highly
    prospective Austral basin concessions. Through subsequent
    workovers, recompletions and development activities, we
    increased production on the acquired properties and have
    established Argentina as Apache’s latest core area. While
    we expect unique challenges with evolving governmental
    regulations, we anticipate growing reserves and production in
    Argentina.

We exited 2006 with a year-end

debt-to-capitalization

ratio of 22 percent despite record capital spending of
    $6.4 billion, excluding asset retirement costs. This
    flexibility enables us to quickly act on attractive acquisition


transactions as they are identified, such as our agreement in
    January 2007 to acquire, through a joint venture interest,
    Permian basin assets from Anadarko Petroleum Company (Anadarko)
    for $1 billion. The transaction, which is subject to normal
    closing conditions and adjustments for matters such as
    preferential rights, is expected to close around the end of the
    first-quarter of 2007.

Apache has increased reserves in each of the last 21 years
    and production in 27 of the last 28 years. We believe our
    strategy and our diversified portfolio of assets provide a
    platform for profitable growth through drilling and acquisitions
    across the cycles of our dynamic industry.

In 2007, we are planning another active year of drilling. We
    revise our capital expenditure estimates throughout the year
    based on changing industry conditions and results to date.
    Therefore, accurately projecting annual capital spending is
    difficult at best. Our preliminary 2007 capital budget
    approaches $4.5 billion. While in most years capital
    budgets are expanded as the year unfolds, if commodity prices
    soften from year-end 2006 levels and service costs do not also
    decline; we plan to reduce our capital spending. Regarding
    potential acquisitions, we continually look for properties to
    which we believe we can add value and earn adequate rates of
    return and will take advantage of those acquisition
    opportunities as they arise.

Operating
    Highlights

Following the sale of our interest in China in the third quarter
    of 2006, our interests in six countries now comprise our
    reportable segments: the United States, Canada, Egypt,
    Australia, the North Sea, and Argentina. In the U.S., our
    exploration and production activities are spread between two
    regions: Gulf Coast and Central.

The following table sets out a brief comparative summary of
    certain key 2006 data for each area. More detailed information
    regarding oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids (NGLs)
    production and the average sales prices received in each
    geographic area for 2006, 2005, and 2004 is available later in
    this section under “Production, Pricing and Lease Operating
    Cost Data.” Also, further discussion and analysis of this
    data is available in Item 7, Management’s Discussion

The following discussions include references to our plans for
    2007. These only represent initial estimates and could vary
    significantly from actual results. In recent years, there have
    been large differences between our capital expenditure forecasts
    and our actual activity. During the year, we routinely adjust
    our level of spending based on results and changing industry
    conditions.

United
    States

Gulf Coast —

The Gulf Coast region comprises
    our interests in and along the Gulf of Mexico, in the areas
    on-and offshore Louisiana and Texas. Apache is the largest

held-by-production

acreage holder and the second largest producer in Gulf waters
    less than 1,200 feet deep. For the third year in a row, the
    Gulf Coast was our leading region for both production volumes
    and revenues. Gulf Coast activities in 2006 focused on restoring
    production impacted by the 2005 hurricanes, while maintaining an
    active drilling program. This region performed 296 workover and
    recompletion operations during 2006 and completed 65 out of 83
    total wells drilled as producers. Our drilling locations mostly
    included proved undeveloped reserves at platforms sustaining
    minimum or no hurricane damage with access to third-party
    transport facilities. In June 2006, we acquired producing
    properties, facilities and prospects on the Outer Continental
    Shelf of the Gulf of Mexico from BP plc (BP) for
    $845 million, adding an estimated 44.2 MMboe of proved
    reserves. The purchase price was allocated as follows:
    $747 million producing properties, $42 million
    prospects, $56 million facilities. As of year-end 2006, the
    Gulf Coast region accounted for 17 percent of our estimated
    proved reserves. Although actual annual capital expenditures may
    change considerably in 2007, we currently estimate investing
    approximately $900 million to drill over 90 wells and
    to continue our production enhancement and exploitation
    programs. In addition, we plan to spend an estimated
    $350 million on repair, redevelopment, and plugging and
    abandonment work required to repair damage caused by Hurricanes
    Katrina and Rita in 2005 that will not be covered by insurance.

Central —

The Central Region includes assets in
    the Permian basin of West Texas and New Mexico, East Texas, and
    the Anadarko basin of western Oklahoma, where the Company got
    its start over 50 years ago. On January 5, 2006, the
    Company expanded its presence in the Permian basin by purchasing
    an estimated 31.5 MMboe of reserves in eight fields for
    $269 million from Amerada-Hess. In early 2007, we also
    entered into agreements to acquire additional Permian basin
    interests from Anadarko as described in more detail below under
    “Subsequent Events.” As of year-end 2006, the Central
    region accounted for approximately 24 percent of our
    estimated proved reserves, the second largest concentration in
    the Company. During 2006, we participated in drilling
    374 wells, 363 of which were completed as productive.
    Apache performed 615 workovers and recompletions in the region
    during the year. We currently estimate spending approximately
    $570 million in 2007 on drilling and production enhancement
    projects.

Marketing —

In general, most of our
    U.S. gas is sold on a monthly basis at either monthly or
    daily market prices. Our natural gas is sold primarily to Local
    Distribution Companies (LDCs), utilities, end-users, integrated
    major oil and gas companies and marketers. In an effort to
    increase sales to direct users of natural gas and to meet the
    needs of our customers, we also periodically sell some gas under
    long-term contracts at prices that fluctuate with market
    conditions. Approximately eight percent of our 2006
    U.S. natural gas production was sold under long-term
    fixed-price physical contracts which expire in 2007 and 2008.
    See Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about
    Market Risk “Commodity Risk” in this

Form 10-K.

Apache has historically marketed and continues to sell its
    U.S. crude oil to integrated major oil companies,
    purchasers, transporters, and refiners. The objective is to
    maximize the value of the crude oil sold by identifying the most
    economical markets and transportation routes available to move
    the crude oil via pipeline, truck or barge. Sales contracts are
    generally thirty (30) day evergreen contracts and renew
    automatically until canceled by either party. These contracts
    provide for sales at prices which fluctuate with daily oil
    market conditions, thus capturing the market value of the crude
    oil each day. We manage our credit risk by selling our oil to
    creditworthy counterparties and monitoring our exposure on a
    daily basis.

Canada

Overview —

Our exploration and development
    activity in our Canadian region is concentrated in the Provinces
    of Alberta, British Columbia, Saskatchewan and to a lesser
    degree the Northwest Territories. The region comprises


24.9 percent of our estimated proved reserves, the largest
    in the Company. We hold over 4.9 million net acres in
    Canada, the largest of our North American regions. Canada was
    our most active drilling area in 2006, with Apache participating
    in 874 wells, focused primarily on low-risk shallow
    development wells. We completed 740 as producers and conducted
    274 workover and recompletion projects. Although actual annual
    capital expenditures may change with industry conditions and
    results, we currently estimate spending approximately
    $770 million in 2007 to drill approximately 380 wells,
    continue our exploitation program, albeit at a lower level, and
    continue developing our gas processing infrastructure. Our 2007
    drilling program will include more deeper, higher risk-reward
    exploration wells and fewer shallow development wells.

Apache is also targeting fields such as Provost and Nevis in
    Alberta for coalbed methane (CBM) and in the process has emerged
    as one of Canada’s largest producers of CBM. The North and
    South Grant Lands obtained through farm-in agreements (discussed
    below) provide additional CBM potential.

In 2005, Apache signed a farm-in agreement with ExxonMobil
    covering approximately 650,000 acres of undeveloped
    properties in the Western Canadian province of Alberta. Under
    the agreement, Apache is to drill and operate 145 new wells over
    a

36-month

period with upside potential for further drilling. ExxonMobil
    retains a royalty on fee lands and a convertible working
    interest on leasehold acreage, both of which vary dependent on
    activity levels. The agreement also allows Apache to test
    additional horizons on approximately 140,000 acres of
    property covered in a 2004 farm-in agreement with ExxonMobil.
    The 2004 farm-in agreement covered approximately
    380,000 acres and stipulated drilling at least
    250 wells over a two-year period beginning in October 2004.
    The 250 well commitment was met and the agreement was extended
    for an additional year. In 2006, Apache drilled 218 wells
    on the 2005 and 2004 farm-in acreage earning 93 additional
    acreage sections. Through the end of 2006, Apache has now
    drilled a total of 675 wells on the farm-in acreage from
    both agreements.

Marketing —

Our Canadian natural gas sales
    focuses on sales to LDCs, utilities, end-users, integrated
    majors, supply aggregators and marketers. Our composite client
    portfolio is credit worthy and diverse. Improved North American
    natural gas pipeline connectivity has triggered a closer
    correlation between Canadian and United States natural gas
    prices. To diversify our market exposure and optimize pricing
    differences in the U.S. and Canada, we transport natural gas via
    our firm transportation contracts to California, the Chicago
    area, and eastern Canada. Our objective is to sell the majority
    of our production monthly, either into the first of the month
    market, or the daily market. Over 95 percent of our
    Canadian natural gas production is sold on a monthly basis at
    either monthly or daily market prices. Approximately two percent
    of our sales are long-term fixed-price sales. The longest term
    for these sales expires in 2011. The remainder is sold under
    long-term commitments to Canadian aggregators and end-users
    where the prices we receive under these contracts fluctuate
    monthly with market indices.

Our Canadian crude oil is primarily sold to refiners, integrated
    majors and marketers. To increase the market value of our
    condensate and heavier crudes, our condensate is either used or
    sold for blending purposes. We sell our crude oil and NGLs on
    Canadian Postings, which are market reflective prices that
    depend on worldwide crude oil prices and are adjusted for
    transportation and quality. In order to reach more purchasers
    and diversify our market, we transport crude on 12 pipelines to
    the major trading hubs within Alberta and Saskatchewan.

Egypt

Overview —

In Egypt, our operations are
    conducted pursuant to production sharing contracts under which
    the contractor partner pays all operating and capital
    expenditure costs for exploration and development. A percentage
    of the production, usually up to 40 percent, is available
    to the contractor partners to recover operating and capital
    expenditure costs. In general, the balance of the production is
    allocated between the contractor partners and the Egyptian
    General Petroleum Corporation (EGPC) on a contractually defined
    basis. Apache is the second largest acreage holder and the most
    active driller in the Western Desert of Egypt. Egypt is the
    country with our largest single acreage position where, as of
    December 31, 2006, we held approximately 10.2 million
    gross acres in 19 separate concessions. Development leases
    within concessions generally have a

25-year

life
    with extensions possible for additional commercial discoveries,
    or on a negotiated basis. Apache is the largest producer of
    liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas in the Western Desert. Egypt
    contributed approximately 21 percent of Apache’s
    production revenues and 19 percent of total production.
    Egypt accounted for 12 percent of total estimated proved
    reserves as of December 31, 2006. The Company reports all
    estimated proved reserves held under production sharing
    agreements utilizing the economic interest method, which
    excludes the host country’s share of reserves.


In 2006, Apache had an active drilling program in Egypt,
    completing 140 of 163 wells, an 86 percent success
    rate, and conducted 390 workovers and recompletions. We
    currently plan to spend approximately $1 billion in 2007.
    Of this, $600 million will be for drilling and production
    enhancement work. We recently received approval to expand our
    Western Desert gas processing capacity and infrastructure to
    evacuate an additional 200 MMcf/d gas volumes driven by the
    Qasr field discovery. We project that this upgrade will take two
    years to complete at a total cost of $950 million,
    excluding actual gas well drilling costs and we have included
    $350 million in our capital expenditures for 2007.

On January 6, 2006, the Company completed the sale of its
    55 percent interest in the deepwater section of
    Egypt’s West Mediterranean Concession to Amerada Hess for
    $413 million.

Please refer to Item 7, Management’s Discussion and
    Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
    “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates, Allowance for
    Doubtful Accounts” in this

Form 10-K

for a discussion of our Egyptian receivables.

Marketing —

We and our partners have sold our
    gas production to EGPC under an Industry Pricing Formula; which
    is a sliding scale based on Dated-Brent crude oil with a minimum
    of $1.50 per MMbtu and a maximum of $2.65 per MMbtu which
    corresponds to a Dated-Brent price of $21.00 per barrel.
    Generally, the Industry Pricing Formula applies to all new gas
    discovered and produced. In exchange for extension of the Khalda
    Concession lease in July 2004, Apache agreed to accept Industry
    Pricing on all production in excess of 100 MMcf/d, but
    preserved the higher price formula until 2013 on the initial
    100 MMcf/d.

Oil from the Khalda Concession, the Qarun Concession and other
    nearby Western Desert blocks is either sold directly to EGPC or
    other third-parties. The oil sales are made either directly into
    the Egyptian oil pipeline grid, exported via one of two
    terminals on the north coast of Egypt, or sold to third parties
    (non-governmental) through the MIDOR refinery located in
    northern Egypt. Oil production that is presently sold to EGPC is
    sold on a spot basis at a “Western Desert” price
    (indexed to Brent). In 2006, we exported 28 cargoes
    (approximately 8.6 million barrels) of Western Desert crude
    oil from the El Hamra and Sidi Kerir terminals located on the
    northern coast of Egypt. These export cargoes were sold at
    market prices comparable to domestic sales to EGPC.
    Additionally, 24 cargoes representing 3.5 million barrels
    were sold in Egypt to other non-governmental purchasers at
    prevailing market prices. Export sales from both the Khalda and
    Qarun areas in the Western Desert have continued in 2007.

Australia

Overview —

Our exploration activity in
    Australia is focused in the offshore Carnarvon, Gippsland,
    Browse, and Perth basins where Apache holds 6.8 million net
    acres in 35 Exploration Permits, 10 Production Licenses, and six
    Retention Leases. Production operations are concentrated in the
    Carnarvon basin which is the location of all 10 Production
    Licenses, nine of which are operated by Apache. In 2006, the
    region generated $408 million of production revenues
    producing 15.7 MMboe (8.6 percent of our total
    production) and accounted for 8.8 percent of our year-end
    estimated proved reserves. During the year we participated in
    drilling 23 wells; 18 exploration and five development
    wells. Four of the exploration wells and three of the
    development wells were productive for a 30 percent success
    rate.

Exploration successes in 2006 included the Theo and West Cycad
    oil discoveries and the Gnu and Bambra East gas finds. The West
    Cycad oil discovery was drilled in the Harriet Joint Venture
    (HJV) area and is slated to begin production in the first
    quarter of 2007. The successful Theo well was drilled in the
    Exmouth

sub-basin

and is scheduled to begin production in 2009. The Gnu well was
    drilled in the Reindeer/Caribou field and added significant new
    reserves. First production from the Reindeer/Caribou field is
    targeted for late 2008 or early 2009. The Bambra East well was a
    successful gas well in the HJV, which more than doubled the
    volume of gas attributed to the Bambra field area. Gas
    production from this asset will begin in 2007 subject to
    augmentation of existing infrastructure.

During 2007, our Australian region plans to expand the HJV oil
    and gas production through development of the 2006 discoveries
    and drilling three additional wells: Bambra 8, Doric 2 and
    Lee 3. We will monitor the effects of the increased water
    injection at Stag and possibly drill an additional producer. We
    will also begin the initial phase of development drilling at the
    Van Gogh field. A key factor for success in 2007 will be
    increasing gas production and


reserves to fulfill the requirements of our sales contracts,
    exploration success and initiating the Theo field development
    and final sanctions thereof. We currently estimate spending
    approximately $460 million in 2007 to drill
    30 exploration, appraisal and development wells and another
    $50 million for new facilities.

Marketing —

In 2006, we executed three new gas
    sales contracts in Australia. As of December 31, 2006,
    Apache had a total of 22 active gas contracts with expiration
    dates ranging from April 2007 to July 2030. Generally, natural
    gas is sold in Western Australia under long-term, fixed-price
    contracts, many of which contain price escalation clauses based
    on the Australian consumer price index.

We continue to export all of our crude oil production into the
    international market at prices which fluctuate with world market
    conditions.

North
    Sea

Overview —

In 2006, the North Sea region
    generated $1.35 billion of revenue, producing
    21.5 million barrels of oil equivalent. We continued to
    develop our North Sea core area around the Forties field,
    including investments in upgrades to improve the operating
    efficiency of our platforms. Despite this, 2006 production was
    down 11 percent from 2005 primarily because of production
    interruptions associated with commissioning of major facility
    projects, and temporary shutdown of the Forties Pipeline System
    during the third quarter of 2006. Our focus in 2006 on
    infrastructure projects also displaced drilling operations
    needed to mitigate natural decline.

In 2006, we invested $329 million of capital in the North
    Sea region, including investments on drilling, recompletion and
    facility upgrades.

At Forties we commissioned a number of key facility projects to
    improve production efficiency and lower operating costs,
    including new power generation, a multi-platform distribution
    system, water injection upgrades and drilling rig modification.
    Also during 2006, seismic survey data acquired over Forties in
    2005 was processed for inversion to identify bypassed oil in the
    main reservoir units and update the inventory of future drilling
    targets. We also drilled one appraisal well outside Forties, and
    had a second appraisal well and an exploration well in progress
    at the end of 2006.

There were no significant additions to North Sea acreage in
    2006; however, in early 2007 Apache was awarded
    62,320 acres from four licenses applied for in the UK
    24th Licensing Round. In

block 22/6a

(Bacchus), Apache increased equity from 60 percent to
    70 percent and became Operator (purchasing
    ExxonMobil’s 20 percent share and farming out
    10 percent). A further 652 square kilometers of 3D
    seismic was acquired over six blocks of our acreage.

North Sea capital expenditures for 2007 are currently estimated
    at $480 million. After a year with minimal drilling,
    activity will significantly increase. In Forties, we will
    continue the development drilling program, with 15 new wells
    planned, and complete platform upgrades begun last year.
    Upgrades for 2007 include finalizing installation of additional
    produced water re-injection pumps and deep gas lift compressors,
    and commissioning of direct fluid export from Forties Bravo to
    Forties Charlie. These projects will enable Forties to meet
    stringent new environmental targets for produced water discharge
    to sea as well as enhance reservoir management capabilities, and
    should enhance runtime efficiency. Outside Forties, four
    exploration and appraisal wells are scheduled to be drilled in
    the first half of the year.

Marketing —

In 2006, we entered into two new
    term contracts for the physical sale of Forties crude at
    prevailing market prices, which are composed of base market
    indices, adjusted for the higher quality of Forties crude
    relative to Brent and a premium to reflect the higher market
    value for term arrangements. Also in 2006, a new value
    adjustment formula (Quality Bank Adjustor) was implemented in
    BP’s Forties Pipeline System, through which Forties crude
    is shipped and commingled with crudes from other central North
    Sea fields. The original formula was challenged by Apache in
    June 2005, as it did not accurately value the Forties crude
    quality relative to the other crudes shipped on the Forties
    Pipeline System. The new agreed upon comingled stream on the
    formula better represents Forties crude value and effectively
    increases the volume allocated to Apache from the Forties
    Pipeline System.


Argentina

Argentina became our newest core area following two significant
    acquisitions in 2006 that substantially increased our presence
    in the country. In the second quarter, we completed our purchase
    of Pioneer’s operations in Argentina for $675 million
    with estimated proved reserves of 22 MMbbls of liquid
    hydrocarbons and 297 Bcf of natural gas. In the third
    quarter, we acquired additional interests in (and now operate)
    seven concessions in the Tierra del Fuego Province from Pan
    American for total consideration of $429 million. Our oil
    and gas assets are located in the Neuquén, San Jorge
    and Austral basins of Argentina. In 2006, we had 9.9 MMboe
    of production and 110.6 MMboe of estimated proved reserves,
    approximately 5.4 percent and 4.8 percent,
    respectively, of Apache’s total production and reserves.

We plan to invest approximately $180 million drilling over
    100 wells and spend an additional $60 million on
    production enhancement projects in 2007.

Marketing —

In Argentina we extended our
    existing natural gas contracts to regulated markets through
    April 2007, per the Argentine Secretary of Energy’s
    request. We expect to reach a new agreement during the
    first-quarter of 2007 with the Argentine government, which will
    set the volumes to be delivered to the regulated market for the
    period 2007 through 2011. We also entered into four new term
    contracts up to two years in duration for a total of
    22 MMcf/d. These four contracts enabled Apache to lock in
    higher priced contracts while awaiting a new agreement to cover
    the internal demand of Argentina for 2007 onward.

In October 2006, the Argentina government removed the export tax
    exempt status previously afforded the province of Tierra del
    Fuego through a Special Customs area exemption. The government
    has further assessed an export tax on all exports from Argentina
    based upon the price paid for natural gas imports from Bolivia.
    This tax reduces the value we are receiving under our contract
    with Methanex in Chile. We have entered into an interim
    agreement with Methanex to mitigate the effects of this tax and
    are working to reach an economically suitable final agreement.
    The Methanex contract represents less than 10 percent of
    our gas sales in Argentina.

Other
    International

China.

On August 8, 2006, the Company
    completed the sale of our 24.5 percent interest in the Zhao
    Dong block offshore the People’s Republic of China, to
    Australia-based ROC Oil Company Limited for $260 million,
    marking Apache’s exit from China. The transaction was
    effective July 1, 2006, and the Company recorded a gain of
    approximately $174 million in the third-quarter of 2006.

Subsequent
    Events

On January 18, 2007, the Company announced that it is
    acquiring controlling interest in 28 oil and gas fields in the
    Permian basin of West Texas from Anadarko Petroleum Corporation
    (Anadarko) for $1 billion. Apache estimates that these
    fields had proved reserves of 57 million barrels (MMbbls)
    of liquid hydrocarbons and 78 billion cubic feet (Bcf) of
    natural gas as of yearend 2006. The transaction will be
    effective the earlier of closing or March 31, 2007.
    Approximately 10 percent of the Permian basin properties
    are subject to third-party preferential purchase rights which,
    if exercised, would reduce the interests we purchase in those
    properties and the purchase price we would pay. The Company
    intends to fund the acquisition with debt. Apache and Anadarko
    are entering into a joint-venture arrangement to effect the
    transaction. In connection with the acquisition, the Company
    entered into cash flow hedges to protect against commodity price
    volatility. For the period of July 2007 through June 2010, the
    Company entered into hedges for a portion of both the oil and
    the natural gas with NYMEX based costless collars.

In anticipation of closing the Anadarko transaction, we
    completed a public offering in January 2007 of $500 million
    of 5.625-percent notes due 2017 and $1 billion of
    6.0-percent notes due 2037. The net proceeds from the
    offering ($1.48 billion, net of original issue discounts
    and underwriting commissions) were used to repay a portion of
    our outstanding commercial paper, which was incurred to finance
    acquisitions we made in 2006 and for general corporate purposes.


Drilling
    Statistics

Worldwide, in 2006, we participated in drilling 1,611 gross
    wells, with 1,399 (87 percent) completed as producers. We
    also performed more than 1,700 workovers and recompletions
    during the year. Historically, our drilling activities in the
    U.S. generally concentrate on exploitation and extension of
    existing, producing fields rather than exploration. As a general
    matter, our operations outside of the U.S. focus on a mix
    of exploration and exploitation wells. In addition to our
    completed wells, at year-end several wells had not yet reached
    completion: 76 in the U.S. (40.27 net); 10 in Canada
    (10 net); 18 in Egypt (17.12 net); three in Australia
    (2.06 net); and two in the North Sea (1.94 net).

As of December 31, 2006, we had 736,497, 2,918,890, and
    1,802,281 net acres scheduled to expire by
    December 31, 2007, 2008 and 2009, respectively, if
    production is not established or we take no other action to
    extend the terms. We plan to continue the terms of many of these
    licenses and concession areas through operational or
    administrative actions and do not expect a significant portion
    of our net acreage position to expire before such actions occur.

The other international drilling statistics on the preceding
    page and the Production, Pricing and Lease Operating Cost Data
    above include activity in China, where Apache ceased operations
    in August 2006.

Estimated
    Proved Reserves and Future Net Cash Flows

As of December 31, 2006, Apache had total estimated proved
    reserves of 1,061 MMbbls of crude oil, condensate and NGLs
    and 7.5 Tcf of natural gas. Combined, these total estimated
    proved reserves are equivalent to 2.3 billion barrels of
    oil equivalent or 13.9 Tcf of natural gas. During 2006, the
    Company’s reserves grew nine percent with increases in all
    our countries. The Company’s reserves have increased for 21
    consecutive years.

Proved oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities of
    natural gas, crude oil, condensate and NGLs that geological and
    engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be
    recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing
    economic and operating conditions. The Company reports all
    estimated proved reserves held under production sharing
    arrangements utilizing the “economic interest” method,
    which excludes the host country’s share of reserves.
    Reserve estimates are considered proved if economical
    producibility is supported by either actual production or
    conclusive formation tests. Estimated reserves that can be
    produced economically through application of improved recovery
    techniques are included in the “proved” classification
    when successful testing by a pilot project or the operation of
    an active, improved recovery program in the reservoir provides
    support for the engineering analysis on which the project or
    program is based. Estimated proved developed oil and gas
    reserves can be expected to be recovered through existing wells
    with existing equipment and operating methods.

Apache emphasizes that its reported reserves are estimates
    which, by their nature, are subject to revision. The estimates
    are made using available geological and reservoir data, as well
    as production performance data. These estimates are reviewed
    throughout the year, and revised either upward or downward, as
    warranted by additional performance data.

Apache’s proved reserves are estimated at the property
    level and compiled for reporting purposes by a centralized group
    of experienced reservoir engineers who are independent of the
    operating groups. These engineers interact with engineering and
    geoscience personnel in each of Apache’s operating areas,
    and with accounting and marketing employees to obtain the
    necessary data for projecting future production, costs, net
    revenues and ultimate recoverable reserves. Reserves are
    reviewed internally with senior management and presented to
    Apache’s Board of Directors in summary form on a quarterly
    basis. Annually, each property is reviewed in detail by our
    centralized and operating region engineers to ensure forecasts
    of operating expenses, netback prices, production trends and
    development timing are reasonable.


We engage Ryder Scott Company, L.P. Petroleum Consultants as
    independent petroleum engineers to review our estimates of
    proved hydrocarbon liquid and gas reserves and provide an
    opinion letter on the reasonableness of Apache’s internal
    projections. Ryder Scott opined that they were in acceptable
    agreement with the Company’s overall reserve estimates and
    that the reserves they reviewed conform to the SEC’s
    definition of proved reserves as set forth in

Rule 210.4-10(a)

of

Regulation S-X.

The independent reviews typically cover a large percentage of
    major value fields, international properties and new wells
    drilled during the year. During 2006, 2005 and 2004, their
    review covered 75, 74 and 79 percent of Apache’s
    worldwide estimated reserve value, respectively.

The Company’s estimates of proved reserves and proved
    developed reserves as of December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004,
    changes in estimated proved reserves during the last three
    years, and estimates of future net cash flows and discounted
    future net cash flows from estimated proved reserves are
    contained in Note 13, Supplemental Oil and Gas Disclosures
    (Unaudited) of Item 15 in this

Form 10-K.

These estimated future net cash flows are based on prices on the
    last day of the year and are calculated in accordance with
    Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 69,
    “Disclosures about Oil and Gas Producing Activities.”
    Disclosure of this value and related reserves has been prepared
    in accordance with SEC

Regulation S-X

Rule 4-10.

Employees

On December 31, 2006, we had 3,150 employees. Only 25 of
    these employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements,
    all of whom are in Argentina.

Offices

Our principal executive offices are located at One Post Oak
    Central, 2000 Post Oak Boulevard, Suite 100, Houston, Texas

77056-4400.

At year-end 2006, we maintained regional exploration

and/or

production offices in Tulsa, Oklahoma; Houston, Texas; Calgary,
    Alberta; Cairo, Egypt; Perth, Western Australia; Aberdeen,
    Scotland; and Buenos Aires, Argentina. Apache leases all of its
    primary office space. The current lease on our principal
    executive offices runs through December 31, 2013. For
    information regarding the Company’s obligations under its
    office leases, see the information appearing in the table in
    Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
    Financial Condition and Results of Operations, “Capital
    Resources and Liquidity, Contractual Obligations” and

Title
    to Interests

As is customary in our industry, a preliminary review of title
    records is made at the time we acquire properties, which may
    include opinions or reports of appropriate professionals or
    counsel. We believe that our title to all of the various
    interests set forth above is satisfactory and consistent with
    the standards generally accepted in the oil and gas industry,
    subject only to immaterial exceptions which do not detract
    substantially from the value of the interests or materially
    interfere with their use in our operations. The interests owned
    by us may be subject to one or more royalty, overriding royalty,
    and other outstanding interests (including disputes related to
    such interests) customary in the industry. The interests may
    additionally be subject to obligations or duties under
    applicable laws, ordinances, rules, regulations, and orders of
    arbitral or governmental authorities. In addition, the interests
    may be subject to burdens such as production payments, net
    profits interests, liens incident to operating agreements and
    current taxes, development obligations under oil and gas leases,
    and other encumbrances, easements, and restrictions, none of
    which detract substantially from the value of the interests or
    materially interfere with their use in our operations.

ITEM 1A.

RISK
    FACTORS

Our business activities and the value of our securities are
    subject to significant hazards and risks, including those
    described below. If any of such events should occur, our
    business, financial condition, liquidity

and/or

results of operations could be materially harmed, and holders
    and purchasers of our securities could lose part or all of their
    investments. Additional risks relating to our securities may be
    included in the prospectuses for securities we issue in the
    future.


Our
    Profitability is Highly Dependent on the Prices of Crude Oil,
    Natural Gas and Natural Gas Liquids, Which Have Historically
    Been Very Volatile

Our estimated proved reserves, revenues, profitability,
    operating cash flows and future rate of growth are highly
    dependent on the prices of crude oil, natural gas and NGLs,
    which are affected by numerous factors beyond our control.
    Historically, these prices have been very volatile. A
    significant downward trend in commodity prices would have a
    material adverse effect on our revenues, profitability and cash
    flow, and could result in a reduction in the carrying value of
    our oil and gas properties and the amounts of our estimated
    proved oil and gas reserves.

Our
    Commodity Hedging May Prevent Us From Benefiting Fully From
    Price Increases and May Expose Us to Other Risks

To the extent that we engage in hedging activities to protect
    ourselves from commodity price volatility, we may be prevented
    from realizing the benefits of price increases above the levels
    of the hedges.

Acquisitions
    or Discoveries of Additional Reserves are Needed to Avoid a
    Material Decline in Reserves and Production

The rate of production from oil and gas properties generally
    declines as reserves are depleted. Except to the extent that we
    find or acquire additional properties containing estimated
    proved reserves, conduct successful exploration and development
    activities or, through engineering studies, identify additional
    behind-pipe zones, secondary recovery reserves or tertiary
    recovery reserves, our estimated proved reserves will decline
    materially as reserves are produced. Future oil and gas
    production is, therefore, highly dependent upon our level of
    success in acquiring or finding additional reserves.

Our
    Drilling Activities May Not Be Productive

Drilling for oil and gas involves numerous risks, including the
    risk that we will not encounter commercially productive oil or
    gas reservoirs. The costs of drilling, completing and operating
    wells are often uncertain, and drilling operations may be
    curtailed, delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of
    factors including, but not limited to:

•

unexpected drilling conditions;

•

pressure or irregularities in formations;

•

equipment failures or accidents;

•

fires, explosions, blowouts and surface cratering;

•

marine risks such as capsizing, collisions and hurricanes;

•

other adverse weather conditions; and

•

shortages or delays in the delivery of equipment.

Certain future drilling activities may not be successful and, if
    unsuccessful, this failure could have an adverse effect on our
    future results of operations and financial condition. While all
    drilling, whether developmental or exploratory, involves these
    risks, exploratory drilling involves greater risks of dry holes
    or failure to find commercial quantities of hydrocarbons.

Risks
    Arising From the Failure to Fully Identify Potential Problems
    Related to Acquired Reserves or to Properly Estimate Those
    Reserves

One of our primary growth strategies is the acquisition of oil
    and gas properties. Although we perform a review of the acquired
    properties that we believe is consistent with industry
    practices, such reviews are inherently incomplete. It generally
    is not feasible to review in depth every individual property
    involved in each acquisition. Ordinarily, we will focus our
    review efforts on the higher-value properties and will sample
    the remainder. However, even a detailed review of records and
    properties may not necessarily reveal existing or potential
    problems, nor will it


permit a buyer to become sufficiently familiar with the
    properties to assess fully their deficiencies and potential.
    Inspections may not always be performed on every well, and
    environmental problems, such as ground water contamination, are
    not necessarily observable even when an inspection is
    undertaken. Even when problems are identified, we often assume
    certain environmental and other risks and liabilities in
    connection with acquired properties. There are numerous
    uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved oil
    and gas reserves and actual future production rates and
    associated costs with respect to acquired properties, and actual
    results may vary substantially from those assumed in the
    estimates. In addition, there can be no assurance that
    acquisitions will not have an adverse effect upon our operating
    results, particularly during the periods in which the operations
    of acquired businesses are being integrated into our ongoing
    operations.

We Are
    Subject to Governmental Risks That May Impact Our
    Operations

Our operations have been, and at times in the future may be,
    affected by political developments and by federal, state,
    provincial and local laws and regulations such as restrictions
    on production, changes in taxes, royalties and other amounts
    payable to governments or governmental agencies, price controls
    and environmental protection laws and regulations.

Global
    Political and Economic Developments May Impact Our
    Operations

Political and economic factors in international markets may have
    a material adverse effect on our operations. On an

equivalent-barrel

basis, approximately 63 percent of our oil, NGLs and
    natural gas production in 2006 was outside the United States,
    and approximately 59 percent of our estimated proved oil
    and gas reserves on December 31, 2006 were located outside
    of the United States.

There are many risks associated with operations in international
    markets, including changes in foreign governmental policies
    relating to crude oil, NGLs, and natural gas pricing and
    taxation, other political, economic or diplomatic developments,
    changing political conditions and international monetary
    fluctuations. These risks include: political and economic
    instability or war; the possibility that a foreign government
    may seize our property with or without compensation;
    confiscatory taxation; legal proceedings and claims arising from
    our foreign investments or operations; a foreign government
    attempting to renegotiate or revoke existing contractual
    arrangements, or failing to extend or renew such arrangements;
    fluctuating currency values and currency controls; and
    constrained natural gas markets dependent on demand in a single
    or limited geographical area.

On December 23, 2004, Apache entered into a

20-year

insurance contract with the Overseas Private Investment
    Corporation (OPIC) which provides $300 million of political
    risk insurance for the Company’s Egyptian operations. This
    policy insures us against (1) non-payment by EGPC of
    arbitral awards covering amounts owed Apache on past due
    invoices and (2) expropriation of exportable petroleum when
    actions taken by the Government of Egypt prevent Apache from
    exporting our share of production. See Item 7,
    Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
    and Results of Operations, “Critical Accounting Policies
    and Estimates, Allowance for Doubtful Accounts” in this

Form 10-K

for additional discussion of our Egyptian receivables.

In addition to the contract with OPIC, the Company has acquired
    commercial political risk insurance covering significant
    portions of its investments in Egypt and Argentina. The
    insurance provides coverage for confiscation, nationalization,
    and expropriation risks and currency inconvertibility, and is
    written on multi-year contracts with highly rated international
    insurers.

Actions of the United States government through tax and other
    legislation, executive order and commercial restrictions can
    adversely affect our operating profitability in the U.S. as
    well as other countries. Various agencies of the United States
    and other governments have, from time to time, imposed
    restrictions which have limited our ability to gain attractive
    opportunities or even operate in various countries. These
    restrictions have in the past limited our foreign opportunities
    and may continue to do so in the future.


Weather
    and Climate May Have a Significant Impact on Our Revenues and
    Productivity

Demand for oil and natural gas are, to a significant degree,
    dependent on weather and climate, which impacts the price we
    receive for the commodities we produce. In addition, our
    exploration and development activities and equipment can be
    adversely affected by severe weather, such as hurricanes in the
    Gulf of Mexico, which may cause a loss of production from
    temporary cessation of activity or lost or damaged equipment.
    While our planning for normal climatic variation, insurance
    program, and emergency recovery plans mitigate the effects of
    the weather, not all such effects can be predicted, eliminated
    or insured against.

Costs
    Incurred Related to Environmental Matters

We, as an owner or lessee and operator of oil and gas
    properties, are subject to various federal, provincial, state,
    local and foreign country laws and regulations relating to
    discharge of materials into, and protection of the environment.
    These laws and regulations may, among other things, impose
    liability on the lessee under an oil and gas lease for the cost
    of pollution

clean-up

resulting from operations, subject the lessee to liability for
    pollution damages, and require suspension or cessation of
    operations in affected areas.

We have made and will continue to make expenditures in our
    efforts to comply with these requirements, which we believe are
    necessary business costs in the oil and gas industry. We have
    established policies for continuing compliance with
    environmental laws and regulations, including regulations
    applicable to our operations in all countries in which we do
    business. We also have established operational procedures and
    training programs designed to minimize the environmental impact
    of our field facilities. The costs incurred by these policies
    and procedures are inextricably connected to normal operating
    expenses such that we are unable to separate the expenses
    related to environmental matters; however, we do not believe any
    such additional expenses are material to our financial position
    or results of operations.

Apache manages its exposure to environmental liabilities on
    properties to be acquired by identifying existing problems and
    assessing the potential liability. The Company also conducts
    periodic reviews, on a company-wide basis, to identify changes
    in its environmental risk profile. These reviews evaluate
    whether there is a probable liability, its amount, and the
    likelihood that the liability will be incurred. The amount of
    any potential liability is determined by considering, among
    other matters, incremental direct costs of any likely
    remediation and the proportionate cost of our employees who are
    expected to devote a significant amount of time to any possible
    remediation effort. Our general policy is to limit any reserve
    additions to incidents or sites that are considered probable to
    result in an expected remediation cost exceeding $100,000.

We maintain insurance coverage, which we believe is customary in
    the industry, although we are not fully insured against all
    environmental risks. As described in Note 10, Commitments
    and Contingencies of Item 15, in this

Form 10-K,

on December 31, 2006, we had an accrued liability of
    $17 million for environmental remediation. We have not
    incurred any material environmental remediation costs in any of
    the periods presented and we are not aware of any future
    environmental remediation matters that would be material to our
    financial position or results of operations.

Although environmental requirements have a substantial impact
    upon the energy industry, generally these requirements do not
    appear to affect us any differently, or to any greater or lesser
    extent, than other upstream companies in the industry. We do not
    believe that compliance with federal, provincial, state, local
    or foreign country provisions regulating the discharge of
    materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the
    protection of the environment, will have a material adverse
    effect upon the capital expenditures, earnings or competitive
    position of Apache or its subsidiaries; however, there is no
    assurance that changes in or additions to laws or regulations
    regarding the protection of the environment will not have such
    an impact.

Industry
    Competition

Strong competition exists in all sectors of the oil and gas
    exploration and production industry. We compete with major
    integrated and other independent oil and gas companies for
    acquisition of oil and gas leases, properties and reserves,
    equipment and labor required to explore, develop and operate
    those properties and the marketing of oil and natural gas
    production. Higher recent crude oil and natural gas prices have
    increased the costs of properties


available for acquisition and there are a greater number of
    companies with the financial resources to pursue acquisition
    opportunities. Many of our competitors have financial and other
    resources substantially larger than those we possess and have
    established strategic long-term positions and maintain strong
    governmental relationships in countries in which we may seek new
    entry. As a consequence, we may be at a competitive disadvantage
    in bidding for drilling rights. In addition, many of our larger
    competitors may have a competitive advantage when responding to
    factors that affect demand for oil and natural gas production,
    such as changing worldwide prices and levels of production, the
    cost and availability of alternative fuels and the application
    of government regulations. We also compete in attracting and
    retaining personnel, including geologists, geo-physicists,
    engineers and other specialists.

Insurance
    Does Not Cover All Risks

Exploration for and production of oil and natural gas can be
    hazardous, involving unforeseen occurrences such as blowouts,
    cratering, fires and loss of well control, which can result in
    damage to or destruction of wells or production facilities,
    injury to persons, loss of life, or damage to property or the
    environment. We maintain insurance against certain losses or
    liabilities arising from our operations in accordance with
    customary industry practices and in amounts that management
    believes to be prudent; however, insurance is not available to
    us against all operational risks.

In response to large underwriting losses caused by Hurricanes
    Katrina and Rita, the insurance industry has reduced capacity
    for windstorm damage and substantially increased premium rates.
    As a result, there is no assurance that Apache will be able to
    arrange insurance to cover fully its Gulf of Mexico exposures at
    a reasonable cost when the current policies expire.

UNRESOLVED
    SEC STAFF COMMENTS

As of December 31, 2006, we did not have any unresolved

The closing price per share of our common stock, as reported on
    the New York Stock Exchange Composite Transactions Reporting
    System for January 31, 2007, was $72.97. On
    January 31, 2007, there were 330,958,433 shares of our
    common stock outstanding held by approximately
    7,000 shareholders of record and approximately 319,000
    beneficial owners.

We have paid cash dividends on our common stock for 42
    consecutive years through December 31, 2006. When, and if,
    declared by our board of directors, future dividend payments
    will depend upon our level of earnings, financial requirements
    and other relevant factors.

In 1995, under our stockholder rights plan, each of our common
    stockholders received a dividend of one “preferred stock
    purchase right (a “right”)” for each 2.310
    outstanding shares of common stock (adjusted for subsequent
    stock dividends and a

two-for-one

stock split) that the stockholder owned. These rights were
    originally scheduled to expire on January 31, 2006.
    Effective as of that date, the rights were reset to one right
    per share of common stock and the expiration was extended to
    January 31, 2016. Unless the rights have been previously
    redeemed, all shares of Apache common stock are issued with
    rights and, the rights trade automatically with our shares of
    common stock. For a description of the rights, please refer to
    Note 8, Capital Stock of Item 15 in this

MANAGEMENT’S
    DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
    OPERATIONS

Overview

Apache Corporation (Apache or the Company) is an independent
    energy company whose principle business includes exploration,
    development and production of crude oil, natural gas and natural
    gas liquids. We operate in six countries: the United States,
    Canada, Egypt, Australia, offshore the United Kingdom in the
    North Sea, and Argentina.

In 2006, we earned $2.5 billion, within three percent of
    last year’s record earnings, despite a 19 percent
    decline in gas price realizations. Cash provided by operating
    activities totaled $4.3 billion, flat to 2005. We also set
    records for production and reserves with worldwide equivalent
    production increasing 10 percent, making 2006 the
    27th out of the last 28 years that we have reported
    production growth. Reserves grew nine percent, increasing in
    every core area, marking the 21st consecutive year of
    reserve growth at Apache.

Our growth strategy focuses on economic growth through drilling,
    acquisitions, or a combination of both, depending on, among
    other things, costs levels, potential rates of return and the
    availability of acquisition opportunities. We utilize a
    portfolio approach to provide diversity in terms of geologic
    risk, geographic location, hydrocarbon mix (crude oil and
    natural gas) and reserve life. This strategy provides multiple
    avenues for growth. We took several steps in 2006 to balance and
    grow our asset base. Outside of North America, we divested two
    assets: the undeveloped deepwater section of Egypt’s West
    Mediterranean Concession and our interest in the Zhao Dong block
    offshore the People’s Republic of China. To rebalance our
    international portfolio, we bolstered our position in Argentina
    purchasing an estimated 109 MMboe of reserves in two
    separate transactions. After increasing our production on these
    properties through active operations, Argentina is now our
    newest core area and we operate an


attractive property base that we believe has significant upside.
    In the U.S., we completed two strategic purchases strengthening
    our Permian basin and Gulf of Mexico positions. In January 2006,
    we purchased an estimated 31 MMboe of proved reserves in
    long life producing properties in the Permian basin of West
    Texas. The acquisition was balanced by purchasing 44 MMboe
    of shorter life, but higher

rate-of-return

reserves in the Gulf of Mexico. Worldwide, we purchased an
    estimated 196.5 MMboe of proved reserves. On the
    exploration and development side, we drilled 1,611 wells
    with an 87 percent success rate with active drilling
    programs in all core areas. We invested $3.7 billion in
    exploration and development activities, excluding asset
    retirement costs and capitalized interest, adding 224 MMboe
    in of estimated proved reserves. Our reserve life across our
    core areas spans from eight to twenty years, with a
    46 percent oil and 54 percent natural gas mix,
    consistent with yearend 2005.

Apache’s profitability is a function of commodity prices,
    the cost to add reserves through drilling and acquisitions and
    the cost to produce our reserves. Trends in commodity prices
    directly impact oil and gas revenues and demand for services and
    thus, have a significant impact on drilling and operating costs.
    We closely monitor trends in drilling costs in each of our core
    areas and the prices paid to acquire producing properties and,
    when appropriate, adjust our capital budgets.

Commodity prices are driven by the prevailing worldwide price
    for crude oil, spot prices applicable to our United States and
    Canadian natural gas production and many other factors beyond
    our control. Historically, these prices have been volatile and
    unpredictable, and 2006 was no exception. Our 2006 crude oil
    price realizations averaged $59.92 per barrel, up
    16 percent from 2005, ranging from an average monthly high
    of $68.59 per barrel in July to a low of $52.64 per
    barrel in October as demand waned in the U.S. with a delay
    in the onset of seasonal temperatures. Natural gas realizations
    were 19 percent lower than last year, averaging
    $5.17 per thousand cubic feet (Mcf), with a high of
    $8.05 per Mcf in January, and a low of $3.85 per Mcf
    in October.

A high drilling and operating cost environment once again
    challenged us in 2006, continuing the trend seen over the past
    few years. This upward trend is a reflection of increased demand
    driven by historically high commodity prices. In addition,
    repair activity from the 2005 Gulf of Mexico hurricanes also
    increased demand for services in the U.S., and accordingly,
    costs. Cost increases were reflected in nearly all of our
    drilling and lease operating cost components, including: rig
    rates, drill pipe costs, labor costs, chemical costs and the
    costs of power and fuel. The Company reviews costs for each core
    area on a routine basis and pursues alternatives in maintaining
    efficient levels of costs and expenses. Despite pressure from
    rising costs, 2006 margins, while down slightly from record 2005
    levels, were the second highest in our 50-plus-year history. For
    purposes of this discussion, margins are calculated as follows:

While the Company has made considerable progress recovering from
    the damage caused by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, which struck
    in late August and late September 2005, the hurricanes had
    considerable impact on both 2006 and 2005 operations and
    results, and will impact 2007 operations. In addition to
    extensive damage to Apache’s onshore and offshore Gulf of
    Mexico production and transportation facilities, third-party
    pipelines, terminals and processing facilities, which the
    Company relies upon to transport and process its crude oil and
    natural gas also sustained substantial damage. For a discussion
    of the impact on 2006 and 2005 operations and results refer to
    Results of Operations and Oil and Gas Capital Expenditures in
    this Item 7.

for segment information.


Acquisitions
    and Divestitures

2006 Acquisitions

U.S. Permian
    Basin

On January 5, 2006, the Company purchased Amerada
    Hess’s interest in eight fields located in the Permian
    basin of West Texas and New Mexico. The original purchase price
    was reduced from $404 million to $269 million because
    other interest owners exercised their preferential rights to
    purchase a number of the properties. The settlement price at
    closing of $239 million was adjusted for revenues and
    expenditures occurring between the effective date and the
    closing date of the acquisition. The acquired fields had
    estimated proved reserves of 27 MMbbls of liquid
    hydrocarbons and 27 Bcf of natural gas as of yearend 2005.

Argentina

On April 25, 2006, the Company acquired the operations of
    Pioneer Natural Resources (Pioneer) in Argentina for
    $675 million. The settlement price at closing, of
    $703 million, was adjusted for revenues and expenditures
    occurring between the effective date and closing date of the
    acquisition. The properties are located in the Neuquén,
    San Jorge and Austral basins of Argentina and had estimated
    net proved reserves of approximately 22 MMbbls of liquid
    hydrocarbons and 297 Bcf of natural gas as of
    December 31, 2005. Eight gas processing plants (five
    operated and three non-operated), 112 miles of operated
    pipelines in the Neuquén basin and 2,200 square miles
    of three-dimensional

(3-D)

seismic data were also included in the transactions. Apache
    financed the purchase with cash on hand and commercial paper.

The purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired and
    liabilities assumed based upon the estimated fair values as of
    the date of acquisition, as follows (in thousands):

On September 19, 2006, Apache acquired additional interests
    in (and now operates) seven concessions in the Tierra del Fuego
    Province from Pan American Fueguina S.R.L. (Pan American) for
    total consideration of $429 million. The settlement price
    at closing of $396 million was adjusted for normal closing
    items, including revenues and expenses between the effective
    date and the closing date of the acquisition. Apache financed
    the purchase with cash on hand and commercial paper.

The total cash consideration allocated below includes working
    capital balances purchased, asset retirement obligations assumed
    and an obligation to deliver specific gas volumes in the future.

Offshore
    Gulf of Mexico

In June 2006, the Company acquired the remaining producing
    properties of BP plc (BP) on the Outer Continental Shelf of the
    Gulf of Mexico. The original purchase price was reduced from
    $1.3 billion for 18 producing fields to $845 million
    because other interest owners exercised their preferential
    rights to purchase five of the 18 fields. The purchase price
    consisted of $747 million of proved property,
    $42 million of unproved property and $56 million of
    facilities. The settlement price on the date of closing of
    $821 million was adjusted primarily for revenues and
    expenditures occurring between the April 1, 2006 effective
    date and the closing date of the acquisition. The acquired
    properties include 13 producing fields (nine of which are
    operated) with estimated proved reserves of 19.5 MMbbls of
    liquid hydrocarbons and 148 Bcf of natural gas. Apache
    financed the purchase with cash on hand and commercial paper.

Pending
    Acquisition — U.S. Permian Basin

On January 18, 2007, the Company announced that it is
    acquiring controlling interest in 28 oil and gas fields in the
    Permian basin of West Texas from Anadarko Petroleum Corporation
    (Anadarko) for $1 billion. Apache estimates that these
    fields had proved reserves of 57 million barrels (MMbbls)
    of liquid hydrocarbons and 78 billion cubic feet (Bcf) of
    natural gas as of yearend 2006. The transaction will be
    effective the earlier of closing or March 31, 2007.
    Approximately 10 percent of the Permian basin properties
    are subject to third-party preferential purchase rights which,
    if exercised, would reduce the interests we purchase in those
    properties and the purchase price we would pay. The Company
    intends to fund the acquisition with debt. Apache and Anadarko
    are entering into a joint-venture arrangement to effect the
    transaction. In connection with the acquisition, the Company
    entered into cash flow hedges to protect against commodity price
    volatility. For the period of July 2007 through June 2010, the
    Company entered into hedges for a portion of both the oil and
    the natural gas with NYMEX based costless collars.

    Divestitures

On January 6, 2006, the Company completed the sale of its
    55 percent interest in the deepwater section of
    Egypt’s West Mediterranean Concession to Amerada Hess for
    $413 million. Apache did not have any proved reserves
    booked for these properties.

On August 8, 2006, the Company completed the sale of its
    24.5 percent interest in the Zhao Dong block offshore, the
    People’s Republic of China, to Australia-based ROC Oil
    Company Limited for $260 million, marking Apache’s
    exit from China. The effective date of the transaction was
    July 1, 2006. The Company recorded a gain of
    $174 million in the third quarter of 2006.

    Acquisitions

In May 2005, Apache signed a farm-in agreement with Exxon Mobil
    Corporation (ExxonMobil) covering approximately
    650,000 acres of undeveloped properties in the Western
    Canadian province of Alberta. Under the agreement, Apache is to
    drill and operate 145 new wells over a

36-month

period with upside potential for further drilling. ExxonMobil
    will retain a royalty on fee lands and a convertible working
    interest on leasehold acreage. The agreement also allows Apache
    to test additional horizons on approximately 140,000 acres
    of property covered in a 2004 farm-in agreement with ExxonMobil.

Revenues

Our revenues are sensitive to changes in prices received for our
    products. A substantial portion of our production is sold at
    prevailing market prices which fluctuate in response to many
    factors that are outside of our control. Given the current
    tightly balanced supply-demand market, small variations in
    either supply or demand, or both, can have dramatic effects on
    prices we receive for our oil and natural gas production.
    Political instability and availability of alternative fuels
    could impact worldwide supply, while other economic factors
    could impact demand.


Oil and
    Natural Gas Prices

While the market price received for crude oil and natural gas
    varies among geographic areas, crude oil trades in a worldwide
    market, whereas natural gas, which has a limited global
    transportation system, is subject to local supply and demand
    conditions. Consequently, price movements for all types and
    grades of crude oil generally move in the same direction, while
    natural gas price movements generally follow local market
    conditions.

Apache primarily sells its natural gas into four markets:

1)

North America, which has a common market and where supply and
    demand are currently tightly balanced, creating a volatile
    pricing environment;

2)

Australia, which has a local market with mostly fixed-price
    contracts;

3)

Egypt, which has a local market where the price received for our
    production is indexed to a weighted-average Dated-Brent crude
    oil price; most of which is subject to a ceiling of
    $2.65 per MMBtu at oil-prices of $21 per barrel or
    above; and

4)

Argentina, where the price we receive on a portion of our
    natural gas production is regulated by the government, at prices
    from $.38 to $1.40 per MMBtu. The volumes we are required to
    sell at regulated prices are set by the government and vary with
    seasonal factors. The remainder of the volumes are sold at
    market-driven prices, presently in excess of $2.00/MMBtu.

Contributions
    to Oil and Natural Gas Revenues

As with production and reserves, a consequence of geographic
    diversification is a shifting geographic mix of our oil revenues
    and natural gas revenues. For the reasons discussed in the Oil
    and Natural Gas Prices section above, contributions to oil
    revenues and gas revenues should be viewed separately.

The following table presents each segment’s oil revenues
    and gas revenues as a percentage of total oil revenues and gas
    revenues, respectively.

Crude Oil
    Contribution

In 2006, oil revenue contributions outside of North America were
    64 percent of our total consolidated oil revenues, equal to
    2005 contributions. Except for Australia, all core regions saw
    oil revenue growth in 2006 when compared to 2005. Egypt and the
    United States saw their contributions rise as their 2006 revenue
    gains, relative to 2005, outpaced gains in our other regions,
    benefiting from both higher relative oil prices and production.
    Argentina’s contribution increase in 2006, compared to
    2005, was virtually all attributable to the 2006 acquisitions
    discussed above, although the region also benefited from price
    improvement. The North Sea and Canada’s 2006 contributions
    fell because higher prices were somewhat neutralized by lower
    relative production and higher oil revenue in other core areas.

In 2005, oil revenue contributions from outside the
    U.S. rose six percent to 74 percent of our total
    consolidated oil revenues. Production growth and significantly
    higher price realizations drove the North Sea’s oil revenue
    contributions to 29 percent of consolidated oil revenues
    from 16 percent the prior year and were largely responsible
    for the growth of

non-U.S. oil

revenues. U.S. oil revenues made up 26 percent of 2005
    oil revenues, down six percent from 2004, a consequence of the
    2005 hurricane activity and the significant growth in North Sea
    production. Australia’s contribution to 2005 consolidated
    oil revenues fell to seven percent from 13 percent on a
    39 percent decrease in production compared to 2004.

Crude Oil
    Revenues

Crude oil revenues in 2006 increased $498 million from 2005
    to $4.9 billion. Price gains across all regions, which
    averaged $8.26 more per barrel than 2005, generated an
    additional $706 million of revenues. These additional
    revenues were partially offset by the effect on revenues from a
    four percent decline in production. All segments reported a
    significant increase in realized crude oil price, with
    Argentina, Egypt, and the U.S. also benefiting from
    production growth compared to 2005.

Egypt generated an additional $233 million of crude oil
    revenue in 2006 when compared to 2005. An 18 percent
    increase in crude oil price realizations, generated
    $200 million of the additional revenues, with the remainder
    coming from a three percent increase in production. While Egypt
    experienced production growth in many areas, the predominate
    contributor was the Khalda Concession which benefited from a
    full year of associated condensate related to increased Qasr
    field gas production.


U.S. crude oil revenues for 2006 increased
    $162 million compared to 2005, with a 13 percent
    increase in crude oil price realizations contributing
    $151 million of the additional revenues. A small increase
    in 2006 oil production, relative to 2005, contributed the
    remaining $11 million. The third-quarter 2005 hurricanes
    reduced Apache’s 2006 average annual daily crude oil
    production 13,100 barrels per day (b/d), compared to 10,813
    b/d in 2005. Shut-in production reduced the Company’s 2006
    and 2005 crude oil revenues by approximately $297 million
    and $186 million, respectively. Central region production
    rose 18 percent, reflecting drilling and recompletion
    activity in the Permian basin and Southeast New Mexico, and the
    Amerada Hess acquired properties. Gulf Coast production was
    10 percent below 2005 levels with downtime, hurricane
    production shut-ins and natural decline outpacing growth
    attributed to drilling and recompletion activity and the BP
    acquired properties. The Gulf Coast region’s fourth-quarter
    2006 production averaged 43,995 b/d compared to 23,487 b/d in
    the comparable 2005 quarter, a testament to the progress in
    returning hurricane damaged properties to production during
    2006, as well as the benefit of the BP acquired properties.

Argentina’s 2006 oil revenues increased $91 million
    over 2005 with $89 million of the increase associated with
    production growth, driven primarily by acquired properties and
    subsequent exploitation activities. Higher oil price
    realizations generated the other $2 million.

The North Sea’s 2006 crude oil revenues were
    $80 million higher than 2005 with $240 million of
    additional revenues generated from a 19 percent increase in
    price realizations, partially offset by lower production, which
    was down 11 percent on a comparative basis. Production was
    lower in 2006 primarily because of production interruptions
    associated with commissioning of major infrastructure projects
    and temporary unplanned shutdown of the third-party Forties
    Pipeline System during the third quarter of 2006. The focus in
    2006 on upgrades also displaced drilling operations necessary to
    mitigate natural decline.

Canada’s 2006 oil revenues increased $17 million over
    2005, with $56 million of additional revenues associated
    with higher price realizations, partially offset by lower
    production, which was down eight percent. Canada production was
    down in most areas as natural decline exceeded drilling and
    production enhancement activities.

Australia’s 2006 crude oil revenues were $27 million
    less than 2005, reflecting a 23 percent decline in
    production and an 18 percent increase in realized price.
    The production decrease resulted from normal field decline which
    offset a full year of associated condensate production from the
    John Brookes field and other development activities, mainly in
    the Bambra, Zephyrus and Stag areas.

China’s 2006 oil revenues were $59 million less than
    2005, a consequence of the August 2006 divestiture.

Apache manages a small portion of its exposure to fluctuations
    in crude oil prices using financial derivatives. Approximately
    nine percent of our worldwide crude oil production was subject
    to financial derivative hedges in 2006, compared to six percent
    in 2005. (See Note 3, Hedging and Derivative Instruments,
    of this

Form 10-K

for a summary of the current derivative positions and terms.)
    These financial derivative instruments reduced our 2006 and 2005
    worldwide realized prices $1.37 and $.68 per barrel,
    respectively.

Natural
    Gas Contribution

Our North American operations contributed 83 percent of
    2006 consolidated natural gas revenues, down five percent
    from 2005. All core gas producing regions generated additional
    revenues in 2006 on production growth. However, these
    incremental production revenues were all but eliminated by the
    effect of lower prices, especially in our North American
    regions, where prices are typically higher, but more volatile,
    than our other regions. Revenues in the U.S. and Canada dropped
    in 2006 on a comparative basis, while all other core gas
    producing regions experienced an increase in revenue.
    Egypt’s contribution to 2006 consolidated gas revenues rose
    three percent in 2006, compared to 2005, while Australia’s
    contribution increased one percent. Argentina contributed one
    percent of consolidated gas revenues.

In 2005, 88 percent of Apache’s natural gas revenues
    came from North America, 54 percent from the U.S. and
    34 percent from Canada. The U.S. contribution
    decreased four percent from 2004, primarily because of
    production declines, the impact Hurricanes Katrina and Rita had
    on U.S. Gulf of Mexico revenues, and the additional
    revenues generated by Canada and Egypt. Our U.S. Gulf Coast
    region, which contributed 63 percent of Apache’s
    U.S. 2005


production, down six percent from 2004, is characterized by
    reservoirs which demonstrate high initial production rates
    followed by steep declines when compared to most other
    U.S. producing areas. Canada’s contribution was up
    five percent from 2004 resulting from 14 percent production
    growth and higher price gains, relative to other areas.
    Egypt’s contribution to total gas revenues decreased
    slightly to nine percent from 10 percent in 2004.
    Australia’s contribution to 2005 natural gas revenues
    remained the same as 2004 at three percent.

Natural
    Gas Revenues

Our 2006 consolidated natural gas revenues increased
    $73 million from the prior year with $614 million of
    additional revenues generated from production growth mostly
    offset by the effect of a 19 percent decline in realized
    prices. All core gas producing regions generated additional
    revenues in 2006 from production growth; however they were
    mostly offset by lower relative natural gas prices.

Egypt contributed $73 million more to 2006 consolidated
    natural gas revenues compared to 2005 on a 31 percent
    increase in production and a four percent decrease in realized
    gas prices. The

year-over-year

production growth came primarily from the Khalda concession,
    mostly attributable to a full year of production from the Qasr
    field.

Argentina’s 2006 natural gas revenues increased
    $38 million compared to 2005, with all of the additional
    revenues associated with production growth. As with oil, the
    production growth primarily came from acquired properties and
    subsequent exploitation activities.

Australia’s 2006 natural gas revenues were $35 million
    higher than 2005. Natural gas production increases added
    $38 million to revenues, while lower gas price realizations
    reduced revenues $3 million. The additional production was
    attributed to a full year of production from the John Brookes
    field.

U.S. natural gas revenues were $17 million higher in
    2006 than 2005. U.S. natural gas production, up
    12 percent, contributed $166 million of additional
    revenues, while a nine percent price decline lowered revenues
    $149 million, when compared to 2005. The 2005 hurricanes
    reduced Apache’s 2006 average annual daily natural gas
    production 37 MMcf/d compared to 59 MMcf/d in 2005.
    Shut-in production from the hurricanes reduced the
    Company’s 2006 and 2005 natural gas revenues by
    approximately $95 million and $211 million,
    respectively. Central region production rose 16 percent
    from 2005, benefiting from drilling and recompletion activity,
    primarily in Central and Western Oklahoma, in East Texas, and
    from acquired properties. Gulf Coast region production was nine
    percent above year-ago levels on the BP acquired properties,
    hurricane restoration, and drilling and recompletion activity,
    principally in the Chauvin, Ship Shoal and South Timbalier
    fields.

Canada’s 2006 natural gas revenues decreased
    $91 million from 2005. An additional $72 million of
    revenues generated from a nine percent increase in production
    were more than offset by the impact of a 16 percent
    decrease in realized natural gas prices. Canada’s
    production growth was concentrated in the North and South Grant
    Lands and Kabob areas, with activity in other areas more than
    offset by natural decline.

Our 2005 natural gas revenues increased $711 million with a
    $1.44 per Mcf increase in our average natural gas price
    realizations generating an additional $652 million of
    revenues. Higher production added the remaining
    $59 million. While all of our operating segments reported
    an increase in natural gas price realizations, most of the
    additional revenues attributable to price came from the U.S. and
    Canada as prices skyrocketed following the Gulf of Mexico
    hurricanes. The additional revenues attributable to production
    were primarily generated in Egypt, where natural gas production
    increased 20 percent, reflecting the success of our
    drilling program. Canada and Australia also contributed to
    increased production revenues with production growth of
    14 percent and four percent, respectively. Canada’s
    increase was from new wells, while Australia’s increase was
    driven by higher customer demand and new contractual sales.
    Partially offsetting these additional production revenues was an
    eight percent decrease in U.S. production, primarily in the
    Gulf Coast region, related to the impact of the 2005 hurricanes
    and natural decline in mature fields.

The majority of our worldwide gas sales contracts are indexed to
    prevailing local market prices. As a result Apache uses a
    variety of strategies to manage its exposure to fluctuations in
    natural gas prices including fixed-price contracts and
    derivatives. In the U.S. and Canada most of our gas is sold on a
    monthly basis at either monthly or daily market prices; however,
    during 2006 and 2005, approximately eight percent and
    10 percent of our U.S. natural


gas production, respectively, was subject to long-term,
    fixed-price physical contracts. These contracts provide a
    measure of protection to the Company in the event of decreasing
    natural gas prices. These fixed-price contracts reduced our 2006
    and 2005 worldwide realized natural gas prices by $.10 per
    Mcf and $.19 per Mcf, respectively. In Australia, nearly
    all of our natural gas production is subject to long-term
    fixed-price contracts that are periodically adjusted for changes
    in Australia’s consumer price index. The majority of
    Egypt’s gas is sold to Egyptian General Petroleum
    Corporation (EGPC) under an Industry Pricing Formula tied to
    Dated Brent crude oil with a maximum price of $2.65 per
    MMbtu. However, in certain concessions Apache has retained a
    higher gas price formula until 2013 for up to 100 MMcf/d
    produced.

Approximately eight percent of our worldwide natural gas
    production was subject to financial derivative hedges for 2006
    compared to nine percent in 2005. These financial derivative
    instruments reduced our 2006 and 2005 consolidated realized
    prices $.05 per Mcf and $.15 per Mcf, respectively.

    Item 15 in this

Depreciation,
    Depletion and Amortization

Apache’s Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization
    (DD&A) of oil and gas properties is calculated using the
    Units of Production Method (UOP). The UOP calculation in
    simplest terms multiplies the percentage of estimated proved
    reserves produced each quarter times the costs of those
    reserves. The result is to recognize expense at the same pace
    that the reservoirs are actually depleting. The costs in the UOP
    calculation include both the net capitalized amounts on the
    balance sheet, and the estimated future costs to access and
    develop reserves needing additional facilities, equipment or
    downhole work in order to produce. Under the full-cost method of
    accounting, the DD&A calculation is prepared separately for
    each country in which Apache operates. Absolute DD&A
    determines the expense reported each period, while the cost per
    unit of production (DD&A rate) provides insight into the
    overall costs of the Company’s reserves growth. Current
    costs incurred to drill or acquire additional reserves that are
    higher than the historical cost level raises the overall
    DD&A rate. Conversely, if reserves are added in the current
    period at a rate per unit less than existing levels, they
    average down the Company’s DD&A rate. Changes from
    period to period in absolute DD&A expense are determined by
    production levels, the mix of production (high cost country
    versus a low cost country) and the impact of recent spending
    (higher or lower DD&A rates).

Our 2006 full-cost DD&A expense totaled $1.7 billion,
    $374 million more than 2005. Our 2006 full-cost DD&A
    rate of $9.29 per boe was $1.30 per boe more than
    2005, reflecting rising acquisition costs, higher


abandonment cost estimates, rising industry-wide drilling and
    finding costs, especially in the U.S. and Canada, and
    incremental future development costs associated with recent
    acquisitions and newly identified development projects. The
    increase in costs, including increased estimates of future
    development costs, is related to increased demand for drilling
    and associated services, a consequence of both higher oil and
    gas prices and additional demand resulting from the ongoing need
    to repair damage caused by hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005.
    The increase in 2006 DD&A, relative to 2005 was mitigated by
    a decline in Egypt resulting from the January 2006 sale of
    Egypt’s deepwater acreage. Our 2006 full-cost DD&A
    expense was $73 million lower because of the production
    shut-in for hurricane damage.

Our 2005 full-cost DD&A expense totaled $1.3 billion,
    $176 million more than 2004. Our 2005 full-cost DD&A
    rate of $7.99 per boe was $.98 per boe more than 2004,
    driven by rising industry-wide drilling costs, especially in the
    U.S., Canada, the North Sea and Egypt. Higher commodity prices
    experienced throughout 2005, as well as the affect of the 2005
    U.S. hurricanes, led to increased demand for drilling
    services and thus higher current drilling costs and higher
    estimated future development costs. The North Sea’s impact
    on our consolidated rate reflects the continuation of facility
    upgrades undertaken during 2005 to improve the overall
    efficiency of platforms. Our 2005 full-cost DD&A expense was
    $57 million lower because of the production shut-in for
    hurricane damage.

Depreciation of other assets increased $27 million in 2006,
    reflecting ongoing development of infrastructure in Canada that
    began in 2005 to accommodate development on the acquired
    ExxonMobil acreage, and the Qasr field support facilities in
    Egypt, including completion of the Tarek gas plant inter-connect.

Depreciation of other assets increased $18 million in 2005,
    reflecting new infrastructure built in Canada to accommodate
    development on acreage acquired from ExxonMobil in 2004 and new
    Qasr natural gas facilities in Egypt.

Impairments

We assess all of our unproved properties for possible impairment
    on a quarterly basis based on geological trend analysis, dry
    holes or relinquishment of acreage. When impairment occurs,
    costs associated with these properties are generally transferred
    to our proved property base where they become subject to
    amortization. Impairments in international areas without proved
    reserves are charged to earnings upon determination that
    impairment has occurred.

Goodwill is subject to a periodic fair-value-based impairment
    assessment. Goodwill totaled $189 million on
    December 31, 2006, and no impairment was recorded in 2006,
    2005 or 2004. For further discussion, see Note 1, Summary
    of Significant Accounting Policies of Item 15 in this

Form 10-K.

Lease
    Operating Costs

Lease operating expenses (LOE) are comprised of several
    components: direct operating costs, repair and maintenance,
    workover costs and ad valorem taxes.

LOE rates are driven by the underlying commodity price levels,
    whether oil or gas is produced, level of workover activity and
    geographical location of the properties. Commodity prices have a
    significant impact on operating cost elements; both directly and
    indirectly. They directly impact costs such as power, fuel,
    chemicals and ad valorem taxes, which are commodity price based.
    The remaining elements, which include among other things, labor,
    services and equipment, are indirectly impacted by high price
    environments which drive up activity and demand and therefore,
    increase costs. All components of LOE have been rising
    throughout the industry for several years with historically
    strong oil and gas prices. Also, oil is inherently more
    expensive to produce than natural gas. Repair and maintenance
    costs are higher on offshore properties and in areas with remote
    plants and facilities. Workovers allow us to exploit our
    existing reserve base by accelerating production, taking
    advantage of high prices. Fluctuations in exchange rates impact
    the Company’s LOE, with a weakening U.S. dollar adding
    to per unit costs and a stronger U.S. dollar lowering per
    unit costs.

The Company reviews production costs in each of its core areas
    on a monthly basis and pursues alternatives to maintain
    efficient levels of costs. The following discussion will focus
    on per unit operating costs as management believes this is the
    most informative method of analyzing LOE trends.


Rising per unit cost remained a challenge in 2006 with LOE
    averaging $7.45 per boe, $1.18 per boe higher than 2005.
    The 2005 hurricanes increased our worldwide rate by $.44 and
    $.41 per boe in 2006 and 2005, respectively, a reflection
    of shut-in production and additional expenses in excess of our
    insurance coverage. The remainder of the increase was driven by
    industry-wide cost increases, as discussed above, workover
    activity, a weaker U.S. dollar relative to the Canadian
    dollar and British Pound and higher non-hurricane related repair
    costs in our U.S. Gulf Coast and Canadian regions.

Regionally, 2006 LOE was up from 2005 as follows:

U.S.

— The U.S. added $.63 per boe to
    the 2006 worldwide rate. The Central region added $.04 per
    boe, with production growth nearly outpacing increases in costs,
    while the Gulf Coast region added $.59 per boe. In addition
    to the impact of industry-wide cost increases, activity levels
    soared in the Gulf of Mexico as producers continue to repair and
    restore production following the 2005 hurricanes. This increase
    in demand on top of an already tight-supply market for boats,
    helicopters, divers, labor, equipment and parts to complete
    repairs, pushed costs even higher in the region. The
    region’s fourth-quarter 2006 LOE included approximately
    $26 million for repairs in excess of insurance coverage. We
    will incur an estimated $60 million of additional LOE
    expenses to complete the repairs during the first half of 2007.
    The 2006 rate increase was also impacted by additional workover
    activity, higher insurance rates and more non-hurricane repair
    costs, relative to 2005.

Canada

— Canada added $.40 per boe to the
    2006 worldwide rate. Higher costs added $.46 per boe,
    however, higher production offset $.06 of that increase.
    Twenty-two percent of the increase in Canada’s rate was
    attributed to the strengthening Canadian dollar. The balance
    related to a higher level of workover activity, higher repair
    and maintenance costs, reclamation and restoration projects
    undertaken during 2006 and the general rise in costs, including
    increases in power rates, contract labor and fuel.

Egypt

— Egypt added $.02 to the 2006 worldwide
    rate as a $32 million increase in costs, including
    increased workover activity, was mostly offset by associated
    production growth.

Australia

— Australia reduced the 2006
    worldwide rate $.11 per boe with production growth more
    than offsetting associated incremental operating costs.

North Sea

— The North Sea added $.37 per
    boe to the 2006 consolidated rate, with approximately two-thirds
    of the increase in rate related to lower relative production,
    the strengthening British Pound and an increase in pension
    liabilities. The balance of the increase in costs related to
    major 2006 turnaround activity, higher fuel rates and usage as
    major projects were commissioned, and higher maintenance and
    repair activity, relative to 2005.

Argentina

— Argentina reduced the 2006
    consolidated rate $.19 per boe with production growth
    related to the 2006 acquisitions more than offsetting associated
    incremental operating costs.

On a per unit produced basis, 2005 LOE averaged $6.27 per
    boe, $1.00 per boe higher than 2004. Production shut-ins
    and additional insurance costs associated with the 2005
    hurricanes added $.41 to the 2005 rate. The remaining increase
    reflects higher service costs associated with rising commodity
    prices and the associated increase in demand for services, an
    increase in workover activity, higher repair and maintenance
    costs and the impact a weaker U.S. dollar had on Canadian
    LOE. The slight strengthening against the Australian dollar and
    British pound had less impact on LOE.

Regionally, 2005 LOE was up as follows:

U.S.

— The U.S. added $.77 per boe to
    the 2005 consolidated rate with nearly one-third of the impact
    attributed to the additional insurance costs and production
    shut-ins caused by the 2005 hurricanes. Higher contract labor
    costs, workover activity, repair and maintenance, and various
    other commodity-price driven service costs accounted for the
    remaining impact. Gulf Coast region LOE included approximately
    $30 million for insurance deductibles and additional
    premiums assessed by OIL.

Australia

— Australia added $.15 per boe
    to the 2005 consolidated rate on a 20 percent drop in
    equivalent production. Australia also saw a rise in insurance
    cost. Lower production added $.13 per boe to the 2005
    consolidated rate, while additional costs added $.02 per
    boe.


Canada

— Canada added $.21 per boe to the
    2005 consolidated rate increase, with costs adding $.27 per
    boe, partially offset by the impact of higher volumes, which
    reduced the rate $.06 per boe. 2005 costs were up
    $44 million from 2004, with 42 percent attributable to
    the strengthening Canadian dollar. The balance related to
    various other costs associated with an increase in activity and
    the general rise in costs, including higher contract labor,
    power and fuel, repair and maintenance and workover costs.

Egypt

— Egypt’s 2005 costs were
    $23 million higher than 2004 on higher diesel fuel costs,
    an increase in workover activity, higher labor costs and
    insurance costs. The diesel fuel costs were previously
    subsidized by the Egyptian government. Egypt added $.04 per
    boe to the consolidated rate increase, with higher costs adding
    $.14 per boe and increased volumes lowering the rate
    $.10 per boe.

North Sea

— The North Sea reduced the 2005
    consolidated rate $.16 per boe on a 24 percent
    increase in production, partially offset by a two percent
    increase in costs. North Sea costs were up on increased repair
    and maintenance activity.

Gathering
    and Transportation Costs

Apache generally sells oil and natural gas under two types of
    agreements, typical in our industry. Both types of agreements
    include a transportation charge. One is a netback arrangement,
    under which Apache sells oil or natural gas at the wellhead and
    collects a price, net of transportation incurred by the
    purchaser. In this case, the Company records sales at the price
    received from the purchaser, which is net of transportation
    costs. Under the other arrangement, Apache sells oil or natural
    gas at a specific delivery point, pays transportation to a
    third-party carrier and receives from the purchaser a price with
    no transportation deduction. In this case, the Company records
    the transportation cost as gathering and transportation costs.
    The Company’s treatment of transportation costs is pursuant
    to Emerging Issues Task Force Issue

00-10,

“Accounting for Shipping and Handling Fees and Costs”
    and as a result a portion of our transporting costs is reflected
    in sales prices and a portion is reflected as Gathering and
    Transportation Costs rendering the separately identified
    transportation costs incomplete.

In both the U.S. and Canada, Apache sells oil and natural gas
    under both types of arrangements. In the North Sea, Apache
    pays transportation to a third-party carrier and receives a
    purchase price with no transportation deduction. In Australia,
    oil and natural gas are sold under netback arrangements. In
    Egypt, our oil and natural gas production has historically been
    sold to EGPC under netback arrangements. During 2005 and 2006,
    Apache exported a portion of its Egyptian crude oil under both
    types of arrangements. Future export cargoes may be sold at the
    loading port or Apache may arrange shipping and receive prices
    which include transportation. The following table presents
    gathering and transportation costs paid directly by Apache to
    third-party carriers for each of the periods presented.

These costs are primarily related to the transportation of
    natural gas in our North American operations, North Sea
    crude oil sales and Egyptian crude oil exports. The four percent
    increase in costs for 2006 was driven primarily by
    U.S. production growth and Egyptian crude exports.


Transportation costs in 2005 increased 22 percent from 2004
    driven primarily by the North Sea’s production growth and
    Egyptian crude exports. Apache began exporting Egyptian crude in
    the second half of 2004 and first incurred third-party
    transportation charges in early 2005.

Severance
    and Other Taxes

Severance and other taxes are primarily comprised of severance
    taxes on properties onshore and in state or provincial waters in
    the U.S. and Australia, and the United Kingdom (U.K.) Petroleum
    Revenue Tax (PRT). Severance taxes are generally based on a
    percentage of oil and gas production revenues, while the U.K.
    PRT is assessed on net receipts (revenues less qualifying
    operating costs and capital spending) from the Forties field in
    the U.K. North Sea. We are also subject to the Australian
    Petroleum Resources Rent Tax (PRRT), and various Canadian taxes
    including the Freehold Mineral Tax, Saskatchewan Capital Tax and
    Saskatchewan Resource Surtax. The Canadian Federal Large
    Corporation Tax was phased out in 2006. The table below presents
    a comparison of these expenses.

Severance and other taxes totaled $554 million in 2006,
    $101 million greater than 2005. U.K. PRT increased
    $109 million in 2006 on a six percent increase in revenue
    and a 21 percent decrease in qualifying capital spending.
    Australia’s severance taxes declined on lower revenues
    associated with lower oil production. Canada’s severance
    taxes decreased $6 million with the phase out of the
    federal large corporation tax. Other taxes increased
    $13 million on additional U.S. franchise taxes,
    consistent with our growth and a $5 million special profits
    charge levied on petroleum revenues by the Chinese government.

In 2005, severance and other taxes increased $359 million.
    U.K. PRT increased $346 million in 2005 on significantly
    higher oil price realizations and higher production.
    U.S. severance taxes increased $36 million on higher
    oil and gas prices. Australia’s taxes decreased
    $24 million reflecting lower excise tax on declining
    production from the Legendre field.

General
    and Administrative Expenses

General and administrative expenses (G&A) averaged
    $1.16 per boe for 2006, $.04 per boe less than 2005.
    Absolute costs increased $13 million to $211 million.
    The additional cost in 2006 was primarily associated with
    expansion of international operations in conjunction with
    acquisitions and increasing insurance costs.

G&A of $1.20 per boe in 2005 increased $.14 per
    boe over 2004. Absolute costs increased $25 million, or
    14 percent. Nearly three-fourths of the increase in

year-over-year

costs related to the impact of Apache’s stock-based
    compensation programs. Stock-based compensation costs increased
    relative to the prior year because of new stock option grants
    issued in 2005, a new targeted stock plan approved by
    stockholders in May 2005, and the impact Apache’s rising
    common stock price had on stock-based compensation expense. The
    balance of the G&A increase was primarily attributed to the
    increased cost of insurance, a consequence of the hurricanes,
    higher charitable contributions and higher Sarbanes-Oxley
    compliance audit fees.

Financing
    Costs, Net

The major components of financing costs, net, include interest
    expense and capitalized interest.


Net financing costs for 2006 were $26 million higher than
    in 2005. Gross interest expense increased $42 million in
    2006 as a result of a higher average debt balance and higher
    short-term interest rates. Capitalized interest increased
    $4 million, a result of a higher average unproved property
    balance. Interest income rose $10 million compared to 2005
    on higher cash balances. Our weighted-average cost of borrowing
    on December 31, 2006 was 6.3 percent compared to
    6.7 percent on December 31, 2005.

Net financing costs in 2005 were slightly lower than 2004. Gross
    interest expense increased $7 million in 2005, on a higher
    average debt balance. This was mostly offset by a
    $6 million increase in the amount of interest capitalized
    as a result of a higher average unproved property balance. Our
    weighted-average cost of borrowing was 6.7 percent on
    December 31, 2005 and 6.1 percent on December 31,
    2004.

Provision
    for Income Taxes

Income tax expense for 2006 totaled $1.5 billion,
    $125 million less than 2005. The effective tax rate for
    2006 was 36.3 percent, down from 37.6 percent in 2005.
    The 2006 effective rate was impacted by a combination of federal
    and provincial tax rate reductions enacted by Canada during the
    second quarter of 2006, a 10 percent increase in the oil
    and gas company supplemental tax enacted by the U.K. during the
    third quarter of 2006 and the gain recognized on the sale of
    China, as discussed below. Currency fluctuations had a
    negligible impact on the 2006 effective tax rate.

The effective income tax rate for 2006 was impacted by the gain
    recognized in conjunction with divestment of operations in
    China. The Company intends to permanently reinvest earnings of
    its foreign subsidiaries and as such, has not recorded
    U.S. income tax expense on any undistributed foreign
    earnings, including the gain from the China sale.

Income tax expense in 2005 of $1.6 billion was
    $590 million or 20 percent higher than 2004. The
    higher taxes were driven by higher taxable income related to
    increased oil and gas revenues in 2005, compared to 2004. Our
    effective tax rate was 37.6 percent in 2005 compared to
    37.3 percent in 2004. Currency fluctuations added
    $13 million of additional deferred tax expense to 2005 and
    $58 million to 2004. For a discussion of Apache’s
    sensitivity to foreign currency fluctuations, please refer to

Overview

Apache’s primary uses of cash are exploration, development
    and acquisition of oil and gas properties, costs and expenses
    necessary to maintain continued operations, repayment of
    principal and interest on outstanding debt and payment of
    dividends.

Our business, as with other extractive industries, is a
    depleting one in which each barrel produced must be replaced or
    the Company, and a critical source of our future liquidity, will
    shrink. Cash investments are continuously required to fund
    exploration and development projects and acquisitions which are
    necessary to offset the inherent declines in production and
    proven reserves. See Item 1 and 2, Business and
    Properties, “Risks Factors,” in this

Form 10-K.

Future success in maintaining and growing reserves and
    production will be highly dependent on having


adequate capital resources available, on our success in both
    exploration and development activities and on acquiring
    additional reserves.

Our 2006 yearend reserve life index indicates an average
    decline of 7.9 percent per year. This projection is based
    on prices at yearend 2006, except in those instances where
    future natural gas and oil sales are covered by physical
    contract terms providing for higher or lower prices, estimates
    of investments required to develop estimated proved undeveloped
    reserves, and costs and taxes reflected in our standardized
    measure in Note 13, Supplemental Oil and Gas Disclosures
    (Unaudited) of Item 15 in this

Form 10-K.

The Company funds its exploration and development activities
    primarily through net cash provided by operating activities
    (cash flow) and budgets capital expenditures based on projected
    cash flow. Our cash flow, both in the short and long-term, is
    impacted by highly volatile oil and natural gas prices,
    production levels, industry trends impacting operating expenses
    and our ability to continue to acquire or find high-margin
    reserves at competitive prices. For these reasons, we only
    forecast, for internal use by management, an annual cash flow.
    Longer-term cash flow and capital spending projections are not
    used by management to operate our business. The annual cash flow
    forecasts are revised monthly in response to changing market
    conditions and production projections. Apache routinely adjusts
    capital expenditure budgets in response to the adjusted cash
    flow forecasts and market trends in drilling and acquisitions
    costs.

The Company has historically utilized internally generated cash
    flow, committed and uncommitted credit facilities and access to
    both debt and equity capital markets for all other liquidity and
    capital resources needs. Because of the liquidity and capital
    resources alternatives available to Apache, including internally
    generated cash flows, Apache’s management believes that its
    short-term and long-term liquidity will be adequate to fund
    operations, including its capital spending program, repayment of
    debt maturities and any amounts that may ultimately be paid in
    connection with contingencies.

The Company’s ratio of current assets to current
    liabilities was .65 on December 31, 2006 compared to .99 at
    the end of 2005. Current liabilities increased 74 percent
    ($1.6 billion) in 2006 versus a 15 percent
    ($328 million) increase in current assets. Changes in our
    current debt particularly impacted the ratio. The Company had
    $1.6 billion of commercial paper outstanding at the end of
    2006 that was subsequently reduced with proceeds from
    $1.5 billion of long-term debt issued in January 2007.
    Also, another $173 million of debt is payable in 2007. The
    current ARO liability of $377 million, an increase of
    $283 million over 2005, reflects the cost expected to be
    incurred over the next 12 months to abandon the platforms
    damaged by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. The increase in current
    liabilities was partially offset by overall decreases in our
    current derivative payable, the U.K. PRT liability, accrued
    income taxes, and accounts payable of $186 million,
    $175 million, $118 million and $70 million,
    respectively. Collectively, the increase in liabilities more
    than offset the higher current asset balances. The current
    derivative receivable increased $123 million, reflecting
    changes in oil and gas strip pricing. Current accounts
    receivables increased $207 million, or 14 percent,
    most of which was related to oil receivables impacted by higher
    oil prices. The remaining current asset categories, inventories,
    cash and drilling advances, decreased $45 million from 2005.

Net Cash
    Provided by Operating Activities

Apache’s net cash provided by operating activities totaled
    $4.3 billion in both 2006 and 2005. For a detailed
    discussion of commodity prices, production, costs and expenses,
    please refer to the Results of Operations section of this
    Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
    Financial Condition and Results of Operations. For a detailed
    discussion of changes in current assets and current liabilities
    please refer to the discussion under the Overview of this
    Capital and Liquidity section.

Apache’s net cash provided by operating activities during
    2005 totaled $4.3 billion, up from $3.2 billion in
    2004. The increase in 2005 cash flow was attributed primarily to
    the significant increase in commodity prices. The Company’s
    average realized oil and natural gas prices increased
    47 percent and 29 percent, respectively; a reflection
    of higher worldwide commodity prices. Higher production also
    added to our 2005 cash flow relative to 2004, albeit to a much
    less extent. These increases in cash flow were partially offset
    by higher production costs attributable to the effect of
    increased commodity prices, costs related to Hurricanes Katrina
    and Rita and an increase in exchange rates in Canada.


Historically, fluctuations in commodity prices have been the
    primary reason for the Company’s short-term changes in cash
    flow from operating activities. Sales volume changes have also
    impacted cash flow in the short-term, but have not been as
    volatile as commodity prices. Apache’s long-term cash flow
    from operating activities is dependent on commodity prices,
    reserve replacement and the level of costs and expenses required
    for continued operations.

Debt

We exited 2006 with a

debt-to-capitalization

ratio of approximately 22 percent, compared to
    17 percent at the end of 2005. Yearend 2006 outstanding
    current and long-term debt totaled $3.8 billion,
    $1.6 billion higher than yearend 2005. The increase was
    associated with the issuance of commercial paper in conjunction
    with $2.4 billion of acquisitions. The Company’s
    outstanding debt consisted of notes and debentures maturing in
    the years 2007 through 2096. Approximately $1.8 billion of
    our total debt is due in 2007. This debt consists of
    $1.6 billion of commercial paper, that was subsequently
    reduced with $1.5 billion of

long-term

debt issued in January 2007, and $170 million of Apache
    Finance Australia 6.5-percent notes and various money market
    lines of credit in Argentina and the U.S. The $1.6 billion
    of commercial paper is fully supported by available borrowing
    capacity under committed credit facilities which expire in 2011.
    An additional $100 million in debt matures in 2009 with the
    remaining $1.9 billion maturing thereafter.

On January 26, 2007, the Company issued $500 million
    principal amount, $499.5 million net of discount, of senior
    unsecured 5.625-percent notes maturing January 15,
    2017. The Company also issued $1.0 billion principal
    amount, $993 million net of discount, of senior unsecured
    6.0-percent notes maturing January 15, 2037. The notes
    are redeemable, as a whole or in part, at Apache’s option,
    subject to a make-whole premium. The proceeds were used to repay
    a portion of the Company’s outstanding commercial paper and
    for general corporate purposes. Please refer to Note 5
    Debt, Subsequent Debt of Item 15 in this

Form 10-K.

In May 2006, the Company amended its existing five-year
    revolving U.S. credit facility which was scheduled to
    mature on May 28, 2009. The amendment: (a) extended
    the maturity to May 28, 2011, (b) increased the size
    of the facility from $750 million to $1.5 billion, and
    (c) reduced the facility fees from .08 percent to
    .06 percent and reduced the margin over LIBOR on loans from
    .27 percent to .19 percent. The lenders also extended
    the maturity dates of the $150 million Canadian facility,
    the $150 million Australian facility and $385 million
    of the $450 million U.S. credit facility, for an
    additional year to May 12, 2011 from May 12, 2010. The
    Company also increased commercial paper availability to
    $1.95 billion from $1.20 billion.

By yearend 2006, the Company extended the maturity of another
    $50 million of commitments under the $450 million
    U.S. credit facility for an additional year. As a result,
    $435 million will mature on May 12, 2011, and
    $15 million will mature on May 12, 2010.

The financial covenants of the credit facilities require the
    Company to maintain a

debt-to-capitalization

ratio of not greater than 60 percent at the end of any
    fiscal quarter. The negative covenants include restrictions on
    the Company’s ability to create liens and security
    interests on our assets, with exceptions for liens typically
    arising in the oil and gas industry, purchase money liens and
    liens arising as a matter of law, such as tax and mechanics
    liens. The Company may incur liens on assets located in the
    U.S., Canada and Australia of up to five percent of the
    Company’s consolidated assets. There are no restrictions on
    incurring liens in countries other than the U.S., Canada and
    Australia. There are also restrictions on Apache’s ability
    to merge with another entity, unless the Company is the
    surviving entity, and a restriction on our ability to guarantee
    debt of entities not within our consolidated group.

There are no clauses in the facilities that permit the lenders
    to accelerate payments or refuse to lend based on unspecified
    material adverse changes (MAC clauses). The credit facility
    agreements do not have drawdown restrictions or prepayment
    obligations in the event of a decline in credit ratings.
    However, the agreements allow the lenders to accelerate payments
    and terminate lending commitments if Apache Corporation, or any
    of its U.S., Canadian and Australian subsidiaries, defaults on
    any direct payment obligation in excess of $100 million or
    has any unpaid, non-appealable judgment against it in excess of
    $100 million. The Company was in compliance with the terms
    of the credit facilities as of December 31, 2006.


Stock
    Transactions

On April 19, 2006, the Company announced that its Board of
    Directors authorized the purchase of up to 15 million
    shares of the Company’s common stock representing a market
    value of approximately $1 billion on the date of
    announcement. The Company may buy shares from time to time on
    the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, or a
    combination of both. The timing and amounts of any purchases
    will be at the discretion of Apache’s management. The
    Company initiated the purchase program on May 1, 2006,
    after the Company’s first-quarter 2006 earnings information
    was disseminated in the market. Through December 31, 2006,
    the Company purchased 2,500,000 shares at an average price
    of $69.74 per share.

Oil and
    Gas Capital Expenditures

The Company funded its exploration and development (E&D)
    capital expenditures, gathering, transportation and marketing
    (GTM) investments, capitalized interest and asset retirement
    costs of $4.4 billion, $4.4 billion and
    $2.7 billion in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively,
    primarily with internally generated cash flow of
    $4.3 billion, $4.3 billion and $3.2 billion.

The Company uses a combination of internally generated cash
    flow, borrowings under the Company’s lines of credit and
    commercial paper program and, from time to time, issues of
    public debt or common stock to fund its significant
    acquisitions. During 2005 and 2004, the Company primarily used
    internally generated cash flow or its lines of credit and
    commercial paper program, which were subsequently paid down with
    internally generated cash flow. In 2006, the Company primarily
    used its commercial paper program to fund its’ significant
    acquisitions. The commercial paper was subsequently repaid with
    the proceeds from the issuance of $1.5 billion of senior
    unsecured notes in January 2007.

The following table presents a summary of the Company’s
    Capital Expenditures for each of our reportable segments for the
    past three years.

Capital expenditures, excluding ARC, totaled $6.4 billion
    in 2006, up 66 percent or $2.6 billion from 2005
    driven by an increase in acquisition activity. The Company
    invested $3.7 billion on exploration and development
    activities in 2006 up nine percent from 2005 including drilling
    1,611 wells.

In the U.S., we invested $1.5 billion on exploration and
    development activities. Our Gulf Coast region invested
    approximately $1 billion on drilling, recompletions, and
    platform and production support facilities, including
    $50 million of associated hurricane redevelopment capital
    in excess of insurance coverage. The region drilled
    60 wells in the Gulf of Mexico and 23 wells onshore,
    with a 78 percent success rate, despite ongoing hurricane
    repair activity. The Central region had its most active year
    ever investing $540 million including the drilling of
    374 wells with a 97 percent success rate. The region
    added to its inventory of opportunities to grow production with
    the addition of Amerada Hess’s Permian basin properties in
    Texas and New Mexico at the beginning of 2006 and will do so
    again with the close of the acquisition of additional Permian
    basin properties from Anadarko in the first quarter of 2007.

Canada’s drilling program accounted for more than half of
    the Company’s wells drilled. The region invested
    $1.1 billion in 2006 on exploration and development
    activities and drilled 874 wells with an 85 percent
    success rate. Twenty-five percent of those wells were on the
    undeveloped acreage Apache obtained through farm-in agreements
    with ExxonMobil.

We invested $329 million in the North Sea;
    $112 million of which was on facility upgrades intended to
    improve the operating efficiency and drilling capability in the
    Forties field. Four of the five exploration and development
    wells drilled during 2006 were productive. We completed the
    Forties power generation and gas ring in 2006, which reduced
    fuel oil generating costs and improved production reliability.
    We also started the upgrade of our produced water re-injection
    system, upgraded the primary gas-lift compression system and
    replaced instrumentation and control systems on several
    platforms. At the end of 2006, we were in the process of
    upgrading drilling equipment on all existing Forties’
    platforms that will extend the reach of our drilling equipment,
    allowing us to determine if the bounds of the Forties field can
    be extended to the west. The latter project should be completed
    by the end of the first quarter of 2007.

Egypt had another active and successful exploration and
    development program investing $455 million and drilling
    163 wells of which 86 percent were productive as we
    continued development of the Qasr field.

In Australia, we invested $180 million in exploration and
    development activities as we participated in drilling
    23 wells; 18 exploration wells and five development wells.
    Four of the exploration wells and three of the development wells
    were productive for a success rate of 30 percent.

Our 2006 exploration and development activities in Argentina
    increased by $90 million over 2005 as we invested
    $116 million drilling 83 wells, 16 exploratory and 67
    development, with a 89% success rate.

The Company invested $249 million in gathering,
    transmission and processing facilities in 2006 compared to
    $393 million in 2005. In Canada we invested
    $130 million in processing plants, $106 million of
    which was to construct five additional gas processing plants to
    support production from wells drilled on the acreage we earned
    from ExxonMobil. Egypt invested $108 million to complete
    the Tarek gas plant pipeline inter-connect and on expansion of
    gas processing facilities to alleviate the processing capacity
    bottleneck throttling deliverability.

In 2006 we also recorded $391 million in asset retirement
    costs. The Gulf Coast region recorded an additional
    $232 million to reflect the estimated abandonment costs to
    be incurred resulting from the hurricane activity, in addition
    to the approximately $492 million recorded in 2005. This
    cost to abandon the 11 operated and 12 non-operated platforms
    lost or severely damaged during the 2005 storms is expected to
    be incurred by the end of 2009 (See Note 4, Asset
    Retirement Obligations of Item 15 in this

Form 10-K).

We also recorded $162 million in asset retirement costs
    associated with our 2006 acquisition activity.

On the acquisition front we invested a record $2.4 billion
    in 2006, closing four significant transactions; one in the Gulf
    of Mexico, one in West Texas and two in Argentina. Acquisition
    activity fluctuates from

year-to-year

based on the availability of acquisition opportunities that fit
    the Company’s strategy.

In 2005, the Company had its most active drilling year ever,
    drilling 2,383 wells investing $3.4 billion on
    exploration and development activities, a 44 percent
    increase from 2004. Approximately two-thirds of our 2005


exploration and development expenditures were invested in Canada
    and the U.S., where nearly 69 percent of Apache’s
    2005 year-end estimated proved reserves were located.
    Exploration and development expenditures in 2005 for Canada and
    the U.S. increased 57 percent and 42 percent,
    respectively, over 2004. Canada was our most active region,
    drilling 1,674 wells, 82 percent of which were shallow
    development wells. Canada was also very active in the
    undeveloped acreage Apache obtained through two farm-in
    agreements with ExxonMobil. The Central region was the second
    most active region, drilling 364 wells, with a
    97 percent success rate. In the Gulf Coast region, despite
    the disruptions caused by the Gulf of Mexico hurricanes, we
    drilled 114 wells, including 66 offshore. Seventy-seven
    percent of our Gulf Coast wells were productive. In the North
    Sea, we drilled a total of 23 wells, including 18 Forties
    field wells, and invested approximately $198 million of
    maintenance capital to continue to improve the operating
    efficiency of the Forties field. In Egypt, we drilled
    121 wells of which 86 percent were productive. We
    continued development of the Qasr field, where gross production
    averaged 128 MMcf/d in December 2005. In Australia, we
    participated in drilling 36 wells; 26 exploration wells and
    10 development wells. China’s capital expenditures were
    flat compared to 2004 as they continued their development
    drilling program.

In 2005 Apache also invested $393 million in gathering,
    transmission and processing facilities investing
    $180 million constructing 11 gas processing plants in
    Canada, six of which were completed by yearend,
    $182 million in Egypt developing Qasr field facilities and
    $31 million on facility upgrades in Australia.

We incurred $547 million in asset retirement costs in 2005,
    most of which was attributed to the hurricane activity in the
    Gulf of Mexico escalating our abandonment obligations.

The Company spent $39 million on acquisitions in 2005
    compared to $1.1 billion in 2004, as the high-price
    commodity market in 2005 limited the number of attractive
    acquisition opportunities. Those that were pursued closed in the
    first quarter of 2006. Acquisition expenditures typically vary

year-to-year

based on the availability of opportunities that fit
    Apache’s overall strategy.

For 2007, we plan another active year of drilling. Because we
    revise our estimates of exploration and development capital
    expenditures frequently throughout the year based on industry
    conditions,

year-to-year

results and the relative levels of commodity prices and service
    costs, accurately projecting future expenditures is difficult at
    best. At the end of 2006 we had a fairly active drilling program
    underway; however, if commodity prices soften and service costs
    do not decline accordingly, Apache will not hesitate to reduce
    activity until margins are back in line. Our 2007 preliminary
    estimate of exploration and development capital and oil and gas
    processing facilities and pipelines is approximately
    $4.5 billion. We generally do not project estimates for
    acquisitions because their timing is unpredictable. We
    continually look for properties in which we believe we can add
    value and earn adequate rates of return and will take advantage
    of those opportunities as they arise.

Cash
    Dividend Payments

The Company has paid cash dividends on its common stock for 42
    consecutive years through 2006. Future dividend payments will
    depend on the Company’s level of earnings, financial
    requirements and other relevant factors. Common dividends paid
    during 2006 rose 33 percent to $148 million,
    reflecting the increase in common shares outstanding and the
    higher common stock dividend rate. The Company increased its
    quarterly cash dividend 50 percent, to 15 cents per share
    from 10 cents per share, effective with the November 2006
    dividend payment.

During 2006 and 2005, Apache paid a total of $6 million in
    dividends each year on its Series B Preferred Stock issued
    in August 1998. See Note 8, Capital Stock of Item 15
    in this

Form 10-K.

Common dividends paid during 2005 rose 32 percent to
    $112 million, reflecting the increase in common shares
    outstanding and the higher common stock dividend rate.

Contractual
    Obligations

We are subject to various financial obligations and commitments
    in the normal course of operations. These contractual
    obligations represent known future cash payments that we are
    required to make and relate primarily to long-term debt,
    operating leases, pipeline transportation commitments and
    international commitments. The Company expects to fund these
    contractual obligations with cash generated from operating
    activities. The following


table summarizes the Company’s contractual obligations as
    of December 31, 2006. See Note 10, Commitments and
    Contingencies of Item 15 in this

Form 10-K

This table does not include the estimated liability for
    dismantlement, abandonment and restoration costs of oil and gas
    properties of $1.7 billion. The Company records a separate
    liability for the fair value of this asset retirement
    obligation. See Note 4, Asset Retirement Obligation of
    Item 15 in this

Form 10-K

for further discussion.

(b)

This table does not include the Company’s pension or
    postretirement benefit obligations. See Note 10,
    Commitments and Contingencies of Item 15 in this

Form 10-K

for further discussion.

Apache is also subject to various contingent obligations that
    become payable only if certain events or rulings were to occur.
    The inherent uncertainty surrounding the timing of and monetary
    impact associated with these events or rulings prevents any
    meaningful accurate measurement, which is necessary to assess
    any impact on future liquidity. Such obligations include
    environmental contingencies and potential settlements resulting
    from litigation. Apache’s management feels that it has
    adequately reserved for its contingent obligations including
    approximately $17 million for environmental remediation and
    approximately $7 million for various legal liabilities, in
    addition to the $71 million, plus interest, we accrued for
    the Texaco China B.V. litigation. See Note 10, Commitments
    and Contingencies of Item 15 in this

Form 10-K

for a detailed discussion of the Company’s environmental
    and legal contingencies.

The Company accrued approximately $34 million as of
    December 31, 2006, for an insurance contingency because of
    our involvement with Oil Insurance Limited (OIL). Apache is a
    member of this insurance pool which insures specific property,
    pollution liability and other catastrophic risks of the Company.
    As part of its membership, the Company is contractually
    committed to pay termination fees were we to elect to withdraw
    from OIL. Apache does not anticipate withdrawal from the
    insurance pool; however, the potential termination fee is
    calculated annually based on past losses and the liability
    reflecting this potential charge has been accrued as required.

As discussed under Note 2, Acquisitions and Divestitures of
    Item 15 in this

Form 10-K,

Apache assumed obligations for pre-existing volumetric
    production payments (VPPs) in the 2004 acquisition of properties
    from Anadarko and the 2003 acquisition of properties from Shell.
    Under the terms of the VPP agreements, Apache is scheduled to
    deliver a total of 4.7 MMboe in 2007 and 1.6 MMboe in
    2008 to Morgan Stanley as owner of the VPP interests. Morgan
    Stanley is entitled to the first production and may demand up to
    90 percent of the production from the assets encumbered by
    each VPP in any given month to satisfy the VPP interests.
    However, they have no right to look to other assets or
    production of Apache beyond that encumbered in the acquisition.
    Apache does not record the reserves and production volumes
    attributable to the VPPs. As of December 31, 2006, Apache
    has booked a total of 87.4 MMboe of reserves attributable
    to the Anadarko and Shell transactions. The VPPs are
    non-operating interests,


free of costs incurred for operations and production. Apache
    provided a liability for these costs as reflected in the
    preceding table.

Upon closing of our 2003 acquisition of the North Sea
    properties, Apache assumed BP’s abandonment obligation for
    those properties and such costs were considered in determining
    the purchase price. The purchase of the properties, however, did
    not relieve BP of its liabilities if Apache fails to satisfy the
    abandonment obligation. Although not currently required, to
    ensure Apache’s payment of these costs, Apache agreed to
    deliver a letter of credit to BP if the rating of our senior
    unsecured debt is lowered by both Moody’s and Standard and
    Poor’s from the Company’s current ratings of A3 and
    A-, respectively. Any such letter of credit would be in an
    amount equal to the net present value of future abandonment
    costs of the North Sea properties as of the date of any such
    ratings change. If Apache is required to provide a letter of
    credit, it will expire if either rating agency restores its
    rating to the present level. The letter of credit amount would
    be 134 million British pounds, an amount that represents
    the letter of credit requirement through March 2008, and will be
    negotiated annually based on Apache’s future abandonment
    obligation estimates.

The Company’s future liquidity could be impacted by a
    significant downgrade of its credit ratings by Standard and
    Poor’s and Moody’s. The Company’s credit
    facilities do not require the Company to maintain a minimum
    credit rating. The negative covenants associated with our debt
    are outlined in greater detail under “Capital Resources and
    Liquidity, Debt” in this section of this

Form 10-K.

In addition, generally under our commodity hedge agreements,
    Apache may be required to post margin or terminate outstanding
    positions if the Company’s credit ratings decline
    significantly.

Off-Balance
    Sheet Arrangements

Apache does not currently utilize any off-balance sheet
    arrangements with unconsolidated entities to enhance liquidity
    and capital resource positions. Apache entered into a
    partnership with ExxonMobil to obtain additional interests in
    specific West Texas and New Mexico oil and gas properties
    acquired from ExxonMobil in September 2004. Apache concluded
    that they were not the primary beneficiary of the partnership
    and, therefore, proportionately consolidated only the
    Company’s portion of the oil and gas properties.

Critical
    Accounting Policies and Estimates

Full-Cost
    Method of Accounting for Oil and Gas Operations

The accounting for our business is subject to special accounting
    rules that are unique to the oil and gas industry. There are two
    allowable methods of accounting for oil and gas business
    activities: the successful-efforts method and the full-cost
    method. There are several significant differences between these
    methods. Under the successful-efforts method, costs such as
    geological and geophysical (G&G), exploratory dry holes and
    delay rentals are expensed as incurred, where under the
    full-cost method these types of charges would be capitalized to
    their respective full-cost pool. In the measurement of
    impairment of oil and gas properties, the successful-efforts
    method of accounting follows the guidance provided in Statement
    of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 144,
    “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
    Assets,” where the first measurement for impairment is to
    compare the net book value of the related asset to its
    undiscounted future cash flows using commodity prices consistent
    with management expectations. Under the full-cost method, the
    net book value (full-cost pool) is compared to the future net
    cash flows discounted at 10 percent using commodity prices
    in effect on the last day of the reporting period (ceiling
    limitation). If the full-cost pool is in excess of the ceiling
    limitation, the excess amount is charged through income.

We have elected to use the full-cost method to account for our
    investment in oil and gas properties. Under this method, the
    Company capitalizes all acquisition, exploration and development
    costs for the purpose of finding oil and gas reserves, including
    salaries, benefits and other internal costs directly
    attributable to these finding activities. Although some of these
    costs will ultimately result in no additional reserves, we
    expect the benefits of successful wells to more than offset the
    costs of any unsuccessful ones. In addition, gains or losses on
    the sale or other disposition of oil and gas properties are not
    recognized unless the gain or loss would significantly alter the
    relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves of
    oil and natural gas attributable to a country. As a result, we
    believe that the full-cost method of accounting better reflects
    the true economics of exploring for and


developing oil and gas reserves. Our financial position and
    results of operations would have been significantly different
    had we used the successful-efforts method of accounting for our
    oil and gas investments. Generally, the application of the
    full-cost method of accounting for oil and gas property results
    in higher capitalized costs and higher DD&A rates compared
    to similar companies applying the successful efforts methods of
    accounting.

Reserve
    Estimates

Our estimate of proved reserves is based on the quantities of
    oil and gas which geological and engineering data demonstrate,
    with reasonable certainty, to be recoverable in future years
    from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating
    conditions. The Company reports all estimated proved reserves
    held under production sharing arrangements utilizing the
    “economic interest” method, which excludes the host
    country’s share of reserves. The accuracy of any reserve
    estimate is a function of the quality of available data,
    engineering and geological interpretation, and judgment. For
    example, we must estimate the amount and timing of future
    operating costs, severance taxes, development costs, and
    workover costs, all of which may in fact vary considerably from
    actual results. In addition, as prices and cost levels change
    from year to year, the estimate of proved reserves also changes.
    Any significant variance in these assumptions could materially
    affect the estimated quantity and value of our reserves. As
    such, our reserve engineers review and revise the Company’s
    reserve estimates at least annually.

Despite the inherent imprecision in these engineering estimates,
    our reserves are used throughout our financial statements. For
    example, since we use the

units-of-production

method to amortize our oil and gas properties, the quantity of
    reserves could significantly impact our DD&A expense. Our
    oil and gas properties are also subject to a “ceiling”
    limitation based in part on the quantity of our proved reserves.
    Finally, these reserves are the basis for our supplemental oil
    and gas disclosures.

We engage an independent petroleum engineering firm to review
    our estimates of proved hydrocarbon liquid and gas reserves.
    During 2006, 2005 and 2004, their review covered 75, 74 and
    79 percent of the reserve value, respectively.

Costs
    Excluded

Under the full-cost method of accounting, oil and gas properties
    include costs that are excluded from capitalized costs being
    amortized. These amounts represent investments in unproved
    properties and major development projects. Apache excludes these
    costs on a

country-by-country

basis until proved reserves are found or until it is determined
    that the costs are impaired. All costs excluded are reviewed at
    least quarterly by the Company’s accounting, exploration
    and engineering staffs to determine if impairment has occurred.
    Nonproducing leases are evaluated based on the progress of the
    Company’s exploration program to date. Exploration costs
    are transferred to the DD&A pool upon completion of drilling
    individual wells. If geological and geophysical (G&G) costs
    cannot be associated with specific properties, they are included
    in the amortization base as incurred. The amount of any
    impairment is transferred to the capitalized costs being
    amortized (the DD&A pool) or a charge is made against
    earnings for those international operations where a proved
    reserve base has not yet been established. Impairments
    transferred to the DD&A pool increase the DD&A rate for
    that country. For international operations where a reserve base
    has not yet been established, all costs associated with a
    prospect or play would be considered quarterly for impairment
    upon full evaluation of such prospect or play. This evaluation
    considers among other factors, seismic data, requirements to
    relinquish acreage, drilling results, remaining time in the
    commitment period, remaining capital plans, and political,
    economic, and market conditions.

Allowance
    for Doubtful Accounts

We routinely assess the recoverability of all material trade and
    other receivables to determine their collectibility. Many of our
    receivables are from joint interest owners on properties we
    operate. Thus, we may have the ability to withhold future
    revenue disbursements to recover any non-payment of joint
    interest billings. Our crude oil and natural gas receivables are
    typically collected within two months. We accrue a reserve on a
    receivable when, based on the judgment of management, it is
    probable that a receivable will not be collected and the amount
    of any reserve may be reasonably estimated.


Beginning in 2001, we experienced a gradual decline in the
    timeliness of receipts from EGPC for our Egyptian oil and
    gas sales. Deteriorating economic conditions in Egypt lessened
    the availability of U.S. dollars, resulting in a one to two
    month delay in receipts from EGPC. During 2006, we experienced
    wide variability in the timing of cash receipts. We have not
    established a reserve for these Egyptian receivables because we
    continue to get paid, albeit late, and have no indication that
    we will not be able to collect our receivable.

Asset
    Retirement Obligation

The Company has significant obligations to remove tangible
    equipment and restore land or seabed at the end of oil and gas
    production operations. Apache’s removal and restoration
    obligations are primarily associated with plugging and
    abandoning wells and removing and disposing of offshore oil and
    gas platforms. Estimating the future restoration and removal
    costs is difficult and requires management to make estimates and
    judgments because most of the removal obligations are many years
    in the future and contracts and regulations often have vague
    descriptions of what constitutes removal. Asset removal
    technologies and costs are constantly changing, as are
    regulatory, political, environmental, safety and public
    relations considerations.

Inherent in the present value calculation are numerous
    assumptions and judgments including the ultimate settlement
    amounts, inflation factors, credit adjusted discount rates,
    timing of settlement, and changes in the legal, regulatory,
    environmental and political environments. To the extent future
    revisions to these assumptions impact the present value of the
    existing Asset Retirement Obligation liability, a corresponding
    adjustment is made to the oil and gas property balance.

Income
    Taxes

Our oil and gas exploration and production operations are
    currently located in six countries. As a result, we are subject
    to taxation on our income in numerous jurisdictions. We record
    deferred tax assets and liabilities to account for the expected
    future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in
    our financial statements and our tax returns. We routinely
    assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets. If we
    conclude that it is more likely than not that some portion or
    all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized under
    accounting standards, the tax asset would be reduced by a
    valuation allowance. We consider future taxable income in making
    such assessments. Numerous judgments and assumptions are
    inherent in the determination of future taxable income,
    including factors such as future operating conditions
    (particularly as related to prevailing oil and gas prices).

The Company regularly assesses and, if required, establishes
    accruals for tax contingencies that could result from
    assessments of additional tax by taxing jurisdictions in
    countries where the Company operates. Tax reserves have been
    established, and include any related interest, despite the
    belief by the Company that certain tax positions have been fully
    documented in the Company’s tax returns. These reserves are
    subject to a significant amount of judgment and are reviewed and
    adjusted on a periodic basis in light of changing facts and
    circumstances considering the progress of ongoing tax audits,
    case law and any new legislation. The Company believes that the
    reserves established are adequate in relation to the potential
    for any additional tax assessments.

Derivatives

Apache uses derivative contracts on a limited basis to manage
    its exposure to oil and gas price volatility and foreign
    currency volatility. The Company accounts for the contracts in
    accordance with SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for
    Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.” The
    estimated fair values of Apache’s derivative contracts
    within the scope of this statement are carried on the
    Company’s consolidated balance sheet. For oil and gas
    derivative contracts designated and qualifying as cash flow
    hedges, realized gains and losses are recognized in oil and gas
    production revenues when the forecasted transaction occurs. For
    foreign currency forward contracts designated and qualifying as
    cash flow hedges, realized gains and losses are generally
    recognized in lease operating expense when the forecasted
    transaction occurs. SFAS No. 133 requires that gains
    and losses from the change in fair value of derivative
    instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting be

“marked-to-market”

and reported in current period income, rather than in the period
    in which the hedged transaction is settled. Realized gains and
    losses on derivative contracts not qualifying as cash flow
    hedges are reported in “Other” under “Revenues
    and Other” of the Statement of Consolidated Operations.


The fair value estimate of Apache’s derivative contracts
    requires judgment; however, the Company’s derivative
    contracts are either exchange traded or valued by reference to
    commodities and currencies that are traded in highly liquid
    markets. As such, the ultimate fair value is determined by
    references to readily available public data. Option valuations
    are verified against independent third-party quotations. See
    Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about
    Market Risk, “Commodity Risk” in this

Form 10-K

for commodity price sensitivity information and the
    Company’s policies related to the use of derivatives.

Stock-Based
    Compensation

Consistent with the Company’s desire to reflect the
    ultimate cost of stock-based compensation on the income
    statement, Apache early adopted the provisions of

SFAS No. 123-R

“Share-Based Payment” upon the FASB’s issuance of
    the revised statement in the fourth quarter 2004. Stock-based
    compensation awards that vest during the year are reflected in
    the Company’s net income. Awards granted in future periods
    will be valued on the date of grant and expensed using a
    straight-line basis over the required service period.

The Company chose to adopt the statement under the
    “Modified Retrospective” approach as prescribed under

SFAS No. 123-R.

Under this approach, the Company is required to expense all
    options and stock-based compensation that vested during the year
    of adoption based on the fair value of the stock compensation
    determined on the date of grant. Had the Company not early
    adopted

SFAS No. 123-R

under this transition approach, 2004 net income would have
    been lower by $89 million ($56 million after tax) or
    $.17 per diluted share. Normally, net income would be
    negatively impacted by adopting

SFAS No. 123-R

under this transition method. However, the Company’s
    2000 Share Appreciation Plan, which triggered in 2004, has
    a fair market value-based expense recorded under the provisions
    of

SFAS No. 123-R

that is substantially less than the intrinsic value cost that
    would have been recorded under the provisions of APB Opinion
    No. 25. Please refer to Note 8, Capital Stock of
    Item 15 of this

Form 10-K

for a detailed description of the 2000 Share Appreciation
    Plan and costs associated with our stock compensation plans.

Also, inherent in expensing stock options and other stock-based
    compensation under

SFAS No. 123-R

are several judgments and estimates that must be made. These
    include determining the underlying valuation methodology for
    stock compensation awards and the related inputs utilized in
    each valuation, such as the Company’s expected stock price
    volatility, expected term of the employee option, expected
    dividend yield, the expected risk-free interest rate, the
    underlying stock price and the exercise price of the option.
    Changes to these assumptions could result in different
    valuations for individual share awards and will be carefully
    scrutinized for each material grant. For option valuations,
    Apache utilizes the Black-Scholes option pricing model. For
    valuing the Share Appreciation Plan awards, the Company utilizes
    a Monte Carlo simulation model developed by a third party.

ITEM 7A.

QUANTITATIVE
    AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Commodity
    Risk

The major market risk exposure is in the pricing applicable to
    our oil and gas production. Realized pricing is primarily driven
    by the prevailing worldwide price for crude oil and spot prices
    applicable to our United States and Canadian natural gas
    production. Prices received for oil and gas production have been
    and remain volatile and unpredictable. Monthly average oil price
    realizations, including the impact of fixed-price contracts and
    hedges, ranged from a low of $52.64 per barrel to a high of
    $68.59 per barrel during 2006. Average gas price
    realizations, including the impact of fixed-price contracts and
    hedges, ranged from a monthly low of $3.85 per Mcf to a
    monthly high of $8.05 per Mcf during the same period. Based
    on the Company’s 2006 worldwide oil and gas production
    levels, a $1.00 per barrel change in the weighted-average
    realized price of oil would increase or decrease revenues by
    $82 million and a $.10 per Mcf change in the
    weighted-average realized price of gas would increase or
    decrease revenues by $55 million.

If oil and gas prices decline significantly, even if only for a
    short period of time, it is possible that non-cash write-downs
    of our oil and gas properties could occur under the full-cost
    accounting method allowed by the Securities Exchange Commission
    (SEC). Under these rules, we review the carrying value of our
    proved oil and gas properties each quarter on a

country-by-country

basis to ensure that capitalized costs of proved oil and gas
    properties, net of accumulated depreciation, depletion and
    amortization, and deferred income taxes do not exceed


the “ceiling.” This ceiling is the present value of
    estimated future net cash flows from proved oil and gas
    reserves, discounted at 10 percent, plus the lower of cost
    or fair value of unproved properties included in the costs being
    amortized, net of related tax effects. If capitalized costs
    exceed this ceiling, the excess is charged to additional
    DD&A expense. The calculation of estimated future net cash
    flows is based on the prices for crude oil and natural gas in
    effect on the last day of each fiscal quarter except for volumes
    sold under long-term contracts. Write-downs required by these
    rules do not impact cash flow from operating activities;
    however, as discussed above, sustained low prices would have a
    material adverse effect on future cash flows.

We periodically enter into hedging activities on a portion of
    our projected oil and natural gas production through a variety
    of financial and physical arrangements intended to support oil
    and natural gas prices at targeted levels and to manage our
    overall exposure to oil and gas price fluctuations. Apache may
    use futures contracts, swaps, options and fixed-price physical
    contracts to hedge its commodity prices. Realized gains or
    losses from the Company’s price risk management activities
    are recognized in oil and gas production revenues when the
    associated production occurs. Apache does not generally hold or
    issue derivative instruments for trading purposes.

Apache has historically only hedged long-term oil and gas prices
    related to a portion of its expected production associated with
    acquisitions; however, in 2006, the Company’s Board of
    Directors authorized management to hedge a portion of production
    generated from the Company’s drilling program. In 2006,
    financial derivative hedges represented approximately eight
    percent of the total worldwide natural gas and nine percent of
    the total worldwide crude oil production. At year end, hedges in
    place were primarily related to North America production and
    represent approximately 12 percent of worldwide production
    for natural gas and crude oil.

On December 31, 2006, the Company had open natural gas
    derivative positions with a fair value of $87 million. A
    10 percent increase in natural gas prices would reduce the
    fair value by approximately $58 million, while a
    10 percent decrease in prices would increase the fair value
    by approximately $60 million. The Company also had open
    crude oil derivative positions with a fair value of
    $40 million. A 10 percent increase in oil prices would
    reduce the fair value by approximately $104 million, while
    a 10 percent decrease in prices would increase the fair
    value by approximately $107 million. These fair value
    changes assume volatility based on prevailing market parameters
    at December 31, 2006. See Note 3, Hedging and
    Derivative Instruments of Item 15 in this

Form 10-K

for notional volumes and terms associated with the
    Company’s derivative contracts.

Apache conducts its risk management activities for its
    commodities under the controls and governance of its risk
    management policy. The Risk Management Committee, comprising the
    Chief Financial Officer, Controller, Treasurer and other key
    members of Apache’s management, approve and oversee these
    controls, which have been implemented by designated members of
    the treasury department. The treasury and accounting departments
    also provide separate checks and reviews on the results of
    hedging activities. Controls for our commodity risk management
    activities include limits on credit, limits on volume,
    segregation of duties, delegation of authority and a number of
    other policy and procedural controls.

Governmental
    Risk

Apache’s U.S. and international operations have been, and
    at times in the future may be, affected by political
    developments and by federal, state and local laws and
    regulations impacting production levels, taxes, environmental
    requirements and other assessments including a potential
    Windfall Profits Tax.

Weather
    and Climate Risk

Demand for oil and natural gas are, to a significant degree,
    dependent on weather and climate, which impacts the price we
    receive for the commodities we produce. In addition, our
    exploration and development activities and equipment can be
    adversely affected by severe weather, such as hurricanes in the
    Gulf of Mexico, which may cause a loss of production from
    temporary cessation of activity or lost or damaged equipment.
    While our planning for normal climatic variation, insurance
    program, and emergency recovery plans mitigate the effects of
    the weather, not all such effects can be predicted, eliminated
    or insured against.

In response to large underwriting losses caused by Hurricanes
    Katrina and Rita, the insurance industry has reduced capacity
    for windstorm damage and substantially increased premium rates.
    As a result, there is no


assurance that Apache will be able to arrange insurance to cover
    fully its Gulf of Mexico exposures at a reasonable cost when the
    current policies expire.

Foreign
    Currency Risk

The Company’s cash flow stream relating to certain
    international operations is based on the U.S. dollar
    equivalent of cash flows measured in foreign currencies. In
    Australia, oil production is sold under U.S. dollar
    contracts and gas production is sold under fixed-price
    Australian dollar contracts. Over half the costs incurred for
    Australian operations are paid in Australian dollars. In Canada,
    the majority of oil and gas production is sold under Canadian
    dollar contracts. The majority of the costs incurred are paid in
    Canadian dollars. The North Sea production is sold under
    U.S. dollar contracts and the majority of costs incurred
    are paid in British pounds. In contrast, all oil and gas
    production in Egypt is sold for U.S. dollars and the
    majority of the costs incurred are denominated in
    U.S. dollars. Argentina revenues and expenditures are
    largely denominated in U.S. dollars but translated into
    pesos at the then current exchange rate. Revenue and
    disbursement transactions denominated in Australian dollars,
    Canadian dollars, British pounds, Egyptian pounds or Argentine
    pesos are converted to U.S. dollar equivalents based on the
    exchange rate as of the transaction date.

Foreign currency gains and losses also come about when monetary
    assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are
    translated at the end of each month. A 10 percent
    strengthening or weakening of the Australian dollar, Canadian
    dollar, British pound, Egyptian pound, or Argentine peso as of
    December 31, 2006, would result in a foreign currency net
    loss or gain of approximately $112 million.

Interest
    Rate Risk

On December 31, 2006, the Company’s debt with fixed
    interest rates represented approximately 57 percent of
    total debt. As a result, the interest expense on approximately
    43 percent of Apache’s debt will fluctuate based on
    short-term interest rates. A 10 percent change in floating
    interest rates on year-end floating debt balances would change
    annual interest expense by approximately $9.2 million.

Forward-Looking
    Statements and Risk

Certain statements in this report, including statements of the
    future plans, objectives, and expected performance of the
    Company, are forward-looking statements that are dependent upon
    certain events, risks and uncertainties that may be outside the
    Company’s control, and which could cause actual results to
    differ materially from those anticipated. Some of these include,
    but are not limited to, capital expenditure projections, the
    market prices of oil and gas, economic and competitive
    conditions, inflation rates, legislative and regulatory changes,
    financial market conditions, political and economic
    uncertainties of foreign governments, future business decisions
    and other uncertainties, all of which are difficult to predict.

There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating
    quantities of proved oil and gas reserves and in projecting
    future rates of production and the timing of development
    expenditures. The total amount or timing of actual future
    production may vary significantly from reserve and production
    estimates. The drilling of exploratory wells can involve
    significant risks, including those related to timing, success
    rates and cost overruns. Lease and rig availability, complex
    geology and other factors can affect these risks. Although
    Apache makes use of futures contracts, swaps, options and
    fixed-price physical contracts to mitigate risk, fluctuations in
    oil and gas prices, or a prolonged continuation of low prices
    may substantially adversely affect the Company’s financial
    position, results of operations and cash flows.

REPORT OF
    MANAGEMENT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL
    REPORTING

Management of the Company is responsible for the preparation and
    integrity of the consolidated financial statements appearing in
    this annual report on

Form 10-K.

The financial statements were prepared in conformity with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
    and include amounts that are based on management’s best
    estimates and judgments.

Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and
    maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting
    as such term is defined in

Rule 13a-15(f)

under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange
    Act”). The Company’s internal control over financial
    reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding
    the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    the consolidated financial statements. Our internal control over
    financial reporting is supported by a program of internal audits
    and appropriate reviews by management, written policies and
    guidelines, careful selection and training of qualified
    personnel and a written code of business conduct adopted by our
    Company’s Board of Directors, applicable to all Company
    Directors and all officers and employees of our Company and
    subsidiaries.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements and
    even when determined to be effective, can only provide
    reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement
    preparation and presentation. Also, projections of any
    evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the
    risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in
    conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or
    procedures may deteriorate.

Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s
    internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2006. In making this assessment, management
    used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in

Internal
    Control — Integrated Framework.

Based
    on our assessment, management believes that the Company
    maintained effective internal control over financial reporting
    as of December 31, 2006.

The Company’s independent auditors, Ernst & Young
    LLP, a registered public accounting firm, are appointed by the
    Audit Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors.
    Ernst & Young LLP have audited and reported on the
    consolidated financial statements of Apache Corporation and
    subsidiaries, management’s assessment of the effectiveness
    of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting
    and the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control
    over financial reporting. The reports of the independent
    auditors follow this report on pages F-2 and F-3.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Apache Corporation:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    Apache Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2006
    and 2005, and the related consolidated statements of operations,
    shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three
    years in the period ended December 31, 2006. These
    consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the
    Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
    opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our
    audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
    present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
    financial position of Apache Corporation and subsidiaries as of
    December 31, 2006 and 2005 and the consolidated results of
    their operations and their cash flows for each of the three
    years ended December 31, 2006, in conformity with
    U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

As described in Note 1 and Note 8 to the consolidated
    financial statements, during 2004, the Company adopted the
    modified prospective provisions of Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 123(revised),
    “Share-Based Payment.” In addition, as described in
    Note 1 and Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements, the Company adopted the provisions of
    SFAS No. 158, “Employees Accounting for Defined
    Benefit Plans and Other Postretirement Plans.”

We also have audited in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    effectiveness of Apache Corporation and subsidiaries’
    internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2006, based on criteria established in
    Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
    and our report dated February 28, 2007 expressed an
    unqualified opinion thereon.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Apache Corporation:

We have audited management’s assessment, included in the
    accompanying Report of Management on Internal Control over
    Financial Reporting, that Apache Corporation and subsidiaries
    maintained effective internal control over financial reporting
    as of December 31, 2006, based on criteria established in
    Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
    (the COSO criteria). Apache Corporation’s management is
    responsible for maintaining effective internal control over
    financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness
    of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility
    is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an
    opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal
    control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
    management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design
    and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
    such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
    circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
    basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that Apache
    Corporation and subsidiaries maintained effective internal
    control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006,
    is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on the COSO
    criteria. Also, in our opinion, Apache Corporation and
    subsidiaries maintained, in all material respects, effective
    internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2006, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated balance sheets of Apache Corporation and
    subsidiaries as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, and the
    related consolidated statements of operations,
    shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three
    years in the period ended December 31, 2006 and our report
    dated February 28, 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion
    thereon.

    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

SUMMARY
    OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Nature of Operations —

Apache
    Corporation (Apache or the Company) is an independent energy
    company that explores for, develops and produces natural gas,
    crude oil and natural gas liquids. The Company’s North
    American exploration and production activities are divided into
    two U.S. operating regions (Central and Gulf Coast) and a
    Canadian region. Approximately 66 percent of the
    Company’s proved reserves are located in North America.
    Outside of North America, Apache has exploration and production
    interests in Egypt, offshore Western Australia, offshore the
    United Kingdom in the North Sea (North Sea) and Argentina.

The Company’s future financial condition and results of
    operations will depend upon prices received for its oil and
    natural gas production and the costs of finding, acquiring,
    developing and producing reserves. The vast majority of the
    Company’s production is sold under market-sensitive
    contracts. Prices for oil and natural gas are subject to
    fluctuations in response to changes in supply, market
    uncertainty and a variety of other factors beyond the
    Company’s control. These factors include worldwide
    political instability (especially in the Middle East), the
    foreign supply of oil and natural gas, the price of foreign
    imports, the level of consumer demand, and the price and
    availability of alternative fuels.

Principles of Consolidation —

The
    accompanying consolidated financial statements include the
    accounts of Apache and its subsidiaries after elimination of
    intercompany balances and transactions. The Company consolidates
    all investments in which the Company, either through direct or
    indirect ownership, has more than a 50 percent voting
    interest. In addition, Apache consolidates all variable interest
    entities where it is the primary beneficiary. The Company’s
    interests in oil and gas exploration and production ventures and
    partnerships are proportionately consolidated.

Cash Equivalents —

The Company considers
    all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with an original
    maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. These
    investments are carried at cost, which approximates fair value.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts —

The
    Company routinely assesses the recoverability of all material
    trade and other receivables to determine their collectibility.
    Many of Apache’s receivables are from joint interest owners
    on properties Apache operates. Thus, Apache may have the ability
    to withhold future revenue disbursements to recover any
    non-payment of joint interest billings. Generally, the
    Company’s crude oil and natural gas receivables are
    collected within two months. Beginning in 2001, however, the
    Company experienced a gradual decline in the timeliness of
    receipts from the Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation (EGPC).
    Deteriorating economic conditions in Egypt lessened the
    availability of U.S. dollars, resulting in an additional
    one to two month delay in receipts from EGPC. During 2006, we
    experienced wide variability in the timing of cash receipts from
    EGPC. We have not established a reserve for these Egyptian
    receivables because we continue to get paid, albeit late, and we
    have no indication that we will not be able to collect our
    receivable.

The Company accrues a reserve on a receivable when, based on the
    judgment of management, it is probable that a receivable will
    not be collected and the amount of any reserve may be reasonably
    estimated. As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, the Company
    had an allowance for doubtful accounts of $23 million and
    $22 million, respectively.

Marketable Securities —

The Company
    accounts for investments in debt and equity securities in
    accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    (SFAS) No. 115, “Accounting for Certain Investments in
    Debt and Equity Securities.” Investments in debt securities
    classified as “held to maturity” are recorded at
    amortized cost. Investments in debt and equity securities
    classified as “available for sale” are recorded at
    fair value with unrealized gains and losses recognized in other
    comprehensive income, net of income taxes. The Company utilizes
    the average-cost method in computing realized gains and losses,
    which are included in Revenues and Other in the statements of
    consolidated operations.

APACHE
    CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Inventories —

Inventories consist
    principally of tubular goods and production equipment, stated at
    the lower of weighted-average cost or market, and oil produced
    but not sold, stated at the lower of cost (a combination of
    production costs and depreciation, depletion and amortization
    (DD&A) expense) or market.

Property and Equipment —

The Company
    uses the full-cost method of accounting for its investment in
    oil and gas properties. Under this method, the Company
    capitalizes all acquisition, exploration and development costs
    incurred for the purpose of finding oil and gas reserves,
    including salaries, benefits and other internal costs directly
    attributable to these activities. Historically, total
    capitalized internal costs in any given year have not been
    material to total oil and gas costs capitalized in such year.
    Apache capitalized $146 million, $141 million and
    $107 million of these internal costs in 2006, 2005 and
    2004, respectively. Costs associated with production and general
    corporate activities, however, are expensed in the period
    incurred. Interest costs related to unproved properties and
    properties under development are also capitalized to oil and gas
    properties. The Company also includes the present value of its
    dismantlement, restoration and abandonment costs within the
    capitalized oil and gas property balance (see Note 4, Asset
    Retirement Obligation). Unless a significant portion of the
    Company’s proved reserve quantities in a particular country
    are sold (greater than 25 percent), proceeds from the sale
    of oil and gas properties are accounted for as a reduction to
    capitalized costs, and gains and losses are not recognized.

Apache computes the DD&A expense of oil and gas properties
    on a quarterly basis using the

unit-of-production

method based upon production and estimates of proved reserve
    quantities. The costs to be amortized include estimated future
    expenditures to be incurred in developing proved reserves as
    well as estimated dismantlement and abandonment costs, net of
    salvage value, that have not yet been capitalized as asset
    retirement costs. Unproved properties are excluded from the
    amortizable base until evaluated. The cost of exploratory dry
    wells is transferred to proved properties and thus subject to
    amortization immediately upon determination that a well is dry
    in those countries where proved reserves exist. If geological
    and geophysical (G&G) costs cannot be associated with
    specific properties, they are included in the amortization base
    as incurred.

In performing its quarterly ceiling test, the Company limits, on
    a

country-by-country

basis, the capitalized costs of proved oil and gas properties,
    net of accumulated DD&A and deferred income taxes, to the
    estimated future net cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves
    discounted at 10 percent, net of related tax effects, plus
    the lower of cost or fair value of unproved properties included
    in the costs being amortized. If capitalized costs exceed this
    limit, the excess is charged as additional DD&A expense. The
    Company calculates future net cash flows by applying

end-of-the-period

prices except in those instances where future natural gas or oil
    sales are covered by physical contract terms or by derivative
    contracts that qualify, and are accounted for, as cash flow
    hedges. Prior to 2007, Canadian provincial tax credits were
    included in the estimated future net cash flows. Effective
    January 1, 2007, the Alberta government eliminated the
    Royalty Tax program. The future cash flows associated with
    settling asset retirement obligations that have been accrued on
    the balance sheet are excluded from estimated future net cash
    flows. See Note 14, Supplemental Oil and Gas Disclosures
    (Unaudited) “Future Net Cash Flows” for a discussion
    on calculation of estimated future net cash flows.

Given the volatility of oil and gas prices, it is reasonably
    possible that the Company’s estimate of discounted future
    net cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves could change in
    the near term. If oil and gas prices decline significantly, even
    if only for a short period of time, it is possible that
    write-downs of oil and gas properties could occur.

Unproved properties are assessed quarterly for possible
    impairments or reductions in value. If a reduction in value has
    occurred, the impairment is transferred to proved properties.

Buildings, equipment and gas gathering, transmission and
    processing facilities are depreciated on a straight-line basis
    over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from
    three to 20 years. Accumulated depreciation for these
    assets totaled $582 million and $467 million at
    December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Goodwill —

    $189 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, with
    approximately $103 million and $86 million recorded to
    the Canadian and Egyptian reporting units, respectively. Each
    geographic area was

F-9

APACHE
    CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

assessed as a reporting unit. Goodwill of each reporting unit is
    tested for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if
    an event occurs or circumstances change that would reduce the
    fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount. No
    impairment of goodwill was recognized during 2006, 2005 or 2004.

Accounts Payable —

Included in accounts
    payable at December 31, 2006 and 2005, are liabilities of
    approximately $204 million and $125 million,
    respectively, representing the amount by which checks issued,
    but not presented to the Company’s banks for collection,
    exceeded balances in applicable bank accounts.

Revenue Recognition —

Oil and gas
    revenues are recognized when production is sold to a purchaser
    at a fixed or determinable price, when delivery has occurred and
    title has transferred, and if collectibility of the revenue is
    probable. Cash received relating to future revenues is deferred
    and recognized when all revenue recognition criteria are met.

Apache uses the sales method of accounting for gas production
    imbalances. The volumes of gas sold may differ from the volumes
    to which Apache is entitled based on its interests in the
    properties. These differences create imbalances that are
    recognized as a liability only when the properties’
    estimated remaining reserves net to Apache will not be
    sufficient to enable the underproduced owner to recoup its
    entitled share through production. The Company’s recorded
    liability is reflected in other non-current liabilities. No
    receivables are recorded for those wells where Apache has taken
    less than its share of production. Gas imbalances are reflected
    as adjustments to proved gas reserves and future cash flows in
    the unaudited supplemental oil and gas disclosures.

The Company’s Egyptian operations are conducted pursuant to
    production sharing contracts under which contractor partners pay
    all operating and capital costs for exploring and developing the
    concessions. A percentage of the production, usually up to
    40 percent, is available to the contractor partners to
    recover all operating and capital costs. The balance of the
    production is split among the contractor partners and EGPC on a
    contractually defined basis.

Apache markets its own U.S. natural gas production. As the
    Company’s production fluctuates because of operational
    issues, it is occasionally necessary for the Company to purchase
    gas (“third-party gas”) to fulfill its sales
    obligations and commitments. Both the costs and sales proceeds
    of this third-party gas are reported on a net basis in oil and
    gas production revenues. The costs of third-party gas netted
    against the related sales proceeds totaled $160 million,
    $158 million and $107 million, for 2006, 2005 and
    2004, respectively.

Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities —

Apache periodically enters into derivative contracts to
    manage its exposure to foreign currency risk and commodity price
    risk. These derivative contracts, which are generally placed
    with major financial institutions that the Company believes are
    minimal credit risks, may take the form of forward contracts,
    futures contracts, swaps or options. The oil and gas reference
    prices, upon which the commodity derivative contracts are based,
    reflect various market indices that have a high degree of
    historical correlation with actual prices received by the
    Company for its oil and gas production.

Apache accounts for its derivative instruments in accordance
    with SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative
    Instruments and Hedging Activities,” as amended.
    SFAS No. 133 establishes accounting and reporting
    standards requiring that all derivative instruments, other than
    those that meet the normal purchases and sales exception, be
    recorded on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability
    measured at fair value (which is generally based on information
    obtained from independent parties). SFAS No. 133 also
    requires that changes in fair value be recognized currently in
    earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met.
    Hedge accounting treatment allows unrealized gains and losses on
    cash flow hedges to be deferred in other comprehensive income.
    Realized gains and losses from the Company’s oil and gas
    cash flow hedges, including terminated contracts, are generally
    recognized in oil and gas production revenues when the
    forecasted transaction occurs. Realized gains and losses on
    foreign currency cash flow hedges are generally recognized in
    lease operating expense when the forecasted transaction occurs.
    Gains and losses from the change in fair value of derivative
    instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are
    reported in current period income as “Other” under
    Revenue and Other in the Statement of Consolidated Operations.
    If at any time the likelihood of occurrence of a hedged
    forecasted transaction ceases to be

F-10

APACHE
    CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

“probable,” hedge accounting under
    SFAS No. 133 will cease on a prospective basis and all
    future changes in the fair value of the derivative will be
    recognized directly in earnings. Amounts recorded in other
    comprehensive income prior to the change in the likelihood of
    occurrence of the forecasted transaction will remain in other
    comprehensive income until such time as the forecasted
    transaction impacts earnings. If it becomes probable that the
    original forecasted production will not occur, then the
    derivative gain or loss would be reclassified from accumulated
    other comprehensive income into earnings immediately. Hedge
    effectiveness is measured at least quarterly based on the
    relative changes in fair value between the derivative contract
    and the hedged item over time, and any ineffectiveness is
    immediately reported under Revenues and Other in the statement
    of consolidated operations.

Income Taxes —

We record deferred tax
    assets and liabilities to account for the expected future tax
    consequences of events that have been recognized in our
    financial statements and our tax returns. We routinely assess
    the realizability of our deferred tax assets. If we conclude
    that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the
    deferred tax assets will not be realized under accounting
    standards, the tax asset is reduced by a valuation allowance. We
    consider future taxable income in making such assessments.
    Numerous judgments and assumptions are inherent in the
    determination of future taxable income, including factors such
    as future operating conditions (particularly as related to
    prevailing oil and gas prices.)

Earnings from Apache’s international operations are
    permanently reinvested; therefore, the Company does not
    recognize U.S. deferred taxes on the unremitted earnings of
    its international subsidiaries. If it becomes apparent that some
    or all of the unremitted earnings will be remitted, the Company
    would then reflect taxes on those earnings.

Foreign Currency Translation —

The
    U.S. dollar has been determined to be the functional
    currency for each of Apache’s international operations. The
    functional currency is determined

country-by-country

based on relevant facts and circumstances of the cash flows,
    commodity pricing environment, and financing arrangements in
    each country.

The Company accounts for foreign currency gains and losses in
    accordance with SFAS No. 52 “Foreign Currency
    Translation.” Foreign currency translation gains and losses
    related to deferred taxes are recorded as a component of its
    provision for income taxes. The Company recorded a deferred tax
    benefit of $5 million in 2006 and $13 million and
    $58 million of additional deferred tax expense in 2005 and
    2004, respectively (see Note 6, Income Taxes). All other
    foreign currency gains and losses are reflected included in
    “Other” under Revenues and Other in the Statement of
    Consolidated Operations. The Company’s other foreign
    currency gains and losses as “Other” under Revenues
    and Other in the Statement of Consolidated Operations, netted to
    a loss of $15 million in 2006, a gain of $11 million
    in 2005 and a loss of $5 million in 2004.

Prior to October 1, 2002, the Company’s Canadian
    subsidiaries’ functional currency was the Canadian dollar.
    Translation adjustments resulting from translating the Canadian
    subsidiaries’ financial statements into U.S. dollar
    equivalents were reported separately and accumulated in other
    comprehensive income. Currency translation adjustments held in
    other comprehensive income on the balance sheet will remain
    there indefinitely unless there is a substantially complete
    liquidation of the Company’s Canadian operations.

Insurance Coverage —

The Company
    currently carries $400 million of property damage and
    business interruption coverage for windstorm losses in the Gulf
    of Mexico. Of this amount, $250 million is provided through
    Oil Insurance Limited (OIL) and is available on a per occurrence
    basis, but is subject to being prorated if total member claims
    for a single event exceed $500 million. The company also
    carries an additional $150 million of coverage for
    windstorm damage through the commercial market.

During the 2005 hurricane season, the Company utilized OIL to
    write physical damage insurance of $250 million per
    insurable event with a $7.5 million deductible. The
    available coverage was prorated for all members of the mutual,
    if the total claims for any one event exceeded $1 billion.
    Claims for damage caused by Hurricane Katrina exceeded the
    $1 billion limit, and the Company expects recoveries to be
    reduced by approximately 50 percent. Claims for damage
    caused by Hurricane Rita also exceeded the limitation, and the
    Company

F-11

APACHE
    CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

expects recoveries to be reduced approximately 30 percent.
    The Company also carried a supplementary $100 million of
    physical damage insurance for which it is expecting full
    recovery. The Company also carried a $150 million of
    business interruption insurance through its commercial policy to
    cover deferred and lost oil and natural gas production revenues.

The Company collected $150 million of business interruption
    proceeds for Hurricanes Katrina and Rita through the end of 2006
    and recorded $375 million for physical damage and removal
    of wreckage insurance claims, $42 million of which has been
    collected.

The Company recognizes an insurance receivable when collection
    of the receivable is deemed probable. Any recognition of an
    insurance receivable is recorded by crediting and offsetting the
    original charge. Any differential arising between insurance
    recoveries and insurance receivables is recorded as a
    capitalized cost or as an expense, consistent with its original
    treatment.

Net Income Per Common Share —

The
    Company’s basic earnings per share (EPS) amounts have been
    computed based on the average number of shares of common stock
    outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS reflects the potential
    dilution, using the treasury stock method that could occur if
    options were exercised and if restricted stock were fully vested.

Diluted EPS also includes the impact of unvested Share
    Appreciation Plans. For awards in which the share price goals
    have already been achieved, shares are included in diluted EPS
    using the treasury stock method. For those awards in which the
    share price goals have not been achieved, the number of
    contingently issuable shares included in the diluted EPS is
    based on the number of shares, if any, using the treasury stock
    method, that would be issuable if the market price of the
    Company’s stock at the end of the reporting period exceeded
    the share price goals under the terms of the plan.

Stock-Based Compensation —

On
    December 31, 2006, the Company had several stock-based
    employee compensation plans, which include Stock Option Plans,
    the Performance Plan, Share Appreciation Plans and restricted
    stock. These plans are defined and described more fully in
    Note 8, Capital Stock. The Company accounts for these plans
    under the fair value recognition provisions of
    SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based
    Compensation,” as amended and revised. Stock compensation
    awards granted are valued on the date of grant and are expensed
    on a straight-line basis over the required service period.

During the fourth quarter of 2004, the Financial Accounting
    Standards Board (FASB) issued

SFAS No. 123-R,

a revision to SFAS No. 123, which requires all
    companies to expense stock-based compensation. The rule was
    effective for the first fiscal year that began after
    June 15, 2005. Apache early adopted this statement in 2004
    electing to transition under the “Modified Retrospective
    Approach” as allowed under

SFAS No. 123-R.

Under this approach, the Company is required to expense all
    options and stock-based compensation that vested in the year of
    adoption based on the fair value of the stock compensation
    determined at the date of grant. Stock vesting in years prior to
    2004 was expensed in accordance with the rules applied by the
    Company during such period. Had the Company not early adopted

SFAS No. 123-R,

2004 net income would have been lower by $89 million
    ($56 million after tax), or $.17 per share on both a
    basic and diluted per share basis. Normally, net income would be
    negatively impacted by adopting

SFAS No. 123-R.

However, the Company’s 2000 Share Appreciation Plan,
    which certain awards were triggered in 2004, has a
    fair-market-value-based expense recorded under the provisions of

SFAS No. 123-R

that is substantially less than the intrinsic-value base cost of
    approximately $175 million that would have been recorded
    under the accounting rules of APB No. 25.

In addition to the expensing provisions discussed above,

SFAS No. 123-R

requires the Company to begin estimating expected future
    forfeitures under each stock compensation plan and to start
    valuing the Company’s liability-based compensation plan
    (Stock Appreciation Rights) under a fair value approach instead
    of the previously applied intrinsic valuation. The effects of
    changing the forfeiture estimates on existing stock plans and
    the valuation methodology for the Company’s liability plans
    resulted in Apache recording a Cumulative Effect of Change in
    Accounting Principle in 2004 totaling $2.1 million
    ($1.3 million after tax).

SFAS No. 123-R

also requires the

F-12

APACHE
    CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation
    cost to be reported as a financing cash flow rather than as an
    operating cash flow, as historically reported. The Company
    classified $49 million, $27 million and
    $32 million as financing cash inflows in 2006, 2005 and
    2004, respectively, that would have been classified as operating
    cash inflows had the Company not adopted the Statement.

Use of Estimates —

Preparation of
    financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
    generally accepted in the U.S., requires management to make
    estimates and assumptions that affect; the reported amounts of
    assets and liabilities, related disclosure of contingent assets
    and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the
    reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
    period. Certain accounting policies involve judgments and
    uncertainties to such an extent that there is reasonable
    likelihood that materially different amounts could have been
    reported under different conditions, or if different assumptions
    had been used. Apache evaluates its estimates and assumptions on
    a regular basis. The Company bases its estimates on historical
    experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be
    reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form
    the basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets
    and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other
    sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates and
    assumptions used in preparation of its financial statements.
    Significant estimates with regard to these financial statements
    include the estimate of proved oil and gas reserve quantities
    and the related present value of estimated future net cash flows
    therefrom. See Note 13 — Supplemental Oil and Gas
    Disclosure (Unaudited).

Treasury Stock —

The Company follows the
    weighted-average-cost method of accounting for treasury stock
    transactions.

Impact of Recently Issued Accounting Standards —

In July 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation
    No. 48 (FIN No. 48). FIN No. 48
    clarifies the accounting for income taxes, by prescribing a
    minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet
    before being recognized in the financial statements.
    FIN No. 48 also provides guidance on derecognizing,
    measurement, classification, interest and penalties, accounting
    in interim periods, disclosure and transition.
    FIN No. 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning
    after December 15, 2006. The Company will adopt
    FIN No. 48 as of January 1, 2007, as required.
    The cumulative effect of adopting FIN No. 48 will be
    recorded as a change to opening retained earnings in the first
    quarter of 2007. Management currently estimates that, upon
    adoption, a cumulative adjustment of less than $50 million
    will be charged to retained earnings to increase reserves for
    uncertain tax positions. This estimate is subject to revision as
    management completes its analysis.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157
    “Fair Value Measurements.” SFAS No. 157
    defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair
    value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.
    This statement is effective for financial statements issued for
    fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. The Company
    is continuing to assess the potential impacts this statement
    might have on Apache’s Consolidated Financial Statements
    and related footnotes.

Also in September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158
    “Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Plans and
    Other Postretirement Plans.” The statement requires
    employers to recognize any over-funded or under-funded status of
    a defined benefit postretirement plan as an asset or liability
    in their Consolidated Financial Statements. Unrealized
    components of net periodic benefit costs are reflected in other
    comprehensive income, net of tax. SFAS No. 158
    requires recognition of the funded status and related
    disclosures as of the end of the fiscal year ending after
    December 15, 2006. At yearend, the Company recorded an
    adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income in
    Shareholders’ Equity of $10.6 million
    ($6.1 million after tax). The adjustment reflects the
    recognition of the Company’s unfunded status for both the
    Company’s pension plan and post retirement benefit plan.
    Refer to Note 10, Commitments and Contingencies for
    additional disclosures.

Reclassifications —

ACQUISITIONS
    AND DIVESTITURES

    Acquisitions

U.S. Permian
    Basin

On January 5, 2006, the Company purchased Amerada
    Hess’s interest in eight fields located in the Permian
    basin of West Texas and New Mexico. The original purchase price
    was reduced from $404 million to $269 million because
    other interest owners exercised their preferential rights on a
    number of the properties. The settlement price on the date of
    closing of $239 million was adjusted primarily for revenues
    and expenditures occurring between the closing date and the
    effective date of the acquisition. Apache estimates that these
    fields had proved reserves of 27 MMbbls of liquid
    hydrocarbons and 27 Bcf of natural gas as of yearend 2005.

Argentina

On April 25, 2006, the Company acquired the operations of
    Pioneer National Resources (Pioneer) in Argentina for
    $675 million. The settlement price at closing, of
    $703 million, was adjusted for revenues and expenditures
    occurring between the effective date and closing date of the
    acquisition. The properties are located in the Neuquén,
    San Jorge and Austral basins of Argentina and had estimated
    net proved reserves of approximately 22 MMbbls of liquid
    hydrocarbons and 297 Bcf of natural gas as of
    December 31, 2005. Eight gas processing plants (five
    operated and three non-operated), 112 miles of operated
    pipelines in the Neuquén basin and 2,200 square miles
    of three-dimensional

Offshore
    Gulf of Mexico

On June 21, 2006, the Company completed its acquisition of
    the remaining producing properties of BP plc (BP) on the Outer
    Continental Shelf of the Gulf of Mexico. The original purchase
    price was reduced from $1.3 billion to $845 million
    because other interest owners exercised their preferential
    rights to purchase five of the original 18 producing fields. The
    settlement price on the date of closing of $821 million was
    adjusted primarily for revenues and expenditures occurring
    between the closing date and the effective date of the
    acquisition. The effective date of the purchase was
    April 1, 2006. The properties include 13 producing fields
    (nine of which are operated) with estimated proved reserves of
    19.5 MMbbls of liquid hydrocarbons and 148 Bcf of
    natural gas. Apache financed the purchase with cash on hand and
    commercial paper.

Pending
    Acquisition — U.S. Permian Basin

On January 18, 2007, the Company announced that it is
    acquiring controlling interest in 28 oil and gas fields in the
    Permian basin of West Texas from Anadarko Petroleum Corporation
    (Anadarko) for $1 billion. Apache estimates that these
    fields had proved reserves of 57 million barrels (MMbbls)
    of liquid hydrocarbons and 78 billion cubic feet (Bcf) of
    natural gas as of yearend 2006. The transaction will be
    effective the earlier of closing or March 31, 2007.
    Approximately 10 percent of the Permian basin properties
    are subject to third-party preferential purchase rights which,
    if exercised, would reduce the interests we purchase in those
    properties and the purchase price we would pay. The Company
    intends to fund the acquisition with debt. Apache and Anadarko
    are entering into a joint-venture arrangement to effect the
    transaction. In connection with the acquisition, the Company
    entered into cash flow hedges to protect against commodity price
    volatility. For the period of July 2007 through June 2010, the
    Company entered into hedges for a portion of both the oil and
    the natural gas with NYMEX based costless collars.

    Acquisitions

In May, 2005, Apache signed a farm-in agreement with Exxon Mobil
    Corporation (ExxonMobil) covering approximately
    650,000 acres of undeveloped properties in the Western
    Canadian province of Alberta. Under the agreement, Apache has
    the right to earn acreage sections by drilling an initial well
    on each such section. ExxonMobil will retain a royalty on fee
    lands and a working interest on leasehold acreage. The agreement
    also allows Apache to test additional horizons on approximately
    140,000 acres of property covered in a 2004 farm-in
    agreement with ExxonMobil.

    Acquisitions

During the third quarter of 2004, Apache entered into separate
    arrangements with ExxonMobil that provided for property
    transfers and joint operating and exploration activity across a
    broad range of prospective and mature

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

properties in (1) Western Canada, (2) West Texas and
    New Mexico, and (3) onshore Louisiana and the Gulf of
    Mexico-Outer Continental Shelf. Apache’s participation
    included cash payments of approximately $347 million,
    subject to normal post closing adjustments. The following
    details these transactions:

Western Canada.

In August 2004, Apache signed
    a farm-in agreement with ExxonMobil covering approximately
    380,000 gross acres of undeveloped properties in the
    Western Canadian Province of Alberta. Under the agreement,
    Apache has the right to earn acreage sections by drilling an
    initial well on each such section. By drilling at least
    250 wells during the initial two-year earning period under
    the agreement, Apache received a one-year extension in which to
    earn additional sections. As to any sections earned by Apache,
    ExxonMobil will retain a royalty on fee lands and a working
    interest on leasehold acreage, both of which will vary dependent
    on activity levels. The agreement also allows Apache to test
    additional horizons on approximately 140,000 acres of
    property covered in a 2004 farm-in agreement with ExxonMobil. In
    addition, during the term of this agreement, Apache is required
    to carry ExxonMobil’s retained working interest with
    respect to certain drilling, capping, completion, equipping and
    tie-in costs associated with wells drilled on leasehold acreage.

West Texas and New Mexico.

In September 2004,
    Apache acquired interests from ExxonMobil in 23 mature producing
    oil and gas fields in West Texas and New Mexico for
    $318 million. Apache separately contributed approximately
    $29 million into a partnership to obtain additional
    interests in the properties. ExxonMobil will retain interests in
    the properties through the partnership, including the right to
    receive, on certain fields, 60 percent of the oil proceeds
    above $30 per barrel in 2004, $29 per barrel in 2005
    and $28 per barrel during the period from 2006 thru 2009.

The partnership is subject to the provisions of FASB
    Interpretation No. 46 “variable interest
    entities” (FIN No. 46). Apache has concluded that
    it is not the primary beneficiary of the partnership as defined
    in that interpretation and will proportionately consolidate its
    partnership portion of the oil and gas properties. Under the
    partnership agreement, the Company’s subsidiaries are also
    subject to environmental and legal claims that could arise in
    the ordinary course of business. Apache is operating the oil and
    gas properties under contract for the partnership.

    Shelf.

In September 2004, Apache and ExxonMobil
    entered into joint exploration agreements to explore
    Apache’s acreage in South Louisiana and the Gulf of
    Mexico-Outer Continental Shelf. The agreements provide for an
    initial term of five years, with the potential for an additional
    five years based on expenditures by ExxonMobil. Pursuant to the
    agreement covering South Louisiana, Apache leased
    50 percent of its interests below certain producing or
    productive formations in the acreage to ExxonMobil, subject to
    retention of a 20 percent royalty interest. Pursuant to the
    agreement covering the Gulf of Mexico-Outer Continental Shelf,
    no assignments will be made until a prospect has been proposed
    and the initial well has been drilled. Apache will retain all
    rights in each prospect above certain producing or productive
    formations and further will retain a three percent overriding
    royalty interest in any property assigned to ExxonMobil.

Gulf of Mexico —

Outer Continental
    Shelf.

On August 20, 2004, Apache signed a
    definitive agreement to acquire all of Anadarko’s Gulf of
    Mexico-Outer Continental Shelf properties (excluding certain
    deepwater properties) for $537 million, subject to normal
    post-closing adjustments, including preferential rights. The
    transaction was effective as of October 1, 2004, and
    included interests in 74 fields covering 232 offshore blocks
    (approximately 664,000 acres) and 104 platforms. Eighty-nine of
    the blocks were undeveloped at the time of the acquisition.
    Apache operates 49 of the fields with approximately
    70 percent of the production.

Prior to Apache’s purchase from Anadarko, Morgan Stanley
    Capital Group, Inc. (Morgan Stanley) paid Anadarko
    $646 million to acquire an overriding royalty interest in
    these properties. Anadarko’s sale of an overriding royalty
    interest to Morgan Stanley is commonly known in the industry as
    a volumetric production payment (VPP), the obligations of which
    Apache assumed along with its purchase. Under the terms of the
    VPP, Morgan Stanley is to receive a fixed volume of oil and
    natural gas production (20 MMboe) over four years beginning
    in October 2004. The VPP represents a non-operating interest
    that is free of costs incurred for operations

F-16

APACHE
    CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

and production. Morgan Stanley is entitled to first production
    and may receive up to 90 percent of the production from the
    assets encumbered by the VPP, but Morgan Stanley may look only
    to the acquired properties for delivery of the scheduled
    volumes. The VPP is scheduled to terminate on August 31,
    2008, but may be extended if all scheduled VPP volumes have not
    been delivered to Morgan Stanley and the properties are still
    producing. The VPP includes restrictions on the Company’s
    ability to sell the properties subject to the VPP or resign as
    operator of VPP properties it currently operates. Upon
    termination of the VPP, all rights, titles and interests revert
    back to Apache. The Company does not record the reserves and
    production volumes attributable to the VPP.

The $537 million purchase price agreed to in the definitive
    agreement was subsequently adjusted for the exercise of
    preferential rights by third parties and other normal
    post-closing adjustments. After adjusting for these items,
    Apache paid $532 million for the properties and recorded
    estimated proved reserves of 60 MMboe, of which
    50 percent was natural gas. In addition, an
    $84 million liability for the future cost to produce and
    deliver the VPP volumes was recorded by the Company. This
    liability will be settled through a reduction of lease operating
    expenses as the volumes are produced and delivered to Morgan
    Stanley. Apache also recorded abandonment obligations for the
    properties of approximately $134 million and other
    obligations assumed from Anadarko in the amount of
    $27 million. Apache allocated $122 million of the
    purchase price to unproved property. The purchase price was
    funded by borrowings under the Company’s lines of credit
    and commercial paper program.

Divestitures

On August 8, 2006, the Company completed the sale of its
    24.5 percent interest in the Zhao Dong block offshore, the
    People’s Republic of China, to Australia-based ROC Oil
    Company Limited for $260 million, marking Apache’s
    exit from China. The effective date of the transaction was
    July 1, 2006, and the Company booked a gain of
    $174 million in the third quarter.

On January 6, 2006, the Company completed the sale of its
    55 percent interest in the deepwater section of
    Egypt’s West Mediterranean Concession to Amerada Hess for
    $413 million. Proceeds from the sale were accounted for as
    a reduction of capitalized costs. Apache did not have any proved
    reserves booked for these properties.

3.

HEDGING
    AND DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

Apache uses a variety of strategies to manage its exposure to
    fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas commodity prices. The
    Company’s hedging policy allows management to enter into
    hedges in connection with investments such as acquisitions. The
    success of an acquisition is significantly influenced by the
    Company’s ability to achieve targeted production at
    forecasted prices and commodity hedges effectively reduce price
    risk on a portion of the acquired production. During the third
    quarter of 2006, the Company’s Board of Directors
    authorized management to enter into derivative contracts on a
    portion of production generated from the 2006 drilling program.
    Hedge positions entered into for the drilling program were
    designed to protect the underlying investment economics of the
    program.

Differences between the fair values and the unrealized loss on
    derivatives before income taxes recognized in accumulated other
    comprehensive income (loss) are primarily related to premiums,
    recognition of unrealized gains and losses on certain
    derivatives that did not qualify for hedge accounting and hedge
    ineffectiveness. Based on applicable market prices as of yearend
    2006, the Company recorded an unrealized gain in other
    comprehensive income (loss) of $129 million
    ($84 million after tax), representing oil and gas
    derivative hedges. Any gain or loss will be realized in future
    earnings contemporaneously with the related sales of natural gas
    and crude oil production applicable to specific hedges.
    Approximately $72 million ($46 million after tax) of
    the $129 million unrealized as of December 31, 2006,
    applies to the next 12 months. However, these amounts are
    likely to vary materially as a

ASSET
    RETIREMENT OBLIGATION

Asset retirement obligations (ARO), associated with retiring
    tangible long-lived assets, are recognized as a liability in the
    period in which a legal obligation is incurred and becomes
    determinable. This liability is offset by a corresponding
    increase in the carrying amount of the underlying asset. The
    cost of the tangible asset, including the initially recognized
    ARO, is depleted such that the cost of the ARO is recognized
    over the useful life of the asset. The ARO is recorded at fair
    value, and accretion expense is recognized over time as the
    discounted liability is accreted to its expected settlement
    value. The fair value of ARO is measured using expected future
    cash outflows discounted at the company’s credit-adjusted
    risk-free interest rate.

Inherent in the fair value calculation of ARO are numerous
    assumptions and judgments including the ultimate settlement
    amounts, inflation factors, credit adjusted discount rates,
    timing of settlement, and changes in legal, regulatory,
    environmental and political environments. To the extent future
    revisions to these assumptions impact the fair value of the
    existing ARO liability, a corresponding adjustment is made to
    the asset balance.

The following table is a reconciliation of the asset retirement
    obligation liability:

The majority of Apache’s asset retirement obligations
    relate to plugging and abandonment of oil and gas properties.
    The Company records an abandonment liability associated with its
    oil and gas wells, facilities and platforms when those assets
    are placed in service or acquired, which for 2006 and 2005 is
    reflected above in liabilities incurred. Liabilities settled
    relate to individual properties plugged and abandoned or sold
    during the period.

Revisions to the estimated liability normally result from annual
    reassessments of the expected cash outflows and assumptions
    inherent in the ARO calculation. However, during the third
    quarter of 2005, nine of the Company’s offshore platforms
    in the Gulf of Mexico were toppled, two platforms were severely
    damaged and 12 non-operated structures were destroyed by
    Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Upon completing an assessment of
    hurricane related costs during the fourth quarter 2005, the
    Company increased its discounted ARO liability on the affected
    properties to $492 million. The revision reflects increased
    costs and acceleration in expected timing to abandon the
    platforms. During 2006, the Company increased its estimate
    another $232 million for hurricane related abandonment. The
    ultimate costs to abandon the affected platforms and properties
    will continue to be revised as more complete information
    surrounding the damage, timing and cost estimates is obtained
    from third parties and from actual costs incurred.

As of December 31, 2006, approximately $377 million of
    the estimated abandonment costs was classified as a current
    liability.

In May 2006, the Company amended its existing five-year
    revolving U.S. credit facility which was scheduled to
    mature on May 28, 2009. The amendment: (a) extended
    the maturity to May 28, 2011, (b) increased the size
    of the facility from $750 million to $1.5 billion, and
    (c) reduced the facility fees from .08 percent to
    .06 percent and reduced the margin over LIBOR on loans from
    .27 percent to .19 percent. The lenders also extended
    the maturity dates of the $150 million Canadian facility,
    the $150 million Australian facility and $385 million
    of the $450 million U.S. credit facility, for an
    additional year to May 12, 2011 from May 12, 2010. The
    Company also increased commercial paper availability to
    $1.95 billion from $1.20 billion.

By year end 2006, the Company extended the maturity of another
    $50 million of commitments under the $450 million U.S.
    credit facility for an additional year. As a result,
    $435 million will mature on May 12, 2011, and
    $15 million will mature on May 12, 2010.

As detailed above, the Company currently has $2.25 billion
    of syndicated bank credit facilities. The financial covenants of
    the credit facilities require the Company to maintain a

debt-to-capitalization

ratio of not greater than 60 percent at the end of any
    fiscal quarter. The negative covenants include restrictions on
    the Company’s ability to create liens and security
    interests on our assets, with exceptions for liens typically
    arising in the oil and gas industry, purchase money liens and
    liens arising as a matter of law, such as tax and mechanics
    liens. The Company may incur

F-20

APACHE
    CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

liens on assets located in the U.S., Canada and Australia of up
    to five percent of the Company’s consolidated assets, which
    approximated $1.2 billion as of December 31, 2006.
    There are no restrictions on incurring liens in countries other
    than the U.S., Canada and Australia. There are also restrictions
    on Apache’s ability to merge with another entity, unless
    the Company is the surviving entity, and a restriction on our
    ability to guarantee debt of entities not within our
    consolidated group.

There are no clauses in the facilities that permit the lenders
    to accelerate payments or refuse to lend based on unspecified
    material adverse changes (MAC clauses). The credit facility
    agreements do not have drawdown restrictions or prepayment
    obligations in the event of a decline in credit ratings.
    However, the agreements allow the lenders to accelerate payments
    and terminate lending commitments if Apache Corporation, or any
    of its U.S., Canadian and Australian subsidiaries, defaults on
    any direct payment obligation in excess of $100 million or
    has any unpaid, non-appealable judgment against it in excess of
    $100 million. The Company was in compliance with the terms
    of the credit facilities as of December 31, 2006. The
    Company’s

debt-to-capitalization

ratio as of December 31, 2006 was 22 percent.

At the Company’s option, the interest rate for the
    facilities is based on (i) the greater of (a) The JP
    Morgan Chase Bank prime rate or (b) the federal funds rate
    plus one-half of one percent or (ii) the London Inter-bank
    Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a margin determined by the
    Company’s senior long-term debt rating. The
    $1.5 billion and the $450 million credit facilities
    (U.S. credit facilities) also allow the Company to borrow
    under competitive auctions.

At December 31, 2006, the margin over LIBOR for committed
    loans was .19 percent on the $1.5 billion facility and
    .23 percent on the other three facilities. If the total
    amount of the loans borrowed under the $1.5 billion
    facility equals or exceeds 50 percent of the total facility
    commitments, then an additional .05 percent will be added
    to the margins over LIBOR. If the total amount of the loans
    borrowed under all of the other three facilities equals or
    exceeds 50 percent of the total facility commitments, then
    an additional .10 percent will be added to the margins over
    LIBOR. The Company also pays quarterly facility fees of
    .06 percent on the total amount of the $1.5 billion
    facility and .07 percent on the total amount of the other
    three facilities. The facility fees vary based upon the
    Company’s senior long-term debt rating. The
    U.S. credit facilities are used to support Apache’s
    commercial paper program. The available borrowing capacity under
    the credit facilities at December 31, 2006 was
    $690 million.

The Company has certain uncommitted money market lines of credit
    which are used from time to time for working capital purposes.
    As of December 31, 2006, $58.8 million was drawn on
    facilities in Argentina and $10.5 million was drawn on
    these facilities.

The Company has a $1.95 billion commercial paper program
    which enables Apache to borrow funds for up to 270 days at
    competitive interest rates. As of December 31, 2006, the
    Company has issued $1.56 billion in commercial paper. The
    weighted-average interest rate for commercial paper was
    5.15 percent in 2006 and 3.03 percent in 2005.

On May 15, 2003, Apache Finance Canada Corporation (Apache
    Finance Canada) issued $350 million of 4.375 percent,

12-year,

senior unsecured notes in a private placement. On March 4,
    2004, the Company completed an exchange offer with the holders
    of the notes, issuing publicly traded, registered notes of the
    same principal amount and with the same interest rates, payment
    terms and maturity. The notes are irrevocably and
    unconditionally guaranteed by Apache and are redeemable, as a
    whole or in part, at Apache Finance Canada’s option,
    subject to a make-whole premium. Interest is payable
    semi-annually on May 15 and November 15 of each year, commencing
    on November 15, 2003. The proceeds of the original note
    offering were used to reduce bank debt and outstanding
    commercial paper and for general corporate purposes.

The Company does not have the right to redeem any of its notes
    or debentures (other than the Apache Corporation 6.25-percent
    notes due April 15, 2012, the Apache Finance Australia
    6.5-percent notes due 2007 and the Apache Finance Canada
    4.375-percent notes due 2015) prior to maturity. Under

Company has the right to advance maturity on the 7.7-percent
    notes, 7.95-percent notes, 7.375-percent debentures and
    7.625-percent debentures.

The notes issued by Apache Finance Pty Ltd (Apache Finance
    Australia) and Apache Finance Canada are irrevocably and
    unconditionally guaranteed by Apache and, in the case of Apache
    Finance Australia, by Apache North America, Inc., an indirect
    wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. Under certain conditions
    related to changes in relevant tax laws, Apache Finance
    Australia and Apache Finance Canada have the right to redeem the
    notes prior to maturity. The Apache Finance Australia
    6.5-percent notes and the Apache Finance Canada 4.375-percent
    notes may be redeemed at the Company’s option subject to a
    make-whole premium (see Note 15 — Supplemental
    Guarantor Information).

The $12 million of discounts on the Company’s debt as
    of December 31, 2006, is amortized over the life of the
    debt issuances as additional interest expense.

As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, the Company had
    approximately $21 million and $18 million,
    respectively, of unamortized deferred loan costs associated with
    its various debt obligations. These costs are included in
    deferred charges and other in the accompanying consolidated
    balance sheet and are being amortized to expense over the life
    of the related debt.

The indentures for the notes described above place certain
    restrictions on the Company, including limits on Apache’s
    ability to incur debt secured by certain liens and its ability
    to enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions. Upon
    certain change in control, all of these debt instruments would
    be subject to mandatory repurchase, at the option of the holders.

Approximately $32 million of the net deferred tax assets is

    classified as current.

The Company has not recorded deferred income taxes on the
    undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries as management
    intends to permanently reinvest such earnings. As of
    December 31, 2006, the undistributed earnings of the
    foreign subsidiaries amounted to approximately
    $10.2 billion. Upon distribution of these earnings in the
    form of dividends or otherwise, the Company may be subject to
    U.S. income taxes and foreign withholding taxes. It is not
    practical, however, to estimate the amount of taxes that may be
    payable on the eventual remittance of these earnings after
    consideration of available foreign tax credits. Presently,
    limited foreign tax credits are available to reduce the
    U.S. taxes on such amounts if repatriated.

At December 31, 2006, the Company had state net operating
    loss carryforwards of $192 million and foreign net
    operating loss carryforwards of $6 million in Canada and
    $28 million in Argentina. The Company also had
    $41 million of corporate income tax net operating loss
    carryforwards and $19 million of supplemental tax net
    operating loss carryforwards in the U.K. The state net operating
    losses will expire over the next 20 years, if they are not
    otherwise utilized. The foreign net operating loss in Canada has
    a seven-year carryover period, while the Argentina net operating
    loss has a five-year carryover period. The net operating losses
    in the U.K. have an indefinite carryover period.

The Company’s tax return filings are subject to review by
    various taxing authorities in the jurisdictions in which the
    Company operates. Currently, the Company is under audit by the
    U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for the 2002 through
    2005 income tax years. The Company is in administrative appeals
    with the IRS regarding the 2002 and 2003 tax years and is in the
    process of responding to normal requests for information in
    respect of the Federal income tax returns for 2004 and 2005. The
    Company believes that it has adequately provided for income
    taxes and any related interest which may become payable in
    future years. However, the resolution of unagreed tax issues in
    the Company’s open tax years cannot be predicted with
    absolute certainty and differences may occur.

    stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, and
    performance-based share appreciation plans. A description of the
    Company’s stock-based compensation plans and related costs
    follows. For 2006, 2005 and 2004, stock-based compensation
    expensed was $35 million, $61 million and
    $43 million ($23 million, $40 million and
    $27 million after-tax), respectively. Costs related to the
    plans are capitalized or expensed based on the nature of the
    employee’s activities.

Stock
    Options

As of December 31, 2006, officers and employees held
    options to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock
    under one or more of the employee stock option plans adopted in
    1995, 1998, 2000 and 2005 (collectively, the Stock Option
    Plans). New shares of company stock will be issued for employee
    option exercises; however, under the 2000 Stock Option Plan,
    shares of treasury stock are used for employee option exercises.
    Under the Stock Option Plans, the exercise price of each option
    equals the market price of Apache’s common stock on the
    date of grant. Options generally become exercisable ratably over
    a four-year period and expire after 10 years. The Stock
    Option Plans allow for accelerated vesting if there is a change
    in control (as defined in each plan). All of the stock option
    plans, except for the 2000 Stock Option Plan, were submitted to
    and approved by the Company’s stockholders.

On October 31, 1996, the Company also established the 1996
    Performance Stock Option Plan (the Performance Plan) for
    substantially all full-time employees, excluding officers and
    certain key employees. Under the Performance Plan, the exercise
    price of each option equals the market price of Apache common
    stock on the date of grant. All options become exercisable after
    nine and one-half years and expire 10 years from the date
    of grant. Under the terms of the Performance Plan, no grants
    were made after December 31, 1998.

As of December 31, 2006, the remaining contractual life for
    options outstanding, expected to vest, and exercisable is
    6.3 years, 6.3 years and 4.5 years, respectively.
    The aggregate intrinsic value of options outstanding, expected
    to vest and exercisable at yearend was $161 million,
    $21 million and $138 million, respectively.

The fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of
    grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Assumptions
    used in the valuation are disclosed in the following table.
    Expected volatilities are based on implied volatilities of
    traded options on the Company’s stock, historical
    volatility of the Company’s stock, and other factors. The
    expected dividend yield is based on historical yields on the
    date of grant. The expected term of options granted represents
    the period of time that the options are expected to be
    outstanding and is derived from historical exercise behavior,
    current trends and values derived from lattice-based models. The
    risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in
    effect at the time of grant.

The intrinsic value of options exercised during 2006 was
    approximately $101 million and the Company realized an
    additional tax benefit of approximately $32 million for the
    amount of intrinsic value in excess of compensation cost
    recognized. As of December 31, 2006, the total compensation
    cost related to non-vested options not yet recognized was
    $62 million, which will be recognized over the remaining
    vesting period of the options.

Stock
    Appreciation Rights

During 2003 and 2004, the Company issued a total of 1,802,210
    and 1,328,400, respectively, of stock appreciation rights (SARs)
    to non-executive employees in lieu of stock options. None were
    issued in 2005 or 2006. The SARs vest ratably over four years
    and will be settled in cash upon exercise throughout their

10-year

life. The weighted-average exercise price of the SARs was $42.68
    and $28.78 for those issued in 2004 and 2003,

F-27

APACHE
    CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

respectively. The number of SARs outstanding as of
    December 31, 2006 was 2,057,581, of which 1,147,473 were
    exercisable. Because the SARs are cash settled, the Company
    records compensation expense on the vested SARs outstanding
    based on the fair value of the SARs at the end of each period.
    As of yearend, the weighted-average fair value of SARs
    outstanding was $36.01 based on the Black-Scholes valuation
    methodology using assumptions comparable to those discussed
    above. During 2006, 282,570 SARs were exercised and
    approximately 85,000 were forfeited. The aggregate of cash
    payments made to settle SARs exercised in 2006 was not material.

Restricted
    Stock

On May 5, 2002, Apache’s Board of Directors approved
    an executive restricted stock plan for all executive officers
    and certain key employees. At the time of grant, participants in
    the executive restricted stock plan may elect to defer income
    from restricted stock vesting into the Deferred Delivery Plan.
    The Company awarded 149,500, 155,300 and 87,500 restricted
    shares at a per share market price of $71.52, $55.90 and $42.68
    in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The value of the stock
    issued was established by the market price on the date of grant
    and will be recorded as compensation expense ratably over the
    four-year vesting terms. During 2006, 2005 and 2004,
    $6.1 million, $4.3 million and $2.8 million,
    respectively, was charged to expense as shares vested. As of
    December 31, 2006, there was $14 million of total
    unrecognized compensation cost related to approximately 318,175
    unvested shares. The weighted-average remaining life of unvested
    shares is approximately 3.5 years.

In December 1998, the Company granted a conditional stock award
    to an executive of the Company for a total of
    100,000 shares (230,992 shares after adjustment for
    subsequent stock dividends and a stock split) of the
    Company’s common stock. The award was composed of five
    annual installments, commencing on January 1, 1999 and each
    successive January through January 1, 2003. Vesting occurs
    on the fifth anniversary following each installment. Under the
    terms of the award, forty percent of the conditional grants are
    paid in cash at the market value of the Company’s stock on
    the date of payment and the balance is issued in Apache common
    stock. The first three periodic installments vested on
    January 1, 2004, January 1, 2005 and January 1,
    2006. The latter two annual installments will vest on
    January 1, 2007 and 2008, respectively.

2005 Share
    Appreciation Plan

On May 5, 2005, the Company’s stockholders approved
    the 2005 Share Appreciation Plan that provides incentives
    for employees to double Apache’s share price to $108 by the
    end of 2008, with an interim goal of $81 to be achieved by the
    end of 2007. To achieve the trigger price, the Company’s
    stock price must close at or above the stated threshold for
    10 days out of any 30 consecutive trading days by the end
    of the stated period. Under the plan, if the first threshold is
    achieved, approximately 1.4 million shares would be awarded
    for an intrinsic cost of $113 million. Achieving the second
    threshold would result in approximately 2.1 million shares
    awarded for an intrinsic cost of $230 million. Shares
    ultimately issued would be reduced for any minimum tax
    withholding requirements. Under the terms of this targeted stock
    plan, awards are payable in four equal installments, beginning
    with the date the trigger stock price is met and on each
    succeeding anniversary date.

Current accounting practices dictate that, regardless of whether
    these thresholds are ultimately achieved, the Company will
    recognize the fair value cost at the grant date based on
    numerous assumptions, including an estimate

F-28

APACHE
    CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

of the likelihood that Apache’s stock price will achieve
    these thresholds and the expected forfeiture rate. As a result,
    the Company will recognize expense and capitalized costs of
    approximately $81 million over the expected service life of
    the plan. For 2006 and 2005, $12.1 million
    ($7.8 million after tax) and $6.6 million
    ($4.3 million after tax) was expensed, respectively. In
    2006 and 2005, $6.2 million and $3.4 million was
    capitalized, respectively. No material forfeitures occurred
    during 2006.

    Appreciation Plan under which grants were made to substantially
    all full-time employees, including officers. The 2000 Share
    Appreciation Plan provided for issuance of up to an aggregate of
    8.08 million shares of Apache common stock, based on
    attainment of one or more of three share price goals (Share
    Price Goals)

and/or

a
    separate production goal (Production Goal). Generally, shares
    are issued in three installments over 24 months after
    achievement of each goal. The shares of Apache common stock
    contingently issuable under the 2000 Share Appreciation
    Plan were excluded from the computation of income per common
    share until the stated goals were met as described below.

The Share Price Goals were based on achieving a closing price of
    $43.29, $51.95 and $77.92 per share on any 10 days out
    of any 30 consecutive trading days prior to January 1,
    2005. Apache’s share price exceeded the first threshold
    ($43.29) under this plan on April 28, 2004. As such, the
    Company issued 913,000 shares of its common stock, after
    minimum tax withholding requirements, which were distributed in
    three annual installments in May 2004, 2005 and 2006,
    respectively. Also, on October 26, 2004, Apache’s
    share price exceeded the second threshold of $51.95.
    Accordingly, Apache issued 2.3 million additional shares of
    its common stock, after minimum tax withholding requirements, in
    three equal installments in November 2004, 2005 and 2006,
    respectively. The third share-price threshold ($77.92) did not
    trigger and the related grants were cancelled as of
    December 31, 2004. A

The outstanding shares at the end of 2005 and 2004 represent
    those shares remaining to be issued as a result of attainment of
    the $43.29 and $51.95 per share price goals. The remaining
    shares were issued net of minimum tax withholding as employees
    fulfilled the one-year remaining service period requirement in
    2006.

(2)

The fair value of each Share Price Goal conditional grant is
    estimated as of the date of grant using a Monte Carlo simulation
    with the following weighted-average assumptions used for grants
    in 2004: (i) risk-free interest rate of 3.04 percent;
    (ii) expected volatility of 35.97 percent; and
    (iii) expected dividend yield of .96 percent.

Timing of expense recognition under the 2000 Share
    Appreciation Plan was based on the accounting policies in place
    for each year the plan was outstanding and vesting (See
    Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies). The
    shares were initially granted in 2000 and were not expensed
    under APB Opinion No. 25. In 2004, Apache adopted

SFAS No. 123-R

retrospectively, to January 1, 2004, and expensed stock
    based compensation vesting during the year. Under

SFAS No. 123-R

expense amounts are determined based on the fair value of the
    plan on the date of grant and for 2006, 2005 and 2004,
    respectively, the Company recorded $1.1 million
    ($.7 million after-tax), $6.3 million
    ($4.1 million after-tax) and $13.1 million
    ($8.2 million after-tax) of expense, net of capitalized
    amounts for this plan of $.6 million, $3.5 million and
    $6.5 million.

The Production Goal was not attained prior to January 1,
    2005 and, therefore, no shares were issued under that goal and
    the related grants were cancelled as of December 31, 2004.

Preferred
    Stock

The Company has five million shares of no par preferred stock
    authorized, of which 25,000 shares have been designated as
    Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock (the
    Series A Preferred Stock) and 100,000 shares have been
    designated as the 5.68 percent Series B Cumulative
    Preferred Stock (the Series B Preferred Stock).

Rights to
    Purchase Series A Preferred Stock

In December 1995, the Company declared a dividend of one right
    (a Right) for each 2.31 shares (adjusted for subsequent
    stock dividends and a

two-for-one

stock split) of Apache common stock outstanding on
    January 31, 1996. Each full Right entitles the registered
    holder to purchase from the Company one ten-thousandth
    (1/10,000) of a share of Series A Preferred Stock at a
    price of $100 per one ten-thousandth of a share, subject to
    adjustment. The Rights are exercisable 10 calendar days
    following a public announcement that certain persons or groups
    have acquired 20 percent or more of the outstanding shares
    of Apache common stock or 10 business days following
    commencement of an offer for 30 percent or more of the
    outstanding shares of Apache common stock. In addition, if a
    person or group becomes the beneficial owner of 20 percent
    or more of Apache’s outstanding common stock (flip in
    event); each Right will become exercisable for shares of
    Apache’s common stock at 50 percent of the then

F-30

APACHE
    CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

market price of the common stock. If a 20 percent
    shareholder of Apache acquires Apache, by merger or otherwise,
    in a transaction where Apache does not survive or in which
    Apache’s common stock is changed or exchanged (flip over
    event), the Rights become exercisable for shares of the common
    stock of the company acquiring Apache at 50 percent of the
    then market price for Apache common stock. Any Rights that are
    or were beneficially owned by a person who has acquired
    20 percent or more of the outstanding shares of Apache
    common stock and who engages in certain transactions or realizes
    the benefits of certain transactions with the Company will
    become void. If an offer to acquire all of the Company’s
    outstanding shares of common stock is determined to be fair by
    Apache’s board of directors, the transaction will not
    trigger a flip in event or a flip over event. The Company may
    also redeem the Rights at $.01 per Right at any time until
    10 business days after public announcement of a flip in event.
    These rights were originally scheduled to expire on
    January 31, 2006. Effective as of that date, the rights
    were reset to one right per share of common stock and the
    expiration was extended to January 31, 2016. Unless the
    Rights have been previously redeemed, all shares of Apache
    common stock issued by the Company after January 31, 1996
    will include Rights. Unless and until the Rights become
    exercisable, they will be transferred with and only with the
    shares of Apache common stock.

Series B
    Preferred Stock

In August 1998, Apache issued 100,000 shares
    ($100 million) of Series B Preferred Stock in the form
    of one million depositary shares, each representing one-tenth
    (1/10) of a share of Series B Preferred Stock, for net
    proceeds of $98 million. The Series B Preferred Stock
    has no stated maturity, is not subject to a sinking fund and is
    not convertible into Apache common stock or any other securities
    of the Company. Apache has the option to redeem the
    Series B Preferred Stock at $1,000 per preferred share
    on or after August 25, 2008. Holders of the shares are
    entitled to receive cumulative cash dividends at an annual rate
    of $5.68 per depositary share when, and if, declared by
    Apache’s board of directors.

The fair value of the notes and debentures is based upon an
    estimate provided to the Company by an independent investment
    banking firm. The carrying amount of the commercial paper and
    money market lines of credit approximated fair value because the
    interest rates are variable and reflective of market rates. The
    Company’s trade receivables and trade payables are by their
    very nature short-term. The carrying values included in the
    accompanying consolidated balance sheet approximate fair value
    at December 31, 2006 and 2005.

COMMITMENTS
    AND CONTINGENCIES

Litigation

Texaco
    China B.V.

Apache recorded a reserve in the second quarter of 2004 to fully
    reflect a pre-tax $71 million international arbitration
    award to Texaco China B.V. (Texaco China). The arbitration award
    was subject to interest at nine percent until May 6, 2005,
    the date following the federal district court ruling discussed
    below. On May 6, 2005, the interest rate dropped to
    3.33 percent. Apache accrued $3.2 million of interest
    expense in 2004, $3.8 million in 2005 and $593,000 in the
    first quarter of 2006. In September 2001, Texaco China initiated
    an arbitration proceeding against Apache China Corporation LDC
    (Apache China), later adding Apache Bohai Corporation LDC
    (Apache Bohai) to the arbitration. In the arbitration Texaco
    China claimed damages, plus interest, arising from Apache
    Bohai’s alleged failure to drill three wells, prior to
    re-assignment of the interest to Texaco China. Apache believes
    that the finding of the arbitrator is unsupported by the facts
    and the law, and Apache filed an application to vacate the award
    in federal court. Texaco China filed an application to confirm
    the award in the same court. On May 5, 2005, the federal
    district court ruled in favor of Texaco China. The Company
    appealed that decision to the circuit court of appeals. In
    January 2005, while awaiting the decision of the
    U.S. federal courts, Texaco China also filed a proceeding
    against Apache

China and Apache Bohai in the People’s Republic of China to
    recognize the award, apparently seeking the same relief as
    sought in U.S. federal court. The parties subsequently
    agreed to stay enforcement of the arbitration award in China and
    elsewhere pending the final, determinative outcome of all
    possible appeals in the U.S. federal courts. On
    February 27, 2007, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals
    affirmed the trial court’s decision in favor of Texaco
    China. Apache is considering its remaining appeal options.

Predator

In December 2000, certain subsidiaries of the Company and Murphy
    Oil Corporation (Murphy) filed a lawsuit in Canada charging The
    Predator Corporation Ltd. (Predator) and others with
    misappropriation and misuse of confidential well data to obtain
    acreage offsetting a significant natural gas discovery in the
    Ladyfern area of northeast British Columbia made by Apache
    Canada Ltd. (Apache Canada) and Murphy during 2000. In February
    2001, Predator filed a counterclaim seeking more than
    C$6 billion and later reduced this amount to approximately
    C$3.6 billion. In September 2004, the Canadian court
    granted Apache Canada’s motion for summary judgment on the
    counterclaim, dismissing more than C$3 billion of
    Predator’s claims against Apache Canada and Murphy, and
    dismissing all claims against both Murphy’s president and
    Apache Canada’s president. Predator appealed the summary
    judgment. On February 28, 2006, the Court of Appeal of
    Alberta dismissed Predator’s appeal. Predator did not seek
    review by the Supreme Court of Canada. The trial court also
    granted Apache Canada’s request for costs and disbursements
    in the approximate amount of C$700,000, which Predator paid. In
    September 2006 the trial court rendered a judgment (the
    Judgment) in favor of Murphy and Apache’s claim against
    Predator and dismissed Predator’s C$365 million
    remaining counterclaim against Murphy and Apache. The parties
    entered into a settlement agreement not to appeal the judgment,
    thereby making the judgment final. As a result, Apache
    recognized approximately $8 million of revenue in the third
    quarter of 2006.

Grynberg

In 1997, Jack J. Grynberg began filing lawsuits against other
    natural gas producers, gatherers, and pipelines claiming that
    the defendants have under paid royalty to the federal government
    and Indian tribes by mis-measurement of the volume and heating
    content of natural gas and are responsible for acts of others
    who mis-measured natural gas. In 2004, Grynberg filed suit
    against Apache making the same claims he had made previously
    against others in the industry. With the addition of Apache,
    there are more than 300 defendants to these actions. The
    Grynberg lawsuits have been consolidated through a federal
    Multi-District Litigation (MDL) action located in Wyoming
    federal court for discovery and pre-trial purposes. The
    defendants in the MDL, jointly

and/or

separately, filed motions to dismiss based upon certain
    statutory requirements Grynberg is required to prove to proceed
    with these qui tam lawsuits. On October 20, 2006, the
    multi-district Judge ruled in favor of Apache and other
    defendants on these motions to dismiss, dismissing
    Grynberg’s lawsuit against Apache and others. Grynberg has
    appealed the ruling. Although Grynberg purports to be acting on
    behalf of the government, the federal government has declined to
    join in the cases. While an adverse judgment against Apache is
    possible, Apache does not believe the plaintiff’s claims
    have merit and plans to vigorously pursue its defenses against
    these claims. Exposure related to this lawsuit is not currently
    determinable.

Egypt Tax
    Authority

As of the end of 2004, the Egyptian Tax Authority (ETA) had
    issued claims for back taxes against various Apache subsidiaries
    in Egypt totaling approximately $113.4 million (at current
    exchange rates) relating to periods as far back as 1994. In July
    2005, the ETA made a new claim for approximately
    $85 million of additional taxes for the

1994-1999

tax years. All of the ETA tax claims, have now been finally
    resolved in Apache’s favor with no liability.

Argentine
    Environmental Claims

In connection with the Pioneer acquisition, the Company acquired
    a subsidiary of Pioneer in Argentina (PNRA) that is involved in
    various administrative proceedings with environmental
    authorities in the Neuquén Province relating to permits for
    and discharges from operations in that province. PNRA is
    cooperating with the proceedings, although it from time to time
    challenges whether certain assessed fines, which could exceed
    $100,000, are appropriate. PNRA was named in a suit initiated
    against oil companies operating in the Neuquén basin
    entitled

Asociación de Superficiarios de la
    Patagonia v. YPF S.A.

,

et. al.

, originally filed
    on August 21, 2003, in the Argentine National Supreme Court
    of Justice. The plaintiffs, a private group of landowners, have
    also named the national government and several provinces as
    third parties. The lawsuit alleges injury to the environment
    generally by the oil and gas industry. The plaintiffs
    principally seek from all defendants, jointly, (i) the
    remediation of the contaminated sites, of the superficial and
    underground waters, and of the soil that was degraded as a
    result of deforestation, (ii) if the remediation is not
    possible, payment of an indemnification for the material and
    moral damages in an unspecified amount claimed from defendants
    operating in the Neuquén basin, of which PNRA is a small
    portion, (iii) adoption of all of the necessary measures to
    prevent future environmental damages, and (iv) the creation
    of a private restoration fund to provide coverage for
    remediation of potential future environmental damages. Much of
    the alleged damage relates to operations by the Argentine state
    oil company, which conducted oil and gas operations throughout
    Argentina prior to its privatization, which began in 1990. While
    the plaintiffs will seek to make all oil and gas companies
    operating in the Neuquén basin jointly liable for each
    others’ actions, PNRA will defend on an individual basis
    and attempt to require the plaintiffs to delineate damages by
    company. PNRA intends to defend itself vigorously in the case.
    It is not certain exactly how or what the court will do in this
    matter as it is the first of its kind. While it is possible PNRA
    may incur liabilities related to the environmental claims, no
    reasonable prediction can be made as PNRA’s exposure
    related to this lawsuit is not currently determinable.

Louisiana
    Restoration

Numerous surface owners have filed claims or sent demand letters
    to various oil and gas companies, including Apache, claiming
    that, under either expressed or implied lease terms or Louisiana
    law, they are liable for damage measured by the cost of
    restoration of leased premises to their original condition as
    well as damages for contamination and cleanup. Many of these
    lawsuits claim small amounts, while others assert claims in
    excess of a million dollars. Also, some lawsuits or claims are
    being settled or resolved, while others are still being filed.
    Any exposure, therefore, related to these lawsuits and claims is
    not currently determinable. While an adverse judgment against
    Apache is possible, Apache intends to actively defend the cases.

Hurricane
    Related Litigation

A class action lawsuit has been filed styled

Barasich,
    et al., individually and as representatives of all those
    similarly situated vs. Columbia Gulf Transmission Co.,
    et al,

No. 05-4161,

United States District Court, Eastern District of Louisiana

    against all oil and gas and pipeline companies that drilled or
    dredged in the marshes of South Louisiana. The lawsuit claims
    defendants were negligent by constructing canals and conducting
    oil and gas operations, which plaintiffs contend is the sole

and/or

almost the sole cause of the alleged destruction of the marshes
    in South Louisiana, which plaintiffs blame for all

and/or

substantially all loss of life and destruction of property which
    was incurred from Hurricane Katrina. Apache was not named, but
    if a defendant class is certified, would fall within the
    definition alleged. Apache believes such claims are without
    merit, and if joined will undertake an active defense to such
    claims.

defendants (oil and gas companies, electric and coal companies,
    and chemical manufacturers). Plaintiffs claim defendants’
    emissions of “greenhouse gases”, cause global warming,
    which they blame as the cause of their damages. They also claim
    that the oil company defendants artificially inflated and
    manipulated the prices of gasoline, diesel fuel, jet fuel,
    natural gas, and other end-use petrochemicals, and covered it up
    by misrepresentations. They further allege a conspiracy to
    disseminate misinformation and cover up the relationship between
    the defendants and global warming. Plaintiffs seek, among other
    damages, actual, consequential, and punitive or exemplary
    damages. A motion has been filed to amend the lawsuit and add
    additional defendants, including Apache. Apache has not yet been
    served.

Insurance
    Claims

In connection with damage related to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita
    in 2005, Apache has filed claims with OIL Insurance Ltd.
    (“OIL”), who provided Apache’s first level of
    property damage insurance coverage (“OIL Coverage”)
    and with its principal commercial insurance underwriters, who
    provided Apache with property damage insurance coverage in
    excess of OIL Coverage, business interruption insurance
    coverage, and liability coverage (collectively “Excess
    Coverage”). Through December 31, 2006, we have
    received payments of $37 million from OIL for property
    damage and $150 million from underwriters providing Excess
    Coverage for business interruption (the entire amount of the
    business interruption coverage) and $5 million for property
    damage. In addition, Apache has $87 million of outstanding
    claims under its Excess Coverage for property damage and
    anticipates additional claims of $13 million, which is the
    remainder of the coverage for property damage (collectively the
    “Remaining Claims”). In addition, Apache’s
    liability policy with certain underwriters who provided Excess
    Coverage includes an endorsement providing $165 million per
    occurrence for wreck removal costs and expenses. Similarly,
    Apache has a second layer of liability coverage from certain
    underwriters which provides an additional $100 million of
    excess coverage per occurrence which includes the same
    endorsement for wreck removal costs and expenses (the
    “Second Excess Coverage”). Apache informed the lead
    underwriter on the Excess Coverage policy and the Second Excess
    Coverage policy, of our plans to make a claim under the wreck
    removal coverage, and the lead underwriter has requested that
    Apache not make such claims in return for payment of the
    Remaining Claims and a waiver of the underwriters’ alleged
    right to seek repayment of the amounts already paid to Apache
    for property damage and business interruption. On account of
    this request from the lead underwriter, Apache filed an action
    styled “Apache Corporation v. Houston Casualty
    Company, and Certain Underwriters at Interest” in the
    District Court of Harris County in Houston, Texas seeking a
    declaratory judgment that the underwriters providing Excess
    Coverage are obligated to pay the Remaining Claims and have no
    right to seek repayment of any previously paid amounts,
    regardless of any final resolution of Apache’s right to
    recovery under the wreck removal endorsement.

General

The Company is involved in other litigation and is subject to
    governmental and regulatory controls arising in the ordinary
    course of business. The Company has an accrued liability of
    approximately $7 million for other legal contingencies that
    are probable of occurring and can be reasonably estimated. It is
    management’s opinion that the loss for any such other
    litigation matters and claims that are reasonably possible to
    occur will not have a material adverse affect on the
    Company’s financial position or results of operations.

Other
    Commitments and Contingencies

Environmental

The Company, as an owner or lessee and operator of oil and gas
    properties, is subject to various federal, provincial, state,
    local and foreign country laws and regulations relating to
    discharge of materials into, and protection of, the environment.
    These laws and regulations may, among other things, impose
    liability on the lessee under an oil and gas lease for the cost

liability for pollution damages. In some instances, the Company
    may be directed to suspend or cease operations in the affected
    area. We maintain insurance coverage, which we believe is
    customary in the industry, although we are not fully insured
    against all environmental risks.

Apache manages its exposure to environmental liabilities on
    properties to be acquired by identifying existing problems and
    assessing the potential liability. The Company also conducts
    periodic reviews, on a company-wide basis, to identify changes
    in its environmental risk profile. These reviews evaluate
    whether there is a probable liability, its amount, and the
    likelihood that the liability will be incurred. The amount of
    any potential liability is determined by considering, among
    other matters, incremental direct costs of any likely
    remediation and the proportionate cost of employees who are
    expected to devote a significant amount of time directly to any
    possible remediation effort. As it relates to evaluations of
    purchased properties, depending on the extent of an identified
    environmental problem, the Company may exclude a property from
    the acquisition, require the seller to remediate the property to
    Apache’s satisfaction, or agree to assume liability for the
    remediation of the property. The Company’s general policy
    is to limit any reserve additions to any incidents or sites that
    are considered probable to result in an expected remediation
    cost exceeding $100,000. Any environmental costs and liabilities
    that are not reserved for are treated as an expense when
    actually incurred. In our estimation, neither these expenses nor
    expenses related to training and compliance programs are likely
    to have a material impact on our financial condition. As of
    December 31, 2006, the Company had an undiscounted reserve
    for environmental remediation of approximately $17 million.
    Apache is not aware of any environmental claims existing as of
    December 31, 2006, which have not been provided for or
    would otherwise have a material impact on its financial position
    or results of operations. There can be no assurance, however,
    that current regulatory requirements will not change, or past
    non-compliance with environmental laws will not be discovered on
    the Company’s properties.

International
    Lease Concessions

The Company, through its subsidiaries, has acquired or has been
    conditionally or unconditionally granted exploration rights in
    Egypt, Australia, the North Sea and Argentina. In order to
    comply with the contracts and agreements granting these rights,
    the Company, through various wholly-owned subsidiaries, is
    committed to expend approximately $240 million through 2010.

Contractual
    Obligations

The Company has leases for buildings, facilities and equipment
    with varying expiration dates through 2035. Net rental expense
    was $23 million, $20 million, and $17 million for
    2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

The Company has additional purchase commitments in Egypt, not
    included in the table below, for pipeline and gas plant
    construction totaling $390 million through 2008.

Retirement
    and Deferred Compensation Plans

The Company provides a 401(k) savings plan for employees which
    allows participating employees to elect to contribute up to
    25 percent of their salaries (50 percent effective
    January 1, 2006), with Apache making matching contributions
    up to a maximum of six percent of each employee’s salary.
    In addition, the Company annually contributes six percent of
    each participating employee’s compensation, as defined, to
    a money purchase retirement plan. The 401(k) plan and the money
    purchase retirement plan are subject to certain
    annually-adjusted, government-mandated restrictions which limit
    the amount of each employee’s contributions.

For certain eligible employees, the Company also provides a
    non-qualified retirement/savings plan which allows the deferral
    of up to 50 percent of each employee’s salary, and
    which accepts employee contributions and the Company’s
    matching contributions in excess of the above-referenced
    restrictions on the 401(k) savings plan and money purchase
    retirement plan. Additionally, Apache Energy Limited, Apache
    Canada Ltd. and Apache North Sea Limited maintain separate
    retirement plans, as required under the laws of Australia,
    Canada and the United Kingdom, respectively.

Vesting in the Company’s contributions to the 401(k)
    savings plan, the money purchase retirement plan and the
    non-qualified retirement/savings plan occurs at the rate of
    20 percent for every full-year of employment. Upon a change
    in control of ownership, vesting is immediate. Total costs under
    all plans were $41 million, $39 million and
    $31 million for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Apache also provides a funded noncontributory defined benefit
    pension plan (U.K. Pension Plan) covering existing BP North Sea
    employees hired by the Company as part of the BP acquisition.
    The pension plan provides defined benefits based on years of
    service and final average salary. The plan is closed to newly
    hired employees.

Apache also has a postretirement benefit plan covering
    substantially all of its U.S. employees. The postretirement
    benefit plan provides for medical benefits up until the age of
    65. The plan is contributory with participants’
    contributions adjusted annually. The postretirement benefit plan
    does not pay benefits once participants become eligible for
    Medicare and is not affected by the Medicare Modernization Act
    of 2003.

As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, the accumulated benefit
    obligation for the pension plan was $90 million and
    $76 million, respectively.

Apache’s defined benefit pension plan assets are held by a
    non-related Trustee who has been instructed to invest the assets
    in an equal blend of equity securities and low-risk debt
    securities. The Company believes this blend of investments will
    provide a reasonable rate of return and ensure that the benefits
    promised to members are provided. The plan’s assets do not
    include any equity or debt securities of Apache. A breakout of
    previous allocations for plan asset holdings and the target
    allocation for the Company’s plan assets are summarized

MAJOR
    CUSTOMERS

In 2006, purchases by BP accounted for 20 percent of the
    Company’s oil and gas production revenues.

In 2005, purchases by BP and Shell each accounted for
    16 percent of the Company’s oil and gas production
    revenues.

In 2004, purchases by EGPC and BP accounted for 17 percent
    and 15 percent, respectively, of the Company’s oil and
    gas production revenues.

Concentration
    of Credit Risk

The Company’s revenues are derived principally from
    uncollateralized sales to customers in the oil and gas industry;
    therefore, customers may be similarly affected by changes in
    economic and other conditions within the industry. Apache has
    not experienced significant credit losses on such sales. Apache
    sells a large portion of its Egyptian crude oil and natural gas
    to EGPC for U.S. dollars. Beginning in 2001, we experienced
    a gradual decline in timeliness of receipts from EGPC for our
    Egyptian oil and gas sales. Deteriorating economic conditions
    during 2001 in Egypt lessened the availability of
    U.S. dollars, resulting in a one to two month delay in
    receipts from EGPC. During 2006, we experienced variability in
    the timing of cash receipts from EGPC. We have not established a
    reserve for these Egyptian receivables because we continue to
    get paid, albeit late, and have no indication that we will not
    be able to collect our receivable.

BUSINESS
    SEGMENT INFORMATION

Apache has interests in six countries: the United States,
    Canada, Egypt, Australia, offshore the United Kingdom
    (U.K.) in the North Sea and Argentina. The Company divested its
    interest in China effective July 1, 2006. Apache’s
    reportable segments are primarily in the business of crude oil
    and natural gas exploration and production. The accounting
    policies of the segments are the same as those described in the
    summary of significant accounting policies. The Company
    evaluates segment performance based on profit or loss from oil
    and gas operations before income and expense items incidental to
    oil and gas operations and income taxes. Apache’s

Oil and
    Gas Reserve Information

We engage Ryder Scott Company, L.P. Petroleum Consultants as
    independent petroleum engineers to review our estimates of
    proved hydrocarbon liquid and gas reserves and provide an
    opinion letter on the reasonableness of Apache’s internal
    projections. Ryder Scott opined that they were in acceptable
    agreement with the Company’s overall reserve estimates and
    that the reserves they reviewed conform to the SEC’s
    definition of proved reserves as set forth in

Rule 210.4-10

(a) of

Regulation S-X.

The independent reviews typically cover a large percentage of
    major value fields, international properties and new wells
    drilled during the year. During 2006, 2005 and 2004, their
    review covered 75, 74 and 79 percent of Apache’s
    worldwide estimated reserve value, respectively.

APACHE

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
    (Continued)

There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating
    quantities of proved reserves and projecting future rates of
    production and timing of development expenditures. The following

As of December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, on a barrel of
    equivalent basis 32, 30 and 33 percent of our estimated
    worldwide reserves, respectively, were classified as proved
    undeveloped. Approximately 22 percent of our year-end 2006
    estimated proved developed reserves are classified as proved not
    producing. These reserves relate to zones that are either behind
    pipe, or that have been completed but not yet produced, or zones
    that have been produced in the past, but are not now producing
    because of mechanical reasons. These reserves may be regarded as
    less certain than producing reserves because they are frequently
    based on volumetric calculations rather than performance data.
    Future production associated with behind pipe reserves is
    scheduled to follow depletion of the currently producing zones
    in the same wellbores. It should be noted that additional
    capital may have to be spent to access these reserves. The
    capital and economic impact of production timing are reflected
    in this Note 14, under “Future Net Cash Flows.”
    The Company reports all estimated proved reserves held under
    production sharing agreements utilizing the economic interest
    method, which excludes the host country’s share of reserves.

Future
    Net Cash Flows

Future cash inflows are based on year-end oil and gas prices
    except in those instances where future natural gas or oil sales
    are covered by physical contract terms providing for higher or
    lower amounts. Operating costs, production and ad valorem taxes
    and future development costs are based on current costs with no
    escalation.

The following table sets forth unaudited information concerning
    future net cash flows for oil and gas reserves, net of income
    tax expense. Income tax expense has been computed using expected
    future tax rates and giving effect to tax deductions and credits
    available, under current laws, and which relate to oil and gas
    producing activities. This information does not purport to
    present the fair market value of the Company’s oil and gas
    assets, but does present a standardized disclosure concerning
    possible future net cash flows that would result under the
    assumptions used.

Impact of
    Pricing

The estimates of cash flows and reserve quantities shown above
    are based on year-end oil and gas prices, except in those cases
    where future natural gas or oil sales are covered by physical
    contracts at specified prices. Forward price volatility is
    largely attributable to supply and demand perceptions for
    natural gas and oil.

Under full-cost accounting rules, the Company reviews the
    carrying value of its proved oil and gas properties each quarter
    on a

country-by-country

basis. Under these rules, capitalized costs of proved oil and
    gas properties, net of accumulated DD&A and deferred income
    taxes, may not exceed the present value of estimated future net
    cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves, discounted at
    10 percent, plus the lower of cost or fair value of
    unproved properties included in the costs being amortized, net
    of related tax effects (the “ceiling”). These rules
    generally require pricing future oil and gas production at the
    unescalated oil and gas prices at the end of each fiscal quarter
    and require a write-down if the “ceiling” is exceeded.
    Given the volatility of oil and gas prices, it is reasonably
    possible that the Company’s estimate of discounted future
    net cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves could change in
    the near term. If oil and gas prices decline significantly, even
    if only for a short period of time, it is possible that
    write-downs of oil and gas properties could occur in the future.

SUPPLEMENTAL
    GUARANTOR INFORMATION

Prior to 2001, Apache Finance Australia was a finance subsidiary
    of Apache with no independent operations. In this capacity, it
    issued approximately $270 million of publicly traded notes
    that are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Apache and,
    beginning in 2001, Apache North America, Inc. The guarantors of
    Apache Finance Australia have joint and several liabilities.
    Similarly, Apache Finance Canada was also a finance subsidiary
    of Apache and had issued approximately $300 million of
    publicly traded notes that were fully and unconditionally
    guaranteed by Apache.

Generally, the issuance of publicly traded securities would
    subject those subsidiaries to the reporting requirements of the
    Securities and Exchange Commission. Since these subsidiaries had
    no independent operations and qualified as “finance
    subsidiaries,” they were exempted from these requirements.

During 2001, Apache contributed stock of its Australian and
    Canadian operating subsidiaries to Apache Finance Australia and
    Apache Finance Canada, respectively. As a result of these
    contributions, they no longer qualify as finance subsidiaries.
    As allowed by the SEC rules, the following condensed
    consolidating financial statements are provided as an
    alternative to filing separate financial statements.

Each of the companies presented in the condensed consolidating
    financial statements is wholly owned and has been consolidated
    in Apache Corporation’s consolidated financial statements
    for all periods presented. As such, the condensed consolidating
    financial statements should be read in conjunction with the
    financial statements of Apache Corporation and subsidiaries and
    notes thereto of which this note is an integral part.
