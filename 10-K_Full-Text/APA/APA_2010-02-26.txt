BUSINESS AND PROPERTIES

General

Apache Corporation, a Delaware corporation formed in 1954, is an
    independent energy company that explores for, develops and
    produces natural gas, crude oil and natural gas liquids. In
    North America, our exploration and production interests are
    focused in the Gulf of Mexico, the Gulf Coast, East Texas, the
    Permian Basin, the Anadarko Basin and the Western Sedimentary
    Basin of Canada. Outside of North America, we have exploration
    and production interests onshore Egypt, offshore Western
    Australia, offshore the U.K. in the North Sea (North Sea), and
    onshore Argentina. We also have exploration interests on the
    Chilean side of the island of Tierra del Fuego. Our common
    stock, par value $0.625 per share, has been listed on the New
    York Stock Exchange (NYSE) since 1969, on the Chicago Stock
    Exchange (CHX) since 1960, and on the NASDAQ National Market
    (NASDAQ) since 2004. On May 19, 2009, we filed
    certifications of our compliance with the listing standards of
    the NYSE and the NASDAQ, including our principal executive
    officer’s certification of compliance with the NYSE
    standards. Through our website, www.apachecorp.com, you can

    in addition to copies of all recent press releases.

We hold interests in many of our United States (U.S.), Canadian
    and other international properties through subsidiaries,
    including Apache Canada Ltd., DEK Energy Company (DEKALB),
    Apache Energy Limited (AEL), Apache North America, Inc. and
    Apache Overseas, Inc. Properties to which we refer in this
    document may be held by those subsidiaries. We treat all
    operations as one line of business. References to
    “Apache” or the “Company” include Apache
    Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries unless otherwise
    specifically stated.

Growth
    Strategy

Apache’s mission is to grow a profitable upstream oil and
    gas company for the long-term benefit of our shareholders.
    Apache’s long-term perspective has many dimensions, with
    the following core principles:

•

own a balanced portfolio of core assets;

•

maintain financial flexibility and a strong balance
    sheet; and

•

optimize rates of return, earnings and cash flow.

Throughout the cycles of our industry, these strategies have
    underpinned our ability to deliver long-term production and
    reserve growth and achieve competitive investment rates of
    return for the benefit of our shareholders. We have increased
    reserves 22 out of the last 24 years and production 29 out
    of the past 31 years, a testament to our consistency over
    the long-term.

Portfolio
    of Assets

We own a portfolio of assets in core areas that provide
    opportunities for growth through drilling, supplemented by
    occasional strategic acquisitions. Over the last two decades, we
    have assembled a large acreage position and



production base outside the United States that provide
    additional geologic and geographic opportunities, diversifying
    risk, and provide exposure to larger reserve targets, which fuel
    production and reserve growth. We now have exploration and
    production operations in six countries, spanning five
    continents: the Gulf Coast and Central regions in the United
    States (U.S.), Canada, Egypt, the North Sea, Australia and
    Argentina. We also have exploration interests in Chile located
    adjacent to our Argentine operations on the Chilean side of the
    island of Tierra del Fuego.

Each of our producing regions has achieved an economy of scale
    that leads to cost effective production and sustainable,
    lower-risk, repeatable drilling opportunities. The net cash
    provided by operating activities (cash flow) generated by our
    current production base and our 33 million gross acres
    across the globe provide the ability to pursue new exploration
    targets while developing our previous exploration discoveries.
    Those developments will fund the next round of exploration
    activities and development programs.

We manage our investments giving consideration to geography,
    reserve life and hydrocarbon mix.

•

No single region contributed more than 27 percent of our
    equivalent production or reserves in 2009.

•

The mixture of reserve life (estimated reserves divided by
    annual production) in our regions, which translates into balance
    in the timing of returns on our investments, ranges from as
    short as six years to as long as 21 years.

•

Our balanced product mix provides a measure of protection
    against price deterioration in a given product while retaining
    upside potential through a significant increase in either
    commodity price. In 2009 crude oil and liquids provided
    50 percent of our production and 72 percent of our
    revenue. At year-end, our estimated proved reserves were
    45 percent crude oil and liquids and 55 percent
    natural gas.

Financial
    Flexibility and a Strong Balance Sheet

Apache’s financial flexibility is the result of years of
    hard work and discipline. This flexibility permits us to pursue
    higher-risk, higher-reward exploration targets, to develop
    large-scale facilities required to produce previous exploration
    discoveries and, when appropriate, to supplement our drilling
    and exploration programs with value-creating acquisitions.

Given the turmoil in the commodity markets and nearly
    unprecedented global financial crisis at the outset of the year,
    Apache’s primary objective for 2009 was to live within our
    cash flow and preserve our financial flexibility. To ensure we
    lived within cash flow, we reduced our 2009 activity and
    invested $4.1 billion, 39 percent below 2008 levels.

Apache grew production nine percent and generated
    $4.2 billion in cash flow in 2009 in spite of curtailed
    capital spending. We exited 2009 with a

debt-to-capitalization

ratio of 24 percent, just over $2 billion of cash and
    $2.3 billion in available committed borrowing capacity. We
    also believe our single-A debt ratings provide a competitive
    advantage in accessing capital markets.

Optimize
    Returns on Invested Capital

We focus on optimizing returns on invested capital through
    strict cost control and the creative application of technology.

Our management systems provide a uniform process of measuring
    success across Apache. Our management systems incentivize high
    rate-of-return activities but allow for appropriate risk-taking
    to drive future growth. Results of operations and rates of
    return on invested capital are measured monthly, reviewed with
    management quarterly and utilized to determine annual
    performance awards. We monitor capital allocations, at least
    quarterly, through a disciplined and focused process that
    includes analyzing current economic conditions, expected rates
    of return on proposed development and exploration drilling
    targets, opportunities for tactical acquisitions or,
    occasionally, new core areas that could enhance our portfolio.

We also use technology to optimize our rates of return by
    reducing risk, decreasing drilling time and costs, and
    maximizing recoveries from reservoirs. Additionally, Apache
    scientists and engineers have been granted numerous



patents for a range of inventions, from systems used for
    interpreting seismic data or processing well logs to
    improvements in drilling and completion techniques.

One such example is a manifold invented for development of our
    Horn River Shale gas play in northeast British Columbia, where
    Apache is employing pad-drilling technology. Apache engineers
    developed and applied for a patent for a manifold that will
    connect all 16 horizontal wells on a single pad, driving down
    costs by reducing non-productive time on our

24-hour-a-day

hydraulic fracturing operations. This technology will increase
    Apache’s rate of return on potentially thousands of future
    wells across our leasehold.

At our Forties field, Apache is using techniques that bring
    together many sources of data to give an accurate view of the
    current state of the field and identify likely places to find
    unswept oil deposits. Four-dimensional modeling, which uses
    reservoir-engineering data and a series of three-dimensional
    seismic surveys, is utilized by Apache to create a time-lapse
    picture that shows where oil remains after 35 years of
    production. The latest model of the reservoir highlighted the
    potential for stranded oil accumulations in close proximity to
    the Charlie platform and helped Apache’s technical teams
    identify the Charlie 6-3 target drilled in 2009. The well came
    on production at 10,500 b/d — the field’s highest
    initial production rate from a new well since 1994.

For a more in-depth discussion of our 2009 results and the
    Company’s capital resources and liquidity, please see
    Part II, Item 7 — Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations.

Geographic
    Area Overviews

We currently have exploration and production interests in six
    countries, divided into seven operating regions: the United
    States (Gulf Coast and Central regions), Canada, Egypt,
    Australia, offshore the United Kingdom in the North Sea and
    Argentina. We also have exploration interests on the Chilean
    side of the island of Tierra del Fuego, which we acquired in the
    second quarter of 2008.

The following table sets out a brief comparative summary of
    certain key 2009 data for each of our operating areas.

North
    America

Apache’s North American asset base comprises the
    U.S. Central region, U.S. Gulf Coast region and our
    Canada region. Oil and liquids production, mainly from the
    U.S. Permian Basin and the Gulf of Mexico, made up



nearly 40 percent of North America’s
    2009 barrel-equivalent production and 46 percent of
    North America’s year-end estimated proved reserves. Our
    North American production is also balanced between the shorter
    reserve life but higher rates of return in the Gulf of Mexico
    and longer reserve life for Apache’s onshore assets in
    Canada and the Permian and Anadarko Basins of the United States.

As result of past growth and future opportunities available in
    the Central region, we have created a new regional unit
    beginning in 2010. Our Permian region will be based in Midland,
    Texas and will be responsible for our Permian Basin business.
    The Central region will focus on our extensive holdings in
    Oklahoma, East Texas and the Texas Panhandle, especially the
    Granite Wash play.

The identification and commercialization of significant
    resources in shale formations and other unconventional gas plays
    has changed the natural gas markets for the foreseeable future,
    with current estimates that North America has a

100-year

resource of natural gas. Although Apache’s current
    production in North America is primarily conventional, near-term
    growth will likely be driven by activity in two large growth
    plays: shale gas in British Columbia’s Horn River Basin and
    the Granite Wash tight sands in the Anadarko Basin of Oklahoma
    and the Texas Panhandle. Apache has identified many years of
    drilling activity in both plays.

We anticipate that the increased supply of natural gas will
    ultimately encourage producers to seek new and unconventional
    markets for their supply. Apache is one of the first independent
    producers to seek global markets for its North American natural
    gas production through our acquisition of a 51-percent ownership
    and throughput capacity interest in the proposed Kitimat LNG
    Terminal in British Columbia.

In order to live within expected cash flow, Apache curtailed
    exploration and development capital at the outset of 2009. In
    North America we drilled 362 gross wells, down from
    1,015 wells in 2008. Exploration, drilling, and acquisition
    spending totaled $1.6 billion in 2009, 49 percent
    lower than in 2008. Despite lower activity and spending, we
    added 122.3 MMboe of estimated proved reserves through
    drilling and acquisitions in North America, 18.8 MMboe more
    than the 103.5 MMboe produced. Equivalent production from
    our North American regions declined one percent

year-over-year.

We are ramping up activity in early 2010 as we move into
    development mode at Horn River, increase drilling in the Granite
    Wash formation and double our oil drilling activity in the
    Permian Basin. In 2010, we currently plan to drill or
    participate in 561 gross wells in North America.

United
    States

Overview

In the U.S., the Gulf Coast
    region’s assets, balanced between oil and natural gas,
    historically generate high rates of return on invested capital.
    Occasional acquisitions have played an important role, as steep
    decline rates mean offshore reserves are generally shorter-lived
    and difficult to replace on a cost-effective basis through
    drilling alone. The Central region brings the balance of
    long-lived reserves and consistent drilling results to the
    portfolio.

Gulf Coast Region

This region comprises our
    interests in and along the Gulf of Mexico, in the areas on and
    offshore Louisiana and Texas. Apache has been the largest

held-by-production

acreage owner since 2004, and the second largest producer on the
    Outer Continental Shelf of the Gulf of Mexico (waters less than
    1,200 feet deep). The region also holds 1.2 million
    gross acres along the Gulf Coast of Louisiana and Texas. In 2009
    the region contributed approximately 20 percent of our
    worldwide production, about 21 percent of our revenues and,
    at year-end, held nearly 13 percent of our estimated proved
    reserves.

The region had a productive year despite the capital curtailment
    stemming from lower commodity prices at the end of 2008. The
    region drilled or participated in 26 wells, down from
    116 wells in 2008, and performed 217 workovers and
    recompletions.

In May 2009 production commenced from two deepwater wells in the
    Geauxpher field, located on Garden Banks Block 462. During
    the second half of 2009, the field produced an average of

91 MMcf/d

gross. Apache generated the prospect and has a 40-percent
    working interest. We also announced another key deepwater
    discovery



in April 2009 at Ewing Banks 998 that test-flowed 4,254 b/d and

5.4 MMcf/d.

The well will be connected to existing facilities, with first
    production projected for mid-year 2010. Apache owns a 50-percent
    interest in the property.

The risk of hurricanes in the Gulf Coast region has been an
    ongoing issue. Frequency, intensity and location of major
    hurricanes is impossible to predict. The majority of our Gulf of
    Mexico assets have enjoyed full-life cycles without suffering
    significant storm-related damage. While facilities are designed
    to withstand severe weather, they may incur significant damage
    when confronted by the most extreme hurricane conditions. Also,
    with mature facilities, proactive management includes aggressive
    well and equipment abandonment that should minimize the
    environmental impact and reduce the eventual cost of remediation.

This damage may result in expenses for repairs to restore
    production as well as expenses to remove and abandon wreckage.
    During 2009, approximately $64 million in excess of
    insurance proceeds was spent to repair damage stemming from 2008
    hurricanes. An additional $260 million in excess of
    insurance proceeds was expended for the continued abandonment
    and removal of wreckage from platforms toppled in hurricanes.
    Cash expended for abandonment activities reduces our asset
    retirement obligation. The majority of the hurricane abandonment
    work is now complete.

During 2010 the region plans to invest approximately
    $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion for drilling,
    recompletion projects, development projects, equipment upgrades,
    production enhancement projects, seismic acquisition and
    abandonment activities.

Central Region

The Central region includes
    assets in the Anadarko Basin, the East Texas Basin and the
    Permian Basin. Over the past decade, the region has grown from
    approximately 3,000 wells to over 10,000 and now represents
    27 percent of Apache’s proved reserves, the largest
    concentration in the Company. The region provides steady,
    predictable results, enhanced by assets across a large acreage
    base. During 2009 Apache operated or participated in drilling
    135 wells; 99 percent were completed as producers. The
    region also performed 810 workovers and recompletions.

In 2009 we drilled our first operated horizontal well in the
    Granite Wash play in Washita County, Oklahoma. The
    Hostetter #1-23H commenced production in September 2009 at

17 MMcf/d

and 800 b/d and is currently producing

9.5 MMcf/d

and 600 b/d. Apache owns a 72-percent working interest in the
    well. The Granite Wash has long been a core-stacked pay target
    for the Central Region, where we have drilled many vertical
    wells over the past decade. As a result, we control
    approximately 200,000 gross acres in the play, mostly

held-by-production.

Despite the numerous vertical wells drilled, the Granite Wash is
    re-emerging as a horizontal play that is capitalizing on high
    oil prices given the rich liquids yield of the wells. Hundreds
    of additional horizontal well locations have been identified
    across our acreage, extending opportunities for many years. In
    early 2010 we had three rigs in operation with plans to increase
    to at least five as we target drilling a minimum of 29
    horizontal wells in the play during the year.

During 2010 the Central region plans to invest approximately
    $325 million to $375 million for drilling,
    recompletion projects, development projects, equipment upgrades,
    production enhancement projects and seismic acquisition in the
    Anadarko Basin and East Texas. Our newly formed Permian Region
    plans to invest approximately $375 million to
    $400 million for similar activities, primarily directed at
    oil targets.

Marketing

In general, most of our
    U.S. gas is sold at either monthly or daily market prices.
    Our natural gas is sold primarily to Local Distribution
    Companies (LDCs), utilities, end-users, and integrated major oil
    companies.

Apache primarily markets its U.S. crude oil to integrated
    major oil companies, marketing and transportation companies and
    refiners. The objective is to maximize the value of crude oil
    sold by identifying the best markets and most economical
    transportation routes available to move the product. Sales
    contracts are generally

30-day

evergreen contracts that renew automatically until canceled by
    either party. These contracts provide for sales that are priced
    daily at prevailing market prices.

Canada

Overview

At year-end 2009 our Canadian region
    held approximately 22 percent of our estimated proved
    reserves, the second largest concentration in the Company. In
    our Canadian region, we have 4.4 million net acres



across the provinces of British Columbia, Alberta and
    Saskatchewan. Our acreage base provides a significant inventory
    of both low-risk development drilling opportunities in and
    around a number of Apache fields and higher-risk, higher-reward
    exploration opportunities. In 2009 we drilled or participated in
    201 wells in Canada, 41 of which were in the Horn River
    Basin. Three of the region’s wells drilled during the year
    were exploration wells, all of which were productive.

Apache and EnCana Corporation (EnCana), 50-percent partners,
    control more than 400,000 acres in the Horn River Basin
    shale-gas play in northeast British Columbia. We estimate that
    we could ultimately drill thousands of wells. In 2009
    Apache and EnCana drilled 41 wells in the Basin: 23 by
    Apache and 18 by EnCana. To minimize the environmental footprint
    and costs, the wells are drilled in batches from multi-well
    pads. Completion activity commences once drilling operations
    from a single pad have been completed, allowing room for the
    equipment needed for fracturing operations to service the entire
    pad. Four of the EnCana-operated wells were placed on production
    in 2009 and at year-end were producing at a combined gross rate
    in excess of

19 MMcf/d.

Apache commenced stimulating the 16 wells on its first
    operated development pad in the fourth quarter of 2009, with
    production scheduled for mid-2010.

The magnitude of the Horn River resource, its remote location,
    and the desire to maximize returns prompted Apache to seek
    alternative markets for its natural gas. On January 13,
    2010, we announced that our Apache Canada Ltd. subsidiary agreed
    to acquire 51-percent ownership and throughput capacity interest
    in Kitimat LNG Inc.’s proposed LNG export terminal in
    northern British Columbia. We expect to begin front-end
    engineering and design (FEED) of the project in early 2010. If
    we proceed with development, Apache’s net capacity in the
    facility will provide an outlet for

350 MMcf/d

from Horn River and other areas in Canada, providing access to
    markets with worldwide LNG prices. Preliminary gross
    construction cost estimates, which will be refined upon
    completion of the FEED study, total C$3 billion. A final
    investment decision (FID) is expected in 2011. If we proceed,
    initial gas exports are forecast for as early as 2014. Kitimat
    is designed to be linked to the pipeline system servicing
    Western Canada’s natural gas producing regions via the
    proposed Pacific Trail Pipelines, a C$1.1 billion project.
    In association with our acquisition of interest in the Kitimat
    project, we also acquired a 25.5-percent interest in the
    proposed pipeline and 350 MMcf/d of capacity rights.

In December 2009, we entered into a farm-in agreement with
    Corridor Resources Inc. (Corridor) to appraise and potentially
    develop oil and natural gas resources in the province of New
    Brunswick. The initial

18-month

program is intended to evaluate the commercial potential of
    natural gas development in the Frederick Brook formation and
    light oil development at a recent Caledonia oil discovery at a
    cost to Apache of not less than $25 million. Upon
    completion of this appraisal program, Apache will have earned a
    50-percent working interest in the spacing units drilled. Apache
    will then have the option to participate in phase two of the
    program at a cost of not less than $100 million. Upon
    completion of this phase by March 31, 2013, Apache would
    earn a 50-percent interest in approximately 116,000 acres.

Our plans for 2010 are to drill or participate in a total of
    172 wells in Canada, including 156 development wells
    and 16 exploratory wells. The planned development wells include
    34 new wells in the Horn River Basin, with Apache drilling 18
    and EnCana drilling 16. We believe our production will continue
    to

ramp-up

in this area throughout 2010 with completion of 55 wells
    from Apache and its Horn River partner’s drilling programs.
    During 2010 the region plans to invest approximately
    $1.0 billion to $1.1 billion for drilling,
    recompletion projects, development projects, equipment upgrades,
    production enhancement projects and seismic acquisition.
    Approximately $100 million of the total is for gathering,
    transportation and processing (GTP) assets.

On our other core properties, we will focus on oil projects
    located primarily in Alberta and Saskatchewan to take advantage
    of the current vast discrepancies between oil and gas prices. We
    will utilize our drilling technology and reservoir modeling
    expertise to identify and exploit unswept oil in our waterflood
    projects in the House Mountain, Leduc, and Snipe Lake fields.
    Additional drilling for oil will continue on our enhanced oil
    recovery (EOR) projects in Midale, Zama and Provost with
    long-term plans to develop and expand
    CO


projects. We will continue intermediate-depth gas development
    drilling in Kaybob and West 5 areas and in Nevis for shallow
    coal bed methane (CBM) gas. In addition, pursuant to our
    December 2009 farm-in agreement with Corridor, Apache will
    commence an appraisal program in New Brunswick in 2010.



Marketing

Our Canadian natural gas marketing
    activities focus on sales to LDCs, utilities, end-users,
    integrated major oil companies, supply aggregators and
    marketers. We maintain a diverse client portfolio, which is
    intended to reduce the concentration of credit risk in our
    portfolio. Improved North American natural gas pipeline
    connectivity led to a closer correlation between Canadian and
    U.S. natural gas prices. To diversify our market exposure,
    we transport natural gas via our firm transportation contracts
    to California, the Chicago area and eastern Canada. We sell the
    majority of our Canadian gas on a monthly basis at either

first-of-the-month

or daily prices. In 2009 approximately two percent of our gas
    sales were subject to long-term fixed-price contracts, with the
    latest expiration in 2011.

Our Canadian crude is sold primarily to integrated major oil
    companies and marketers. We sell our oil based on West Texas
    Intermediate and our NGLs based on postings, both of which are
    market-reflective prices, adjusted for quality, transportation
    and a negotiated differential. We maximize the value of our
    condensate and heavier crudes by determining whether to blend
    the condensate into our own crude production or sell it in the
    market as a segregated product. We transport crude oil on 12
    pipelines to the major trading hubs within Alberta and
    Saskatchewan, which enables us to achieve a higher netback for
    the production and to diversify our purchasers.

Egypt

Overview

Egypt holds our largest acreage
    position, with more than 11 million gross acres in 21
    separate concessions (18 producing) that provide us considerable
    exploration and development opportunities. In addition to being
    the largest acreage holder in Egypt’s Western Desert, we
    believe that Apache is also the largest producer of liquid
    hydrocarbons and natural gas in the Western Desert and the third
    largest in all of Egypt. In 2009 our Egypt region contributed
    30 percent of Apache’s production revenue,
    26 percent of total production and 13 percent of total
    estimated proved reserves. The Company reports all estimated
    proved reserves held under production sharing agreements
    utilizing the economic interest method, which excludes the host
    country’s share of reserves. In 2009 Apache had an active
    drilling program in Egypt, drilling 164 wells, including
    nine new field discoveries, and conducted 792 workovers and
    recompletions. Historically, our growth in Egypt has been driven
    primarily by exploration and development of internally-generated
    prospects; in 2009 we were the most active driller in Egypt.

In the Khalda concession in 2009, we continued to monetize our
    Qasr gas discovery through completion of two additional Salam
    gas processing facilities, trains three and four, and an
    associated pipeline compression project on the Western Desert
    Northern Gas Pipeline. These facility expansions increased flow
    rates from our Qasr field discovery to

600 MMcf/d

and increased total net production in Egypt by

100 MMcf/d

and 5,000 b/d.

In Egypt, our operations are conducted pursuant to
    production-sharing contracts under which the contractor partner
    pays all operating and capital expenditure costs for exploration
    and development. A percentage of the production, usually up to
    40 percent, is available to the contractor partners to
    recover operating and capital expenditure costs. In general, the
    balance of the production is allocated between the contractor
    partners and Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation (EGPC) on a
    contractually defined basis. Development leases within
    concessions generally have a

25-year

life, with extensions possible for additional commercial
    discoveries or on a negotiated basis.

During 2010 the region plans to invest approximately
    $1.0 billion to $1.1 billion for drilling,
    recompletion projects, development projects, equipment upgrades,
    production enhancement projects and seismic acquisition.
    Approximately $150 million of the total is for GTP assets.

Marketing

Our gas production is sold to EGPC
    primarily under an industry-pricing formula, a sliding scale
    based on Dated Brent crude oil with a minimum of $1.50 per MMbtu
    and a maximum of $2.65 per MMbtu, which corresponds to a Dated
    Brent price of $21.00 per barrel. Generally, this
    industry-pricing formula applies to all new gas discovered and
    produced. In exchange for extension of the Khalda Concession
    lease in July 2004, Apache agreed to accept the industry-pricing
    formula on a majority of gas sold but retained the previous
    gas-price formula (without a price cap) until 2013 for up to

100 MMcf/d

gross. This region averaged $3.70 per Mcf in 2009.

Oil from the Khalda Concession, the Qarun Concession and other
    nearby Western Desert blocks is sold to EGPC when called upon to
    supply domestic demand

and/or

to
    third parties primarily in the Mediterranean market. Oil sales
    are made either directly into the Egyptian oil pipeline grid,
    sold to non-governmental third parties



including the Middle East Oil Refinery located in northern
    Egypt, or exported from or sold at one of two terminals on the
    northern coast of Egypt. Oil production that is presently sold
    to EGPC is sold on a spot basis priced at Brent with a monthly
    EGPC official differential applied. In 2009 we sold 47 cargoes
    (approximately 14.7 million barrels) of Western Desert
    crude oil into the export market from the El Hamra terminal
    located on the northern coast of Egypt. These export cargoes
    were sold to third parties at market prices above our domestic
    prices received from EGPC. Additionally, Apache sold Qarun
    quality oil (approximately 8.5 MMbbls) at the Sidi Kerir
    terminal, also located on the northern coast of Egypt. This
    Qarun oil was sold at prevailing market prices into the domestic
    market to non-governmental purchasers (1.7 MMbbls) or
    exported primarily to refiners in the Mediterranean region (14
    cargoes for approximately 6.8 MMbbls). While we anticipate
    that an increasing amount of our oil will be sold to meet
    domestic demand during 2010, we still expect some level of sales
    to the export market.

Australia

Overview

In Australia our exploration activity
    is focused in the offshore Carnarvon, Gippsland and Browse
    Basins, where Apache holds 4.3 million net acres in 31
    exploration permits, 14 production licenses and three retention
    leases. We also have one production license and two retention
    leases pending confirmation. Production operations are
    concentrated in the Carnarvon and Exmouth Basins. In 2009 the
    region increased equivalent production 40 percent and
    accounted for approximately seven percent of our total
    production. Australia held 13 percent of our year-end
    estimated proved reserves. During the year the region
    participated in drilling 33 wells, which generated 28
    productive wells.

During 2009 the Australia region restored operations and
    increased capacity at our Varanus Island gas processing
    facility, and continued to lay the foundation for future growth
    by developing previously discovered fields that will come online
    over the short, intermediate and long terms.

Our growth strategy includes short-term, medium-term and
    long-term projects from the Carnarvon Basin off the North West
    shelf of Australia. Both Van Gogh and Pyrenees (two large oil
    development projects in the Exmouth

sub-basin)

commenced production in the first quarter of 2010. In the
    intermediate-term, growth in Australia will result from the
    development of both Apache’s 2008 Halyard discovery and our
    Reindeer discovery. Both Halyard and Reindeer are
    gas-development projects that are scheduled to initiate
    production in 2011. Long-term growth will come from the
    Company’s Julimar, Macedon and Coniston discoveries.

Growth Drivers 2010

Van Gogh is
    Apache-operated, while Pyrenees is operated by BHP Billiton. Van
    Gogh development drilling and installation of sub sea production
    equipment was completed in mid-2009, and limited production
    commenced in mid-February 2010. Van Gogh oil is produced and
    stored in the Ningaloo Vision floating, production, storage and
    offloading (FPSO) vessel, which is still performing normal
    commissioning activities.

Pyrenees development continued with the drilling and completion
    of initial wells and installation of subsea facilities in 2009.
    First oil production commenced ahead of schedule, on
    February 24, 2010. As planned, the wells will be drilled
    and brought on in phases, with half of the expected production
    volume ramping up over the next six months.

Peak production from the Van Gogh and Pyrenees discoveries is
    projected to reach a combined 40,000 b/d net to Apache.

During 2010 the region plans to invest approximately
    $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion for drilling,
    recompletion projects, development projects, equipment upgrades,
    production enhancement projects and seismic acquisition.
    Approximately $350 million of the total is for development
    and processing facilities.

Growth Drivers 2011

In April 2008 we drilled
    the Halyard-1 discovery well, which tested

68 MMcf/d.

Current plans call for the field to be tied into the nearby East
    Spar gas facilities, with first production anticipated in 2011.

Construction and fabrication work has resumed and official
    groundbreaking at the Devil Creek site of the onshore gas plant
    was on September 15, 2009, following completion of a gas
    sales contract with CITIC Pacific’s Sino Iron project in
    Western Australia. This plant and gas sales contract will enable
    us to monetize a portion of our



Reindeer gas discovery. Under terms of the agreement, Apache and
    its joint venture partner have agreed to supply 154 Bcf of
    gas over seven years (approximately

60 MMcf/d)

beginning in the second half of 2011 at prices substantially
    above Apache’s current average realizations. Apache owns a
    55-percent interest in the field. The Company is continuing to
    market its remaining net share in the Reindeer field.

Growth Drivers — Long-Term

Apache
    has agreed to participate in an LNG development project
    (discussed below) that will enable Apache to develop and
    monetize its share of the Julimar and Brunello natural gas
    discoveries, opening up new markets for these reserves.
    Apache’s projected net sales are

190 MMcf/d

and 5,100 b/d with a projected

15-year

production plateau when the multi-year project is fully
    operational. The project, which is currently in FEED, will
    convert the gas into LNG for sale on the world market. World LNG
    prices are typically tied to oil prices and are currently higher
    than the historical gas prices in Western Australia.

In October 2009 we announced Apache’s 16.25 percent
    participation with Chevron in the Wheatstone LNG project. The
    Wheatstone project is targeting a FID in 2011, with first LNG
    projected in 2015. Apache operates the Julimar and Brunello
    fields, while Chevron will operate both the Wheatstone field and
    the LNG facilities. Our net capital investment in the project is
    currently estimated to be $1.2 billion for upstream
    development of the Julimar and Brunello fields and
    $3.0 billion in the Wheatstone facilities.

We have two contingent development opportunities tied to our
    recent Pyrenees and Van Gogh projects that will be evaluated
    during 2010. Macedon field is a gas discovery near the Pyrenees
    field that is currently under review by the operator, BHP
    Billiton, for commercial development. Gas produced from Pyrenees
    will be reinjected into Macedon field to reduce flaring and to
    conserve those volumes for future sale. Coniston field is an oil
    accumulation near our Van Gogh field. Apache has drilled 10
    appraisal wells during 2009 and is evaluating a development plan
    to tie back the field to the FPSO Ningaloo Vision currently
    serving the Van Gogh field.

Marketing

As of December 31, 2009, Apache
    had a total of 18 active gas contracts in Australia with
    expiration dates ranging from March 2010 to July 2030.
    Historically, natural gas sold in Western Australia was under
    long-term, fixed-price contracts, many of which contain price
    escalation clauses based on the Australian consumer price index.
    The contract in place for the Reindeer field contains prices
    substantially higher than we currently receive in Australia. The
    LNG from our Julimar discovery is anticipated to be sold at
    prices tied to oil and sold into international markets.

Apache continues to directly market all of its crude oil
    production into Australian domestic and international markets at
    prices generally indexed to Dated Brent or Tapis benchmarks,
    which typically track at or above NYMEX oil prices.

North
    Sea

Overview

Apache entered the North Sea in 2003
    upon acquiring an approximate 97-percent working interest in the
    Forties field (Forties). Production for 2009 increased two
    percent compared to 2008 as gains from our topsides renovation
    program and our drilling and workover programs more than offset
    downtime to replace an original vintage spool section at the end
    of the Bravo-Charlie infield pipeline, which lowered production
    for the year by 2,690 boe/d.

In addition to an active year of drilling, we completed and made
    significant progress on several important facility projects that
    will benefit Forties in the years ahead. The Delta-Charlie
    infield pipeline was replaced, bringing improved mechanical
    integrity. We installed and commissioned a new power turbine on
    Delta to support increasing field-water injection during 2010.
    On the Charlie platform, we purchased equipment, cleared access
    and began installing components late in 2009 for a new
    high-pressure gas lift system that will be operational in early
    2011. Work that began on the Echo platform several years ago to
    replace the antiquated and unreliable controls system with a
    modern version was fundamentally completed. The various facility
    upgrade and improvement projects completed in recent years
    resulted in a significant reduction in the number of occurrences
    of unplanned downtime. In 2009 we had fewer events causing
    unplanned downtime than we have experienced in any year since
    acquiring the Forties field; 64 percent less than our previous
    best year.



In 2009 the North Sea region produced 22.4 MMboe
    (99 percent oil), approximately 11 percent of our
    total worldwide production, generating almost $1.4 billion
    of revenue and held approximately seven percent of our year-end
    estimated proved reserves. Our capital investments in the North
    Sea region during 2009 totaled $354 million.

During 2010 the region plans to invest approximately
    $625 million to $675 million with significant capital
    devoted to drilling and improving facilities within Forties. We
    will also shoot a

3-D

seismic
    survey over Forties to refresh our four-dimensional imaging of
    bypassed oil accumulations. In 2010 we expect to drill at least
    one exploration well and one appraisal well in waters outside
    Forties.

Marketing

In 2009 we sold our Forties crude
    under both term contracts and spot cargoes. The term sales are
    composed of base-market indices, adjusted for the quality
    difference between the Forties crude and Brent, with a premium
    to reflect the higher market value for term arrangements. The
    value received for spot cargoes, generally about
    600,000 barrels each, were at or above prevailing market
    prices. Apache sold 12 spot cargoes in 2009.

Argentina

Overview

We have had a continuous presence in
    Argentina since 2001, which was expanded substantially by two
    acquisitions in 2006. We currently have operations in the
    Provinces of Neuquén, Rio Negro and Tierra del Fuego. We
    have interests in 24 concessions covering over 3.1 million
    gross acres (2.8 million net), with varying expiration
    dates, but generally greater than 10 years remaining subject to
    additional extensions.

Natural gas price realizations in Argentina continued their
    upward trend in 2009. Our 2009 realized prices were $1.96 per
    Mcf, a 22 percent increase over our 2008 averaged realized
    price of $1.61 per Mcf and a 68 percent increase over the
    $1.17 per Mcf realized in 2007.

During 2009 Apache received technical and commercial approval
    from the government of Argentina for four Gas Plus projects and
    technical approval for two more Gas Plus projects designed to
    encourage new supplies through development of tight sands and
    unconventional gas reserves. Under the Gas Plus program, Apache
    has the opportunity to supply

10 MMcf/d

from fields in the Neuquén Province at a price of $4.10 per
    MMBtu beginning January 2010 for an initial one-year term. The
    Company also has signed a letter of intent for a contract to
    supply up to

50 MMcf/d

from fields in the Neuquén and Rio Negro Provinces for
    $5.00 per MMBtu beginning January 2011. The gas supplying the
    Gas Plus program contracts is required to come from wells
    drilled in the projects’ approved fields and formations. We
    believe this type of program, coupled with changing market
    conditions, points to improving price realizations going forward.

In December 2008 the Mendoza Province granted Apache an
    exploration permit for CCyB Block 17B in the Cuyo Basin,
    which increased our Argentine acreage by 34 percent. Apache
    is currently awaiting Mendoza Province’s approval for the
    extension of CCyB Block 17A, which is anticipated in the
    first half of 2010. Together the two Mendoza Province blocks
    comprise about 1.2 million acres. Approximately
    505 square kilometers of

3-D

seismic
    is scheduled to be acquired in 2010 using new cable-less
    technology, the first time this technology has been used in
    Argentina. A drilling campaign in the Cuyo Basin is also
    scheduled to commence in mid-2010. With the addition of the
    Mendoza acreage, Apache will hold oil and gas assets in three of
    the main Argentine hydrocarbon basins: Neuquén, Austral and
    Cuyo.

In March 2009 the Province of Neuquén and Apache reached
    agreement to extend eight federal oil and gas concessions for 10
    additional years. The concessions, which were scheduled to
    expire between 2015 and 2017, encompass approximately
    590,000 net acres, including exploratory areas totaling
    514,000 net acres. Neuquén operations generate about
    half of Apache’s total output in Argentina.

Activity during 2009 on our Tierra del Fuego assets included
    nine discoveries, several facility projects and a fracture
    stimulation campaign involving 10 wells. Future investment
    by Apache in the Tierra del Fuego Province will be significantly
    influenced by the probability of obtaining the Province’s
    agreement to an extension of the present concession deadlines,
    which are scheduled to expire in 2016 and 2017.

In 2009 our Argentina region produced 16.6 MMboe, drilled
    29.6 net wells (32 gross) and performed 57 additional
    capital projects. These programs added an estimated
    14.4 MMboe in reserves and bring our reserves in Argentina
    to an estimated 119.0 MMboe at December 31, 2009, or
    five percent of our estimated worldwide total.



During 2010 the region plans to invest approximately
    $250 million for drilling, recompletion projects,
    development projects, equipment upgrades, production enhancement
    projects and seismic acquisition.

Marketing

We receive government-regulated
    pricing on a substantial portion of our production. The volumes
    we are required to sell at regulated prices are set by the
    government and vary with seasonal factors and industry category.
    During 2009 we realized an average price of $1.07 per Mcf on
    government-regulated sales. The majority of the remaining
    volumes were sold at market-driven prices, which averaged $2.65
    per Mcf in 2009. Our overall average realized price for 2009 was
    $1.96 per Mcf, 22 percent higher than 2008 average realized
    prices ($1.61 per Mcf) and 68 percent higher than 2007
    average realized prices ($1.17 per Mcf).

Taxes on exported oil effectively limit the prices buyers are
    willing to pay for domestic sales. Domestic oil prices are
    currently based on $42 per barrel, plus quality adjustments and
    local premiums, and producers realize a gradual increase or
    decrease as market prices deviate from the base price. In Tierra
    del Fuego, similar pricing formulas exist, however, Apache
    retains the value-added tax collected from buyers, effectively
    increasing realized prices by 21 percent. As a result, 2009
    oil prices realized from our Neuquén Basin production
    averaged $44.09 per barrel, compared to $54.43 per barrel from
    our Tierra del Fuego oil production.

Apache realized an additional $6 million of oil revenues in
    2009 from benefits generated by the government’s Oil Plus
    Program. This program rewarded participants that increased oil
    production and reserves during 2008 and 2009. A further
    $2 million of benefit was realized in January 2010.

Chile

In November 2007 Apache was awarded exploration rights on two
    blocks comprising approximately one million net acres on the
    Chilean side of Tierra del Fuego. This acreage is adjacent to
    our 552,000 net acres on the Argentine side of the island
    of Tierra del Fuego and represents a natural extension of our
    expanding exploration and production operations. The Lenga and
    Rusfin Blocks were ratified by the Chilean government on
    July 24, 2008. In January 2009 a

3-D

seismic
    survey totaling 1,000 square kilometers was completed, and
    in November 2009 the first of a three-well exploration program
    commenced drilling. Two of the wells reached total depth by
    year-end 2009, with drilling completed on the third well in
    early 2010. Currently a completion rig is conducting testing and
    completion efforts on the three wells. During 2010 we plan to
    invest approximately $25 million to $35 million for
    drilling and seismic acquisition.

Major
    Customers

In 2009 purchases by Shell accounted for 18 percent of the
    Company’s worldwide oil and gas production revenues.

Subsequent
    Events

Kitimat
    LNG Terminal

On January 13, 2010, Apache announced that its Apache
    Canada Ltd. subsidiary has agreed to acquire 51 percent of
    Kitimat LNG Inc.’s proposed LNG export terminal in British
    Columbia. Apache also reserved 51 percent of gas throughput
    capacity in the terminal.

The proposed Kitimat project, located at Bish Cove near the Port
    of Kitimat about 405 miles north of Vancouver, has planned
    capacity of about

700 MMcf/d,

or five million metric tons of LNG per year. Preliminary gross
    construction cost estimates of C$3 billion will be refined
    at the conclusion of FEED. The project is projected to employ an
    estimated 1,500 people during construction and 100 on a
    permanent basis.

Kitimat is designed to be linked to the pipeline system
    servicing Western Canada’s natural gas producing regions
    via the proposed Pacific Trail Pipelines, a C$1.1 billion
    project. In association with our acquisition of interest in the
    Kitimat project, we also acquired a 25.5-percent interest in the
    proposed pipeline and 350 MMcf/d of capacity rights.

    Performance Program

To provide long-term incentives for Apache employees to deliver
    competitive returns to our stockholders, in January 2010 the
    Company’s Board of Directors approved the 2010 Performance
    Program, pursuant to the 2007



Omnibus Equity Compensation Plan. Eligible employees received an
    initial conditional restricted stock unit award of
    541,440 units, with the ultimate number of restricted stock
    units to be awarded, if any, based upon measurement of total
    shareholder return of Apache common stock as compared to a
    designated peer group during a three-year performance period.
    Should any restricted stock units be awarded at the end of the
    three-year performance period, 50 percent of restricted
    stock units awarded will immediately vest, and an additional
    25 percent will vest on succeeding anniversaries of the end
    of the performance period. The Company’s Board of Directors
    also approved a one-time restricted stock unit award of
    502,470 shares to eligible Apache employees, with one-third
    of the units granted immediately vesting and an additional
    one-third vesting on each of the first and second anniversaries
    of the grant date.

Drilling
    Statistics

Worldwide in 2009 we participated in drilling 610 gross
    wells, with 558 (91 percent) completed as producers. We
    also performed nearly 2,100 workovers and recompletions during
    the year. Historically, our drilling activities in the
    U.S. have generally concentrated on exploitation and
    extension of existing, producing fields rather than exploration.
    As a general matter, our operations outside of the
    U.S. focus on a mix of exploration and exploitation wells.
    In addition to our completed wells, at year-end several wells
    had not yet reached completion: 12 in the U.S. (8.1 net); 5
    in Canada (3.6 net); 14 in Egypt (13.0 net); 9 in Australia (3.1
    net); 2 in the North Sea (1.9 net); and 2 in Argentina (2 net).

    928,515 net acres scheduled to expire by December 31,
    2010, 2011 and 2012, respectively, if production is not
    established or we take no other action to extend the terms. We
    plan to continue the terms of many of these licenses and
    concession areas through operational or administrative actions
    and do not expect a significant portion of our net acreage
    position to expire before such actions occur.

As of December 31, 2009, 78 percent of U.S. net
    undeveloped acreage and 44 percent of Canadian undeveloped
    acreage was held by production.

Estimated
    Proved Reserves and Future Net Cash Flows

In January 2009 the SEC issued Release

No. 33-8995,

“Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting” (Release

33-8995),

amending oil and gas reporting requirements under

Rule 4-10

of

Regulation S-X

and Industry Guide 2 in

Regulation S-K

and bringing full-cost accounting rules into alignment with the
    revised disclosure requirements. The new rules include changes
    to the pricing used to estimate reserves, the option to disclose
    probable and possible reserves, revised definitions for proved
    reserves, additional disclosures with respect to undeveloped
    reserves, and other new or revised definitions and disclosures.
    In January 2010 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)
    issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU)

No. 2010-03

,

“Oil and Gas Reserve Estimation and Disclosures”
    (ASU

2010-03),

which amends Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 932,
    “Extractive Industries — Oil and Gas” to
    align the guidance with the changes made by the SEC. The Company
    adopted Release

33-8995

and
    the amendments to ASC Topic 932 resulting from ASU

2010-03

(collectively, the Modernization Rules) effective
    December 31, 2009.

Proved oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities of
    natural gas, crude oil, condensate and NGL’s that
    geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable
    certainty to be recoverable in future years from known
    reservoirs under existing conditions, operating conditions, and
    government regulations. The Company reports all estimated proved
    reserves held under production-sharing arrangements utilizing
    the “economic interest” method, which excludes the
    host country’s share of reserves. Reserve estimates are
    considered proved if they are economically producible and are
    supported by either actual production or conclusive formation
    tests. Estimated reserves that can be produced economically
    through application of improved recovery techniques are included
    in the “proved” classification when successful testing
    by a pilot project or the operation of an active, improved
    recovery program using reliable technology establishes the
    reasonable certainty for the engineering analysis on which the
    project or program is based. Economically producible means a
    resource which generates revenue that exceeds, or is reasonably
    expected to exceed, the costs of the operation. Reasonable
    certainty means a high degree of confidence that the quantities
    will be recovered. Reliable technology is a grouping of one or
    more technologies (including computational methods) that has
    been field-tested and has been demonstrated to provide
    reasonably certain results with consistency and repeatability in
    the formation being evaluated or in an analogous formation.
    Estimated proved developed oil and gas reserves can be expected
    to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment
    and operating methods.

Proved undeveloped (PUD) reserves include those reserves that
    are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled
    acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major
    expenditure is required for recompletion. Undeveloped reserves
    may be classified as proved reserves on undrilled acreage
    directly offsetting development areas that are reasonably
    certain of production when drilled, or where reliable technology
    provides reasonable certainty of economic producibility.
    Undrilled locations may be classified as having undeveloped
    reserves only if a development plan has been adopted indicating
    that they are scheduled to be drilled within five years, unless
    specific circumstances justify a longer time period.



The following table shows proved oil, NGL and gas reserves as of
    December 31, 2009, based on average commodity prices in
    effect on the first day of each month in 2009, held flat for the

As of December 31, 2009, Apache had total estimated proved
    reserves of 1,067 MMbbls of crude oil, condensate and NGLs
    and 7.8 Tcf of natural gas. Combined, these total estimated
    proved reserves are the energy equivalent of 2.4 billion
    barrels of oil or 14.2 Tcf of natural gas. As of
    December 31, 2009, the Company’s proved developed
    reserves totaled 1,636 MMboe, and estimated PUD reserves
    totaled 731 MMboe, or approximately 31 percent of
    worldwide total proved reserves. Apache has elected not to
    disclose probable or possible reserves in this filing.

The Company’s estimates of proved reserves, proved
    developed reserves and proved undeveloped reserves as of
    December 31, 2009, 2008, 2007 and 2006, changes in
    estimated proved reserves during the last three years, and
    estimates of future net cash flows from proved reserves are
    contained in Note 13 — Supplemental Oil and Gas
    Disclosures in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
    set forth in Part IV, Item 15 of this

Form 10-K.

Estimated future net cash flows as of December 31, 2009,
    were calculated using a discount rate of 10 percent per
    annum, end of period costs, and an unweighted arithmetic average
    of commodity prices in effect on the first day of each month in
    2009, held flat for the life of the production, except where
    prices are defined by contractual arrangements. Future net cash
    flows as of December 31, 2008, and 2007, were estimated
    using commodity prices in effect at the end of those years, in
    accordance with the SEC guidelines in effect prior to the
    issuance of the Modernization Rules.

Proved
    Undeveloped Reserves

The Company’s total estimated proved undeveloped reserves
    of 731 MMboe as of December 31, 2009, increased by
    54 MMboe over the 677 MMboe of PUD reserves estimated
    at the end of 2008. During the year, Apache converted
    39 MMboe of proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed
    reserves through development drilling activity. In North America
    we converted 22 MMboe with the remaining 17 MMboe in
    our international areas.

During the year a total of $760 million was spent on
    projects associated with reserves that were carried as PUD
    reserves at the end of 2008. Not all of those expenditures
    resulted in a conversion from proved undeveloped to proved
    developed reserves during the year. We spent $264 million
    on PUD reserve development activity in North America and
    $496 million in the international areas, including
    $230 million in Australia where the reserves for those
    projects will be converted to developed in future years.



Preparation
    of Oil and Gas Reserve Information

Apache emphasizes that its reported reserves are reasonably
    certain estimates which, by their very nature, are subject to
    revision. As additional geoscience, engineering and economic
    data are obtained, proved reserve estimates are much more likely
    to increase or remain constant than to decrease. These estimates
    are reviewed throughout the year and revised either upward or
    downward, as warranted.

Apache’s proved reserves are estimated at the property
    level and compiled for reporting purposes by a centralized group
    of experienced reservoir engineers that is independent of the
    operating groups. These engineers interact with engineering and
    geoscience personnel in each of Apache’s operating areas
    and with accounting and marketing employees to obtain the
    necessary data for projecting future production, costs, net
    revenues and ultimate recoverable reserves. All relevant data is
    compiled in a computer database application, to which only
    authorized personnel are given security access rights consistent
    with their assigned job function. Reserves are reviewed
    internally with senior management and presented to Apache’s
    Board of Directors in summary form on a quarterly basis.
    Annually, each property is reviewed in detail by our centralized
    and operating region engineers to ensure forecasts of operating
    expenses, netback prices, production trends and development
    timing are reasonable.

Apache’s Executive Vice President of Corporate Reservoir
    Engineering, W. Kregg Olson, is the person primarily responsible
    for overseeing the preparation of our internal reserve estimates
    and for coordinating any reserves audits conducted by a
    third-party engineering firm. Mr. Olson is a graduate of
    Texas A&M University with a Bachelor of Science degree in
    Petroleum Engineering. He has over 29 years of industry
    experience, with the last 25 years focused on reservoir
    engineering. He is a member of the Society of Petroleum
    Engineers and is a Registered Professional Engineer in the state
    of Oklahoma. Mr. Olson has held positions of increasing
    responsibility within Apache’s corporate reservoir
    engineering department since joining the company in 1992.

The estimate of reserves disclosed in this annual report on

Form 10-K

is prepared by the Company’s internal staff, and the
    Company is responsible for the adequacy and accuracy of those
    estimates. However, the Company engages Ryder Scott Company,
    L.P. Petroleum Consultants (Ryder Scott) to review our processes
    and the reasonableness of our estimates of proved hydrocarbon
    liquid and gas reserves. Apache selects the properties for
    review by Ryder Scott. These properties represented all material
    fields, and over 85 percent of international properties and
    new wells drilled during the year. During 2009, 2008, and 2007,
    Ryder Scott’s review covered 79, 82 and 77 percent of
    the Company’s worldwide estimated reserves value,
    respectively. We have filed Ryder Scott’s independent
    report as an exhibit to this

Form 10-K.

Ryder Scott opined that the overall proved reserves for the
    reviewed properties as estimated by the Company are, in the
    aggregate, reasonable, prepared in accordance with generally
    accepted petroleum engineering and evaluation principles and
    conform to the SEC’s definition of proved reserves as set
    forth in

Rule 210.4-10(a)

of

Regulation S-X.

Ryder Scott has informed the Company that the tests and
    procedures used during its reserves audit conform to the
    Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and
    Gas Reserves Information approved by the Society of Petroleum
    Engineers. Paragraph 2.2(f) of the Standards Pertaining to
    the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information
    defines a reserves audit as the process of reviewing certain of
    the pertinent facts interpreted and assumptions made that have
    resulted in an estimate of reserves prepared by others and the
    rendering of an opinion about (1) the appropriateness of
    the methodologies employed, (2) the adequacy and quality of
    the data relied upon, (3) the depth and thoroughness of the
    reserves estimation process, (4) the classification of
    reserves appropriate to the relevant definitions used, and
    (5) the reasonableness of the estimated reserve quantities.
    A reserve audit is not the same as a financial audit and is less
    rigorous in nature than an independent reserve report where the
    independent reserve engineer determines the reserves on his or
    her own.

Form 10-K.

Title to
    Interests

As is customary in our industry, a preliminary review of title
    records, which may include opinions or reports of appropriate
    professionals or counsel, is made at the time we acquire
    properties. We believe that our title to all of the various
    interests set forth above is satisfactory and consistent with
    the standards generally accepted in the oil and gas industry,
    subject only to immaterial exceptions that do not detract
    substantially from the value of the interests or materially
    interfere with their use in our operations. The interests owned
    by us may be subject to one or more royalty, overriding royalty,
    or other outstanding interests (including disputes related to
    such interests) customary in the industry. The interests may
    additionally be subject to obligations or duties under
    applicable laws, ordinances, rules, regulations, and orders of
    arbitral or governmental authorities. In addition, the interests
    may be subject to burdens such as production payments, net
    profits interests, liens incident to operating agreements and
    current taxes, development obligations under oil and gas leases,
    and other encumbrances, easements, and restrictions, none of
    which detract substantially from the value of the interests or
    materially interfere with their use in our operations.

ITEM 1A.

RISK
    FACTORS

Our business activities and the value of our securities are
    subject to significant hazards and risks, including those
    described below. If any of such events should occur, our
    business, financial condition, liquidity

and/or

results of operations could be materially harmed, and holders
    and purchasers of our securities could lose part or all of their
    investments. Additional risks relating to our securities may be
    included in the prospectuses for securities we issue in the
    future.

Future
    economic conditions in the U.S. and key international markets
    may materially adversely impact our operating
    results.

The U.S. and other world economies are slowly recovering
    from a recession that began in 2008 and extended into 2009.
    Growth has resumed but is modest. There are likely to be
    significant long-term effects resulting from the recession and
    credit market crisis, including a future global economic growth
    rate that is slower than we have experienced in recent years. In
    addition, more volatility may occur before a sustainable growth
    rate is achieved. Global economic growth drives demand for
    energy from all sources, including fossil fuels. A lower future
    economic growth rate could result in decreased demand growth for
    our crude oil and natural gas production as well as lower
    commodity prices, which would reduce our cash flows from
    operations and our profitability.

Crude
    oil and natural gas prices are volatile and a substantial
    reduction in these prices could adversely affect our results and
    the price of our common stock.

Our revenues, operating results and future rate of growth depend
    highly upon the prices we receive for our crude oil and natural
    gas production. Historically, the markets for crude oil and
    natural gas have been volatile and are likely to continue to be
    volatile in the future. For example, the NYMEX daily settlement
    price for the prompt month oil contract in 2009 ranged from a
    high of $81.37 per barrel to a low of $33.98 per barrel. The
    NYMEX daily settlement price for the prompt month natural gas
    contract in 2009 ranged from a high of $6.07 per MMBtu to a low
    of $2.51 per MMBtu. The market prices for crude oil and natural
    gas depend on factors beyond our control. These factors include
    demand for crude oil and natural gas, which fluctuates with
    changes in market and economic conditions, and other factors,
    including:

•

worldwide and domestic supplies of crude oil and natural gas;

•

actions taken by foreign oil and gas producing nations;



•

political conditions and events (including instability or armed
    conflict) in crude oil or natural gas producing regions;

•

the level of global crude oil and natural gas inventories;

•

the price and level of imported foreign crude oil and natural
    gas;

•

the price and availability of alternative fuels, including coal
    and biofuels;

•

the availability of pipeline capacity and infrastructure;

•

the availability of crude oil transportation and refining
    capacity;

•

weather conditions;

•

electricity generation;

•

domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes; and

•

the overall economic environment.

Significant declines in crude oil and natural gas prices for an
    extended period may have the following effects on our business:

•

limiting our financial condition, liquidity,

and/or

ability to fund planned capital expenditures and operations;

•

reducing the amount of crude oil and natural gas that we can
    produce economically;

•

causing us to delay or postpone some of our capital projects;

•

reducing our revenues, operating income and cash flows;

•

limiting our access to sources of capital, such as equity and
    long-term debt;

•

a reduction in the carrying value of our crude oil and natural
    gas properties; or

•

a reduction in the carrying value of goodwill.

We recorded asset impairment charges during 2009. If commodity
    prices decline during 2010, there could be additional
    impairments of our oil and gas assets or other investments or an
    impairment of goodwill.

Our
    ability to sell natural gas or oil and/or receive market prices
    for our natural gas or oil may be adversely affected by pipeline
    and gathering system capacity constraints and various
    transportation interruptions.

A portion of our natural gas and oil production in any region
    may be interrupted, or shut in, from time to time for numerous
    reasons, including as a result of weather conditions, accidents,
    loss of pipeline or gathering system access, field labor issues
    or strikes, or capital constraints that limit the ability of
    third parties to construct gathering systems, processing
    facilities or interstate pipelines to transport our production,
    or we might voluntarily curtail production in response to market
    conditions. If a substantial amount of our production is
    interrupted at the same time, it could temporarily adversely
    affect our cash flow.

Weather
    and climate may have a significant adverse impact on our
    revenues and productivity.

Demand for oil and natural gas are, to a significant degree,
    dependent on weather and climate, which impact the price we
    receive for the commodities we produce. In addition, our
    exploration and development activities and equipment can be
    adversely affected by severe weather, such as hurricanes in the
    Gulf of Mexico or cyclones offshore Australia, which may cause a
    loss of production from temporary cessation of activity or lost
    or damaged equipment. Our planning for normal climatic
    variation, insurance programs, and emergency recovery plans may
    inadequately mitigate the effects of such weather, and not all
    such effects can be predicted, eliminated or insured against.



Our
    commodity price risk management and trading activities may
    prevent us from benefiting fully from price increases and may
    expose us to other risks.

To the extent that we engage in price risk management activities
    to protect ourselves from commodity price declines, we may be
    prevented from realizing the full benefits of price increases
    above the levels of the derivative instruments used to manage
    price risk. In addition, our hedging arrangements may expose us
    to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances,
    including instances in which:

•

our production falls short of the hedged volumes;

•

there is a widening of price-basis differentials between
    delivery points for our production and the delivery point
    assumed in the hedge arrangement;

•

the counterparties to our hedging or other price risk management
    contracts fail to perform under those arrangements; or

•

a sudden unexpected event materially impacts oil and natural gas
    prices.

The
    credit risk of financial institutions could adversely affect
    us.

We have exposure to different counterparties, and we have
    entered into transactions with counterparties in the financial
    services industry, including commercial banks, investment banks,
    insurance companies, other investment funds and other
    institutions. These transactions expose us to credit risk in the
    event of default of our counterparty. Deterioration in the
    credit markets may impact the credit ratings of our current and
    potential counterparties and affect their ability to fulfill
    their existing obligations to us and their willingness to enter
    into future transactions with us. We have exposure to these
    financial institutions in the form of derivative transactions in
    connection with our hedges. We also maintain insurance policies
    with insurance companies to protect us against certain risks
    inherent in our business. In addition, if any lender under our
    credit facility is unable to fund its commitment, our liquidity
    will be reduced by an amount up to the aggregate amount of such
    lender’s commitment under our credit facility.

We are
    exposed to counterparty credit risk as a result of our
    receivables.

We are exposed to risk of financial loss from trade, joint
    venture, joint interest billing and other receivables. We sell
    our crude oil, natural gas and NGLs to a variety of purchasers.
    As operator, we pay expenses and bill our non-operating partners
    for their respective shares of costs. Some of our purchasers and
    non-operating partners may experience liquidity problems and may
    not be able to meet their financial obligations. Nonperformance
    by a trade creditor or non-operating partner could result in
    significant financial losses.

A
    downgrade in our credit rating could negatively impact our cost
    of and ability to access capital.

We receive debt ratings from the major credit rating agencies in
    the United States. Factors that may impact our credit ratings
    include debt levels, planned asset purchases or sales and
    near-term and long-term production growth opportunities.
    Liquidity, asset quality, cost structure, reserve mix and
    commodity pricing levels could also be considered by the rating
    agencies. Apache’s senior unsecured long-term debt is
    currently rated A3 by Moody’s, A- by Standard &
    Poor’s and A- by Fitch. The Company has received short-term
    debt ratings for its commercial paper program of

P-2

from
    Moody’s,

A-2

from
    Standard & Poor’s and F2 from Fitch. In September
    2009 Fitch downgraded Apache’s senior unsecured long-term
    debt and short-term debt from A and F1 to A- and F2,
    respectively. The current outlook at all three rating agencies
    is stable. A further ratings downgrade could adversely impact
    our ability to access debt markets in the future, increase the
    cost of future debt and potentially require the Company to post
    letters of credit in certain circumstances.

Market
    conditions may restrict our ability to obtain funds for future
    development and working capital needs, which may limit our
    financial flexibility.

During 2009 credit markets recovered but remain vulnerable to
    unpredictable shocks. We have a significant development project
    inventory and an extensive exploration portfolio, which will
    require substantial future investment. We

and/or

our
    partners may need to seek financing in order to fund these or
    other future activities.



Our future access to capital, as well as that of our partners
    and contractors, could be limited if the debt or equity markets
    are constrained. This could significantly delay development of
    our property interests.

Discoveries
    or acquisitions of additional reserves are needed to avoid a
    material decline in reserves and production.

The production rate from oil and gas properties generally
    declines as reserves are depleted, while related

per-unit

production costs generally increase as a result of decreasing
    reservoir pressures and other factors. Therefore, unless we add
    reserves through exploration and development activities or,
    through engineering studies, identify additional behind-pipe
    zones, secondary recovery reserves or tertiary recovery
    reserves, or acquire additional properties containing proved
    reserves, our estimated proved reserves will decline materially
    as reserves are produced. Future oil and gas production is,
    therefore, highly dependent upon our level of success in
    acquiring or finding additional reserves on an economic basis.
    Furthermore, if oil or gas prices increase, our cost for
    additional reserves could also increase.

We may
    not realize an adequate return on wells that we
    drill.

Drilling for oil and gas involves numerous risks, including the
    risk that we will not encounter commercially productive oil or
    gas reservoirs. The wells we drill or participate in may not be
    productive, and we may not recover all or any portion of our
    investment in those wells. The seismic data and other
    technologies we use do not allow us to know conclusively prior
    to drilling a well that crude or natural gas is present or may
    be produced economically. The costs of drilling, completing and
    operating wells are often uncertain, and drilling operations may
    be curtailed, delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of
    factors including, but not limited to:

•

unexpected drilling conditions;

•

pressure or irregularities in formations;

•

equipment failures or accidents;

•

fires, explosions, blowouts and surface cratering;

•

marine risks such as capsizing, collisions and hurricanes;

•

other adverse weather conditions; and

•

increase in the cost of, or shortages or delays in the
    availability of, drilling rigs and equipment.

Future drilling activities may not be successful and, if
    unsuccessful, this failure could have an adverse effect on our
    future results of operations and financial condition. While all
    drilling, whether developmental or exploratory, involves these
    risks, exploratory drilling involves greater risks of dry holes
    or failure to find commercial quantities of hydrocarbons.

Material
    differences between the estimated and actual timing of critical
    events may affect the completion and commencement of production
    from development projects.

We are involved in several large development projects whose
    completion may be delayed beyond our anticipated completion
    dates. Our projects may be delayed by project approvals from
    joint venture partners, timely issuances of permits and licenses
    by governmental agencies, weather conditions, manufacturing and
    delivery schedules of critical equipment, and other unforeseen
    events. Delays and differences between estimated and actual
    timing of critical events may adversely affect our large
    development projects and our ability to participate in large
    scale development projects in the future.

We may
    fail to fully identify potential problems related to acquired
    reserves or to properly estimate those reserves.

Although we perform a review of properties that we acquire that
    we believe is consistent with industry practices, such reviews
    are inherently incomplete. It generally is not feasible to
    review in depth every individual property involved in each
    acquisition. Ordinarily, we will focus our review efforts on the
    higher-value properties



and will sample the remainder. However, even a detailed review
    of records and properties may not necessarily reveal existing or
    potential problems, nor will it permit us as a buyer to become
    sufficiently familiar with the properties to assess fully and
    accurately their deficiencies and potential. Inspections may not
    always be performed on every well, and environmental problems,
    such as groundwater contamination, are not necessarily
    observable even when an inspection is undertaken. Even when
    problems are identified, we often assume certain environmental
    and other risks and liabilities in connection with acquired
    properties. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in
    estimating quantities of proved oil and gas reserves and future
    production rates and associated costs with respect to acquired
    properties, and actual results may vary substantially from those
    assumed in the estimates. In addition, there can be no assurance
    that acquisitions will not have an adverse effect upon our
    operating results, particularly during the periods in which the
    operations of acquired businesses are being integrated into our
    ongoing operations.

Crude
    oil and natural gas reserves are estimates, and actual
    recoveries may vary significantly.

There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating crude
    oil and natural gas reserves and their value, including factors
    that are beyond our control. Reservoir engineering is a
    subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of
    crude oil and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact
    manner. In accordance with the SEC’s revisions to rules for
    oil and gas reserves reporting, which we adopted effective
    December 31, 2009, our reserves estimates are based on

12-month

average prices, except where contractual arrangements exist;
    therefore, reserves quantities will change when actual prices
    increase or decrease. The estimates depend on a number of
    factors and assumptions that may vary considerably from actual
    results, including:

•

historical production from the area compared with production
    from other areas;

•

the assumed effects of regulations by governmental agencies,
    including the impact of the SEC’s new oil and gas company
    reserves reporting requirements;

•

assumptions concerning future crude oil and natural gas prices;

•

future operating costs;

•

severance and excise taxes;

•

development costs; and

•

workover and remediation costs.

For these reasons, estimates of the economically recoverable
    quantities of crude oil and natural gas attributable to any
    particular group of properties, classifications of those
    reserves based on risk of recovery and estimates of the future
    net cash flows expected from them prepared by different
    engineers or by the same engineers but at different times may
    vary substantially. Accordingly, reserves estimates may be
    subject to upward or downward adjustment, and actual production,
    revenue and expenditures with respect to our reserves likely
    will vary, possibly materially, from estimates.

Additionally, because some of our reserves estimates are
    calculated using volumetric analysis, those estimates are less
    reliable than the estimates based on a lengthy production
    history. Volumetric analysis involves estimating the volume of a
    reservoir based on the net feet of pay of the structure and an
    estimation of the area covered by the structure. In addition,
    realization or recognition of proved undeveloped reserves will
    depend on our development schedule and plans. A change in future
    development plans for proved undeveloped reserves could cause
    the discontinuation of the classification of these reserves as
    proved.

Certain
    of our undeveloped leasehold acreage is subject to leases that
    will expire over the next several years unless production is
    established on units containing the acreage.

A sizeable portion of our acreage is currently undeveloped.
    Unless production in paying quantities is established on units
    containing certain of these leases during their terms, the
    leases will expire. If our leases expire, we will lose our right
    to develop the related properties. Our drilling plans for these
    areas are subject to change based upon various factors,
    including drilling results, oil and natural gas prices, the
    availability and cost of



capital, drilling and production costs, availability of drilling
    services and equipment, gathering system and pipeline
    transportation constraints and regulatory approvals.

We may
    incur significant costs related to environmental
    matters.

As an owner or lessee and operator of oil and gas properties, we
    are subject to various federal, provincial, state, local and
    foreign country laws and regulations relating to discharge of
    materials into, and protection of, the environment. These laws
    and regulations may, among other things, impose liability on the
    lessee under an oil and gas lease for the cost of pollution

clean-up

resulting from operations, subject the lessee to liability for
    pollution damages and require suspension or cessation of
    operations in affected areas. Our efforts to limit our exposure
    to such liability and cost may prove inadequate and result in
    significant adverse affect on our results of operations. In
    addition, it is possible that the increasingly strict
    requirements imposed by environmental laws and enforcement
    policies could require us to make significant capital
    expenditures. Such capital expenditures could adversely impact
    our cash flows and our financial condition.

Our
    North American operations are subject to governmental risks that
    may impact our operations.

Our North American operations have been, and at times in the
    future may be, affected by political developments and by
    federal, state, provincial and local laws and regulations such
    as restrictions on production, changes in taxes, royalties and
    other amounts payable to governments or governmental agencies,
    price or gathering rate controls and environmental protection
    laws and regulations. New political developments, laws and
    regulations may adversely impact our results on operations.

Pending
    regulations related to emissions and the impact of any changes
    in climate could adversely impact our business.

Legislation is pending in a number of countries where Apache
    operates including Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom and the
    United States, that, if enacted, could tax or assess some form
    of greenhouse gas (GHG) related fees on Company operations and
    could lead to increased operating expenses. Such legislation, if
    enacted, could also potentially cause the Company to make
    significant capital investments for infrastructure
    modifications. Through 2009, only two of the jurisdictions in
    which the Company has operations, Alberta, Canada and the United
    Kingdom (European Union), have enacted legislation which exposes
    the Company to financial payments related to GHG emissions from
    production facilities. This exposure has not been material to
    date.

Furthermore, various governmental entities in countries where
    Apache operates have discussed regulatory initiatives that
    could, if adopted, require the Company to modify existing or
    planned infrastructure to meet GHG emissions performance
    standards and necessitate significant capital expenditures. At
    some level, the cost of performance standards may force the
    early retirement of smaller production facilities, which in
    aggregate may have a material adverse effect on Apache’s
    business.

Several of the countries we operate in are signatories to
    current international accords related to climate change, such as
    the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on
    Climate Change. Given the current implementation of the Kyoto
    Protocol, we do not expect it to have a material impact on the
    Company.

Several indirect consequences of regulation and business trends
    have potential to impact us. Taxes or fees on carbon emissions
    could lead to decreased demand for fossil fuels. Consumers may
    prefer alternative products and unknown technological
    innovations may make oil and gas less significant energy sources.

In the event the predictions for rising temperatures and sea
    levels suggested by reports of the United Nations
    Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change do transpire, we do
    not believe those events by themselves are likely to impact the
    Company’s assets or operations. However, any increase in
    severe weather could have a material adverse effect on our
    assets and operations.



The
    proposed U.S. federal budget for fiscal year 2011 includes
    certain provisions that, if passed as originally submitted, will
    have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of
    operations, and cash flows.

On February 1, 2010, the Office of Management and Budget
    released a summary of the proposed U.S. federal budget for
    fiscal year 2011. The proposed budget repeals many tax
    incentives and deductions that are currently used by
    U.S. oil and gas companies and imposes new taxes. The
    provisions include: elimination of the ability to fully deduct
    intangible drilling costs in the year incurred; increases in the
    taxation of foreign source income; repeal of the manufacturing
    tax deduction for oil and natural gas companies; and an increase
    in the geological and geophysical amortization period for
    independent producers. Should some or all of these provisions
    become law, our taxes will increase, potentially significantly,
    which would have a negative impact on our net income and cash
    flows. This could also reduce our drilling activities in the
    U.S. Since none of these proposals have yet to be voted on
    or become law, we do not know the ultimate impact these proposed
    changes may have on our business.

Proposed
    federal regulation regarding hydraulic fracturing could increase
    our operating and capital costs.

Several proposals are before the U.S. Congress that, if
    implemented, would either prohibit the practice of hydraulic
    fracturing or subject the process to regulation under the Safe
    Drinking Water Act. We routinely use fracturing techniques in
    the U.S. and other regions to expand the available space
    for natural gas to migrate toward the well-bore. It is typically
    done at substantial depths in very tight formations.

Although it is not possible at this time to predict the final
    outcome of the legislation regarding hydraulic fracturing, any
    new federal restrictions on hydraulic fracturing that may be
    imposed in areas in which we conduct business could result in
    increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions
    in the U.S.

International
    operations have uncertain political, economic and other
    risks.

Our operations outside North America are based primarily in
    Egypt, Australia, the United Kingdom and Argentina. On a barrel
    equivalent basis, approximately 52 percent of our 2009
    production was outside North America and approximately
    38 percent of our estimated proved oil and gas reserves on
    December 31, 2009 were located outside North America. As a
    result, a significant portion of our production and resources
    are subject to the increased political and economic risks and
    other factors associated with international operations
    including, but not limited to:

•

general strikes and civil unrest;

•

the risk of war, acts of terrorism, expropriation and resource
    nationalization, forced renegotiation or modification of
    existing contracts;

•

import and export regulations;

•

taxation policies, including royalty and tax increases and
    retroactive tax claims, and investment restrictions;

•

price control;

•

transportation regulations and tariffs;

•

constrained natural gas markets dependent on demand in a single
    or limited geographical area;

•

exchange controls, currency fluctuations, devaluation or other
    activities that limit or disrupt markets and restrict payments
    or the movement of funds;

•

laws and policies of the United States affecting foreign trade,
    including trade sanctions;

•

the possibility of being subject to exclusive jurisdiction of
    foreign courts in connection with legal disputes relating to
    licenses to operate and concession rights in countries where we
    currently operate;

•

the possible inability to subject foreign persons, especially
    foreign oil ministries and national oil companies, to the
    jurisdiction of courts in the United States; and



•

difficulties in enforcing our rights against a governmental
    agency because of the doctrine of sovereign immunity and foreign
    sovereignty over international operations.

Foreign countries have occasionally asserted rights to oil and
    gas properties through border disputes. If a country claims
    superior rights to oil and gas leases or concessions granted to
    us by another country, our interests could decrease in value or
    be lost. Even our smaller international assets may affect our
    overall business and results of operations by distracting
    management’s attention from our more significant assets.
    Various regions of the world in which we operate have a history
    of political and economic instability. This instability could
    result in new governments or the adoption of new policies that
    might result in a substantially more hostile attitude toward
    foreign investments such as ours. In an extreme case, such a
    change could result in termination of contract rights and
    expropriation of our assets. This could adversely affect our
    interests and our future profitability.

The impact that future terrorist attacks or regional hostilities
    may have on the oil and gas industry in general, and on our
    operations in particular, is not known at this time. Uncertainty
    surrounding military strikes or a sustained military campaign
    may affect operations in unpredictable ways, including
    disruptions of fuel supplies and markets, particularly oil, and
    the possibility that infrastructure facilities, including
    pipelines, production facilities, processing plants and
    refineries, could be direct targets of, or indirect casualties
    of, an act of terror or war. We may be required to incur
    significant costs in the future to safeguard our assets against
    terrorist activities.

Our
    operations are sensitive to currency rate
    fluctuations.

Our operations are sensitive to fluctuations in foreign currency
    exchange rates, particularly between the U.S. dollar and
    the Canadian dollar, the Australian dollar and the British
    Pound. Our financial statements, presented in U.S. dollars,
    are affected by foreign currency fluctuations through both
    translation risk and transaction risk. Volatility in exchange
    rates may adversely affect our results of operation,
    particularly through the weakening of the U.S. dollar
    relative to other currencies.

We
    face strong industry competition that may have a significant
    negative impact on our result of operations.

Strong competition exists in all sectors of the oil and gas
    exploration and production industry. We compete with major
    integrated and other independent oil and gas companies for
    acquisition of oil and gas leases, properties and reserves,
    equipment and labor required to explore, develop and operate
    those properties and marketing of oil and natural gas
    production. Crude oil and natural gas prices impact the costs of
    properties available for acquisition and the number of companies
    with the financial resources to pursue acquisition
    opportunities. Many of our competitors have financial and other
    resources substantially larger than we possess and have
    established strategic long-term positions and maintain strong
    governmental relationships in countries in which we may seek new
    entry. As a consequence, we may be at a competitive disadvantage
    in bidding for drilling rights. In addition, many of our larger
    competitors may have a competitive advantage when responding to
    factors that affect demand for oil and natural gas production,
    such as fluctuating worldwide commodity prices and levels of
    production, the cost and availability of alternative fuels and
    the application of government regulations. We also compete in
    attracting and retaining personnel, including geologists,
    geophysicists, engineers and other specialists. These
    competitive pressures may have a significant negative impact on
    our results of operations.

Our
    insurance policies do not cover all of the risks we face, which
    could result in significant financial exposure.

Exploration for and production of crude oil and natural gas can
    be hazardous, involving natural disasters and other events such
    as blowouts, cratering, fire and explosion and loss of well
    control which can result in damage to or destruction of wells or
    production facilities, injury to persons, loss of life, or
    damage to property and the environment. Our international
    operations are also subject to political risk. The insurance
    coverage that we maintain against certain losses or liabilities
    arising from our operations may be inadequate to cover any such
    resulting liability; moreover, insurance is not available to us
    against all operational risks.

    336,550,234 shares of our common stock outstanding held by
    approximately 5,800 stockholders of record and approximately
    442,000 beneficial owners.

We have paid cash dividends on our common stock for 45
    consecutive years through December 31, 2009. When, and if,
    declared by our Board of Directors, future dividend payments
    will depend upon our level of earnings, financial requirements
    and other relevant factors.

In 1995, under our stockholder rights plan, each of our common
    stockholders received a dividend of one preferred stock purchase
    right (a “right”) for each 2.310 outstanding shares of
    common stock (adjusted for subsequent stock dividends and a

two-for-one

stock split) that the stockholder owned. These rights were
    originally scheduled to expire on January 31, 2006.
    Effective as of that date, the rights were reset to one right
    per share of common stock, and the expiration was extended to
    January 31, 2016. Unless the rights have been previously
    redeemed, all shares of Apache common stock are issued with
    rights, which trade automatically with our shares of common

ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S
    DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
    OPERATIONS

Apache Corporation, a Delaware corporation formed in 1954, is an
    independent energy company engaged in worldwide crude oil,
    natural gas and NGL exploration and production. In North
    America, our exploration and production operations are focused
    in the Gulf of Mexico, the Gulf Coast, East Texas, the Permian
    Basin, the Anadarko Basin and the Western Sedimentary Basin of
    Canada. Outside of North America, we have exploration and
    production operations onshore Egypt, offshore Western Australia,
    offshore the United Kingdom (U.K.) in the North Sea (North Sea),
    and onshore Argentina. We also have exploration interests on the
    Chilean side of the island of Tierra del Fuego.

The following discussion should be read together with the
    Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements set forth in Part IV, Item 15 of
    this

Form 10-K,

and the Risk Factors information set forth in Part I,
    Item 1A of this

Form 10-K.

Executive
    Overview

Strategy

Apache’s mission is to grow a profitable upstream oil and
    gas company for the long-term benefit of our shareholders.
    Apache’s long-term perspective has many dimensions, with
    the following core principles:

•

Own a balanced portfolio of core assets;

•

Maintain financial flexibility and a strong balance
    sheet; and

•

Optimize rates of return, earnings and cash flow.

Throughout the cycles of our industry, these strategies have
    underpinned our ability to deliver production and reserve growth
    and achieve competitive investment rates of return for the
    benefit of our shareholders. We have increased reserves 22 out
    of the last 24 years and production 29 out of the past
    31 years, a testament to our consistency over the long-term.

These strategies have served us well in the past and should
    continue to serve us well going forward. However, we also
    believe several long-term trends across the globe will have a
    tremendous impact on supply and demand for fuel and on
    Apache’s business model in the years ahead.

•

Demand for fuel continues to grow in many parts of the
    developing world, where billions of people are seeking to move
    up the economic ladder.

•

A new psychology of scarcity is driving competition for
    resources around the world and testing many long-held
    assumptions and relationships. The world will need all sources
    of energy — including wind, solar and other
    alternatives — to keep up with long-term demand growth.

•

In North America, recent improvements in horizontal drilling and
    completion technology have transformed the natural gas market,
    opening up a

100-year

resource with the potential to improve U.S. energy
    security, create jobs and help achieve environmental and climate
    change goals.

We believe Apache’s evolution from a domestic driller and
    producer to an independent global exploration and production
    company, coupled with our sense of urgency, discipline,
    innovation and spirit, positions us well to take advantage of
    these impending trends. Our current production base provides the
    cash flow required for us to seek out larger exploration targets
    while developing our discoveries, including Qasr in Egypt,
    Julimar in Australia and the Horn River Basin of British
    Columbia.

As we head into 2010, we anticipate that higher production will
    generate adequate cash flow to support a higher activity level
    compared to 2009. Two oil developments in Australia —
    Van Gogh and Pyrenees — will contribute significant
    volumes in 2010. Also, gas production in the Horn River Basin
    shale play will begin ramping up in 2010 as Apache’s teams
    apply technological innovations to complete wells more quickly
    and at lower cost.



However, while we are comfortable that our $2 billion of
    cash on hand at year-end and the additional liquidity available
    from our credit facilities will provide ample flexibility to
    pursue additional exploration activity or opportunistic,
    value-adding acquisitions, lingering issues in the credit
    markets clearly demonstrate that any detectable economic
    recovery is fragile at best. Therefore, we will continue to
    manage drilling and development capital spending in line with
    available cash flow.

Financial
    and Operating Results

The dramatic decline in oil and gas prices and global financial
    crisis that began in 2008 provided the backdrop for our primary
    objective in 2009: living within our cash flow to preserve
    financial flexibility. Although we curtailed activity to achieve
    this objective, Apache delivered record annual average daily
    production — up nine percent from 2008 — and
    added slightly more reserves, excluding revisions, than we
    produced.

The decline in oil and gas prices impacted Apache’s 2009
    financial results, requiring us to reduce the carrying value of
    oil and gas properties and resulting in a $1.98-billion non-cash
    charge to earnings during the first quarter. However, with
    rebounding oil prices and higher production, earnings
    strengthened throughout the remainder of the year.

To ensure we lived within cash flow, we reduced 2009 activity
    and investments to $4.1 billion, 39 percent below 2008
    levels. Despite curtailed capital spending, we moved forward on
    several large development projects, pursued exploration
    opportunities resulting in several important new discoveries,
    increased production nine percent to a record 583,328 boe/d and
    generated $4.2 billion in net cash provided by operating
    activities. In addition, we maintained our strong balance sheet
    and ample liquidity levels, exiting 2009 with a

debt-to-capitalization

ratio of 24 percent, just over $2 billion of cash and
    $2.3 billion in available committed borrowing capacity. We
    also believe our single-A debt ratings provide a competitive
    advantage in accessing capital.

For the year, Apache recorded a net loss of $292 million,
    or $.87 per common diluted share, compared to 2008 net
    income of $706 million, or $2.09 per common diluted share.
    Apache’s 2009 reported adjusted earnings (1) , which
    exclude certain items impacting the comparability of results,
    were $1.98 billion or $5.59 per common diluted share, down
    from $3.8 billion or $11.22 per common diluted share in the
    prior year. We generated net cash provided by operating
    activities totaling $4.2 billion, down from
    $7.1 billion in 2008.

The following items impacted our 2009 earnings and cash flow as
    compared to 2008:

•

Record production of 583,328 boe/d, up nine percent from 2008;

•

Average realized oil prices decreased 32 percent to $59.85
    per bbl;

•

Average realized gas prices decreased 45 percent to $3.69
    per Mcf;

•

A non-cash after-tax write-down of the carrying value of proved
    property of $1.98 billion in 2009 versus $3.6 billion
    in 2008 affected earnings; and

•

Total operating expenses decreased $3.2 billion, or
    28 percent, from 2008.

    U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP)
    measure, and a reconciliation to this measure from Income (Loss)
    Attributable to Common Stock, which is presented in accordance
    with GAAP.

Proposed
    Climate Change Legislation

Management believes that climate change legislation globally is
    undergoing a phase of significant evolution, and as a
    consequence, the Company perceives an unusual lack of clarity
    surrounding this issue. Furthermore, in the United States, the
    Company is concerned that legislation will distort markets and
    protect other energy sectors. The Company believes that natural
    gas offers the most cost effective means to reduce greenhouse
    gas (GHG) emissions rapidly and the Company is well positioned
    to contribute to an overall increase of natural gas supply.



Apache
    Greenhouse Gas Emissions Reporting

Total gross GHG emissions from Apache operated properties
    world-wide are calculated and reported to the Carbon Disclosure
    Project (CDP) on a country-by-country basis using recognized
    international protocols. Currently the CDP maintains a public
    access website with Apache information for calendar year 2008.
    Emissions for calendar year 2009 are due to be reported to CDP
    by May for posting later in 2010. Readers are advised that
    Apache GHG emissions values are not subject to the same rigorous
    controls for accuracy and reliability as financial data found in
    this filing, and that there are inherent limitations for
    directly measuring GHG emissions from oil and gas production
    facilities in general.

In addition, for required facilities, Apache GHG emissions are
    reported to local and national authorities in Australia, Canada
    and the United Kingdom following reporting standards specific to
    each jurisdiction, and verified according to regulatory
    requirements. For 2010, the United States Environmental
    Protection Agency will require emissions reports covering some
    of our largest fixed combustion facilities.

Operating
    Highlights

Operational highlights for the year and growth drivers for 2010
    and beyond are as follows:

Australia

During 2009 the Australia region restored operations and
    increased capacity at the Varanus Island gas processing
    facility, and it continued to lay the foundation for future
    growth by developing previously discovered fields that will come
    on-line over the short, intermediate and long terms. Our Van
    Gogh and Pyrenees discoveries (oil fields) commenced production
    in the first quarter of 2010. In the intermediate-term, our
    Halyard and Reindeer discoveries (gas fields) are scheduled to
    begin producing in 2011. In the longer term, we will see
    additional production from our Julimar, Macedon and Coniston
    field discoveries, as discussed below.

Discoveries
    expected to begin producing in 2010

•

Van Gogh Discovery Development

Drilling and
    installation of subsea production equipment were completed in
    2009 at the Apache-operated Van Gogh field discovery. Limited
    production began in February 2010, with routine commissioning
    activities still being performed on the floating, production,
    storage, and offloading vessel (FPSO) servicing the field.

•

Pyrenees Discovery Development

Installation of
    subsea facilities at our Pyrenees field was completed in 2009.
    First oil production commenced ahead of schedule, on
    February 24, 2010. As planned, the wells will be drilled
    and brought on in phases, with half of the expected production
    volume ramping up over the next six months.

Peak production from the Van Gogh and Pyrenees discoveries is
    projected to reach a combined 40,000 b/d net to Apache.

Discoveries
    expected to begin producing in 2011

•

Halyard Discovery Development

In April 2008 we
    drilled the Halyard-1 discovery well, which tested

68 MMcf/d.

We currently plan to tie the field into the existing nearby East
    Spar gas facilities. First production is anticipated in 2011.

•

Reindeer Discovery Development

Our Reindeer
    field discovery will be produced through an onshore gas plant
    currently under construction, the Devil Creek gas plant. In
    2009, we entered into a gas sales contract covering a portion of
    the field’s future production. Under the contract, Apache
    and our joint venture partner agreed to supply 154 Bcf of
    gas over seven years (approximately

60 MMcf/d)

beginning in the second half of 2011 at prices higher than we
    have historically received in Western Australia. Apache owns a
    55-percent interest in the field. The company is continuing to
    market its remaining net share in the Reindeer field.



Discoveries
    expected to begin producing after 2011

•

Julimar and Brunello Natural Gas
    Discoveries

Our Julimar and Brunello natural gas
    discoveries will be produced through liquefied natural gas (LNG)
    facilities (discussed below). The LNG project, which is
    currently in front-end engineering and design (FEED), will
    convert the gas into LNG for sale on the world market. World LNG
    prices are typically tied to oil prices, and are currently
    higher than gas prices we have historically received in Western
    Australia. Our projected net sales would approximate

190 MMcf/d

and 5,100 b/d with a projected

15-year

production plateau when the multi-year project is complete and
    all the wells are producing.

•

Wheatstone LNG Project

In October 2009, Apache
    announced an agreement to become a foundation equity partner in
    Chevron’s Wheatstone LNG hub in Western Australia. Chevron,
    which has a 100-percent interest in the Wheatstone field, will
    operate the LNG facilities with a 75-percent interest. Apache
    will own 16.25 percent interest in the project and our
    partner in the Julimar and Brunello fields will own the
    remaining project interest. The Wheatstone project is targeting
    a final investment decision (FID) in 2011 and first sales from
    the facility are projected for 2015. Our net capital for the
    project is currently estimated to be $1.2 billion for
    upstream development of the Julimar and Brunello fields and
    $3.0 billion in the Wheatstone facilities. The investment
    will be funded as the multi-year project is developed.

•

Macedon and Coniston Discoveries

We have two
    contingent development opportunities that will be evaluated
    during 2010. The Macedon field is a gas discovery near our
    Pyrenees field which is currently being reviewed by the
    operator, BHP Billiton, for commercial development. Gas produced
    from Pyrenees will be reinjected into the Macedon field to
    reduce flaring and conserve those volumes for future production.
    The Coniston field is an oil accumulation near our Van Gogh
    field. Apache drilled 10 appraisal wells during the year and is
    evaluating a development plan to tie-back the field to the FPSO
    currently serving the Van Gogh field.

Egypt

Notable successes during the year include:

2X
    Project

•

In June 2005, Apache and the Egyptian government set a goal to
    double gross equivalent production from Apache operated
    concessions by the end of 2010 (2X Project). At the time of the
    proposal, Apache’s gross operated equivalent production was
    approximately 163 Mboe/d. As we exited 2009, Egypt was over
    90 percent of the way to reaching that goal.

Double-digit
    Growth in both oil and gas production

•

Egypt’s gross gas production increased 26 percent,
    driven by exploration successes at our Khalda and Matruh
    concessions and from additional plant and pipeline capacity.
    Additional capacity provided by the combination of two new
    processing trains at the Salam Gas Plant and completion of a
    project to increase compression on the Northern pipeline allowed
    previously discovered wells in the Khalda Concession Qasr field
    to come online. The increased compression in the Northern Gas
    Pipeline also allowed increased throughput at the nearby Tarek
    plant and enabled us to begin producing previous discoveries at
    the Jade and Falcon fields in our Matruh concession.

•

Egypt’s gross oil production increased 25 percent on
    exploration successes in numerous concessions, most notably East
    Bahariya Extension, South Umbarka, Matruh, NEAG Extension and
    Khalda. Waterflood projects and increased condensate from
    additional Qasr gas flowing through the new processing trains at
    Salam Gas Plant also contributed.

•

Additional plant and pipeline capacity expansion will be
    required in the coming years to keep pace with the
    internally-generated discoveries described below.



Development,
    Exploration and Appraisal Activity

•

Phiops Field Discovery

Kalabsha
    Concession — Current production from the Phiops field,
    initially discovered in late 2008, is approximately 8,100 b/d
    gross, with two of four completed wells shut-in due to facility
    constraints. The Phiops field is the largest of five fields
    discovered in the Faghur Basin of the Western Desert since 2006
    by Apache through its joint venture partner, Khalda Petroleum
    Company. We expect to increase production to 20,000 gross
    barrels per day when additional infrastructure is completed by
    mid-2010. To allow for future production growth, a second phase
    of infrastructure expansion to 40,000 b/d, is targeted for
    completion by the end of the third quarter of 2010. In addition,
    gas capacity of

38 MMcf/d

is slated for mid-2011. Further exploration, appraisal and
    development activity in the concession is planned for 2010.

•

Concession Extensions

Amendments to extend our
    Siwa, Sallum, and West Ghazalat exploration concessions for an
    additional three years (to July 27, 2013) were
    approved by the Egyptian Parliament in June 2009. These
    concessions encompass 3.8 million gross acres, which Apache
    operates with a 50-percent contractor interest. Seismic
    acquisition and early exploration drilling is planned for 2010.
    Additionally, we finalized extension of the Khalda Offset and
    East Bahariya concessions in the Western Desert. At Khalda
    Offset, the exploration phase is extended until July 2016.
    Apache has a 100-percent contractor interest in this concession,
    which covers 909,000 acres. The East Bahariya concession
    exploration phase was extended through July 2012. Apache has a
    100-percent contractor interest in this concession, which
    encompasses 674,000 acres.

•

North Tarek Concession

On April 30, 2009,
    we announced the NTRK-C-1X well, our first discovery in this
    concession along the Mediterranean coast, tested at a rate of
    3,489 b/d and

5 MMcf/d.

Additional drilling is planned for 2010.

•

Shushan C Concession

Hydra Field —
    Apache has had numerous exploration successes on this concession
    and is in the process of negotiating a Gas Sales Agreement with
    Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation (EGPC). When the
    agreement is completed, we will file to establish a development
    lease. The most recent discovery, the Hydra-5X appraisal well,
    tested

21 MMcf/d

and 3,744 b/d. This well follows Apache’s Hydra-1X
    discovery drilled in 2008 which test-flowed

76.6 MMcf/d

and 2,813 b/d.

•

Other Discoveries

During 2009 we had three
    additional discoveries in Egypt’s Western Desert that
    tested an aggregate

80 MMcf/d

and 5,909 b/d. The Sultan-3X located on the Khalda Offset
    Concession test-flowed 5,021 b/d and

11 MMcf/d.

The two other discoveries, the Adam-1X and the Maggie-1X,
    discovered new gas-condensate fields on the Matruh development
    lease north of the Sultan discovery. Apache has a 100-percent
    contractor interest in both concessions. Oil production from
    Sultan-3X began in the first quarter of 2009.

North
    America

Apache’s North American asset base, comprised of the
    U.S. Central and Gulf Coast Regions along with Canada,
    reflects the balanced portfolio approach that has long been one
    of the Company’s greatest strengths. The Central Region
    provided steady, predictable results with its high-quality
    assets and large acreage base. The Gulf Coast Region delivered
    solid production despite curtailment of capital spending. Also,
    the region restored virtually all production shut-in by
    hurricanes. Canada laid the foundation for future growth through
    its shale-gas plays and Kitimat LNG acquisition. Operating
    highlights for 2009 and future growth drivers for our North
    American operations include the following:

U.S.
    Central Region

•

During the second quarter of 2009 we announced the acquisition
    of nine Permian Basin oil and gas fields with current net
    production of 3,500 barrels of oil equivalent per day from
    Marathon Oil Corporation for $187.4 million, subject to
    normal post-closing adjustments. These long-lived oil fields fit
    well with Apache’s existing properties in the Permian
    Basin, particularly in Lea County, N.M., and will provide us
    drilling opportunities for many years. The effective date of the
    transaction was January 1, 2009.



•

In 2009 we drilled our first operated horizontal well in the
    Granite Wash play in Washita County, Oklahoma. The
    Hostetter #1-23H commenced production in September 2009 at

17 MMcf/d

and 800 b/d and is currently producing

9.5 MMcf/d

and 600 b/d. Apache owns a 72-percent working interest in the
    well. We have drilled extensively over the past decade in the
    Granite Wash, and as a result, we control approximately
    200,000 gross acres in the play, mostly

held-by-production.

Hundreds of additional horizontal well locations have been
    identified across our acreage, extending opportunities for many
    years. In early 2010 we had three rigs in operation with plans
    to increase to at least five as we target drilling a minimum of
    29 horizontal wells in the play during the year.

U.S. Gulf
    Coast Region

•

In April 2009 we announced a key deepwater discovery at Ewing
    Banks Block 998 that test-flowed 4,254 b/d and

5.4 MMcf/d.

The well will be connected to existing facilities, with first
    production projected for mid-year 2010. Apache owns a 50-percent
    interest in the property.

•

In May 2009 production commenced from two deepwater discoveries
    in the Geauxpher field, located on Garden Banks Block 462.
    During the second half of 2009, the field produced an average of

91 MMcf/d

gross. Apache generated the prospect and has a 40-percent
    working interest.

•

At South Timbalier 287 (drilled from Apache’s South
    Timbalier 308 platform), the #A-8 well came online flowing
    1,800 b/d. Apache has a 100-percent working interest in this
    well.

•

At Ewing Banks 826, four successful wells were drilled as part
    of our redevelopment program. Initial production rates ranged
    from 500 b/d to 1,000 b/d per well. Apache has a 100-percent
    working interest in these wells.

•

A relatively quiet hurricane season allowed the region to
    continue restoration of shut-in production in the Gulf of
    Mexico. We made considerable progress, and virtually all
    production shut-in by hurricanes has been restored.

Canada

Unconventional gas opportunities in Canada are anticipated to
    drive future growth of Apache’s Canadian region, moving
    beyond conventional plays in Alberta, British Columbia and
    Saskatchewan that have been the foundation of the region’s
    activities for 15 years.

•

Horn River Basin Shale Gas Play

Apache
    continued development activity on its Horn River Basin shale-gas
    play in northeast British Columbia, where we have over 220,000
    highly prospective net acres. During 2009 Apache and its joint
    interest partner drilled 41 horizontal wells. Four of these
    wells were completed and placed on production by year-end 2009
    and were producing at a combined gross rate in excess of

19 MMcf/d.

Apache commenced stimulating the 16 wells on its first
    operated development pad in the fourth quarter of 2009, with
    production scheduled for mid-2010. A total of 55 wells are
    planned for completion in 2010. Additionally, during the second
    quarter of 2009, a new dehydration and compressor facility and a
    new

42-mile

24-inch

sales line, with capacity of over

700 MMcf/d,

was commissioned that will allow us to flow gas to a third-party
    interconnect point when completed in 2010.

•

Kitimat LNG Terminal

The expected magnitude of
    the Horn River Basin resources and its remote
    location — far from most major North American
    markets — prompted Apache to seek alternative markets.
    In January 2010 we announced an agreement to acquire a
    51-percent interest in Kitimat LNG, Inc’s. proposed LNG
    export terminal in British Columbia. We also reserved
    51 percent of throughput capacity in the terminal. Planned
    plant capacity will be approximately

700 MMcf/d,

or five million metric tons of LNG per day. This project has the
    potential to access new markets in the Asia-Pacific region and
    allow Apache to monetize gas from its Canadian region, including
    its interest in the Horn River Basin in northeast British
    Columbia. A final investment decision is expected in 2011, with
    the first LNG shipments projected for as early as 2014. Apache
    will become the operator of the project. Preliminary gross
    construction cost estimates, which will be refined upon
    completion of a FEED study, total C$3 billion. Kitimat is
    designed to be linked to the pipeline system servicing Western
    Canada’s natural gas producing regions via the proposed
    Pacific Trail



Pipelines, a project with a current estimated gross cost of
    C$1.1 billion. In association with our acquisition of
    interest in the Kitimat project, we also acquired a 25.5-percent
    interest in the proposed pipeline and

350 MMcf/d

of capacity rights.

•

Corridor Resources, Inc. Farm-in

In December
    2009, we entered into a farm-in agreement with Corridor
    Resources Inc. (Corridor) to appraise and potentially develop
    oil and natural gas resources in the province of New Brunswick,
    Canada. The initial

18-month

program is intended to evaluate the commercial potential of
    natural gas development in the Frederick Brook formation and
    light oil development at a recent Caledonia oil discovery at a
    cost to Apache of not less than $25 million. Upon
    completion of this appraisal program, Apache will have earned a
    50-percent working interest in the spacing units drilled. Apache
    will then have the option to participate in phase two of the
    program at a cost of not less than $100 million. Upon
    completion of this phase by March 31, 2013, Apache would
    earn a 50-percent interest in approximately 116,000 acres.

North
    Sea

Apache entered the North Sea in 2003 upon acquiring an
    approximate 97-percent working interest in the Forties field
    (Forties). Production increased two percent in 2009, as gains
    from our drilling and workover programs more than offset
    unplanned downtime to replace an original vintage spool section
    at the end of the Bravo-Charlie infield pipeline, which lowered
    production for the year by 2,690 boe/d.

In addition to an active year of drilling, we completed and made
    significant progress on several important facility projects that
    will benefit Forties in the years ahead. The Delta-Charlie
    infield pipeline was replaced, bringing improved mechanical
    integrity. We installed and commissioned a new power turbine on
    Delta to support increasing field-water injection during 2010.
    On the Charlie platform, we purchased equipment, cleared access
    and began installing components late in 2009 for a new
    high-pressure gas lift system that will be operational in early
    2011. Work that began on the Echo platform several years ago to
    replace the antiquated and unreliable controls system with a
    modern version was fundamentally completed. The various facility
    upgrade and improvement projects completed in recent years
    resulted in a significant reduction in the number of occurrences
    of unplanned downtime. In 2009 we had fewer events causing
    unplanned downtime than we have experienced in any year since
    acquiring the Forties field; 64 percent less than our
    previous best year.

Argentina

Argentina announced several strategic agreements during 2009
    that will improve the long-term viability of our investments.

Exploration
    Activity

•

On March 30, 2009, Apache announced that the Neuquén
    Province of Argentina agreed to extend the term of eight federal
    oil and gas concessions for 10 additional years. Neuquén
    operations provide about half of Apache’s total output in
    Argentina. The concessions encompass approximately
    590,000 acres, including exploratory areas totaling
    514,000 acres. In exchange for production that would have
    reverted to the Province beginning in six years and the right to
    explore for 10 additional years, Apache paid a bonus of
    approximately $23 million, increased the provincial royalty
    to 15 percent from 12 percent and will spend up to
    $320 million in future work programs over a

19-year

period.

Development
    Activity

•

During 2009 Apache received technical and commercial approval
    from the government of Argentina for four Gas Plus projects and
    technical approval for two more Gas Plus projects designed to
    encourage new supplies through development of tight sands and
    unconventional gas reserves. Under the Gas Plus program, Apache
    has the opportunity to supply

10 MMcf/d

from fields in the Neuquén Province at a price of $4.10 per
    MMBtu beginning January 2010 for an initial one-year term. The
    Company also has a letter of intent for a contract to supply up
    to

50 MMcf/d

from fields in the Neuquén and Rio Negro Provinces for
    $5.00 per MMBtu beginning January 2011. The gas supplying the
    Gas Plus program contracts is required to come from wells



drilled in the projects’ approved fields and formations. We
    believe this type of program, coupled with changing market
    conditions, point to improving price realizations going forward.

Chile

Exploration
    Activity

In November 2007 Apache was awarded exploration rights on two
    blocks comprising approximately one million net acres on the
    Chilean side of Tierra del Fuego. This acreage is adjacent to
    our 552,000 net acres on the Argentine side of the island
    of Tierra del Fuego and represents a natural extension of our
    expanding exploration and production operations. The Lenga and
    Rusfin Blocks were ratified by the Chilean government on
    July 24, 2008. In January 2009 a

3-D

seismic
    survey totaling 1,000 square kilometers was completed, and
    in November 2009 the first of a three-well exploration program
    commenced drilling. Two of the wells reached total depth by
    year-end 2009, with drilling completed on the third well in
    early 2010. Currently a completion rig is conducting testing and
    completion efforts on the three wells. During 2010 the region
    will invest approximately $25 million to $35 million
    for drilling and seismic acquisition.

Crude Oil
    Prices

A substantial portion of our oil production is sold at
    prevailing market prices, which fluctuate in response to many
    factors that are outside of our control. Prices we received for
    our crude oil in 2009 were 32 percent below 2008 with the
    worldwide economic downturn. Apache uses financial instruments
    to manage a portion of its exposure to fluctuations in crude oil
    prices, particularly in North America. In 2009, 10 percent
    of our oil production was subject to financial derivative
    hedges, increasing revenues by $45 million. In 2008,
    19 percent of our oil production was hedged, reducing oil
    revenue by $451 million. For the year-end status of our
    derivatives, please see Note 3 — Derivative
    Instruments and Hedging Activities in the Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements set forth in Part IV, Item 15 of
    this

Form 10-K.

While the market price received for crude oil varies among
    geographic areas, crude oil tends to trade at a global price.
    With the exception of Argentina, price movements for all types
    and grades of crude oil generally move in the same direction. In
    Australia, Apache continues to directly market all of our crude
    oil production into Australian domestic and international
    markets at prices indexed to Asian or Dated Brent benchmark
    crude oil prices, which typically track at or above NYMEX oil
    prices. In Argentina, we currently sell our oil in the domestic
    market. The Argentine government previously imposed a
    sliding-scale tax on oil exports, which significantly influences
    prices domestic buyers are willing to pay. Domestic oil prices
    are currently indexed to a $42 per barrel base price, subject to
    quality adjustments and local premiums, and producers realize a
    gradual increase or decrease as market prices deviate from the
    base price. In Tierra del Fuego, similar pricing formulas exist,
    but producers retain a value-added tax collected from buyers,
    effectively increasing price realizations by 21 percent.

Natural
    Gas Prices

Natural gas, which currently has a limited global transportation
    system, is subject to price variances based on local supply and
    demand conditions. The majority of our gas sales contracts are
    indexed to prevailing local market prices. Apache uses a variety
    of fixed-price contracts and derivatives to manage its exposure
    to fluctuations in natural gas prices, primarily in North
    America. In 2009 nine percent of our gas production was subject
    to financial derivative hedges, increasing revenues by
    $136 million. In 2008 20 percent of our gas production
    was hedged, reducing gas revenue by $8 million. For the
    year-end status of our derivatives, please see
    Note 3 — Derivative Instruments and Hedging
    Activities in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set
    forth in Part IV, Item 15 of this

Form 10-K.



Apache primarily sells natural gas into the North American
    market, where spot prices were cut in half compared to 2008, and
    various international markets, where our average contracted
    prices declined just 16 percent from 2008. Our primary
    markets include:

1) North America, which has a common market and where most
    of our gas is sold on a monthly or daily basis at either monthly
    or daily market prices.

2) Egypt, where the majority of our gas is sold to EGPC
    under an industry pricing formula indexed to Dated-Brent crude
    oil with a maximum gas price of $2.65 per MMbtu. On up to

100 MMcf/d

of gross production, there is no price cap for our gas under a
    legacy contract, which expires at the beginning of 2013. The
    region averaged $3.70 per Mcf in 2009.

3) Australia, which has a local market with mostly
    long-term, fixed-price contracts that are periodically adjusted
    for changes in the local consumer price index. Natural gas
    discoveries are increasingly dedicated to the LNG market, and
    supply is tightening for delivery to the domestic market. As a
    result, recent contracts, including for our Reindeer field, are
    substantially higher than historical levels.

4) Argentina, where we receive government-regulated pricing
    on a substantial portion of our production. The volumes we are
    required to sell at regulated prices are set by the government
    and vary with seasonal factors and industry category. During
    2009 we realized an average price of $1.07 per Mcf on
    government-regulated sales. The majority of the remaining
    volumes were sold at market-driven prices, which averaged $2.65
    per Mcf in 2009. Our overall average realized price for 2009 was
    $1.96 per Mcf, 22 percent higher than 2008 average realized
    prices and 68 percent higher than 2007 average realized
    prices.

During 2009 Apache received technical and commercial approval
    from the government of Argentina for four Gas Plus projects and
    technical approval for two more Gas Plus projects designed to
    encourage new supplies through development of tight sands and
    unconventional gas reserves. Under the Gas Plus program, Apache
    has the opportunity to supply

10 MMcf/d

from fields in the Neuquén Province at a price of $4.10 per
    MMBtu beginning January 1, 2010 for an initial one-year
    term. The Company also has a letter of intent for a contract to
    supply up to

50 MMcf/d

from fields in the Neuquén and Rio Negro Provinces for
    $5.00 per MMbtu beginning January 1, 2011. The gas
    supplying the Gas Plus program contracts is required to come
    from wells drilled in the projects’ approved fields and
    formations. We believe this type of program, coupled with
    changing market conditions, point to improving price
    realizations going forward.

Crude Oil
    Revenues

2009 vs. 2008

Crude oil accounted for
    48 percent of our equivalent production and 71 percent
    of oil and gas production revenues during 2009, compared to 48
    and 66 percent, respectively, for 2008. Crude oil revenues
    for 2009 totaled $6.1 billion, $2.1 billion lower than
    2008. The decrease was driven by a 32 percent decline in
    average realized prices (-$2.6 billion), mitigated by the
    impact of 10 percent production growth (+$528 million).

Worldwide production increased 24.9 Mb/d despite curtailed
    capital spending, which was 40 percent lower than 2008.
    Egypt’s oil production increased 38 percent or 25.4
    Mb/d on exploration successes in numerous concessions, most
    notably East Bahariya Extension, South Umbarka, Matruh,
    Northeast Abu Gharadig (NEAG) Extension and Khalda, waterflood
    projects and increased condensate from additional Qasr gas
    flowing through the new processing trains at the Salam Gas
    Plant. Australia’s production was up 1.5 Mb/d, as
    production was restored following completion of repairs at
    Varanus Island. North Sea production increased 1.5 Mb/d on
    strong drilling results, which offset the impact of unplanned
    downtime at the Bravo Platform, which lowered 2009 average daily
    oil production by 2.6 Mb/d. The Bravo Platform was down for most
    of the fourth quarter for pipeline repairs. Production declined
    2.0 Mb/d in Canada, .9 Mb/d in Argentina and .7 Mb/d in the
    U.S., as natural decline offset results from our curtailed 2009
    drilling programs.

2008 vs. 2007

Crude oil accounted for
    48 percent of our equivalent production and 66 percent
    of our oil and gas production revenues for 2008, compared to 44
    and 63 percent, respectively, for 2007. Crude oil revenues
    for



2008 totaled $8.2 billion, increasing $1.9 billion on
    a 28 percent increase in average realized prices
    (+$1.7 billion) and a two percent production growth
    (+$175 million).

Worldwide production was up 4.8 Mb/d, driven by increases in the
    North Sea and Egypt, which more than offset lower production in
    Australia, Canada and the U.S. Production in the North Sea
    was up 5.9 Mb/d (11 percent) on successful drilling and
    workover programs and a reduction in platform downtime.
    Egypt’s production increased 6.0 Mb/d (10 percent) on
    higher gross production from wells at El Diyur, Umbarka and East
    Bahariya and higher cost recovery from accelerated capital
    spending on a gas plant expansion. Argentine production was up
    1.0 Mb/d on increased production from new wells in Tierra del
    Fuego. Australia’s production was down 5.5 Mb/d
    (40 percent), split between shut-ins following a June 2008
    pipeline explosion at the Varanus Island gas processing and
    transportation hub and natural decline. Canada’s daily
    production was 1.6 Mb/d lower on natural decline and
    property divestitures, which more than offset drilling and
    recompletion activity. U.S. production declined 1.0 Mb/d.
    Production in the Gulf Coast region decreased 2.7 Mb/d; shut-in
    production related to hurricanes reduced annual production by
    6.9 Mb/d, offsetting net production growth from the regions
    drilling program. The Central region’s production increased
    1.7 Mb/d, driven by property acquisitions and drilling and
    recompletion activity.

Natural
    Gas Revenues

2009 vs. 2008

Natural gas accounted for
    50 percent of our equivalent production and 28 percent
    of our oil and gas production revenues during 2009, compared to
    50 and 32 percent, respectively, for 2008. Gas revenues for
    2009 totaled $2.4 billion, down $1.6 billion from
    2008. All of the natural gas revenue decline occurred in North
    America, as a 25 percent increase in international
    production more than offset a 16 percent decline in
    international price realizations.

Worldwide production grew

141 MMcf/d,

driven by a

99 MMcf/d

increase in Egypt’s net production and a

61 MMcf/d

increase in Australia. Egypt’s gas production was up
    38 percent on exploration successes at our Khalda and
    Matruh concessions and additional plant and pipeline capacity.
    Additional capacity provided by the combination of two new
    processing trains at the Salam Gas Plant and completion of a
    project to increase compression on the Northern Gas Pipeline
    allowed previously discovered wells in our Khalda Concession
    Qasr field to come online. The increased compression in the
    Northern Gas Pipeline also allowed increased throughput at the
    nearby Tarek plant and enabled us to begin producing previous
    discoveries at the Jade and Falcon fields in our Matruh
    concession. Australia’s 49 percent production increase
    was driven by production restorations following completion of
    repairs to the Varanus Island facility. Canada’s gas
    production increased

6 MMcf/d

from drilling and recompletion activities and a lower effective
    royalty rate, partially offset by natural decline. Argentine
    production decreased

11 MMcf/d

on natural decline and lower capital spending levels.
    U.S. daily production declined

14 MMcf/d.

Production in the Gulf Coast decreased

8 MMcf/d

as production shut-in for facility, rig and third-party downtime
    repairs reduced the 2009 production by

30 MMcf/d,

which more than offset net production gains from drilling
    results. Our Central region’s production declined

6 MMcf/d

primarily a result of the region’s curtailed drilling
    program, which was deferred until service costs fell in line
    with lower commodity prices. Most of the regions drilling
    activity occurred in the second half of the year.

2008 vs. 2007

Gas accounted for
    50 percent of our equivalent production and 32 percent
    of our oil and gas production revenues for 2008, compared to 53
    and 35 percent, respectively, for 2007. Natural gas
    revenues in 2008 totaled $4.0 billion and were
    $461 million higher than 2007, reflecting a 25 percent
    increase in realized natural gas prices (+$887 million),
    which more than offset 10 percent lower production
    (-$426 million).

Worldwide production decreased

179 MMcf/d.

Australian production was down

72 MMcf/d.

Volumes were impacted by production shut-in after an explosion
    on an export pipeline and resulting fire that damaged our
    processing facilities. U.S. production was

90 MMcf/d

lower. Gulf Coast daily production drove the lower
    U.S. production, with a decrease of

99 MMcf/d.

The region’s production was negatively impacted by
    properties shut-in for hurricanes

(55 MMcf/d)

and facility, rig and third-party downtime

(27 MMcf/d),

as well as the impact of a delay in the region’s drilling
    program caused by the hurricanes. Central region production
    increased

10 MMcf/d

on drilling and recompletion activities and from incremental
    volumes from Permian Basin properties acquired in March 2007.
    Canada’s production decreased

35 MMcf/d

on natural decline and property divestitures. Egypt’s gas
    production increased

23 MMcf/d

(10 percent) on successful recompletions at our Matruh
    concession, new wells



brought online at the NEAG concession and higher cost recovery
    from accelerated capital spending on gas plant expansion.

Operating
    Expenses

The table below presents a comparison of our expenses on an
    absolute dollar basis and an equivalent unit of production (boe)
    basis. Our discussion may reference expenses either on a boe
    basis, on an absolute dollar basis or both, depending on
    relevance. Amounts included in this table and in the discussion
    below are rounded to millions and may differ slightly from those

2009 vs. 2008

Recurring full-cost depletion
    expense decreased $156 million on an absolute dollar basis:
    $306 million on lower rate, partially offset by an increase
    of $150 million from higher production. Our full-cost
    depletion rate decreased $1.72 to $10.34 per boe. The decrease
    in rate was driven by a $5.33 billion non-cash write-down
    of the carrying value of our December 31, 2008, proved
    property balances in the U.S., U.K. North Sea, Canada and
    Argentina and a $2.82 billion non-cash write-down of the
    carrying value of our March 31, 2009, proved oil and gas
    property balances in the U.S. and Canada. The impact of the
    write-downs was partially offset by 2009 drilling and finding
    costs, which exceeded our historical cost basis.

Under the full-cost method of accounting, the Company is
    required to review the carrying value of its proved oil and gas
    properties each quarter on a

country-by-country

basis. Under these rules, capitalized costs of oil and gas
    properties, net of accumulated DD&A and deferred income
    taxes, may not exceed the present value of estimated



future net cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves,
    discounted 10 percent, net of related tax effects. Until
    December 31, 2009, the rules generally required pricing
    future net cash flows at the unescalated oil and gas prices in
    effect at the end of each fiscal quarter. Effective
    December 31, 2009, estimated future net cash flows is
    calculated using an unweighted arithmetic average of commodity
    prices in effect on the first day of each month in 2009, held
    flat for the life of the production, except where prices are
    defined by contractual arrangements. The rules also generally
    require the estimation of future costs using costs in effect at
    the end of each fiscal quarter. Write-downs required by these
    rules do not impact cash flow from operating activities.

2008 vs. 2007

During 2008, recurring full-cost
    depletion expense increased $150 million, $277 million
    on rate, partially offset by $127 million on lower volumes.
    Our full-cost depletion rate increased $1.28 to $12.06 per boe
    on drilling and finding costs that exceeded our historical cost
    basis. Higher industry-wide costs, which also impacted estimates
    of future development costs, were driven by increased demand for
    drilling services, a consequence of higher oil and gas prices.

Lease
    Operating Expenses

Lease operating expenses (LOE) include several components:
    direct operating costs, repair and maintenance, and workover
    costs.

Direct operating costs generally trend with commodity prices and
    are impacted by the type of commodity produced and the location
    of properties (i.e., offshore, onshore, remote locations, etc.).
    Fluctuations in commodity prices impact operating cost elements
    both directly and indirectly. They directly impact costs such as
    power, fuel, and chemicals, which are commodity-price based.
    Commodity prices also affect industry activity and demand, thus
    indirectly impacting the cost of items such as labor, boats,
    helicopters, materials and supplies. Oil, which contributed
    nearly half of our production, is inherently more expensive to
    produce than natural gas. Repair and maintenance costs are
    typically higher on offshore properties and in areas with remote
    plants and facilities. All production in Australia and the North
    Sea and nearly 90 percent from the U.S. Gulf Coast
    region comes from offshore properties. Workovers accelerate
    production; hence, activity generally increases with higher
    commodity prices. Foreign exchange rate fluctuations generally
    impact the Company’s LOE, with a weakening U.S. dollar
    adding to

per-unit

costs and a strengthening U.S. dollar lowering

per-unit

costs in our international regions.

2009 vs. 2008

Our 2009 LOE decreased
    $247 million from 2008. LOE per boe was down
    20 percent: 13 percent on lower cost and seven percent
    on higher production. The rate was impacted by the items below:

Gathering
    and Transportation

We generally sell oil and natural gas under two common types of
    agreements, both of which include a transportation charge. One
    is a netback arrangement, under which we sell oil or natural gas
    at the wellhead and collect a lower relative price to reflect
    transportation costs to be incurred by the purchaser. In this
    case, we record sales at the netback price received from the
    purchaser. Alternatively, we sell oil or natural gas at a
    specific delivery point, pay our own transportation to a
    third-party carrier and receive a price with no transportation
    deduction. In this case we record the separate transportation
    cost as gathering and transportation costs.

In the U.S., Canada and Argentina, we sell oil and natural gas
    under both types of arrangements. In the North Sea, we pay
    transportation charges to a third-party carrier. In Australia,
    oil and natural gas are sold under netback arrangements. In
    Egypt, our oil and natural gas production is primarily sold to
    EGPC under netback arrangements; however, we also export crude
    oil under both types of arrangements.

The following table presents gathering and transportation costs
    we paid directly to third-party carriers for each of the periods

2009 vs. 2008

Gathering and transportation
    costs decreased $14 million from 2008. On a per unit basis,
    gathering and transportation costs were down 16 percent:
    nine percent on lower costs and seven percent on higher
    production.

The decreases in the U.S. and Canada resulted from a
    decrease in both the volumes transported under arrangements
    where we pay costs directly to third-parties and in rates. North
    Sea costs were down on foreign exchange rates. Egypt costs
    increased as a result of retroactive terminal fees claimed by
    EGPC, partially offset by a decrease in export cargoes as more
    crude oil was purchased by EGPC for domestic use in the latter
    part of 2009.

2008 vs. 2007

Gathering and transportation
    costs for 2008 increased $20 million from 2007. On a per
    unit basis, gathering and transportation costs were up
    19 percent: 15 percent on higher costs and four
    percent on lower



production. The increase was driven primarily by higher
    transportation tariffs in Canada and an increase in Egyptian
    export volumes.

Taxes
    Other Than Income

Taxes other than income primarily comprises U.K. Petroleum
    Revenue Tax (PRT), severance taxes on properties onshore and in
    state or provincial waters off the coast of the U.S. and
    Australia and ad valorem taxes on properties in the
    U.S. and Canada. Severance taxes are generally based on a
    percentage of oil and gas production revenues, while the U.K.
    PRT is assessed on net receipts (revenues less qualifying
    operating costs and capital spending) from the Forties field in
    the U.K. North Sea. We are subject to a variety of other taxes
    including U.S. franchise taxes, Australian Petroleum
    Resources Rent tax and various Canadian taxes including:
    Freehold Mineral tax, Saskatchewan Capital tax and Saskatchewan
    Resources surtax. We also pay taxes on invoices and bank
    transactions in Argentina. The table below presents a comparison
    of these expenses:

2009 vs. 2008

Taxes other than income were
    $406 million lower than 2008. On a per unit basis, they
    decreased 46 percent: 41 percent on lower costs and
    five percent on higher production.

U.K. PRT was $312 million less than 2008 on a
    43 percent decrease in net profits, driven by lower oil
    revenues and lower operating and capital costs. The decrease in
    severance taxes resulted from lower taxable revenues in the
    U.S., consistent with the lower realized oil and natural gas
    prices relative to the prior year. The $16 million decrease
    in ad valorem taxes resulted from lower taxable valuations
    associated with decreases in oil and natural gas prices.

2008 vs. 2007

Taxes other than income for 2008
    were $387 million higher than 2007. On a per unit basis,
    they increased 72 percent: 65 percent on higher costs
    and seven percent on lower production.

U.K. PRT was $349 million more than 2007 on a
    98 percent increase in net profits, driven by higher oil
    revenues. The increase in severance taxes resulted from higher
    taxable revenues in the U.S., consistent with the higher
    realized oil and natural gas prices in the first nine months of
    the year. The $15 million increase in ad valorem taxes
    resulted from higher taxable valuations associated with
    increases in oil and natural gas prices at the time the taxes
    were assessed and a full year of taxes on the Permian Basin
    properties acquired in the first quarter of 2007.

General
    and Administrative Expenses

2009 vs. 2008

General and administrative
    (G&A) expenses were $55 million higher in 2009 than in
    2008. On a per boe basis, G&A expenses increased nine
    percent: 19 percent on higher costs, offset by a
    10 percent reduction on higher volumes. The increase was
    driven by $39 million of nonrecurring charges related to
    the retirement of our founder and former chairman and employee
    separation costs related to a 2009 workforce reduction.
    Stock-based compensation expense increased $34 million on
    the impact of higher stock appreciation relative to 2008 and new
    awards issued in 2009. Insurance premiums were up
    $9 million. These increases were partially offset by net
    reductions in other corporate expenses of $27 million.

2008 vs. 2007

G&A expenses were
    $14 million higher in 2008 compared to 2007. On a per boe
    basis, G&A expenses increased 10 percent: five percent
    on higher costs and five percent on lower volumes. The cost
    increase was driven by higher legal fees, especially in our
    international operations, increased incentive compensation



expenses and miscellaneous higher costs in several departments,
    partially offset by a decrease in stock-based compensation
    expenses related to cash-settled stock appreciation rights.

    $76 million from 2008. On a per unit basis, they increased
    33 percent: 46 percent on higher costs, offset by a
    13 percent reduction related to production growth.

The increase in cost is primarily the result of a
    $29 million increase in interest expense related to higher
    average outstanding debt balances, a $33 million reduction
    in capitalized interest related to lower unproved property
    balances and completion of several long-term construction
    projects, and a $12 million decrease in interest income on
    a lower average cash balance and lower interest rates.

2008 vs. 2007

Financing costs, net for 2008
    decreased $54 million from 2007. On a per unit basis, they
    decreased 21 percent: 25 percent on lower costs and
    four percent on production growth.

Interest expense was down $28 million on lower average
    outstanding debt balances. Capitalized interest was up primarily
    because of expenditures associated with long-term construction
    projects under development.

Provision
    for Income Taxes

2009 vs. 2008

There were no significant
    changes in statutory tax rates in the major jurisdictions in
    which the Company operates during 2009.

The provision for income taxes totaled $611 million in 2009
    compared to $220 million in 2008. Total taxes and the
    effective rates for each period were skewed by the magnitude of
    the taxes related to the 2009 and 2008 full-cost write-downs,
    the effect of currency exchange rates on our foreign deferred
    tax liabilities and other net tax settlements. Excluding these
    items, the 2009 and 2008 effective tax rates were comparable at
    39.83 percent and 39.58 percent, respectively.

2008 vs. 2007

There were no significant
    changes in statutory tax rates in the major jurisdictions in
    which the Company operates during 2008. In 2007 we saw a
    significant reduction to deferred income taxes resulting from
    Canadian tax rate reductions.

The provision for income taxes decreased $1.6 billion from
    2007 to $220 million, as income before taxes decreased
    80 percent as a result of the $5.3 billion in
    additional DD&A recorded in conjunction with the ceiling
    test write-down. The effective income tax rate for the year was
    23.6 percent compared to 39.8 percent in 2007. The
    2008 effective rate was impacted by the magnitude of the taxes
    related to the write-down, non-cash benefits related to the
    effect of the strengthening U.S. dollar on our foreign
    deferred tax liabilities and other net tax settlements. The 2007
    effective rate was impacted by a non-cash charge related to the
    effect of the weakening U.S. dollar on our foreign deferred
    tax liabilities. Partially offsetting this charge was an out of
    period benefit from Canadian federal tax rate reductions enacted
    in the second and fourth quarters of 2007. Excluding these
    items, the 2008 effective rate would have been comparable to the
    2007 effective rate.



Non-GAAP Measures

The Company makes reference to some measures in discussion of
    its financial and operating highlights that are not required by
    or presented in accordance with GAAP. Management uses these
    measures in assessing operating results and believes the
    presentation of these measures provides information useful in
    assessing the Company’s financial condition and results of
    operations. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered as
    alternatives to GAAP measures and may be calculated differently
    from, and therefore may not be comparable to, similarly-titled
    measures used at other companies.

Adjusted
    Earnings

To assess the Company’s operating trends and performance,
    management uses Adjusted Earnings, which is net income excluding
    certain items that management believes affect the comparability
    of operating results. Management believes this presentation may
    be useful to investors who follow the practice of some industry
    analysts who adjust reported company earnings for items that may
    obscure underlying fundamentals and trends. The reconciling
    items below are the types of items management excludes and
    believes are frequently excluded by analysts when evaluating the
    operating trends and comparability of the Company’s results.

Additional depletion (non-cash write-down of the carrying value
    of proved property) recorded in 2009 was $2,818,161 pre-tax, for
    which a deferred tax benefit of $836,763 was recognized. Also,
    additional depletion was recorded in 2008 totaling $5,333,821
    pre-tax, for which a deferred tax benefit of $1,686,076 was
    recognized. The tax effect of write-down of the carrying value
    of proved property (additional depletion) in both 2009 and 2008
    were calculated utilizing the statutory rates in effect in each
    country where a write-down occurred.



Significant
    Acquisitions and Divestitures

    Activity

During the second quarter of 2009 Apache announced the
    acquisition of nine Permian Basin oil and gas fields with then
    current net production of 3,500 barrels of oil equivalent
    per day from Marathon Oil Corporation for $187.4 million,
    subject to normal post-closing adjustments. Estimated reserves
    acquired in connection with the acquisition totaled
    19.5 MMboe. These long-lived fields fit well with
    Apache’s existing properties in the Permian Basin,
    particularly in Lea County, N.M., and will provide the Company
    many years of drilling opportunities. The effective date of the
    transaction was January 1, 2009.

    Activity

There was no major acquisition activity during 2008; however,
    the Company completed several divestiture transactions. On
    January 29, 2008, the Company completed the sale of its
    interest in Ship Shoal blocks 349 and 359 on the outer
    continental shelf of the Gulf of Mexico to W&T Offshore,
    Inc. for $116 million. On January 31, 2008, the
    Company completed the sale of non-strategic oil and gas
    properties in the Permian Basin of West Texas to Vanguard
    Permian, LLC for $78 million. On April 2, 2008, the
    Company completed the sale of non-strategic Canadian properties
    to Central Global Resources for C$112 million. These
    divestitures were subject to normal post-closing adjustments.

    Activity

U.S. Gulf Coast Farm-in

On
    September 6, 2007, Apache entered into an Exploration
    Agreement with various EnerVest Partnerships (“EVP”)
    for an initial term of four years whereby Apache committed to
    spend $30 million in qualified expenditures to explore,
    drill, produce and market hydrocarbons from specified
    undeveloped formations across 400,000 net acres in Central
    and East Texas. As of December 31, 2008, Apache had
    fulfilled the $30 million commitment.

U.S. Permian Basin

On March 29,
    2007, the Company closed its acquisition of controlling interest
    in 28 oil and gas fields in the Permian Basin of West Texas from
    Anadarko for $1 billion. Apache estimates that these fields
    had proved reserves of 57 million barrels (MMbbls) of
    liquid hydrocarbons and 78 billion cubic feet (Bcf) of
    natural gas as of year-end 2006. The Company funded the
    acquisition with debt. Apache and Anadarko entered into a
    joint-venture arrangement to effect the transaction. The Company
    entered into cash flow hedges for a portion of the crude oil and
    natural gas production.

Capital
    Resources and Liquidity

Net cash provided by operating activities (cash flows) is our
    primary source of liquidity. Our cash flows, both in the
    short-term and the long-term, are impacted by highly volatile
    oil and natural gas prices. Significant deterioration in
    commodity prices negatively impacts our revenues, earnings and
    cash flows, capital spending and potentially our liquidity if
    spending does not trend downward as well. Sales volumes and
    costs also impact cash flows; however, these historically have
    not been as volatile or as impactive as commodity prices in the
    short-term.

Our long-term operating cash flows are dependent on reserve
    replacement and the level of costs required for ongoing
    operations. Our business, as with other extractive industries,
    is a depleting one in which each barrel produced must be
    replaced or the Company and our reserves, a critical source of
    future liquidity, will shrink. Cash investments are required
    continuously to fund exploration and development projects and
    acquisitions, which are necessary to offset the inherent
    declines in production and proven reserves. Future success in
    maintaining and growing reserves and production is highly
    dependent on the success of our exploration and development
    activities or our ability to acquire additional reserves at
    reasonable costs. For a discussion of risk factors related to
    our business and operations, please see Part I, Item
    1A — Risk Factors.

We may also elect to utilize available committed borrowing
    capacity, access to both debt and equity capital markets, or
    proceeds from the occasional sale of nonstrategic assets for all
    other liquidity and capital resource needs. Apache’s
    ability to access the debt and equity capital markets is
    supported by its investment-grade credit ratings.



We believe the liquidity and capital resource alternatives
    available to Apache, as discussed in the Liquidity section of
    this Capital Resources and Liquidity discussion, combined with
    internally-generated cash flows, will be adequate to fund our
    short-term and long-term operations, including our capital
    spending program, repayment of debt maturities and any amount
    that may ultimately be paid in connection with contingencies.

Our primary uses of cash are exploration, development and
    acquisition of oil and gas properties, costs necessary to
    maintain ongoing operations, repayment of principal and interest
    on outstanding debt and payment of dividends. We fund our
    exploration and development activities primarily through net
    cash flows and budget our capital expenditures based on
    projected cash flows.

Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities

Net
    cash provided by operating activities (operating cash flows or
    cash flows) is our primary source of capital and liquidity and
    is impacted, both in the short-term and the long-term, by highly
    volatile oil and natural gas prices.

Our average natural gas price realizations fluctuated throughout
    2009, dipping from a high of $4.31 per Mcf in January to a low
    of $3.29 in September before increasing to $4.16 in December.
    Average realized prices in 2009 for natural gas fell
    45 percent to $3.69 per Mcf. Our average crude oil
    realizations saw a gradual increase from a low of $40.24 per
    barrel in January 2009, peaking in November at $75.09, before
    falling back to $71.13 in December. Crude oil prices averaged
    $59.85 per barrel, down 32 percent from 2008.

In order to manage the variability in cash flows, we increased
    our commodity hedge positions during the third and fourth
    quarters of 2009. At the end of 2009, we had hedged an average
    of just over 450,000 MMBtu per day of our projected 2010
    North American natural gas production. The volumes were
    primarily hedged using fixed-price swaps at an average price of
    approximately $5.65 per MMBtu. For perspective, the natural gas
    hedges represent 41 percent of fourth-quarter 2009 North
    America daily gas production; 24 percent worldwide. We also
    had an average of just over 35,000 b/d of oil production hedged
    for 2010. Crude oil production was primarily hedged using
    collars that had average floor and ceiling prices of
    approximately $65.00 and $80.80 per barrel, respectively. For
    perspective, the oil hedges represent 13 percent of
    fourth-quarter 2009 worldwide daily oil production. For
    additional information regarding our derivative contracts,
    please see Note 3 — Derivative Instruments and
    Hedging



Activities in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set
    forth in Part IV, Item 15 of this

Form 10-K.

For quantitative and qualitative information regarding our use
    of derivatives to manage commodity price risk, please see
    “Commodity Risk” in Part II, Item 7A of this

Form 10-K.

The factors affecting operating cash flows are largely the same
    as those that affect net earnings, with the exception of
    non-cash expenses such as DD&A, asset retirement obligation
    (ARO) accretion and deferred income tax expense.

For 2009 operating cash flows totaled $4.2 billion, down
    $2.8 billion from 2008. The primary driver of the reduction
    was a $3.8 billion decrease in oil and gas revenues, with
    the impact of lower commodity prices more than offsetting a nine
    percent increase in equivalent daily production. Also negatively
    impacting operating cash flows was the change in working capital
    from year-end 2008 to year-end 2009. These items were partially
    offset by the impact of a decline in cash-based expenses and
    lower current taxes.

For a detailed discussion of commodity prices, production, costs
    and expenses, please see “Results of Operations” in
    this Item 7. For additional detail on the changes in
    operating assets and liabilities and the non-cash expenses which
    do not impact net cash provided by operating activities, please
    see the Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows in the Consolidated
    Financial Statements set forth in Part IV, Item 15 of
    this

Form 10-K.

Short-term Investments

We occasionally invest
    in highly-liquid, short-term investments until funds are needed
    to further supplement our operating cash flows. At
    December 31, 2008, we had $792 million invested in
    U.S. Treasury securities with original maturities greater
    than three months but less than one year. These securities
    matured on April 2, 2009. None were held at
    December 31, 2009.

Project Financing Draw-downs

One of the
    Company’s Australian subsidiaries has a secured revolving
    syndicated credit facility for its Van Gogh and Pyrenees oil
    developments offshore Western Australia. The outstanding balance
    under the facility increased $250 million during the year
    to $350 million at December 31, 2009. For a more
    detailed discussion of this facility and information regarding
    our available committed borrowing capacity, please see
    “Liquidity” in this Item 7.

Capital Expenditures

We fund exploration and
    development activities primarily through operating cash flows
    and budget capital expenditures based on projected operating
    cash flows. Our operating cash flows, both in the short and long
    term, are impacted by highly volatile oil and natural gas
    prices, production levels, industry trends impacting operating
    expenses and our ability to continue to acquire or find
    high-margin reserves at competitive prices. For these reasons,
    management primarily relies on annual operating cash flow
    forecasts. Annual operating cash flow forecasts are revised
    monthly in response to changing market conditions and production
    projections. Apache routinely adjusts capital expenditure
    budgets in response to these adjusted operating cash flow
    forecasts and market trends in drilling and acquisitions costs.

Historically, we have used a combination of our operating cash
    flows, borrowings under the our lines of credit and commercial
    paper program and, from time to time, issues of public debt or
    common stock to fund significant acquisitions.

Exploration and Development (E&D)

As
    planned, our 2009 worldwide exploration and development
    (E&D) expenditures were 42 percent lower than 2008. We
    reduced 2009 expenditures in response to the precipitous decline
    in commodity prices and the uncertainties surrounding the
    financial crisis in late 2008 and early in 2009, seeking to keep
    capital spending in line with 2009 operating cash flows.
    Consequently, our E&D investments in all countries were
    down. E&D spending in North America was 54 percent
    less than the prior year as we lowered activity and concentrated
    on identifying drilling opportunities and building inventory.
    Investments in Egypt were $177 million lower than the prior
    year as we scaled back drilling activity in the Western Desert.
    However, Egypt’s percentage of worldwide E&D spending
    rose to 21 percent, up from 16 percent.
    Australia’s E&D expenditures were 32 percent
    below 2008 on lower drilling activity and lower investments in
    platforms and production facilities. North Sea E&D
    expenditures were $84 million lower as their investment
    requirements dropped following completion of several platform
    upgrades in 2008.

Acquisitions

We completed $310 million of
    acquisitions in 2009 compared to $150 million in 2008.
    Acquisition capital expenditures occur as attractive
    opportunities arise and, therefore, vary from year to year.

Asset Retirement Costs

In 2009 we recorded
    $293 million of additional future asset retirement costs
    associated with continued worldwide drilling programs,
    acquisition activity and further assessment of Hurricane Ike
    damages.

Gathering, Transmission and Processing Facilities
    (GTP)

We invested $305 million in GTP
    facilities in 2009 compared to $659 million in 2008. In
    Egypt we invested $151 million in gas processing facilities
    to alleviate



capacity constraints, which were restricting production. We also
    invested $69 million in Australia on GTP projects currently
    in process. In Canada, we invested $83 million in
    processing plants.

2010 Outlook

In order to preserve our strong
    balance sheet and financial flexibility, we plan to keep
    E&D capital spending generally in line with 2010 operating
    cash flows. While funds have been committed for certain 2010
    exploration drilling, long-lead development projects and FEED
    studies, the majority of our drilling and development projects
    are discretionary and subject to acceleration, deferral or
    cancellation as conditions warrant. We will closely monitor
    commodity prices, service cost levels and predicted operating
    cash and will adjust our exploration and development budgets
    accordingly. However, with $2.0 billion of cash on our
    balance sheet, we have the flexibility to utilize this surplus
    for acquisitions or drilling and development projects that might
    otherwise not progress. Because we typically revise our
    exploration and development capital budgets throughout the year
    depending on prices, projecting future expenditures is somewhat
    difficult. Our current 2010 capital budget includes exploration
    and development capital of approximately $6.0 to
    $6.5 billion, including GTP. We generally do not project
    capital estimates for acquisitions because they are specific
    discrete events whose occurrence and timing is unpredictable.
    Any acquisitions could be funded from operating cash flow,
    credit facilities, new equity, or a combination thereof.

Payments on Fixed-rate Notes

The
    $100 million Apache Finance Pty Ltd (Apache Finance
    Australia) 7.0-percent notes matured on March 15, 2009. The
    notes were repaid using existing cash balances.

Redemption of Preferred Stock

The Company
    redeemed with cash all of its 5.68-percent Cumulative
    Series B Preferred Stock on December 30, 2009. The
    100,000 outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock were
    redeemed at a redemption price of $1,000 per share, plus $9.47
    in accrued and unpaid dividends.

Dividends

The Company has paid cash dividends
    on its common stock for 45 consecutive years through 2009.
    Future dividend payments will depend on the Company’s level
    of earnings, financial requirements and other relevant factors.
    Common stock dividends paid during 2009 totaled
    $201 million, compared with $234 million in 2008 and
    $199 million in 2007. The 2008 period included a special
    non-recurring cash dividend of 10 cents per common share paid on
    March 18, 2008.

As discussed above, on December 30, 2009, the Company
    redeemed with cash all of its 5.68-percent Cumulative
    Series B Preferred Stock. As a result, the Company paid a
    total of $6.6 million of dividends, which includes two
    months of dividends accelerated because of the redemption. Also,
    in conjunction with the redemption of these shares, the Company
    was required to classify $1.6 million of the redemption
    amount ($100 million face value less $98.4 million
    carrying value) as preferred stock dividends. During 2008 and
    2007 the Company paid $5.7 million of dividends each year.

Our liquidity and financial position have not been materially
    affected by the ongoing turmoil in the credit markets. We
    believe that losses from non-performance are unlikely to occur;
    however, we are not able to predict sudden changes in the
    creditworthiness of the financial institutions with which we do
    business. Twenty-six of 27 banks with lending commitments to the
    Company have credit ratings of at least single-A, which in some
    cases is



based on government support. There is no assurance that the
    financial condition of these banks will not deteriorate or that
    the government guarantee will be maintained. We closely monitor
    the ratings of the 27 banks in our bank group. Having a large
    bank group allows the Company to mitigate the impact of any
    bank’s failure to honor its lending commitment.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

We had
    $2.05 billion in cash and cash equivalents at
    December 31, 2009. At December 31, 2009,
    $1.4 billion of cash was held by foreign subsidiaries and
    approximately $650 million was held by Apache Corporation
    and U.S. subsidiaries. The cash held by foreign
    subsidiaries is subject to additional U.S. income taxes if
    repatriated. Almost all of the cash is denominated in
    U.S. dollars and, at times, is invested in highly liquid,
    investment-grade securities, with maturities of three months or
    less at the time of purchase. We intend to use cash from our
    international subsidiaries to fund international projects. We
    held $1.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents at
    December 31, 2008.

Short-term Investments

We occasionally invest
    in highly-liquid, short-term investments. As needed, we may
    reduce such short-term investment balances to further supplement
    our operating cash flows. As of December 31, 2009, Apache
    held no short-term investments. At December 31, 2008, the
    Company had $792 million invested in obligations of the
    U.S. government with original maturities greater than three
    months but less than a year.

Restricted Cash

The Company classifies cash
    balances as restricted cash when it is restricted as to
    withdrawal or usage. As of December 31, 2008, we had
    approximately $14 million of property divestiture proceeds
    classified as restricted cash and held in escrow available for
    use in a like-kind exchange under Section 1031 of the
    U.S. federal income tax code. The Company expected to use
    these funds to purchase noncurrent assets. Accordingly, the
    restricted cash was classified as long-term at year-end.
    Subsequent to year-end 2008 the time limits pursuant to
    Section 1031 expired and the funds were transferred to
    cash. As of December 31, 2009, no cash balances were
    classified as restricted cash.

Debt

At December 31, 2009, outstanding
    debt, which consisted of notes, debentures, uncommitted bank
    lines and project financing, totaled $5.1 billion. Current
    debt includes $110 million of loans under the Apache PVG
    Pty Ltd credit facility due in 2010 and $7 million borrowed
    under uncommitted overdraft lines in Argentina. We have
    $100 million of debt maturing in 2011, $480 million
    maturing in 2012, $945 million maturing in 2013,
    $15 million maturing in 2014, and the remaining
    $3.4 billion maturing intermittently in years 2015 through
    2096.

Debt-to-Capitalization

Ratio

The Company’s

debt-to-capitalization

ratio as of December 31, 2009 was 24 percent.

Available Credit Facilities

As of
    December 31, 2009, the Company had unsecured committed
    revolving syndicated bank credit facilities totaling
    $2.3 billion, which mature in May 2013. The facilities
    consist of a $1.5 billion facility and a $450 million
    facility in the U.S., a $200 million facility in Australia
    and a $150 million facility in Canada. The
    $1.5 billion and the $450 million credit facilities
    (U.S. credit facilities) also allow the company to borrow
    under competitive auctions. The U.S. credit facilities are
    used to support Apache’s commercial paper program.

The financial covenants of the credit facilities require the
    Company to maintain a

debt-to-capitalization

ratio of not greater than 60 percent at the end of any
    fiscal quarter. The negative covenants include restrictions on
    the Company’s ability to create liens and security
    interests on our assets, with exceptions for liens typically
    arising in the oil and gas industry, purchase money liens and
    liens arising as a matter of law, such as tax and
    mechanics’ liens. The Company may incur liens on assets
    located in the U.S. and Canada of up to five percent of the
    Company’s consolidated assets, or approximately
    $1.4 billion as of December 31, 2009. There are no
    restrictions on incurring liens in countries other than
    U.S. and Canada. There are also restrictions on
    Apache’s ability to merge with another entity, unless the
    Company is the surviving entity, and a restriction on our
    ability to guarantee debt of entities not within our
    consolidated group.

There are no clauses in the facilities that permit the lenders
    to accelerate payments or refuse to lend based on unspecified
    material adverse changes (MAC clauses). The credit facility
    agreements do not have drawdown restrictions or prepayment
    obligations in the event of a decline in credit ratings.
    However, the agreements allow the lenders to accelerate payments
    and terminate lending commitments if Apache Corporation, or any
    of its U.S. or Canadian subsidiaries, defaults on any
    direct payment obligation in excess of $100 million or has
    any unpaid, non-



appealable judgment against it in excess of $100 million.
    The Company was in compliance with the terms of the credit
    facilities as of December 31, 2009.

At the Company’s option, the interest rate for the
    facilities is based on (i) the greater of (a) the JP
    Morgan Chase Bank prime rate or (b) the federal funds rate
    plus one-half of one percent or (ii) the London Inter-bank
    Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a margin determined by the
    Company’s senior long-term debt rating.

At December 31, 2009, the margin over LIBOR for committed
    loans was .19 percent on the $1.5 billion facility and
    .23 percent on the other three facilities. If the total
    amount of the loans borrowed under the $1.5 billion
    facility equals or exceeds 50 percent of the total facility
    commitments, then an additional .05 percent will be added
    to the margins over LIBOR. If the total amount of the loans
    borrowed under all of the other three facilities equals or
    exceeds 50 percent of the total facility commitments, then
    an additional .10 percent will be added to the margins over
    LIBOR. The Company also pays quarterly facility fees of
    .06 percent on the total amount of the $1.5 billion
    facility and .07 percent on the total amount of the other
    three facilities. The facility fees vary based upon the
    Company’s senior long-term debt rating.

One of the Company’s Australian subsidiaries has a secured
    revolving syndicated credit facility for its Van Gogh and
    Pyrenees oil developments offshore Western Australia. The
    facility provides for total commitments of up to
    $350 million, with availability determined by a borrowing
    base formula. The borrowing base was set at $350 million
    and will be redetermined after the fields commence production in
    the first half of 2010 and certain tests have been met, and
    semi-annually thereafter. The facility is secured by certain
    assets associated with the Van Gogh and Pyrenees oil
    developments, including the shares of stock of the
    Company’s subsidiary holding the assets. The Company agreed
    to guarantee the credit facility until project completion occurs
    pursuant to terms of the facility, which is expected in the
    fourth quarter of 2010. In the event project completion does not
    occur by December 31, 2010, pursuant to terms of the
    facility the lenders may require repayment of outstanding
    amounts in the first quarter of 2011. Interest is based on
    LIBOR, which may be subject to change under certain market
    disruption conditions, plus a margin of 1.00 percent
    pre-completion and 1.75 percent post-completion. The
    pre-completion margin increases to 1.125 percent in the
    event the Company’s ratings are downgraded to BBB+ or below
    by at least two major rating agencies. As of December 31,
    2009 and 2008, there was $350 million and
    $100 million, respectively, outstanding under the facility.
    The commitments under the facility will be reduced by scheduled
    increments every six months beginning June 30, 2010, with
    final maturity on March 31, 2014. The outstanding amount
    under this facility must not exceed $300 million on
    June 30, 2010 and $240 million on December 31,
    2010. Accordingly, $50 million and $60 million of the
    current balance will be repaid by June 30, 2010 and
    December 31, 2010, respectively and has been classified as
    current debt at December 31, 2009.

Commercial Paper Program

The Company has
    available a $1.95 billion commercial paper program, which
    generally enables Apache to borrow funds for up to 270 days
    at competitive interest rates. If the Company is unable to issue
    commercial paper following a significant credit downgrade or
    dislocation in the market, the Company’s U.S. credit
    facilities are available as a 100-percent backstop. The
    commercial paper program is fully supported by available
    borrowing capacity under U.S. committed credit facilities,
    which expire in 2013. As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, the
    Company had no outstanding commercial paper.

Credit Ratings

We receive debt ratings from
    the major credit rating agencies in the United States. Factors
    that may impact our credit ratings include debt levels, planned
    asset purchases or sales and near-term and long-term production
    growth opportunities. Liquidity, asset quality, cost structure,
    reserve mix and commodity pricing levels could also be
    considered by the rating agencies. Apache’s senior
    unsecured long-term debt is currently rated A3 by Moody’s,
    A- by Standard & Poor’s and A- by Fitch. The
    Company has received short-term debt ratings for its commercial
    paper program of

P-2

from
    Moody’s,

A-2

from
    Standard & Poor’s and F2 from Fitch. In September
    2009 Fitch downgraded Apache’s senior unsecured long-term
    debt and short-term debt from A and F1 to A- and F2,
    respectively. The current outlook at all three rating agencies
    is stable. A further ratings downgrade could adversely impact
    our ability to access debt markets in the future, increase the
    cost of future debt and potentially require the Company to post
    letters of credit in certain circumstances.



Contractual
    Obligations

We are subject to various financial obligations and commitments
    in the normal course of operations. These contractual
    obligations represent known future cash payments that we are
    required to make and relate primarily to long-term debt,
    operating leases, pipeline transportation commitments and
    international commitments. The Company expects to fund these
    contractual obligations with cash generated from operating
    activities.

The following table summarizes the Company’s contractual
    obligations as of December 31, 2009. For additional
    information regarding these obligations, please see
    Note 5 — Debt and Note 8 —
    Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements set forth in Part IV, Item 15 of
    this

Apache is also subject to various contingent obligations that
    become payable only if certain events or rulings were to occur.
    The inherent uncertainty surrounding the timing of and monetary
    impact associated with these events or rulings prevents any
    meaningful accurate measurement, which is necessary to assess
    settlements resulting from litigation. Apache’s management
    feels that it has adequately reserved for its contingent
    obligations, including approximately $27 million for
    environmental remediation and approximately $20 million for
    various contingent legal liabilities. For a detailed discussion
    of the Company’s environmental and legal contingencies,
    please see Note 8 — Commitments and Contingencies
    in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in
    Part IV, Item 15 of this

Form 10-K.

The Company also accrued approximately $63 million as of
    December 31, 2009, for an insurance contingency as a member
    of Oil Insurance Limited (OIL). This insurance co-op insures
    specific property, pollution liability and



other catastrophic risks of the Company. As part of its
    membership, the Company is contractually committed to pay a
    withdrawal premium if we elect to withdraw from OIL. Apache does
    not anticipate withdrawal from the insurance pool; however, the
    potential withdrawal premium is calculated annually based on
    past losses and the nature of our asset base. The liability
    reflecting this potential charge has been fully accrued.

Off-Balance
    Sheet Arrangements

Apache does not currently utilize any off-balance sheet
    arrangements with unconsolidated entities to enhance liquidity
    and capital resource positions.

Critical
    Accounting Policies and Estimates

Apache prepares its financial statements and the accompanying
    notes in conformity with accounting principles generally
    accepted in the United States of America, which require
    management to make estimates and assumptions about future events
    that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and
    the accompanying notes. Apache identifies certain accounting
    policies as critical based on, among other things, their impact
    on the portrayal of Apache’s financial condition, results
    of operations or liquidity and the degree of difficulty,
    subjectivity and complexity in their deployment. Critical
    accounting policies cover accounting matters that are inherently
    uncertain because the future resolution of such matters is
    unknown. Management routinely discusses the development,
    selection and disclosure of each of the critical accounting
    policies. Following is a discussion of Apache’s most
    critical accounting policies:

Reserve
    Estimates

In January 2009, the SEC issued Release

No. 33-8995,

“Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting” (Release

33-8995),

amending oil and gas reporting requirements under

Rule 4-10

of

Regulation S-X

and Industry Guide 2 in

Regulation S-K

and bringing full-cost accounting rules into alignment with the
    revised disclosure requirements. The new rules include changes
    to the pricing used to estimate reserves, the option to disclose
    probable and possible reserves, revised definitions for proved
    reserves, additional disclosures with respect to undeveloped
    reserves, and other new or revised definitions and disclosures.
    In January 2010, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)
    issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU)

No. 2010-03,

“Oil and Gas Reserve Estimation and Disclosures” (ASU

2010-03),

which amends Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 932,
    “Extractive Industries — Oil and Gas

”

to align the guidance with the changes made by the SEC. The
    Company adopted Release

33-8995

and
    the amendments to ASC Topic 932 resulting from ASU

2010-03

(collectively, the Modernization Rules) effective
    December 31, 2009.

Proved oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities of
    natural gas, crude oil, condensate and NGL’s that
    geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable
    certainty to be recoverable in future years from known
    reservoirs under existing conditions, operating conditions, and
    government regulations.

Proved undeveloped reserves include those reserves that are
    expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or
    from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is
    required for recompletion. Undeveloped reserves may be
    classified as proved reserves on undrilled acreage directly
    offsetting development areas that are reasonably certain of
    production when drilled, or where reliable technology provides
    reasonable certainty of economic producibility. Undrilled
    locations may be classified as having undeveloped reserves only
    if a development plan has been adopted indicating that they are
    scheduled to be drilled within five years, unless specific
    circumstances justify a longer time.

Despite the inherent imprecision in these engineering estimates,
    our reserves are used throughout our financial statements. For
    example, since we use the

units-of-production

method to amortize our oil and gas properties, the quantity of
    reserves could significantly impact our DD&A expense. Our
    oil and gas properties are also subject to a “ceiling”
    limitation based in part on the quantity of our proved reserves.
    Finally, these reserves are the basis for our supplemental oil
    and gas disclosures.

Reserves as of December 31, 2009 were calculated using an
    unweighted arithmetic average of commodity prices in effect on
    the first day of each month in 2009, held flat for the life of
    the production, except where prices are defined



by contractual arrangements. Reserves as of December 31,
    2008 and 2007 were estimated using prices in effect at the end
    of those years, in accordance with SEC guidance in effect prior
    to the issuance of the Modernization Rules.

Apache has elected not to disclose probable and possible
    reserves or reserve estimates in this filing.

Asset
    Retirement Obligation (ARO)

The Company has significant obligations to remove tangible
    equipment and restore land or seabed at the end of oil and gas
    production operations. Apache’s removal and restoration
    obligations are primarily associated with plugging and
    abandoning wells and removing and disposing of offshore oil and
    gas platforms. Estimating the future restoration and removal
    costs is difficult and requires management to make estimates and
    judgments because most of the removal obligations are many years
    in the future, and contracts and regulation often have vague
    descriptions of what constitutes removal. Asset removal
    technologies and costs are constantly changing, as are
    regulatory, political, environmental, safety and public
    relations considerations.

ARO associated with retiring tangible long-lived assets is
    recognized as a liability in the period in which the legal
    obligation is incurred and becomes determinable. The liability
    is offset by a corresponding increase in the underlying asset.
    The ARO is recorded at fair value, and accretion expense is
    recognized over time as the discounted liability is accreted to
    its expected settlement value.

Inherent in the present value calculation are numerous
    assumptions and judgments including the ultimate settlement
    amounts, inflation factors, credit adjusted discount rates,
    timing of settlement and changes in the legal, regulatory,
    environmental and political environments. To the extent future
    revisions to these assumptions impact the present value of the
    existing ARO liability, a corresponding adjustment is made to
    the oil and gas property balance.

Income
    Taxes

Our oil and gas exploration and production operations are
    currently located in six countries. As a result, we are subject
    to taxation on our income in numerous jurisdictions. We record
    deferred tax assets and liabilities to account for the expected
    future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in
    our financial statements and our tax returns. We routinely
    assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets. If we
    conclude that it is more likely than not that some portion or
    all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized under
    accounting standards, the tax asset would be reduced by a
    valuation allowance. Numerous judgments and assumptions are
    inherent in the determination of future taxable income,
    including factors such as future operating conditions
    (particularly as related to prevailing oil and gas prices).

The Company regularly assesses and, if required, establishes
    accruals for tax contingencies that could result from
    assessments of additional tax by taxing jurisdictions in
    countries where the Company operates. Tax reserves have been
    established and include any related interest, despite the belief
    by the Company that certain tax positions meet certain
    legislative, judicial and regulatory requirements. These
    reserves are subject to a significant amount of judgment and are
    reviewed and adjusted on a periodic basis in light of changing
    facts and circumstances considering the progress of ongoing tax
    audits, case law and any new legislation. The Company believes
    that the reserves established are adequate in relation to the
    potential for any additional tax assessments.

ITEM 7A.

QUANTITATIVE
    AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

The primary objective of the following information is to provide
    forward-looking quantitative and qualitative information about
    our exposure to market risk. The term market risk relates to the
    risk of loss arising from adverse changes in oil, gas and NGL
    prices, interest rates, foreign currency and adverse
    governmental actions. The disclosures are not meant to be
    precise indicators of expected future losses, but rather
    indicators of reasonably possible losses. The forward-looking
    information provides indicators of how we view and manage our
    ongoing market risk exposures.

Commodity
    Risk

The Company’s revenues, earnings, cash flow, capital
    investments and, ultimately, future rate of growth are highly
    dependent on the prices we receive for our crude oil, natural
    gas and NGLs, which have historically been very



volatile due to unpredictable events such as economical growth
    or retraction, weather and climate. Our average monthly crude
    oil realizations saw a gradual increase from a low of $40.24 per
    barrel in January 2009, peaking in November at $75.09, before
    falling back to $71.13 in December. In 2009 crude oil prices
    averaged $59.85 per barrel down 32 percent from 2008. Our
    average monthly natural gas price realizations fluctuated
    throughout 2009, dipping from a high of $4.31 per Mcf in January
    to a low of $3.29 in September before increasing to $4.16 in
    December. Average realized prices in 2009 for natural gas fell
    45 percent to $3.69 per Mcf.

For 2009 approximately nine percent of our natural gas
    production was subject to financial derivative hedges. In the
    third and fourth quarters of 2009, we entered into additional
    hedges on our 2010 projected North American gas production. For
    perspective, these 2010 hedges represent approximately
    24 percent of our fourth-quarter 2009 worldwide daily gas
    volumes and approximately 41 percent of our fourth-quarter
    2009 North American daily gas production.

For 2009 approximately 10 percent of our crude oil
    production was subject to financial derivative hedges. In the
    third and fourth quarters of 2009, we entered into additional
    crude oil hedges on our 2010 projected production. For
    perspective, these 2010 hedges represent approximately
    13 percent of our fourth-quarter 2009 worldwide daily oil
    volumes.

Apache may use futures contracts, swaps, options and fixed-price
    physical contracts to hedge its commodity prices. Realized gains
    or losses from the Company’s price-risk management
    activities are recognized in oil and gas production revenues
    when the associated production occurs. Apache does not hold or
    issue derivative instruments for trading purposes.

On December 31, 2009, the Company had open natural gas
    derivative hedges in an asset position with a fair value of
    $56 million. A 10 percent increase in natural gas
    prices would reduce the fair value by approximately
    $128 million, while a 10 percent decrease in prices
    would increase the fair value by approximately
    $127 million. The Company also had open oil derivatives in
    a liability position with a fair value of $322 million. A
    10 percent increase in oil prices would increase the
    liability by approximately $202 million, while a
    10 percent decrease in prices would decrease the liability
    by approximately $190 million. These fair value changes
    assume volatility based on prevailing market parameters at
    December 31, 2009. For notional volumes and terms
    associated with the Company’s derivative contracts, please
    see Note 3 — Derivative Instruments and Hedging
    Activities in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set
    forth in Part IV, Item 15 of this

Form 10-K.

Apache conducts its risk management activities for its
    commodities under the controls and governance of its risk
    management policy. The Risk Management Committee, comprising the
    President (principal financial officer), General Counsel,
    Treasurer and other key members of Apache’s management,
    approve and oversee these controls, which have been implemented
    by designated members of the treasury department. The treasury
    and accounting departments also provide separate checks and
    reviews on the results of hedging activities. Controls for our
    commodity risk management activities include limits on credit,
    limits on volume, segregation of duties, delegation of authority
    and a number of other policy and procedural controls.

Interest
    Rate Risk

On December 31, 2009, the Company’s debt with fixed
    interest rates represented approximately 93 percent of
    total debt. As a result, the interest expense on approximately
    seven percent of Apache’s debt will fluctuate based on
    short-term interest rates. A 10 percent change in floating
    interest rates on year-end floating debt balances would change
    annual interest expense by approximately $537,000.

Foreign
    Currency Risk

The Company’s cash flow stream relating to certain
    international operations is based on the U.S. dollar
    equivalent of cash flows measured in foreign currencies. In
    Australia, oil production is sold under U.S. dollar
    contracts, and gas production is sold largely under fixed-price
    Australian dollar contracts. Approximately half the costs
    incurred for Australian operations are paid in
    U.S. dollars. In Canada, the majority of oil and gas
    production is sold under Canadian dollar contracts. The majority
    of the costs incurred are paid in Canadian dollars. The North
    Sea production is sold under U.S. dollar contracts, and the
    majority of costs incurred are paid in British pounds. In Egypt,
    all oil and gas production is sold under U.S. dollar
    contracts, and the majority of the costs incurred are
    denominated in U.S. dollars. Argentine revenues and
    expenditures are largely denominated in U.S. dollars but



converted into Argentine pesos at the time of payment. Revenue
    and disbursement transactions denominated in Australian dollars,
    Canadian dollars, British pounds, Egyptian pounds and Argentine
    pesos are converted to U.S. dollar equivalents based on
    average exchange rates during the period.

Foreign currency gains and losses also arise when monetary
    assets and monetary liabilities denominated in foreign
    currencies are translated at the end of each month. Currency
    gains and losses are included as either a component of
    “Other” under “Revenues and Other” or, as is
    the case when we re-measure our foreign tax liabilities, as a
    component of the Company’s provision for income tax expense
    on the Statement of Consolidated Operations. A 10 percent
    strengthening or weakening of the Australian dollar, Canadian
    dollar, British pound, Egyptian pound or Argentine peso as of
    December 31, 2009, would result in a foreign currency net
    loss or gain, respectively, of approximately $95 million.

Forward-Looking
    Statements and Risk

This report includes “forward-looking statements”
    within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of
    1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities

CONTROLS
    AND PROCEDURES

Disclosure
    Controls and Procedures

G. Steven Farris, the Company’s Chairman and Chief
    Executive Officer, in his capacity as principal executive
    officer, and Roger B. Plank, the Company’s President, in
    his capacity as principal financial officer, evaluated the
    effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of
    December 31, 2009, the end of the period covered by this
    report. Based on that evaluation and as of the date of that
    evaluation, these officers concluded that the Company’s
    disclosure controls and procedures were effective, providing
    effective means to ensure that the information we are required
    to disclose under applicable laws and regulations is recorded,
    processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
    specified in the Commission’s rules and forms and
    accumulated and communicated to our management, including our
    principal executive officer and principal financial officer, to
    allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. We also
    made no changes in internal controls over financial reporting
    during the quarter ending December 31, 2009, that have
    materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
    affect, the Company’s internal control over financial
    reporting.

We periodically review the design and effectiveness of our
    disclosure controls, including compliance with various laws and
    regulations that apply to our operations both inside and outside
    the United States. We make modifications to improve the design
    and effectiveness of our disclosure controls and may take other
    corrective action, if our reviews identify deficiencies or
    weaknesses in our controls.

REPORT OF
    MANAGEMENT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL
    REPORTING

Management of the Company is responsible for the preparation and
    integrity of the consolidated financial statements appearing in
    this annual report on

Form 10-K.

The financial statements were prepared in conformity with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
    and include amounts that are based on management’s best
    estimates and judgments.

Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and
    maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting
    as such term is defined in

Rule 13a-15(f)

under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act). The
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting is
    designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the
    consolidated financial statements. Our internal control over
    financial reporting is supported by a program on internal audits
    and appropriate reviews by management, written policies and
    guidelines, careful selection and training of qualified
    personnel and a written code of business conduct adopted by our
    Company’s board of directors, applicable to all Company
    directors and all officers and employees of our Company and
    subsidiaries.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements and
    even when determined to be effective, can only provide
    reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement
    preparation and presentation. Also, projections of any
    evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the
    risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in
    conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or
    procedures may deteriorate.

Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s
    internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2009. In making this assessment, management
    used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in

Internal
    Control — Integrated Framework.

Based on our
    assessment, management believes that the Company maintained
    effective internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2009.

The Company’s independent auditors, Ernst & Young
    LLP, a registered public accounting firm, are appointed by the
    Audit Committee of the Company’s board of directors.
    Ernst & Young LLP have audited and reported on the
    consolidated financial statements of Apache Corporation and
    subsidiaries, and the effectiveness of the Company’s
    internal control over financial reporting. The reports of the
    independent auditors follow this report on pages F-2 and F-3.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Apache Corporation:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    Apache Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2009
    and 2008, and the related consolidated statements of operations,
    shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three
    years in the period ended December 31, 2009. These
    financial statements are the responsibility of the
    Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
    opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
    present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
    financial position of Apache Corporation and subsidiaries at
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the consolidated results of
    their operations and their cash flows for each of the three
    years in the period ended December 31, 2009, in conformity
    with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial
    statements, in 2009, the Company adopted SEC Release

33-8995

and
    the amendments to ASC Topic 932, “Extractive
    Industries — Oil and Gas,” resulting from ASU

2010-03

(collectively, the Modernization Rules).

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States),
    Apache Corporation’s internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2009, based on criteria
    established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by
    the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission and our report dated February 26, 2010,
    expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Apache Corporation:

We have audited Apache Corporation and subsidiaries’
    internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2009, based on criteria established in
    Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
    (the COSO criteria). Apache Corporation and subsidiaries’
    management is responsible for maintaining effective internal
    control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the
    effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting
    included in the accompanying Management’s Report on
    Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is
    to express an opinion on the company’s internal control
    over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
    that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the
    design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
    the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we
    considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
    audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Apache Corporation and subsidiaries maintained,
    in all material respects, effective internal control over
    financial reporting as of December 31, 2009, based on the
    COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated balance sheets of Apache Corporation and
    subsidiaries as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the
    related consolidated statements of operations,
    shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three
    years in the period ended December 31, 2009 of Apache
    Corporation and subsidiaries, and our report dated
    February 26, 2010, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

General Accounting Description

Nature
    of Operations

Apache Corporation (Apache or the Company) is an independent
    energy company that explores for, develops and produces natural
    gas, crude oil and natural gas liquids. The Company’s North
    American exploration and production activities are divided into
    two United States (U.S.) operating regions (Central and Gulf
    Coast) and a Canadian region. Approximately 62 percent
    (unaudited) of the Company’s proved reserves are located in
    North America. Outside of North America, Apache has exploration
    and production interests in Egypt, offshore Western Australia,
    offshore the United Kingdom in the North Sea (North Sea) and
    Argentina. Apache also has exploration interests on the Chilean
    side of the island of Tierra del Fuego.

1.

SUMMARY
    OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Accounting policies used by Apache and its subsidiaries reflect
    industry practices and conform to accounting principles
    generally accepted in the U.S. (GAAP). Certain
    reclassifications have been made to prior periods to conform to
    the current-year presentation. Significant policies are
    discussed below.

Principles
    of Consolidation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the
    accounts of Apache and its subsidiaries after elimination of
    intercompany balances and transactions. The Company consolidates
    all investments in which the Company, either through direct or
    indirect ownership, has more than a 50-percent voting interest.
    In addition, Apache consolidates all variable interest entities
    where it is the primary beneficiary. The Company’s interest
    in oil and gas exploration and production ventures and
    partnerships are proportionately consolidated.

Use of
    Estimates

Preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP
    requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
    affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure
    of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
    financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and
    expenses during the reporting period. The Company bases its
    estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions
    that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the
    results of which form the basis for making judgments about
    carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily
    apparent from other sources. Apache evaluates its estimates and
    assumptions on a regular basis. Actual results may differ from
    these estimates and assumptions used in preparation of its
    financial statements and changes in these estimates are recorded
    when known. Significant estimates with regard to these financial
    statements include the estimate of proved oil and gas reserves
    and related present value estimates of future net cash flows
    therefrom (see Note 13 — Supplemental Oil and Gas
    Disclosures), asset retirement obligations and income taxes.

Cash
    Equivalents

The Company considers all highly liquid short-term investments
    with a maturity of three months or less at time of purchase to
    be cash equivalents. These investments are carried at cost,
    which approximates fair value. As of December 31, 2009 and
    2008, Apache had $2.0 billion and $1.2 billion,
    respectively, of cash and cash equivalents.

Marketable
    Securities

The Company accounts for investments in debt and equity
    securities in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards
    Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC, also known
    collectively as the Codification) Topic 320,
    “Investments — Debt and Equity Securities.”
    Investments in debt securities classified as “held to
    maturity” are recorded at cost. As of December 31,
    2009, Apache held no marketable securities. At December 31,
    2008, the Company had $792 million invested in obligations
    of the U.S. government with original maturities greater
    than three months but less than a year.

    CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Allowance
    for Doubtful Accounts

The Company routinely assesses the collectibility of all
    material trade and other receivables. Many of Apache’s
    receivables are from joint interest owners on properties Apache
    operates. Thus, Apache may have the ability to withhold future
    revenue disbursements to recover any non-payment of these joint
    interest billings. Generally, the Company’s crude oil and
    natural gas receivables are collected within two months. The
    Company accrues a reserve on a receivable when, based on the
    judgment of management, it is probable that a receivable will
    not be collected and the amount of any reserve may be reasonably
    estimated. As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, the Company
    had an allowance for doubtful accounts of $38 million and
    $33 million, respectively.

While Apache experienced a decline in the timeliness of receipts
    from the Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation (EGPC) for oil
    and gas sales in recent years, the Company saw significant
    improvement in collections throughout 2009.

Inventories

Inventories consist principally of tubular goods and equipment,
    stated at the weighted-average cost, and oil produced but not
    sold, stated at the lower of cost or market.

Oil
    and Gas Property

The Company uses the full-cost method of accounting for its
    exploration and development activities. Under this method of
    accounting, the cost of both successful and unsuccessful
    exploration and development activities are capitalized as
    property and equipment. This includes any internal costs that
    are directly related to exploration and development activities,
    including salaries and benefits, but does not include any costs
    related to production, general corporate overhead or similar
    activities. Historically, total capitalized internal costs in
    any given year have not been material to total oil and gas costs
    capitalized in such year. Apache capitalized $219 million,
    $236 million and $208 million of these internal costs
    in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Proceeds from the sale or
    disposition of oil and gas properties are accounted for as a
    reduction to capitalized costs unless a significant portion
    (greater than 25 percent) of the Company’s reserve
    quantities in a particular country are sold, in which case a
    gain or loss is recognized in income.

In December 2007 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)
    issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS)
    No. 141 (Revised), “Business Combinations”
    (SFAS No. 141(R)), which was amended by FASB Staff
    Position (FSP) FAS No. 141(R)-1 in April 2009. This
    guidance has been primarily codified into the FASB Accounting
    Standards Codification (ASC, also known collectively as the
    Codification) Topic 805, “Business Combinations.” The
    guidance broadens the definition of a business combination to
    include all transactions or other events in which control of one
    or more businesses is obtained. Further, the standard
    establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer
    recognizes and measures in its financial statements the
    identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, any
    non-controlling interests in the acquiree and the goodwill
    acquired. The statement requires the acquiring entity in a
    business combination to recognize the fair value of all the
    assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction. It
    also modifies disclosure requirements. Apache adopted this
    statement effective January 1, 2009. However, since the
    Company did not close any material business combinations during
    the 2009, the adoption had a negligible impact on the
    Company’s consolidated financial statements.

Costs
    Excluded

Oil and gas unevaluated properties and properties under
    development include costs that are excluded from costs being
    depreciated or amortized. These costs represent investments in
    unproved properties and major development projects in which the
    Company owns a direct interest. Apache excludes these costs on a

country-by-country

basis until proved reserves are found, until it is determined
    that the costs are impaired, or until major development projects
    are placed in service. All costs excluded are reviewed at least
    quarterly to determine if

F-9


APACHE
    CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

impairment has occurred. In countries where proved reserves
    exist, exploratory drilling costs associated with dry holes are
    transferred to proved properties immediately upon determination
    that a well is dry and amortized accordingly. Also, geological
    and geophysical (G&G) costs not associated with specific
    properties are recorded to proved property. For international
    operations where a reserve base has not yet been established,
    impairments are charged to earnings and are determined through
    an evaluation considering, among other factors, seismic data,
    requirements to relinquish acreage, drilling results, remaining
    time in the commitment period, remaining capital plan and
    political, economic and market conditions.

Ceiling
    Test

Under the existing full-cost method of accounting, a ceiling
    test is performed each quarter. The test establishes a limit
    (ceiling), on a

country-by-country

basis, on the book value of oil and gas properties. The
    capitalized costs of proved oil and gas properties, net of
    accumulated depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD&A)
    and the related deferred income taxes, may not exceed this
    “ceiling.” The ceiling limitation is the estimated
    after-tax future net cash flows from proved oil and gas
    reserves, excluding future cash outflows associated with
    settling asset retirement obligations accrued on the balance
    sheet. In January 2009, the SEC issued Release

No. 33-8995,

“Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting” (Release

33-8995),

amending oil and gas reporting requirements under

Rule 4-10

of

Regulation S-X

and Industry Guide 2 in

Regulation S-K

and bringing full-cost accounting rules into alignment with the
    revised disclosure requirements. In January 2010, the FASB
    issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU)

No. 2010-03,

“Oil and Gas Reserve Estimation and Disclosures” (ASU

2010-03),

which amends ASC Topic 932, “Extractive
    Industries — Oil and Gas” (ASC Topic 932) to
    align the guidance with the changes made by the SEC. The Company
    adopted Release

33-8995

and
    the amendments to ASC Topic 932 resulting from ASU

2010-03

(collectively, the Modernization Rules) effective
    December 31, 2009.

The estimate of after-tax future net cash flows as of
    December 31, 2009 is calculated using a discount rate of
    10 percent per annum,

end-of-period

costs, and an unweighted arithmetic average of commodity prices
    in effect on the first day of each month in 2009, held flat for
    the life of the production, except where prices are defined by
    contractual arrangements. Prior to adoption of the Modernization
    Rules, effective in the fourth quarter of 2009, estimated
    after-tax future net cash flows were calculated using commodity
    prices in effect at the end of each quarter. If capitalized
    costs exceed this ceiling, the excess is charged to expense and
    reflected as additional DD&A. Excluding the effect of cash
    flow hedges in calculating the ceiling limitation at
    December 31, 2009, capitalized costs still would not have
    exceeded the ceiling limitation. See Note 13 —
    Supplemental Oil and Gas Disclosures for a discussion on
    calculation of estimated future net cash flows.

Under the existing full-cost accounting rules, the Company
    recorded a $5.3 billion ($3.6 billion net of tax)
    non-cash write-down of the carrying value of the Company’s
    U.S., U.K. North Sea, Canadian and Argentine proved oil and gas
    properties on December 31, 2008, as a result of the ceiling
    test limitations. Under those same rules, which were in effect
    for the first three quarterly reporting periods in 2009, the
    Company recorded an additional $2.82 billion
    ($1.98 billion net of tax) non-cash write-down of the
    carrying value of the Company’s U.S. and Canadian
    proved oil and gas properties on March 31, 2009. These
    write-downs are reflected as additional DD&A expense in the
    accompanying Statement of Consolidated Operations. Excluding the
    effects of cash flow hedges in calculating the ceiling
    limitation, the write-downs as of December 31, 2008, and
    March 31, 2009 would have been $5.9 billion ($4.0 billion net of
    tax) and $3.4 billion ($2.4 billion net of tax), respectively.

Gathering,
    Transmission and Processing Facilities

The Company assesses the carrying amount of its gathering,
    transmission and processing facilities annually and whenever
    events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying
    amount may not be recoverable. If the carrying amount of these
    facilities is less than the sum of the undiscounted cash flows
    expected to result from their use and eventual disposition, an
    impairment loss is recorded through a charge to expense.
    Gathering, transmission

F-10


APACHE
    CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

and processing facilities totaled $3.2 billion and
    $2.9 billion at December 31, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively. No impairment of gathering, transmission and
    processing facilities was recognized during 2009, 2008 or 2007.

Depreciation,
    Depletion and Amortization

DD&A of oil and gas properties is calculated quarterly, on
    a

country-by-country

basis, using the Units of Production Method (UOP). The UOP
    calculation, in simplest terms, multiplies the percentage of
    estimated proved reserves produced each quarter times the costs
    of those reserves. The result is to recognize expense at the
    same pace that the reservoirs are actually depleting. The
    amortization base in the UOP calculation includes the sum of
    proved property costs net of accumulated DD&A, estimated
    future development costs (future costs to access and develop
    reserves) and asset retirement costs which are not already
    included in oil and gas property, less related salvage value.

Gas gathering, transmission and processing facilities, buildings
    and equipment are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the
    estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from three to
    20 years. Accumulated depreciation for these assets totaled
    $1 billion and $870 million at December 31, 2009
    and 2008, respectively.

Asset
    Retirement Obligation

The initial estimated asset retirement obligation (ARO) related
    to properties is recognized as a liability, with an associated
    increase in property and equipment for the asset retirement
    cost. Accretion expense is recognized over the estimated
    productive life of the related assets. If the fair value of the
    estimated ARO changes, an adjustment is recorded to both the ARO
    and the asset retirement cost. Revisions in estimated
    liabilities can result from changes in estimated inflation
    rates, changes in service and equipment costs and changes in the
    estimated timing of settling ARO.

Capitalized
    Interest

Interest is capitalized on oil and gas investments in unproved
    properties and exploration and development activities that are
    in progress. Major construction projects also qualify for
    interest capitalization up until the time the assets are ready
    for service. Capitalized interest is calculated by multiplying
    the Company’s weighted-average interest rate on debt by the
    amount of qualifying costs. For projects under construction that
    carry their own financing, interest is calculated using the
    interest rate related to the project financing. Interest and
    related costs are capitalized until each project is complete.
    Capitalized interest cannot exceed gross interest expense.
    Capitalized interest associated with unproved properties is
    transferred to proved properties along with the associated
    unproved property balance. As major construction projects are
    completed, the associated capitalized interest is amortized over
    the useful life of the related asset. Capitalized interest
    totaled $61 million, $94 million and $76 million
    in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

Goodwill

Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of an
    entity over the estimated fair value of the assets acquired and
    liabilities assumed. The Company assesses the carrying amount of
    goodwill by testing the goodwill for impairment annually and
    when impairment indicators arise. The impairment test requires
    allocating goodwill and all other assets and liabilities to
    assigned reporting units. The fair value of each unit is
    determined and compared to the book value of the reporting unit.
    If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the book
    value, including goodwill, then goodwill is written down to the
    implied fair value of the goodwill through a charge to expense.
    Goodwill totaled $189 million at December 31, 2009 and
    2008, with approximately $103 million and $86 million
    recorded in Canada and Egypt, respectively. Each country was
    assessed as a reporting unit. No impairment of goodwill was
    recognized during 2009, 2008 or 2007.

F-11


APACHE
    CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Accounts
    Payable

Included in accounts payable at December 31, 2009 and 2008,
    are liabilities of approximately $98 million and
    $164 million, respectively, representing the amount by
    which checks issued, but not presented to the Company’s
    banks for collection, exceeded balances in applicable bank
    accounts.

Commitments
    and Contingencies

Accruals for loss contingencies arising from claims,
    assessments, litigation, environmental and other sources are
    recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred
    and the amount can be reasonably estimated. These accruals are
    adjusted as additional information becomes available or
    circumstances change.

Revenue
    Recognition and Imbalances

Oil and gas revenues are recognized when production is sold to a
    purchaser at a fixed or determinable price, when delivery has
    occurred and title has transferred, and if collectibility of the
    revenue is probable. Cash received relating to future revenues
    is deferred and recognized when all revenue recognition criteria
    are met.

Apache uses the sales method of accounting for gas production
    imbalances. The volumes of gas sold may differ from the volumes
    to which Apache is entitled based on its interests in the
    properties. These differences create imbalances that are
    recognized as a liability only when the properties’
    estimated remaining reserves net to Apache will not be
    sufficient to enable the under-produced owner to recoup its
    entitled share through production. The Company’s recorded
    liability is generally reflected in other non-current
    liabilities. No receivables are recorded for those wells where
    Apache has taken less than its share of production. Gas
    imbalances are reflected as adjustments to estimates of proved
    gas reserves and future cash flows in the unaudited supplemental
    oil and gas disclosures.

Apache markets its own U.S. natural gas production. As the
    Company’s production fluctuates because of operational
    issues, it is occasionally necessary to purchase gas
    (third-party gas) to fulfill its sales obligations and
    commitments. Both the costs and sales proceeds of this
    third-party gas are reported on a net basis in oil and gas
    production revenues. The costs of third-party gas netted against
    the related sales proceeds totaled $34 million,
    $56 million and $123 million, for 2009, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively.

The Company’s Egyptian operations are conducted pursuant to
    production sharing contracts under which contractor partners pay
    all operating and capital costs for exploring and developing the
    concessions. A percentage of the production, generally up to
    40 percent, is available to contractor partners to recover
    these operating and capital costs over contractually defined
    terms. The balance of the production is split among the
    contractor partners and the EGPC on a contractually defined
    basis. Cost recovery is reflected in revenue.

Derivative
    Instruments and Hedging Activities

Apache periodically enters into derivative contracts to manage
    its exposure to commodity price risk. These derivative
    contracts, which are generally placed with major financial
    institutions that the Company believes are minimal credit risks,
    may take the form of forward contracts, futures contracts, swaps
    or options. The oil and gas reference prices, upon which the
    commodity derivative contracts are based, reflect various market
    indices that have a high degree of historical correlation with
    actual prices received by the Company for its oil and gas
    production.

Apache accounts for its derivative instruments in accordance
    with ASC Topic 815, “Derivatives and Hedging,” which
    requires that all derivative instruments, other than those that
    meet the normal purchases and sales exception, be recorded on
    the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at
    fair value (which is generally based on information obtained
    from an independent investment banking firm). Changes in fair
    value are recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge
    accounting criteria are met. Hedge accounting treatment allows
    unrealized gains and losses on cash flow hedges to be deferred
    in other comprehensive income. Realized gains and losses from
    the Company’s oil and gas cash flow hedges, including
    terminated contracts, are generally recognized in oil and gas

F-12


APACHE
    CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

production revenues when the forecasted transaction occurs.
    Gains and losses from the change in fair value of derivative
    instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are
    reported in current-period income as “Other” under
    Revenues and Other in the Statement of Consolidated Operations.
    If at any time the likelihood of occurrence of a hedged
    forecasted transaction ceases to be “probable,” hedge
    accounting treatment will cease on a prospective basis, and all
    future changes in the fair value of the derivative will be
    recognized directly in earnings. Amounts recorded in other
    comprehensive income prior to the change in the likelihood of
    occurrence of the forecasted transaction will remain in other
    comprehensive income until such time as the forecasted
    transaction impacts earnings. If it becomes probable that the
    original forecasted production will not occur, then the
    derivative gain or loss would be reclassified from accumulated
    other comprehensive income into earnings immediately. Hedge
    effectiveness is measured at least quarterly based on the
    relative changes in fair value between the derivative contract
    and the hedged item over time, and any ineffectiveness is
    immediately reported as “Other” under Revenues and
    Other in the Statement of Consolidated Operations.

General
    and Administrative Expense

General and administrative expenses are reported net of
    recoveries from owners in properties operated by Apache and net
    of amounts related to lease operating activities or capitalized
    pursuant to the full-cost method of accounting.

Income
    Taxes

Apache records deferred tax assets and liabilities to account
    for the expected future tax consequences of events that have
    been recognized in our financial statements and our tax returns.
    The Company routinely assesses the realizability of its deferred
    tax assets. If the Company concludes that it is more likely than
    not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not
    be realized under accounting standards, the tax asset is reduced
    by a valuation allowance. Numerous judgments and assumptions are
    inherent in the determination of future taxable income,
    including factors such as future operating conditions
    (particularly as related to prevailing oil and gas prices).

Earnings from Apache’s international operations are
    permanently reinvested; therefore, the Company does not
    recognize U.S. deferred taxes on the unremitted earnings of
    its international subsidiaries. If it becomes apparent that some
    or all of the unremitted earnings will be remitted, the Company
    will then recognize taxes on those earnings.

Foreign
    Currency Translation

The U.S. dollar has been determined to be the functional
    currency for each of Apache’s international operations. The
    functional currency is determined

country-by-country

based on relevant facts and circumstances of the cash flows,
    commodity pricing environment and financing arrangements in each
    country. Foreign currency translation gains and losses arise
    when monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign
    currencies are remeasured to their U.S. dollar equivalent
    at the exchange rate in effect at the end of each reporting
    period.

The Company accounts for foreign currency gains and losses in
    accordance with ASC Topic 830, “Foreign Currency
    Matters.” Foreign currency translation gains and losses
    related to current taxes payable and deferred tax liabilities
    are recorded as a component of provision for income taxes. In
    2009, the Company recorded additional net tax expense of
    $195 million, including a current tax benefit of
    $3 million and deferred tax expense of $198 million,
    in connection with foreign currency translation gains and
    losses. In 2008, Apache recorded an additional tax benefit of
    $400 million, including a current benefit of
    $3 million and a deferred benefit of $397 million. In
    2007, the Company recorded additional deferred tax expense of
    $228 million. Foreign currency translation gains and losses
    had a negligible impact on current tax expense in 2007. For
    further discussion, see Note 6 — Income Taxes.
    All other foreign currency translation gains and losses are
    reflected in “Other” under Revenues and Other in the
    Statement of Consolidated Operations. The Company’s other
    foreign currency gains and losses included in “Other”
    under Revenues and Other in the Statement of Consolidated
    Operations netted to gains of $11 million, $38 million
    and $9 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

Foreign currency gains and losses also arise when revenue and
    disbursement transactions denominated in a country’s local
    currency are converted to a U.S. dollar equivalent based on
    the average exchange rates during the reporting period.

Insurance
    Coverage

The Company recognizes an insurance receivable when collection
    of the receivable is deemed probable. Any recognition of an
    insurance receivable is recorded by crediting and offsetting the
    original charge. Any differential arising between insurance
    recoveries and insurance receivables is recorded as a
    capitalized cost or as an expense, consistent with its original
    treatment.

Earnings
    Per Share

The Company’s basic earnings per share (EPS) amounts have
    been computed based on the weighted-average number of shares of
    common stock outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS reflects
    the potential dilution, using the treasury-stock method, which
    assumes that options were exercised and restricted stock was
    fully vested.

Diluted EPS also includes the impact of unvested share
    appreciation plans. For awards in which the share price goals
    have already been achieved, shares are included in diluted EPS
    using the treasury-stock method. For those awards in which the
    share price goals have not been achieved, the number of
    contingently issuable shares included in the diluted EPS is
    based on the number of shares, if any, using the treasury-stock
    method, that would be issuable if the market price of the
    Company’s stock at the end of the reporting period exceeded
    the share price goals under the terms of the plan.

Unvested share-based payment awards that contain rights to
    receive nonforfeitable dividends or dividend equivalents are
    participating securities prior to vesting and, therefore, are
    included in the earnings allocations in computing basic EPS
    under the two-class method.

Stock-Based
    Compensation

The Company accounts for stock-based compensation under the fair
    value recognition provisions of ASC Topic 718,
    “Compensation — Stock Compensation.” The
    Company grants various types of stock-based awards including
    stock options, nonvested restricted stock units and
    performance-based awards. In 2003 and 2004, the Company also
    granted cash-based stock appreciation rights. These plans and
    related accounting policies are defined and described more fully
    in Note 7 — Capital Stock. Stock compensation
    awards granted are valued on the date of grant and are expensed,
    net of estimated forfeitures, over the required service period.

ASC Topic 718 also requires that benefits of tax deductions in
    excess of recognized compensation cost be reported as financing
    cash flows rather than as operating cash flows. The Company
    classified $16 million, $47 million and
    $30 million as financing cash inflows in 2009, 2008 and
    2007, respectively.

Treasury

The Company follows the weighted-average-cost method of
    accounting for treasury stock transactions.

SIGNIFICANT
    ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES

    Activity

During the second quarter of 2009 Apache announced the
    acquisition of nine Permian Basin oil and gas fields with then
    current net production of 3,500 barrels of oil equivalent
    per day from Marathon Oil Corporation for $187.4 million,
    subject to normal post-closing adjustments. Estimated reserves
    acquired in connection with the acquisition totaled
    19.5 MMboe (unaudited). These long-lived fields fit well
    with Apache’s existing properties in the Permian Basin,
    particularly in Lea County, N.M., and will provide the Company
    many years of drilling opportunities. The effective date of the
    transaction was January 1, 2009.

    Activity

There was no major acquisition activity during 2008; however,
    the Company completed several divestiture transactions. On
    January 29, 2008, the Company completed the sale of its
    interest in Ship Shoal blocks 349 and 359 on the outer
    continental shelf of the Gulf of Mexico to W&T Offshore,
    Inc. for $116 million. On January 31, 2008, the
    Company completed the sale of non-strategic oil and gas
    properties in the Permian Basin of West Texas to Vanguard
    Permian, LLC for $78 million. On April 2, 2008, the
    Company completed the sale of non-strategic Canadian properties
    to Central Global Resources for C$112 million. These
    divestitures were subject to normal post-closing adjustments.

    Activity

U.S. Gulf Coast Farm-in

On
    September 6, 2007, Apache entered into an Exploration
    Agreement with various EnerVest Partnerships (“EVP”)
    for an initial term of four years whereby Apache committed to
    spend $30 million in qualified expenditures to explore,
    drill, produce and market hydrocarbons from specified
    undeveloped formations across 400,000 net acres in Central
    and East Texas. As of December 31, 2008, Apache had
    fulfilled the $30 million commitment.

U.S. Permian Basin

On March 29,
    2007, the Company closed its acquisition of controlling interest
    in 28 oil and gas fields in the Permian Basin of West Texas from
    Anadarko for $1 billion. Apache estimates that these fields
    had proved reserves of 57 million barrels (MMbbls)
    (unaudited) of liquid hydrocarbons and 78 billion cubic
    feet (Bcf) (unaudited) of natural gas as of year-end 2006. The
    Company funded the acquisition with debt. Apache and Anadarko
    entered into a joint-venture arrangement to effect the
    transaction. The Company entered into cash flow hedges for a
    portion of the crude oil and natural gas production.

3.

DERIVATIVE
    INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES

Objectives
    and Strategies

The Company is exposed to fluctuations in crude oil and natural
    gas prices on the majority of its worldwide production.
    Apache’s first strategy is to maintain a balance in its
    commodities mix of oil and gas, and gas sold at New York
    Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX)-related prices versus gas sold under
    long-term contracts tied to oil prices. Management also believes
    it is prudent to manage the variability in cash flows on a
    portion of its crude oil and natural gas production. The Company
    utilizes various types of derivative financial instruments,
    including swaps and options, to manage fluctuations in cash
    flows resulting from changes in commodity prices. Derivative
    instruments entered into are designated as cash flow hedges.

Counterparty
    Risk

The use of derivative instruments exposes the Company to
    counterparty credit risk, or the risk that a counterparty will
    be unable to meet its commitments. Apache’s commodity
    derivative instruments are with a diversified group of
    counterparties, primarily financial institutions. To reduce the
    concentration of exposure to any

F-15


APACHE
    CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

individual counterparty, Apache had positions with 16
    counterparties as of December 31, 2009. All of these
    counterparties were at year-end rated A or higher by
    Standard & Poor’s and A2 or higher by
    Moody’s. The Company monitors counterparty creditworthiness
    on an ongoing basis; however, it cannot predict sudden changes
    in counterparties’ creditworthiness. In addition, even if
    such changes are not sudden, the Company may be limited in its
    ability to mitigate an increase in counterparty credit risk.
    Should one of these counterparties not perform, Apache may not
    realize the benefit of some of its derivative instruments under
    lower commodity prices.

The Company executes commodity derivative transactions under
    master agreements that have netting provisions that provide for
    offsetting payables against receivables. In general, if a party
    to a derivative transaction incurs a material deterioration in
    its credit ratings, as defined in the applicable agreement, the
    other party will have the right to demand the posting of
    collateral, demand a transfer or terminate the arrangement.

    activity in accordance with ASC Topic 815, “Derivatives and
    Hedging,” and all derivative instruments are reflected as
    either assets or liabilities at fair value in the Consolidated
    Balance Sheet. These fair values are recorded by netting asset
    and liability positions where counterparty master netting

The ARO liability reflects the estimated present value of the
    amount of dismantlement, removal, site reclamation and similar
    activities associated with Apache’s oil and gas properties.
    The Company utilizes current retirement costs to estimate the
    expected cash outflows for retirement obligations. The Company
    estimates the ultimate productive life of the properties, a
    risk-adjusted discount rate and an inflation factor in order to
    determine the current present value of this obligation. To the
    extent future revisions to these assumptions impact the present
    value of the existing ARO liability, a corresponding adjustment
    is made to the oil and gas property balance.

Liabilities settled primarily relate to individual properties
    plugged and abandoned during the period. Most of the activity in
    both periods was in the Gulf of Mexico, a portion of which
    relates to the continued abandonment activity on platforms
    toppled in 2005 during Hurricanes Katrina and Rita and in 2008
    during Hurricane Ike.

Overview

All of the Company’s debt, excluding the Apache PVG secured
    facility, is senior unsecured debt and has equal priority with
    respect to the payment of both principal and interest.

The indentures for the notes described above place certain
    restrictions on the Company, including limits on Apache’s
    ability to incur debt secured by certain liens and its ability
    to enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions. Upon
    certain changes in control, all of these debt instruments would
    be subject to mandatory repurchase, at the option of the
    holders. None of the indentures for the notes contain
    pre-payment obligations in the event of a decline in credit
    ratings.

Money
    Market and Overdraft Lines of Credit

The Company has certain uncommitted money market and overdraft
    lines of credit that are used from time to time for working
    capital purposes. As of December 31, 2009 and 2008,
    $7.3 million and $12.6 million, respectively, was
    drawn on facilities in Argentina.

Unsecured
    Committed Bank Credit Facilities

As of December 31, 2009, the Company had unsecured
    committed revolving syndicated bank credit facilities totaling
    $2.3 billion, which mature in May 2013. The facilities
    consist of a $1.5 billion facility and a $450 million
    facility in the U.S., a $200 million facility in Australia
    and a $150 million facility in Canada. Since there are no
    outstanding borrowings or commercial paper at year-end, the full
    $2.3 billion of unsecured credit facilities are available
    to the Company. The U.S. credit facilities are used to
    support Apache’s commercial paper program.

The financial covenants of the credit facilities require the
    Company to maintain a

debt-to-capitalization

ratio of not greater than 60 percent at the end of any
    fiscal quarter. The Company’s

debt-to-capitalization

ratio at December 31, 2009 was 24 percent.

The negative covenants include restrictions on the
    Company’s ability to create liens and security interests on
    our assets, with exceptions for liens typically arising in the
    oil and gas industry, purchase money liens and liens arising as
    a matter of law, such as tax and mechanics’ liens. The
    Company may incur liens on assets located in the U.S. and
    Canada of up to five percent of the Company’s consolidated
    assets, or approximately $1.4 billion as of
    December 31, 2009. There are no restrictions on incurring
    liens in countries other than the U.S. and Canada. There
    are also restrictions on Apache’s ability to merge with
    another entity, unless the Company is the surviving entity, and
    a restriction on our ability to guarantee debt of entities not
    within our consolidated group.

There are no clauses in the facilities that permit the lenders
    to accelerate payments or refuse to lend based on unspecified
    material adverse changes (MAC clauses). The credit facility
    agreements do not have drawdown restrictions or prepayment
    obligations in the event of a decline in credit ratings.
    However, the agreements allow the lenders to accelerate payments
    and terminate lending commitments if Apache Corporation, or any
    of its U.S. or

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Canadian subsidiaries, defaults on any direct payment obligation
    in excess of $100 million or has any unpaid, non-appealable
    judgment against it in excess of $100 million.

The Company was in compliance with the terms of the credit
    facilities as of December 31, 2009.

At the Company’s option, the interest rate for the
    facilities is based on (i) the greater of (a) the JP
    Morgan Chase Bank prime rate or (b) the federal funds rate
    plus one-half of one percent or (ii) the London Inter-bank
    Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a margin determined by the
    Company’s senior long-term debt rating. The
    $1.5 billion and the $450 million credit facilities
    (U.S. credit facilities) also allow the company to borrow
    under competitive auctions.

At December 31, 2009, the margin over LIBOR for committed
    loans was .19 percent on the $1.5 billion facility and
    .23 percent on the other three facilities. If the total
    amount of the loans borrowed under the $1.5 billion
    facility equals or exceeds 50 percent of the total facility
    commitments, then an additional .05 percent will be added
    to the margins over LIBOR. If the total amount of the loans
    borrowed under all of the other three facilities equals or
    exceeds 50 percent of the total facility commitments, then
    an additional .10 percent will be added to the margins over
    LIBOR. The Company also pays quarterly facility fees of
    .06 percent on the total amount of the $1.5 billion
    facility and .07 percent on the total amount of the other
    three facilities. The facility fees vary based upon the
    Company’s senior long-term debt rating.

Commercial
    Paper Program

The Company has available a $1.95 billion commercial paper
    program, which generally enables Apache to borrow funds for up
    to 270 days at competitive interest rates. If the Company
    is unable to issue commercial paper following a significant
    credit downgrade or dislocation in the market, the
    Company’s U.S. credit facilities are available as a
    100-percent backstop. The commercial paper program is fully
    supported by available borrowing capacity under
    U.S. committed credit facilities, which expire in 2013. As
    of December 31, 2009 and 2008, the Company had no
    outstanding commercial paper.

U.S. Debt

The U.S. 6.25-percent, 5.25-percent, 5.625-percent,
    6.9-percent and both 6.0-percent notes are redeemable, as a
    whole or in part, at Apache’s option, subject to a
    make-whole premium. The remaining U.S. notes and debentures

Subsidiary
    Notes and Credit Facility

Rule 3-10

of SEC

Regulation S-X

(Rule 3-10)

generally requires filing of financial statements by every
    issuer of a registered security. Issuers with no independent
    operations qualify as “finance subsidiaries” and are
    exempt from the reporting requirements. Apache Finance Australia
    and Apache Finance Canada qualified as “finance
    subsidiaries” until Apache, during 2001, contributed stock
    of its Australian and Canadian operating subsidiaries to Apache
    Finance Australia and Apache Finance Canada, respectively.

Apache Finance Australia

Apache Finance
    Pty Limited (Apache Finance Australia) issued approximately
    $270 million of publicly-traded notes that were fully and
    unconditionally guaranteed by Apache and, beginning in 2001,
    also by Apache North America, Inc. In 2007, $170 million of
    these notes matured and were repaid. The remaining
    $100 million of publicly-traded notes matured on
    March 15, 2009, and were repaid using existing cash
    balances.

Apache Finance Canada

Apache Finance
    Canada Corporation (Apache Finance Canada) issued approximately
    $300 million of 7.75-percent publicly-traded notes due in
    2029 and an additional $350 million of 4.375-percent
    publicly-traded notes due in 2015 that are fully and
    unconditionally guaranteed by Apache. Under certain conditions
    related to changes in relevant tax laws, Apache Finance Canada
    has the right to redeem either of the

notes prior to maturity. The Apache Finance Canada 4.375-percent
    notes also may be redeemed as a whole or in part at the
    Company’s option subject to a make-whole premium.

See Note 15 — Supplemental Guarantor Information
    for further discussion of subsidiary debt.

One of the Company’s Australian subsidiaries has a secured
    revolving syndicated credit facility for its Van Gogh and
    Pyrenees oil developments offshore Western Australia. The
    facility provides for total commitments of up to
    $350 million, with availability determined by a borrowing
    base formula. The borrowing base was set at $350 million
    and will be redetermined after the fields commence production in
    the first half of 2010 and certain tests have been met, and
    semi-annually thereafter. The facility is secured by certain
    assets associated with the Van Gogh and Pyrenees oil
    developments, including the shares of stock of the
    Company’s subsidiary holding the assets. The Company has
    agreed to guarantee the credit facility until project completion
    occurs pursuant to terms of the facility, which is expected in
    the fourth quarter of 2010. In the event project completion does
    not occur by December 31, 2010, pursuant to terms of the
    facility, the lenders may require repayment of outstanding
    amounts in the first quarter of 2011. The commitments under the
    facility will be reduced by scheduled increments every six
    months beginning June 30, 2010, with final maturity on
    March 31, 2014. Interest is based on LIBOR, which may be
    subject to change under certain market disruption conditions,
    plus a margin of 1.00 percent pre-completion and
    1.75 percent post-completion. The pre-completion margin
    increases to 1.125 percent in the event the Company’s
    ratings are downgraded to BBB+ or below by at least two major
    rating agencies. As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, there
    was $350 million and $100 million, respectively,
    outstanding under the facility. The outstanding amount under
    this facility must not exceed $300 million on June 30,
    2010 and $240 million on December 31, 2010. As
    $50 million and $60 million of the current balance
    will be repaid by June 30, 2010 and December 31, 2010,
    respectively, $110 million has been classified as current
    debt at December 31, 2009.

Credit
    Ratings

We receive debt ratings from the major credit rating agencies in
    the United States. Factors that may impact our credit ratings
    include debt levels, planned asset purchases or sales and
    near-term and long-term production growth opportunities.
    Liquidity, asset quality, cost structure, reserve mix and
    commodity pricing levels could also be considered by the rating
    agencies. Apache’s senior unsecured long-term debt is
    currently rated A3 by Moody’s, A- by Standard &
    Poor’s and A- by Fitch. The Company has received short-term
    debt ratings for its commercial paper program of

P-2

from
    Moody’s,

A-2

from
    Standard & Poor’s and F2 from Fitch. In September
    2009 Fitch downgraded Apache’s senior unsecured long-term
    debt and short-term debt from A and F1 to A- and F2,
    respectively. The current outlook at all three rating agencies
    is stable.

The Company has not recorded U.S. deferred income taxes on
    the undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries as
    management intends to permanently reinvest such earnings. As of
    December 31, 2009, the undistributed earnings of the
    foreign subsidiaries amounted to approximately
    $15.3 billion. Upon distribution of these earnings in the
    form of dividends or otherwise, the Company may be subject to
    U.S. income taxes and foreign withholding taxes. It is not
    practical, however, to estimate the amount of taxes that may be
    payable on the eventual remittance of these earnings after
    consideration of available foreign tax credits. Presently,
    limited foreign tax credits are available to reduce the
    U.S. taxes on such amounts if repatriated.

APACHE
    CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

On December 31, 2009, the Company had U.S. net
    operating losses of $393 million, state net operating loss
    carryforwards of $673 million and foreign net operating
    loss carryforwards of $4 million in Canada,
    $22 million in Argentina and $662 million in
    Australia. The Company also had $141 million of capital
    loss carryforwards in Canada. Under the provisions of the
    Worker, Homeownership, and Business Assistance Act of 2009, the
    Company expects to carryback the U.S. net operating loss
    generated in 2009 to the 2004 tax year. The state net operating
    losses will expire over the next 20 years if they are not
    otherwise utilized. The foreign net operating loss in Canada
    will begin to expire in 2014, the Argentina net operating loss
    will begin to expire in 2011, and the Australia net operating
    loss has an indefinite carryover period. The capital loss in
    Canada also has an indefinite carryover period.

The tax benefits of carryforwards are recorded as assets to the
    extent that management assesses the utilization of such
    carryforwards to be “more likely than not.” When the
    future utilization of some portion of the carryforwards is
    determined to not meet the “more likely than not”
    standard, a valuation allowance is provided to reduce the tax
    benefits from such assets. As the Company does not believe the
    utilization of the Canadian capital losses and certain state net
    operating losses to be “more likely than not,” a
    valuation allowance was provided to reduce the tax benefit from
    these deferred tax assets.

Apache accounts for income taxes in accordance with ASC Topic
    740, “Income Taxes,” which prescribes a minimum
    recognition threshold a tax position must meet before being
    recognized in the financial statements. A reconciliation of the
    beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as

Included in the balance at December 31, 2009, are
    $14 million of tax positions for which the ultimate
    deductibility is highly certain, but for which there is
    uncertainty about the timing of such deductibility. Because of
    the impact of deferred tax accounting, other than penalties and
    interest, the disallowance of the shorter deductibility period
    would not affect the annual effective income tax rate but would
    accelerate the payment of cash to the taxing authority to an
    earlier period.

The Company records interest and penalties related to
    unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. Each quarter
    the company assesses the amounts provided for and may increase
    (expense) or reduce (benefit) the amount of interest and
    penalties. During the years ended December 31, 2009 and
    2008, the Company recorded tax benefits of approximately
    $17 million and $87 million, respectively. In 2007,
    the company recorded an additional $43 million in interest
    and penalties. As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, the
    Company had approximately $24 million and $41 million,
    respectively, accrued for payment of interest and penalties.

The Company is in Administrative Appeals with the
    U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) regarding the tax years
    2004 through 2007. The Company is also under audit in various
    states and in most of the Company’s foreign jurisdictions
    as part of its normal course of business. Resolution of any of
    the above, which may occur in 2010, could result in a
    significant change to the Company’s tax reserves. However,
    the resolution of unagreed tax issues in the Company’s open
    tax years cannot be predicted with absolute certainty, and
    differences between what has been recorded and the eventual
    outcomes may occur. Due to this uncertainty and the uncertain
    timing of the final resolution of the Appeals process, an
    accurate estimate of the range of outcomes occurring during the
    next 12 months cannot be made at this time. Nevertheless,
    the Company believes that it has adequately provided for income
    taxes and any related interest and penalties for all open tax
    years.

Stock
    Compensation Plans

The Company has several stock-based compensation plans, which
    include stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted
    stock, and performance-based share appreciation plans. In May
    2007, the Company’s shareholders approved the 2007 Omnibus
    Equity Compensation Plan (the 2007 Plan), which is intended to
    provide eligible employees with equity-based incentives. The
    2007 Plan provides for the granting of Incentive Stock Options,
    Non-Qualified Stock Options, Performance Awards, Restricted
    Stock, Restricted Stock Units, Stock Appreciation Rights, or any
    combination of the foregoing. All new grants will be issued from
    the 2007 Plan. The previous plans remain in effect solely for
    the purpose of governing grants still outstanding that were
    issued prior to approval of the 2007 Plan, including the
    2005 Share Appreciation Plan, which remains in effect to
    issue shares for previously-attained stock appreciation goals.

For 2009, 2008 and 2007, stock-based compensation expensed was
    $104 million, $52 million and $73 million
    ($67 million, $34 million and $47 million after
    tax), respectively. Costs related to the plans are capitalized
    or expensed based on the nature of each employee’s
    activities. A description of the Company’s stock-based

Stock
    Options

As of December 31, 2009, officers and employees held
    options to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock
    under one or more of the employee stock option plans adopted in
    1998, 2000 and 2005 (collectively, the Stock Option Plans), and
    under the 2007 Plan discussed above. New shares of Company stock
    will be issued for employee stock option exercises; however,
    under the 2000 Stock Option Plan, shares of treasury stock are
    used for employee stock option exercises to the extent treasury
    stock is held. Under the Stock Option Plans and the 2007 Plan,
    the exercise price of each option equals the closing price of
    Apache’s common stock on the date of grant. Options
    generally become exercisable ratably over a four-year period and
    expire 10 years after granted. All of these plans allow for
    accelerated vesting if there is a change in control, as defined
    in each plan. The 2007 Plan and all of the Stock Option Plans,
    except for the 2000 Stock Option Plan, were submitted to and
    approved by the Company’s stockholders.

On October 31, 1996, the Company also established the 1996
    Performance Stock Option Plan (the Performance Plan) for
    substantially all full-time employees, excluding officers and
    certain other key employees. As of December 31, 2009, all
    options granted under the Performance Plan had been exercised or
    cancelled.

As of December 31, 2009, the weighted average remaining

    exercisable is 6.5 years, 8.1 years and
    5.2 years, respectively. The aggregate intrinsic value of
    options outstanding, expected to vest and exercisable at
    year-end was $193 million, $49 million and
    $135 million, respectively. The weighted-average grant-date
    fair value of options granted during the years 2009, 2008 and
    2007 was $29.71, $39.76 and $23.01, respectively.

The fair value of each stock option award is estimated on the
    date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
    Assumptions used in the valuation are disclosed in the following
    table. Expected volatilities are based on historical volatility
    of the Company’s common stock and other factors. The
    expected dividend yield is based on historical yields on the
    date of grant. The expected term of stock options granted
    represents the period of time that the stock options are
    expected to be outstanding and is derived from historical
    exercise behavior, current trends and values derived from
    lattice-based models. The risk-free rate is based on the
    U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.

The intrinsic value of options exercised during 2009, 2008 and

    $105 million, respectively. The cash received from exercise
    of options during 2009 was approximately $43 million. The
    Company realized an additional tax benefit of approximately
    $9 million for the amount of intrinsic value in excess of
    compensation cost recognized in 2009. As of December 31,
    2009, the total compensation cost related to non-vested options
    not yet recognized was $56 million, which will be
    recognized over the remaining vesting period of the options.

Stock
    Appreciation Rights

In 2003 and 2004, the Company issued a total of 1,809,060 and
    1,334,300, respectively, of stock appreciation rights (SARs) to
    non-executive employees in lieu of stock options. The SARs vest
    ratably over four years and will be settled in cash upon
    exercise throughout their

10-year

life. The weighted-average exercise price was $42.68 and $28.78
    for those issued in 2004 and 2003, respectively. The number of
    SARs outstanding and exercisable as of

December 31, 2009 was 777,708. The Company records
    compensation expense on the vested SARs outstanding based on the
    fair value of the SARs at the end of each period because SARs
    are cash-settled. As of year-end, the weighted-average fair
    value of SARs outstanding was $69.54 based on the Black-Scholes
    valuation methodology using assumptions comparable to those
    discussed above. During 2009, 127,031 SARs were exercised. The
    aggregate of cash payments made to settle SARs was
    $5 million.

Restricted
    Stock and Restricted Stock Units

The Company has restricted stock and restricted stock unit
    plans, including those awarded pursuant to programs under the
    2007 Plan, that are for eligible employees including officers.
    The programs created under the 2007 Plan have been approved by
    Apache’s Board of Directors. In 2009, the Company awarded
    1,119,936 restricted stock units at a per-share market price of
    $84.30. In 2008 and 2007, the Company awarded 787,846 and
    399,500 restricted stock units at a per-share market price of
    $136.05 and $77.31, respectively. The value of the stock issued
    was established by the market price on the date of grant and is
    being recorded as compensation expense ratably over the vesting
    terms. During 2009, 2008 and 2007, $35.6 million
    ($22.9 million after tax), $20.1 million
    ($13.0 million after tax) and $8.2 million
    ($5.3 million after tax), respectively, was charged to
    expense. In 2009, 2008 and 2007, $11.8 million,
    $5.9 million and $1.0 million was capitalized,
    respectively. As of December 31, 2009, there was
    $150 million of total unrecognized compensation cost
    related to 1,835,263 unvested restricted stock units. The
    weighted-average remaining life of unvested restricted stock
    units is approximately 1.8 years.

The total fair value of these awards vested during 2009, 2008
    and 2007 was approximately $34 million, $15 million
    and $7 million, respectively.

On May 7, 2008, the Stock Option Plan Committee of
    Apache’s Board of Directors awarded its Chief Executive
    Officer 250,000 restricted stock units, 50,000 of which vested
    on July 1, 2009. The remaining 200,000 shares vest
    ratably on the first business day of the years 2010, 2011, 2012
    and 2013. Upon vesting, the Company will issue one share of the
    Company’s common stock as settlement for each restricted
    stock unit. Thirty thousand of the shares vesting each year will
    not be eligible for sale by the executive until such time as he
    retires or otherwise terminates employment with the Company.
    This award was made under the terms of the Company’s 2007
    Omnibus Equity Compensation Plan.

In August 2008, the Company established, pursuant to the
    Company’s 2007 Omnibus Equity Compensation Plan, the
    Non-Employee Directors’ Restricted Stock Units Program (the
    RSU Program). Each non-employee director was awarded 1,500
    restricted stock units on August 14, 2008 under the RSU
    Program, with half of the restricted stock units vesting thirty
    days after the grant and the other half vesting on the one-year
    anniversary date of the grant. Each year, all non-employee
    directors will be eligible to receive grants of restricted stock
    units comparable in value to the 2008 grant. Non-employee
    directors are required to choose, at the time of each award,
    whether such award will vest as 100 percent common stock or
    a combination of 40 percent cash and 60 percent common
    stock.

On February 12, 2009, the Company awarded Roger B. Plank,
    President, John A. Crum, Co-Chief Operating Officer and
    President — North America, and Rodney J. Eichler,

International, each 62,500 restricted stock units pursuant to
    Apache’s 2007 Omnibus Equity Compensation Plan. Twenty
    percent of such restricted stock units will vest on each of
    April 1, 2010, February 12, 2011, February 12,
    2012, February 11, 2013 and February 11, 2014.
    Additionally, on November 18, 2009, the Company awarded
    five other key officers each 20,000 restricted stock units
    pursuant to Apache’s 2007 Omnibus Equity Compensation Plan.
    Twenty percent of these restricted stock units will vest on each
    of December 31, 2010, November 18, 2011,
    November 19, 2012, November 18, 2013 and
    November 18, 2014. Upon vesting, Apache will issue one
    share of Apache’s common stock as settlement for each
    restricted stock unit. Sixty percent of the shares vesting each
    year for each recipient will be subject to the restriction that
    none of those shares will be eligible for sale by the recipient
    until such time as he retires or otherwise terminates employment
    with Apache.

Subsequent
    Events

To provide long-term incentives for Apache employees to deliver
    competitive returns to our stockholders, in January 2010 the
    Company’s Board of Directors approved the 2010 Performance
    Program, pursuant to the 2007 Omnibus Equity Compensation Plan.
    Eligible employees received an initial conditional restricted
    stock unit award of 541,440 units, with the ultimate number
    of restricted stock units to be awarded, if any, based upon
    measurement of total shareholder return of Apache common stock
    as compared to a designated peer group during a three-year
    performance period. Should any restricted stock units be awarded
    at the end of the three-year performance period, 50 percent
    of restricted stock units awarded will immediately vest, and an
    additional 25 percent will vest on succeeding anniversaries
    of the end of the performance period. The Company’s Board
    of Directors also approved a one-time restricted stock unit
    award of 502,470 shares to eligible Apache employees, with
    one-third of the units granted immediately vesting and an
    additional one-third vesting on each of the first and second
    anniversaries of the grant date.

Share
    Appreciation Plans

The Company has previously utilized share appreciation plans to
    provide incentives for substantially all full-time employees and
    officers to increase Apache’s share price within a stated
    measurement period. To achieve the payout, the Company’s
    stock price must close at or above a stated threshold for 10 out
    of any 30 consecutive trading days before the end of the stated
    period. Awards under the plans are payable in equal annual
    installments as specified by each plan, beginning on a date not
    more than 30 days after a threshold is attained for the
    required measurement period and on succeeding anniversaries of
    the attainment date. Shares issued to employees would be reduced
    by the required minimum tax withholding. Shares of Apache common
    stock contingently issuable under the plans are excluded from
    the computation of income per common share until the stated
    goals are met as described below.

Since 2005, two share appreciation plans have been approved. A
    summary of these plans is as follows:

•

On May 7, 2008, the Stock Option Plan Committee of the
    Company’s Board of Directors, pursuant to the
    Company’s 2007 Omnibus Equity Compensation Plan, approved
    the 2008 Share Appreciation Program with a target to
    increase Apache’s share price to $216 by the end of 2012
    and an interim goal of $162 to be achieved by the end of 2010.
    Any awards under the program would be payable in five equal
    annual installments. As of December 31, 2009, neither share
    price threshold had been met.

•

On May 5, 2005, the Company’s stockholders approved
    the 2005 Share Appreciation Plan, with a target to increase
    Apache’s share price to $108 by the end of 2008 and an
    interim goal of $81 to be achieved by the end of 2007. Awards
    under the plan are payable in four equal annual installments to
    eligible employees remaining with the Company. Apache’s
    share price exceeded the interim $81 threshold for the

10-day

requirement as of June 14, 2007, and the first and second
    installments were awarded in July 2007 and 2008. The third
    installment was awarded in June 2009, and the fourth and final
    installment will be awarded in June 2010. Apache’s share
    price exceeded the $108 threshold for the

10-day

requirement as of February 29, 2008.

Current accounting practices dictate that, regardless of whether

    recognize, over time, the fair value cost determined at the
    grant date based on numerous assumptions, including an estimate
    of the likelihood that Apache’s stock price will achieve
    these thresholds and the expected forfeiture rate. Over the

Preferred
    Stock

The Company has five million shares of no par preferred stock
    authorized, of which 25,000 shares have been designated as
    Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock (the
    Series A Preferred Stock). The Company redeemed the 100,000
    outstanding shares of its 5.68 percent Series B
    Cumulative Preferred Stock (the Series B Preferred Stock)
    on December 30, 2009.

Series A
    Preferred Stock

In December 1995, the Company declared a dividend of one right
    (a Right) for each 2.31 shares (adjusted for subsequent
    stock dividends and a

two-for-one

stock split) of Apache common stock outstanding on
    January 31, 1996. Each full Right entitles the registered
    holder to purchase from the Company one ten-thousandth
    (1/10,000) of a share of Series A Preferred Stock at a
    price of $100 per one ten-thousandth of a share, subject to
    adjustment. The Rights are exercisable 10 calendar days
    following a public announcement that certain persons or groups
    have acquired 20 percent or more of the outstanding shares
    of Apache common stock or 10 business days following
    commencement of an offer for 30 percent or more of the
    outstanding shares of Apache’s outstanding common stock
    (flip in event); each Right will become exercisable for shares
    of Apache’s common stock at 50 percent of the
    then-market price of the common stock. If a 20-percent
    shareholder of Apache acquires Apache, by merger or otherwise,
    in a transaction where Apache does not survive or in which
    Apache’s common stock is changed or exchanged (flip over
    event), the Rights become exercisable for shares of the common
    stock of the Company acquiring Apache at 50 percent of the
    then-market price for Apache common stock. Any Rights that are
    or were beneficially owned by a person who has acquired
    20 percent or more of the outstanding shares of Apache
    common stock and who engages in certain transactions or realizes
    the benefits of certain transactions with the Company will
    become void. If an offer to acquire all of the Company’s
    outstanding shares of common stock is determined to be fair by
    Apache’s board of directors, the transaction will not
    trigger a flip in event or a flip-over event. The Company may
    also redeem the Rights at $.01 per Right at any time until 10
    business days after public announcement of a flip in event.
    These rights were originally scheduled to expire on
    January 31, 2006. Effective as of that date, the Rights
    were reset to one right per share of common stock and the
    expiration was extended to January 31, 2016. Unless the
    Rights have been previously redeemed, all shares of Apache
    common stock issued by the Company after January 31, 1996
    will include Rights. Unless and until the Rights become
    exercisable, they will be transferred with and only with the
    shares of Apache common stock.

Series B
    Preferred Stock

In August 1998, Apache issued 100,000 shares
    ($100 million) of Series B Preferred Stock in the form
    of one million depositary shares, each representing one-tenth
    (1/10) of a share of Series B Preferred Stock, for net
    proceeds

of $98.4 million. On December 30, 2009, Apache
    redeemed all Series B Preferred Stock at $1,000 per
    preferred share plus $9.47 in accrued and unpaid dividends.
    Holders of the shares were entitled to receive cumulative cash
    dividends at an annual rate of $5.68 per depositary share.
    During 2009, 2008 and 2007, Apache accrued a total of
    $5.7 million each year in dividends on its Series B
    Preferred Stock issued in August 1998. As the final dividend
    payment was accelerated with the redemption of the Series B
    Preferred Stock, Apache paid $6.6 million in dividends on
    this stock during 2009, compared to $5.7 million each year
    for 2008 and 2007. The difference of $1.6 million between
    the redemption amount and the initial net proceeds was
    recognized as additional preferred stock dividends in
    conjunction with the redemption of these shares on
    December 30, 2009.

COMMITMENTS
    AND CONTINGENCIES

Apache is party to various legal actions arising in the ordinary
    course of business, including litigation and governmental and
    regulatory controls. The Company has an accrued liability of
    approximately $20 million for all legal contingencies that
    are deemed to be probable of occurring and can be reasonably
    estimated. Apache’s estimates are based on information
    known about the matters and its experience in contesting,
    litigating and settling similar matters. Although actual amounts
    could differ from management’s estimate, none of the
    actions are believed by management to involve future amounts
    that would be material to Apache’s financial position or
    results of operations after consideration of recorded accruals.
    It is management’s opinion that the loss for any other
    litigation matters and claims that are reasonably possible to
    occur will not have a material adverse affect on the
    Company’s financial position or results of operations.

Legal
    Matters

Argentine
    Environmental Claims

In connection with the acquisition from Pioneer in 2006, the
    Company acquired a subsidiary of Pioneer in Argentina (PNRA)
    that is involved in various administrative proceedings with
    environmental authorities in the Neuquén Province relating
    to permits for and discharges from operations in that province.
    In addition, PNRA was named in a suit initiated against oil
    companies operating in the Neuquén basin entitled

Asociación de Superficiarios de la Patagonia v YPF S.A.,
    et. al.,

originally filed on August 21, 2003, in the
    Argentine National Supreme Court of Justice. The plaintiffs, a
    private group of landowners, have also named the national
    government and several provinces as third parties. The lawsuit
    alleges injury to the environment generally by the oil and gas
    industry. The plaintiffs principally seek from all defendants,
    jointly, (i) the remediation of contaminated sites, of the
    superficial

F-33


APACHE
    CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

and underground waters, and of soil that allegedly was degraded
    as a result of deforestation, (ii) if the remediation is
    not possible, payment of an indemnification for the material and
    moral damages claimed from defendants operating in the
    Neuquén basin, of which PNRA is a small portion,
    (iii) adoption of all the necessary measures to prevent
    future environmental damages, and (iv) the creation of a
    private restoration fund to provide coverage for remediation of
    potential future environmental damages. Much of the alleged
    damage relates to operations by the Argentine state oil company,
    which conducted oil and gas operations throughout Argentina
    prior to its privatization, which began in 1990. While the
    plaintiffs will seek to make all oil and gas companies operating
    in the Neuquén basin jointly liable for each others’
    actions, PNRA will defend on an individual basis and attempt to
    require the plaintiffs to delineate damages by company. PNRA
    intends to defend itself vigorously in the case. It is not
    certain exactly how or what the court will do in this matter as
    it is the first of its kind. While it is possible PNRA may incur
    liabilities related to the environmental claims, no reasonable
    prediction can be made as PNRA’s exposure related to this
    lawsuit is not currently determinable.

Louisiana
    Restoration

Numerous surface owners have filed claims or sent demand letters
    to various oil and gas companies, including Apache, claiming
    that, under either expressed or implied lease terms or Louisiana
    law, they are liable for damage measured by the cost of
    restoration of leased premises to their original condition as
    well as damages from contamination and cleanup. Many of these
    lawsuits claim small amounts, while others assert claims in
    excess of a million dollars. Also, some lawsuits or claims are
    being settled or resolved, while others are still being filed.
    Any exposure, therefore, related to these lawsuits and claims is
    not currently determinable. While an adverse judgment against
    Apache is possible, Apache intends to actively defend the cases.

Hurricane
    Related Litigation

In a case styled

Ned Comer, et al vs. Murphy Oil USA,
    Inc., et al,

Case No: 1:05-cv-00436; U.S.D.C.,

United
    States District Court, Southern District of Mississippi

,
    Mississippi property owners allege that hurricanes’
    meteorological effects increased in frequency and intensity due
    to global warming, and there will be continued future damage
    from increasing intensity of storms and sea level rises. They
    claim this was caused by the various defendants (oil and gas
    companies, electric and coal companies, and chemical
    manufacturers). Plaintiffs claim defendants’ emissions of
    “greenhouse gases” cause global warming, which they
    blame as the cause of their damages. They also claim that the
    oil company defendants artificially inflated and manipulated the
    prices of gasoline, diesel fuel, jet fuel, natural gas, and
    other end-use petrochemicals, and covered it up by
    misrepresentations. They further allege a conspiracy to
    disseminate misinformation and cover up the relationship between
    the defendants and global warming. Plaintiffs seek, among other
    damages, actual, consequential, and punitive or exemplary
    damages. The District Court dismissed the case on
    August 30, 2007. The plaintiffs appealed the dismissal.
    Prior to the dismissal, the plaintiffs filed a motion to amend
    the lawsuit to add additional defendants, including Apache. On
    October 16, 2009, the United States Court of Appeals for
    the Fifth Circuit reversed the judgment of the District Court
    and remanded the case to the District Court. The Fifth Circuit
    held that plaintiffs have pleaded sufficient facts to
    demonstrate standing for their public and private nuisance,
    trespass, and negligence claims, and that those claims are
    justifiable and do not present a political question. However,
    the Fifth Circuit declined to find standing for the unjust
    enrichment, civil conspiracy, and fraudulent misrepresentation
    claims, and therefore dismissed those claims. Several defendants
    have filed a petition with the Fifth Circuit for a rehearing

en banc

.

Australia
    Gas Pipeline Force Majeure

The Company subsidiaries reported a pipeline explosion that
    interrupted deliveries of natural gas to customers under various
    long-term contracts. Company subsidiaries believe that the event
    was a force majeure and as a result, the subsidiaries and their
    joint venture participants have declared force majeure under
    those contracts. On December 16, 2009, a customer, Burrup
    Fertilisers Pty Ltd, filed a lawsuit on behalf of itself and
    certain of its underwriters at Lloyd’s London and other
    insurers, against the Company and its subsidiaries in Texas
    state court,

F-34

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

asserting claims for negligence, breach of contract, alter ego,
    single business enterprise, res ipsa loquitur, and gross
    negligence/exemplary damages. Other customers have threatened to
    file suit challenging the declaration of force majeure under
    their contracts. Contract prices under their contracts are
    significantly below current spot prices for natural gas in
    Australia. In the event it is determined that the pipeline
    explosion was not a force majeure, Company subsidiaries believe
    that liquidated damages should be the extent of the damages
    under those long-term contracts with such provisions.
    Approximately 90 percent of the natural gas volumes sold by
    Company subsidiaries under long-term contracts have liquidated
    damages provisions. Contractual liquidated damages under the
    long-term contracts with such provisions would not be expected
    to exceed $200 million AUD. In their Harris County
    petition, Burrup Fertilisers and its underwriters and insurers
    seek to recover unspecified actual damages, cost of repair and
    replacement, exemplary damages, lost profits, loss of business
    goodwill, value of the gas lost under the GSA, interest and
    court costs. No assurance can be given that Burrup Fertilisers
    and other customers would not assert claims in excess of
    contractual liquidated damages, and exposure related to such
    claims is not currently determinable. While an adverse judgment
    against Company subsidiaries (and Company, in the case of the
    Burrup Fertilisers lawsuit) is possible, Company and Company
    subsidiaries do not believe any such claims would have merit and
    plan to vigorously pursue their defenses against any such claims.

In December 2008, the Senate Economics Committee of the
    Parliament of Australia released its findings from public
    hearings concerning the economic impact of the gas shortage
    following the explosion on Varanus Island and the
    government’s response. The Committee concluded, among other
    things, that the macroeconomic impact to Western Australia will
    never be precisely known, but cited to a range of estimates from
    $300 million AUD to $2.5 billion AUD consisting in
    part of losses alleged by some parties who have long-term
    contracts with Company subsidiaries (as described above), but
    also losses alleged by third parties who do not have contracts
    with Company subsidiaries (but who may have purchased gas that
    was re-sold by customers or who may have paid more for energy
    following the explosion or who lost wages or sales due to the
    inability to obtain energy or the increased price of energy). A
    timber industry group, whose members do not have a contract with
    Company subsidiaries, has announced that it intends to seek
    compensation for its members and their subcontractors from
    Company subsidiaries for $20 million AUD in losses
    allegedly incurred as a result of the gas supply shortage
    following the explosion. In

Johnson Tiles Pty Ltd v.
    Esso Australia Pty Ltd

[2003] VSC 27 (Supreme Court of
    Victoria, Gillard J presiding), which concerned a 1998 explosion
    at an Esso natural gas processing plant at Longford in East
    Gippsland, Victoria, the Court held that Esso was not liable for
    $1.3 billion AUD of pure economic losses suffered by
    claimants that had no contract with Esso, but was liable to such
    claimants for reasonably foreseeable property damage which Esso
    settled for $32.5 million plus costs. In reaching this
    decision the Court held that third-party claimants should have
    protected themselves from pure economic losses, through the
    purchase of insurance or the installation of adequate backup
    measures, in case of an interruption in their gas supply from
    Esso. While an adverse judgment against Company subsidiaries is
    possible if litigation is filed, Company subsidiaries do not
    believe any such claims would have merit and plan to vigorously
    pursue their defenses against any such claims. Exposure related
    to any such potential claims is not currently determinable.

On October 10, 2008, the Australia National Offshore
    Petroleum Safety Authority (NOPSA) released a self-titled
    “Final Report” of the findings of its investigation
    into the pipeline explosion, prepared at the request of the
    Western Australian Department of Industry and Resources (DoIR).
    NOPSA concluded in its report that the evidence gathered to date
    indicates that the main causal factors in the incident were:
    (1) ineffective anti-corrosion coating at the beach
    crossing section of the

12-inch

sales gas pipeline, due to damage

and/or

dis-bondment from the pipeline; (2) ineffective cathodic
    protection of the wet-dry transition zone of the beach crossing
    section of the

12-inch

sales gas pipeline; and (3) ineffective inspection and
    monitoring by Company subsidiaries of the beach crossing and
    shallow water section of the

12-inch

sales gas pipeline. NOPSA further concluded that the
    investigation identified that Apache Northwest Pty Ltd and its
    co-licensees may have committed offences under the Petroleum
    Pipelines Act 1969, Sections 36A & 38(b) and the
    Petroleum Pipelines Regulations 1970, Regulation 10, and
    that some findings may also constitute non-compliance with
    pipeline license conditions. NOPSA states in its report that an
    application for renewal of the pipeline license covering the
    area of the Varanus

Island facility was granted in May 1985 with 21 years
    validity, and an application for renewal of the license was
    submitted to DoIR by Company subsidiaries in December 2005 and
    remains pending.

Company subsidiaries disagree with NOPSA’s conclusions and
    believe that the NOPSA report is premature, based on an
    incomplete investigation and misleading. In a July 17,
    2008, media statement, DoIR acknowledged, “The pipelines
    and Varanus Island facilities have been the subject of an
    independent validation report [by Lloyd’s Register] which
    was received in August 2007. NOPSA has also undertaken a number
    of inspections between 2005 and the present.” These and
    numerous other inspections, audits and reviews conducted by top
    international consultants and regulators did not identify any
    warnings that the pipeline had a corrosion problem or other
    issues that could lead to its failure. Company subsidiaries
    believe that the explosion was not reasonably foreseeable, and
    was not within the reasonable control of Company’s
    subsidiaries or able to be reasonably prevented by Company
    subsidiaries.

On January 9, 2009, the governments of Western Australia
    and the Commonwealth of Australia announced a joint inquiry to
    consider the effectiveness of the regulatory regime for
    occupational health and safety and integrity that applied to
    operations and facilities at Varanus Island and the role of
    DoIR, NOPSA and the Western Australian Department of Consumer
    and Employment Protection (DoCEP). The joint inquiry’s
    report was published in June 2009.

On May 8, 2009, the government of Western Australia
    announced that its Department of Mines and Petroleum (DMP) will
    carry out “the final stage of investigations into the
    Varanus Island gas explosion.” Inspectors were appointed
    under the Petroleum Pipelines Act to coordinate the final stage
    of the investigations. Their report has been delivered to the
    Minister for Mines and Petroleum, but neither the report nor its
    contents have been made available to Company subsidiaries for
    their review and comment.

On May 28, 2009, the DMP filed a prosecution notice in the
    Magistrates Court of Western Australia, charging Apache
    Northwest Pty Ltd and its co-licensees with failure to maintain
    a pipeline in good condition and repair under the Petroleum
    Pipelines Act 1969, Section 38(b). The maximum fine
    associated with the alleged offense is AUD$50,000. The Company
    subsidiary does not believe that the charge has merit and plans
    to vigorously pursue its defenses.

Seismic
    License

In December 1996, the Company and Fairfield Industries
    Incorporated entered into a Master Licensing Agreement for the
    licensing of seismic data relating to certain blocks in the Gulf
    of Mexico. The Company and Fairfield also entered into
    supplemental agreements specifying the data to be licensed to
    the Company as well as the consideration due Fairfield. In
    February 2009, the Company filed an action in Texas state court
    seeking a declaration of the parties’ contractual
    obligations. The Company and its subsidiary, GOM Shelf LLC, have
    also asserted a claim to recover damages for certain
    overpayments to Fairfield under the parties’ agreements.
    Fairfield and a related entity, Fairfield Royalty Corporation,
    have attempted to counterclaim to recover unspecified damages
    for alleged underpayments. Because the lawsuit is still in the
    discovery phase, potential exposure related to the attempted
    counterclaim is not currently determinable. While an adverse
    judgment is possible with respect to the attempted counterclaim,
    the Company does not believe that the attempted counterclaim has
    merit and plans to vigorously pursue all defenses.

Environmental
    Matters

The Company, as an owner or lessee and operator of oil and gas
    properties, is subject to various federal, provincial, state,
    local and foreign country laws and regulations relating to
    discharge of materials into, and protection of, the environment.
    These laws and regulations may, among other things, impose
    liability on the lessee under an oil and gas lease for the cost
    of pollution

clean-up

resulting from operations and subject to the lessee to liability
    for pollution damages. In some instances, the Company may be
    directed to suspend or cease operations in

the affected area. We maintain insurance coverage, which we
    believe is customary in the industry, although we are not fully
    insured against all environmental risks.

Apache manages its exposure to environmental liabilities on
    properties to be acquired by identifying existing problems and
    assessing the potential liability. The Company also conducts
    periodic reviews, on a Company-wide basis, to identify changes
    in its environmental risk profile. These reviews evaluate
    whether there is a probable liability, the amount, and the
    likelihood that the liability will be incurred. The amount of
    any potential liability is determined by considering, among
    other matters, incremental direct costs of any likely
    remediation and the proportionate cost of employees who are
    expected to devote a significant amount of time directly to any
    possible remediation effort. As it relates to evaluations of
    purchased properties, depending on the extent of an identified
    environmental problem, the Company may exclude a property from
    the acquisition, require the seller to remediate the property to
    Apache’s satisfaction, or agree to assume liability for the
    remediation of the property. The Company’s general policy
    is to limit any reserve additions to any incidents or sites that
    are considered probable to result in an expected remediation
    cost exceeding $300,000. Any environmental costs and liabilities
    that are not reserved for are treated as an expense when
    actually incurred. In our estimation, neither these expenses nor
    expenses related to training and compliance programs are likely
    to have a material impact on our financial condition.

As of December 31, 2009, the Company had an undiscounted
    reserve for environmental remediation of approximately
    $27 million. Apache is not aware of any environmental
    claims existing as of December 31, 2009 that have not been
    provided for or would otherwise have a material impact on its
    financial position or results of operations. There can be no
    assurance however, that current regulatory requirements will not
    change or past non-compliance with environmental laws will not
    be discovered on the Company’s properties.

Also, the Government of Alberta Climate Change and Emissions
    Management Act requires companies to meet emissions intensity
    reduction obligations either by making operational improvements
    to reduce emissions or by making compliance obligation payments.
    Payments made in 2009 to comply with the requirements of this
    act based on the volume of GHG emitted from Apache Canada
    Ltd.’s Zama gas processing facility in 2008 totaled
    approximately $300,000.

Retirement
    and Deferred Compensation Plans

Apache Corporation provides retirement benefits to its
    U.S. employees through the use of three types of plans: an
    Internal Revenue Code (IRC) 401(k) savings plan, a money
    purchase pension plan and a restorative non-qualified retirement
    savings plan. The 401(k) savings plan provides participating
    employees the ability to elect to contribute up to
    50 percent of eligible compensation to the plan with the
    Company making matching contributions up to a maximum of six
    percent of each employee’s annual covered compensation. In
    addition, the Company annually contributes six percent of each
    participating employee’s compensation, as defined, to a
    money purchase retirement plan. The 401(k) plan and the money
    purchase retirement plan are subject to certain
    annually-adjusted, government-mandated restrictions that limit
    the amount of employee and Company contributions. For certain
    eligible employees, the Company also provides a non-qualified
    retirement/savings plan that allows the deferral of up to
    50 percent of each employee’s salary and that accepts
    employee contributions and the Company’s matching
    contributions in excess of the government mandated limitations
    imposed in the 401(k) savings plan and money purchase retirement
    plan.

Vesting in the Company’s contributions in the 401(k)
    savings plan, the money purchase retirement plan and the
    non-qualified retirement/savings plan occurs at the rate of
    20 percent for every full year of employment. Upon a change
    in control of ownership, immediate and full vesting occurs.

Additionally, Apache Energy Limited, Apache Canada Ltd. and
    Apache North Sea Limited maintain separate retirement plans, as
    required under the laws of Australia, Canada and the United
    Kingdom, respectively.

F-37


APACHE
    CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The aggregate annual cost of the 401(k) savings plans, the money
    purchase retirement plan and the non-qualified
    retirement/savings plans was $66 million, $52 million
    and $59 million for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

Apache also provides a funded noncontributory defined benefit
    pension plan (U.K. Pension Plan) covering certain employees of
    the Company’s North Sea operations in the United Kingdom
    (U.K.). The plan provides defined pension benefits based on
    years of service and final average salary. The plan applies only
    to employees who were part of the BP North Sea’s pension
    plan as of April 2, 2003, prior to the acquisition of BP
    North Sea by the Company effective July 1, 2003.

Additionally, the Company offers postretirement medical benefits
    to U.S. employees who meet certain eligibility
    requirements. Covered participants receive medical benefits up
    until the age of 65 or the Medicare eligibility date, if later,
    provided the participant remits the required portion of the cost
    of coverage. The plan is contributory with participants’
    contributions adjusted annually. The postretirement benefit plan
    does not cover benefit expenses once a covered participant
    becomes eligible for Medicare.

As of December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, the accumulated
    benefit obligation for the pension plan was $89 million,
    $69 million and $91 million, respectively.

Apache’s defined benefit pension plan assets are held by a
    non-related trustee who has been instructed to invest the assets
    in an equal blend of equity securities and low-risk debt
    securities. The Company intends that this blend of investments
    will provide a reasonable rate of return such that the benefits
    promised to members are provided.

The U.K. Pension Plan policy is to target an ongoing funding
    level of 100 percent through prudent investments and
    includes policies and strategies such as investment goals, risk
    management practices and permitted and prohibited investments. A

SUBSEQUENT
    EVENTS

Subsequent events have been evaluated for recognition and
    disclosure through the date these financial statements were
    filed with the SEC.

Kitimat
    LNG Terminal

On January 13, 2010, Apache announced that its Apache
    Canada Ltd. subsidiary has agreed to acquire 51 percent of
    Kitimat LNG Inc.’s proposed LNG export terminal in British
    Columbia. Apache also reserved 51 percent of gas throughput
    capacity in the terminal.

The proposed Kitimat project, located at Bish Cove near the Port
    of Kitimat about 405 miles north of Vancouver, has planned
    capacity of about

700 MMcf/d,

or five million metric tons of LNG per year. Preliminary gross
    construction cost estimates of C$3 billion will be refined
    at the conclusion of Front-End Engineering and Design. The
    project is projected to employ an estimated 1,500 people
    during construction and 100 on a permanent basis.

Kitimat is designed to be linked to the pipeline system
    servicing Western Canada’s natural gas producing regions
    via the proposed Pacific Trail Pipelines, a C$1.1 billion
    project. In association with our acquisition of interest in the
    Kitimat project, we also acquired a 25.5-percent interest in the
    proposed pipeline and 350 MMcf/d of capacity rights.

FAIR
    VALUE MEASUREMENTS

ASC

820-10-35

provides a hierarchy that prioritizes and defines the types of
    inputs used to measure fair value. The fair value hierarchy
    gives the highest priority to Level 1 inputs, which consist
    of unadjusted quoted prices for identical instruments in active
    markets. Level 2 inputs consist of quoted prices for
    similar instruments. Level 3 valuations are derived from
    inputs that are significant and unobservable, and these
    valuations have the lowest priority.

Assets
    and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring
    Basis

Certain assets and liabilities are reported at fair value on a
    recurring basis in Apache’s Consolidated Balance Sheet. The
    following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair
    values:

Cash,
    Cash Equivalents, Short-Term Investments, Accounts Receivable
    and Accounts Payable

The carrying amounts approximate fair value due to the
    short-term nature or maturity of the instruments.

Commodity
    Derivative Instruments

Apache’s commodity derivative instruments consist of

variable-to-fixed

price commodity swaps and options. The Company estimates the
    fair values of derivative instruments using published commodity
    futures price strips for the underlying commodities as of the
    date of the estimate. The fair values of the Company’s
    derivative instruments are not actively quoted in the open
    market and are valued using forward commodity price curves
    provided by a reputable third-party. These valuations are
    Level 2 inputs. See Note 3 — Derivative
    Instruments and Hedging Activities for further information.

The following table presents the Company’s material assets
    and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis for
    each hierarchy level:

The derivative fair values above are based on analysis of each
    contract as required by ASC Topic 820. Derivative assets and
    liabilities with the same counterparty are presented here on a
    gross basis, even where the legal right of offset exists. See

Assets
    and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring
    Basis

Certain assets and liabilities are reported at fair value on a
    nonrecurring basis in Apache’s Consolidated Balance Sheet.
    The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate fair
    values:

Asset
    Retirement Obligations Incurred in Current Period

Apache estimates the fair value of AROs based on discounted cash
    flow projections using numerous estimates, assumptions and
    judgments regarding such factors as the existence of a legal
    obligation for an ARO; estimated probabilities, amounts and
    timing of settlements; the credit-adjusted risk-free rate to be
    used; and inflation rates. AROs incurred in the current period
    were Level 3 fair value measurements.
    Note 4 — Asset Retirement Obligation provides a
    summary of changes in the ARO liability.

Debt

The Company’s debt is recorded at the carrying amount on
    its Consolidated Balance Sheet. The fair value of Apache’s
    fixed-rate debt is based upon estimates provided by an
    independent investment banking firm, which is a Level 2
    fair value measurement. The carrying amount of floating-rate
    debt approximates fair value because the

interest rates are variable and reflective of market rates. The

The carrying amount of the commercial paper and money market

    rates are variable and reflective of market rates. The
    Company’s trade receivables, trade payables and short-term
    investments are, by their very nature, short-term. The carrying
    values included in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet
    approximate fair value at December 31, 2009 and 2008.

MAJOR
    CUSTOMERS

In 2009, 2008 and 2007, purchases by Shell accounted for
    18 percent, 17 percent and 12 percent,
    respectively, of the Company’s worldwide oil and gas
    production revenues.

Concentration
    of Credit Risk

While Apache experienced a decline in the timeliness of receipts
    from EGPC for oil and gas sales in recent years, the Company saw
    significant improvement in collections throughout 2009.

Proved
    Undeveloped Reserves

The Company’s total estimated proved undeveloped reserves
    of 731 MMboe as of December 31, 2009, increased by
    54 MMboe over the 677 MMboe of PUD reserves estimated
    at the end of 2008. During the year, Apache converted
    39 MMboe of proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed
    reserves through development drilling activity. In North America
    we converted 22 MMboe with the remaining 17 MMboe in
    our international areas.

During the year a total of $760 million was spent on
    projects associated with reserves that were carried as PUD
    reserves at the end of 2008. Not all of those expenditures
    resulted in a conversion from proved undeveloped to proved
    developed reserves during the year. We spent $264 million
    on PUD reserve development activity in North America and
    $496 million in the international areas, including
    $230 million in Australia where the reserves for those
    projects will be converted to developed in future years.

Oil
    and Gas Reserve Information

In January 2009, the SEC issued Release

No. 33-8995

amending oil and gas reporting requirements under

Rule 4-10

of

Regulation S-X

and Industry Guide 2 in

Regulation S-K

and bringing full-cost accounting rules into alignment with the
    revised disclosure requirements. The new rules include changes
    to the pricing used to estimate reserves, the option to disclose
    probable and possible reserves, revised definitions for proved
    reserves, additional disclosures with respect to undeveloped
    reserves, and other new or revised definitions and disclosures.
    In January 2010, the FASB issued ASU

No. 2010-03

,

which amends ASC Topic 932 to align the guidance with the
    changes made by the SEC. The Company adopted these Modernization
    Rules effective December 31, 2009, and the impact of the
    adoption did not have a material impact on our results of
    operations.

The new rules require the use of a 12-month average price,
    instead of a single-day period end price, to calculate reserves.
    Application of these rules resulted in the use of lower prices
    at December 31, 2009, for both oil and gas than would have
    resulted under the previous rules. Using these lower commodity
    prices reduced the Company’s standardized measure and the
    quantities of estimated proved reserves that were reported. The
    effect of applying the new definition of reliable technology and
    other non-price related aspects of the updated rules did not
    have a significant impact on our estimated proved reserves at
    December 31, 2009.

Apache’s proved reserves are estimated at the property
    level and compiled for reporting purposes by a centralized group
    of experienced reservoir engineers that is independent of the
    operating groups. These engineers interact with engineering and
    geoscience personnel in each of Apache’s operating areas
    and with accounting and marketing employees to obtain the
    necessary data for projecting future production, costs, net
    revenues and ultimate recoverable reserves. All relevant data is
    compiled in a computer database application, to which only
    authorized

personnel are given security access rights consistent with their
    assigned job function. Reserves are reviewed internally with
    senior management and presented to Apache’s Board of
    Directors in summary form on a quarterly basis. Annually, each
    property is reviewed in detail by our centralized and operating
    region engineers to ensure forecasts of operating expenses,
    netback prices, production trends and development timing are
    reasonable.

Apache’s Executive Vice President of Corporate Reservoir
    Engineering, W. Kregg Olson, is the person primarily responsible
    for overseeing the preparation of our internal reserve estimates
    and for coordinating any reserves audits conducted by a
    third-party engineering firm. Mr. Olson is a graduate of
    Texas A&M University with a Bachelor of Science degree in
    Petroleum Engineering. He has over 29 years of industry
    experience, with the last 25 years focused on reservoir
    engineering. He is a member of the Society of Petroleum
    Engineers and is a Registered Professional Engineer in the state
    of Oklahoma. Mr. Olson has held positions of increasing
    responsibility within Apache’s corporate reservoir
    engineering department since joining the company in 1992.

The estimate of reserves disclosed in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

is prepared by the Company’s internal staff, and the
    Company is responsible for the adequacy and accuracy of those
    estimates. However, the Company engages Ryder Scott Company,
    L.P. Petroleum Consultants (Ryder Scott) to review our processes
    and the reasonableness of our estimates of proved hydrocarbon
    liquid and gas reserves. Apache selects the properties for
    review by Ryder Scott. These properties represented all material
    fields, and over 85 percent of international properties and
    new wells drilled during the year. During 2009, 2008, and 2007,
    Ryder Scott’s review covered 79, 82 and 77 percent of
    the Company’s worldwide estimated reserves value,
    respectively. We have filed Ryder Scott’s independent
    report as an exhibit to this

Form 10-K.

Ryder Scott opined that the overall proved reserves for the
    reviewed properties as estimated by the Company are, in the
    aggregate, reasonable, prepared in accordance with generally
    accepted petroleum engineering and evaluation principles and
    conform to the SEC’s definition of proved reserves as set
    forth in

Rule 210.4-10(a)

of

Regulation S-X.

Ryder Scott has informed the Company that the tests and
    procedures used during its reserves audit conform to the
    Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and
    Gas Reserves Information approved by the Society of Petroleum
    Engineers. Paragraph 2.2(f) of the Standards Pertaining to
    the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information
    defines a reserves audit as the process of reviewing certain of
    the pertinent facts interpreted and assumptions made that have
    resulted in an estimate of reserves prepared by others and the
    rendering of an opinion about (1) the appropriateness of
    the methodologies employed, (2) the adequacy and quality of
    the data relied upon, (3) the depth and thoroughness of the
    reserves estimation process, (4) the classification of
    reserves appropriate to the relevant definitions used and
    (5) the reasonableness of the estimated reserve quantities.
    A reserve audit is not the same as a financial audit and is less
    rigorous in nature than an independent reserve report where the
    independent reserve engineer determines the reserves on his own.

Approximately 21 percent of our year-end 2009 estimated
    proved developed reserves are classified as proved not
    producing. These reserves relate to zones that are either behind
    pipe, or that have been completed but not yet produced, or zones
    that have been produced in the past, but are not now producing
    because of mechanical reasons. These reserves are considered to
    be a lower tier of reserves than producing reserves because they
    are frequently based on volumetric calculations rather than
    performance data. Future production associated with behind pipe
    reserves is scheduled to follow depletion of the currently
    producing zones in the same wellbores. It should be noted that
    additional capital may have to be spent to access these
    reserves. The capital and economic impact of production timing
    are reflected in this Note 13, under “Future Net Cash
    Flows.”

Future
    Net Cash Flows

Future cash inflows as of December 31, 2009 were calculated
    using an average of oil and gas prices in effect on the first
    day of each month in 2009, except where prices are defined by
    contractual arrangements. Future cash inflows as of
    December 31, 2008 and 2007 were estimated using oil and gas
    prices in effect at the end of those years, except where prices
    are defined by contractual arrangements, in accordance with SEC
    guidance in effect prior to the issuance of the Modernization
    Rules. Operating costs, production and ad valorem taxes and
    future development costs are based on current costs with no
    escalation.

The following table sets forth unaudited information concerning
    future net cash flows for oil and gas reserves, net of income
    tax expense. Income tax expense has been computed using expected
    future tax rates and giving effect to tax deductions and credits
    available, under current laws, and which relate to oil and gas
    producing activities. This information does not purport to
    present the fair market value of the Company’s oil and gas
    assets, but does present a standardized disclosure concerning
    possible future net cash flows that would result under the
    assumptions used.

SUPPLEMENTAL
    GUARANTOR INFORMATION

Rule 3-10

of SEC

Regulation S-X

(Rule 3-10)

generally requires filing of financial statements by every
    issuer of a registered security. Issuers with no independent
    operations qualify as “finance subsidiaries” and are
    exempt from the reporting requirements. Apache Finance Australia
    and Apache Finance Canada qualified as “finance
    subsidiaries” until Apache, during 2001, contributed stock
    of its Australian and Canadian operating subsidiaries to Apache
    Finance Australia and Apache Finance Canada, respectively.

Rule 3-10

also allows condensed consolidating financial statements in a
    footnote of the parent company financial statements as an
    alternative to filing separate financial statements, if the
    publicly-traded notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed
    by the parent company.

Each of the companies presented in the condensed consolidating
    financial statements is wholly owned and has been consolidated
    in Apache Corporation’s consolidated financial statements
    for all periods presented. As such, the condensed consolidating
    financial statements should be read in conjunction with the
    financial statements of Apache Corporation and subsidiaries and
    notes thereto of which this note is an integral part.

Apache
    Finance Australia

Apache Finance Australia issued approximately $270 million
    of publicly-traded notes that were fully and unconditionally
    guaranteed by Apache and, beginning in 2001, also by Apache
    North America, Inc. In 2007, $170 million of these notes
    matured and were repaid. The remaining $100 million of
    publicly-traded notes matured on March 15, 2009, and were
    repaid using existing cash balances.

Apache
    Finance Canada

Apache Finance Canada issued approximately $300 million of
    publicly-traded notes due in 2029 and an additional
    $350 million of publicly-traded notes due in 2015 that are
    fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Apache.
