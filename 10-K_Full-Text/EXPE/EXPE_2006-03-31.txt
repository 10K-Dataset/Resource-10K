Management Overview

General Description of our Business

Expedia, Inc. is an online travel company, empowering business
and leisure travelers with the tools and information they need
to efficiently research, plan, book and experience travel. We
have created a global travel marketplace used by a broad range
of leisure and corporate travelers and offline retail travel
agents. We make available, on a stand-alone and package basis,
travel products and services provided by numerous airlines,
lodging properties, car rental companies, destination service
providers, cruise lines and other travel products and services.

Our portfolio of brands, which are described below, include:
Expedia-branded websites, Hotels.com, Hotwire.com, Worldwide
Travel Exchange (“WWTE”) and Interactive Affiliate
Network (“IAN”), Classic Vacations, Expedia Corporate
Travel, eLong and TripAdvisor.

Summary of the Spin-Off from IAC/InterActiveCorp

On December 21, 2004, IAC/InterActiveCorp (“IAC”)
announced its plan to separate into two independent public
companies to allow each company to focus on its individual
strategic objectives. We refer to this transaction as the
“Spin-Off.” A new company, Expedia, Inc., was
incorporated under Delaware law in April 2005, to hold
substantially all of IAC’s travel and travel-related
businesses.

On August 9, 2005, the Spin-Off was completed and Expedia,
Inc. shares began trading on The Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc. under
the symbol “EXPE.” In conjunction with the Spin-Off,
we completed the following transactions: (1) transferred to
IAC all cash in excess of $100 million, excluding the cash
and cash equivalents held by eLong, (2) extinguished all
intercompany receivable balances from IAC, which totaled
$2.5 billion by recording a non-cash distribution to IAC,
(3) recorded a non-cash



contribution from IAC of a joint ownership interest in an
airplane, with a value of $17.4 million, (4) recorded
a non-cash contribution of media time, with a value of
$17.1 million, (5) recorded derivative liabilities for
the stock warrants and Ask Jeeves Convertible Subordinated Notes
(“Ask Jeeves Notes”) with a fair value of
$101.6 million, (6) recorded a modification of
stock-based compensation awards of $5.4 million, and
(7) recapitalized the invested equity balance with common
stock, Class B common stock and preferred stock, whereby
holders of IAC stock received shares of Expedia stock based on a
formula. For additional information about the Spin-Off, see
Note 1, Organization and Basis of Presentation, in the
notes to consolidated financial statements.

Equity Ownership and Voting Control

As of February 28, 2006, there were approximately
323,069,100 shares of Expedia common stock,
25,599,998 shares of Expedia Class B common stock and
846 shares of Expedia preferred stock outstanding. Liberty
Media Corporation (“Liberty”) through companies owned
by Liberty and companies owned jointly by Liberty and Barry
Diller, Chairman and Senior Executive of Expedia, beneficially
owned approximately 18% of Expedia’s outstanding common
stock and 100% of Expedia’s outstanding Class B common
stock. As of such date, Mr. Diller (through companies owned
jointly by Liberty and Mr. Diller, his own holdings and
holdings of Liberty, over which Mr. Diller generally has
voting control pursuant to an irrevocable proxy granted by
Liberty under the Stockholders Agreement described below)
controlled approximately 53% of the outstanding total voting
power of Expedia.

Subject to the Stockholders Agreement, dated as of
August 9, 2005, between Liberty and Mr. Diller,
Mr. Diller is effectively able to control the outcome of
nearly all matters submitted to a vote or for the consent of
Expedia’s stockholders (other than with respect to the
election by the Expedia common stockholders of 25% of the
members of Expedia’s Board of Directors and certain matters
as to which a separate class vote of the holders of Expedia
common stock or Expedia preferred stock is required under
Delaware law). In addition, pursuant to the Governance
Agreement, dated as of August 9, 2005, among Expedia,
Liberty and Mr. Diller, each of Mr. Diller and Liberty
generally has the right to consent to certain significant
corporate actions in the event that Expedia’s ratio of
total debt to EBITDA, as defined therein, equals or exceeds four
to one over a continuous

12-month

period.

Portfolio of Brands

We leverage our portfolio of brands to target the broadest range
of travelers looking for different travel options. Our brands
provide a wide selection of travel products and services, from
simple, discounted travel to more complex, luxury travel. Our
products primarily consist of air, hotel, car rental,
destination services and cruise.

Expedia.

Our Expedia-branded websites make a large
variety of travel products and services available directly to
travelers through our

U.S.-based

website,
www.expedia.com, as well as through localized versions of our
website in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, the
Netherlands and the United Kingdom (“U.K.”).
Expedia-branded websites also serve as the travel channel on
MSN.com, Microsoft Corporation’s (“Microsoft”)
online services network in the United States, as well as certain
international MSN sites. Expedia-branded websites target many
different types of consumers, from families booking a summer
vacation to individual travelers arranging a quick weekend
getaway. Travelers can search for, compare information about
(including pricing and availability) and book travel products
and services on Expedia-branded websites, including airline
tickets, lodging, car rentals, cruises and many destination
services, such as attractions and tours, from a large number of
suppliers, on a stand-alone or package basis.

Hotels.com.

Our Hotels.com website makes available a
large variety of lodging options to travelers, who can plan,
shop for and book lodging accommodations, from traditional
hotels to vacation rentals. Hotels.com seeks to provide
travelers with premium content and service through our

U.S.-based

website,
www.hotels.com (as well as localized versions in the Americas,
Europe, Asia Pacific and South Africa), our vacation rentals
website at www.vacationspot.com and our call centers. Through
Hotels.com, we are



pursuing a strategy focused on differentiating our service
offerings by positioning ourselves as a hotel expert with
premium content about lodging properties, while simultaneously
broadening our focus to include other travel products and
services.

Hotwire.com.

Our discount travel website, Hotwire.com,
makes available airline tickets, hotel rooms, rental cars,
cruises and vacation packages. Hotwire.com’s approach
matches the price-sensitive travelers willing to be flexible to
save money with suppliers who have excess seats, rooms and cars
they wish to fill without affecting the public’s perception
of their brands. Hotwire.com travelers may enjoy significant
discounts by electing to book travel services
“opaquely” or “semi-opaquely,” without
knowing certain itinerary details such as brand, time of
departure and exact hotel location, while suppliers create value
from excess inventory without diluting their core brand-loyal
traveler base. Hotwire.com works with many domestic and
international airlines, including United States full-service
major network airlines, top hotels in hundreds of cities and
resort destinations in the United States, Europe, Canada, Mexico
and the Caribbean and major car rental companies in the United
States.

WWTE and IAN.

Our private label programs make travel
products and services available to travelers through third party
company-branded websites. The products and services made
available through our websites, www.wwte.com and www.ian.com,
are based on those made available on Expedia-branded and
Hotels.com-branded websites, respectively. We generally
compensate participants in the WWTE and IAN private label
programs on a revenue-share basis.

Classic Vacations.

We offer individually tailored
vacations that we provide primarily through a national network
of third-party retail travel agents. We deliver a full line of
premium vacation packages — air, hotels, car rentals,
activities and private transportation — to create
customized luxury vacations in Hawaii, the Caribbean, Mexico,
Costa Rica, Europe and Tahiti. Travel agents and travelers can
preview our product offering through our websites,
www.classicforagents.com and www.classicvacations.com.

Destination Services.

Our network of in-destination
travel desks located at hotels and resorts in Florida, Hawaii
and Mexico makes available to travelers the opportunity to
obtain tours, attractions, airport transfer services and other
travel-related services. Our network expanded through our
acquisition of Activity World, a destination service provider in
Hawaii in 2004, and our 2005 acquisition of Premier Getaways, a
destination service provider in Florida.

Expedia Corporate Travel (“ECT”).

Our
full-service travel management company makes travel products and
services available to corporate travelers in the United States,
Canada and Europe. In 2004, we established ECT —
Europe, which includes Egencia and World Travel Management, both
of which were acquired in 2004. ECT provides, among other
things, centralized booking tools for employees of our corporate
travelers, support of negotiated airfares and consolidated
reporting aimed at small- and mid-sized businesses. ECT charges
corporate client companies

sign-up

and

set-up

fees, as well as
transactional fees for making or changing bookings. In addition,
ECT provides

on-site

agents to some corporate clients in order to fully support the
account.

eLong.

Our majority owned online travel service company,
based in Beijing, People’s Republic of China
(“China”), specializes in travel products and services
in China. eLong uses web-based distribution technologies and a

24-hour

nationwide call
center to provide consumers with consolidated travel information
and the ability to access hotel reservations at discounted rates
at over 3,000 hotels in major cities across China. eLong also
offers air ticketing and other travel related services, such as
rental cars and vacation packages. Travelers can access travel
products and services through the websites, www.elong.com and
www.elong.net.

TripAdvisor.

Our comprehensive online travel search
engine and directory aggregates unbiased articles, guidebook
reviews and user opinions on cities, hotels and activities in a
variety of given destinations from a number of online sources
through our website, www.tripadvisor.com. In addition to
travel-related information, TripAdvisor’s
destination-specific search results provide links to the
websites of TripAdvisor’s travel partners (travel service
providers and marketers) through which travelers can make
related travel arrangements.



Business Strategy

We are in the early stages of leveraging our historic strength
as an efficient transaction processor to become a retailer and
merchandiser of travel experiences. Our goal is to help
travelers enjoy their trips; from before the reservation is
made, to after the trip has been taken.

Our business strategy is as follows:

Leverage Our Portfolio of Travel Brands.

We seek to
appeal to the broadest possible range of travelers and suppliers
through our collection of industry-leading brands. We target
several different demographics, from the value-conscious
traveler through our Hotwire brand to luxury travelers seeking a
high-touch, customized vacation package through our Classic
Vacations brand. We believe our flagship Expedia brand appeals
to the broadest range of travelers, with our extensive product
offering and facilitation of single item purchases of discounted
product to complex bundling of higher-end travel packages. Our
Hotels.com site and its international versions target travelers
with premium content about lodging properties, and generally
appeal to travelers with shorter booking windows who prefer to
drive to their destination.

We believe our appeal to suppliers is enhanced by our brand
portfolio and our international points of presence, by allowing
suppliers to access the broadest possible range of travelers
with their product and service offerings. We intend to continue
supporting and investing in our brand portfolio for the benefit
of travelers and suppliers.

Innovate on Behalf of Travelers and Supplier Partners.

We
have a long tradition of innovation, from Expedia.com’s
inception as a division of Microsoft, to our introduction of
Best Fare Search and dynamic packaging technologies to more
recent innovations such as traveler reviews, Personal Trip
Guides, Expedia Corporate Travel’s TripController software
and our AirShopper

e-mail

campaign.

A recent innovation of note was Expedia.com’s introduction
of its Best Price Guarantee in early 2006. We increase our
travelers’ confidence and their likelihood of purchase by
assuring them that our pricing is competitive. If travelers find
a better price online for the same trip within 24 hours, we
refund the difference and we give them a $50 travel coupon
towards their next qualifying trip, subject to certain
restrictions.

We intend to continue innovating on behalf of our travelers. We
are currently investing in and building a scaleable, extensible,
service-oriented technology platform, which will extend across
our portfolio of brands. This will result in improved
flexibility and faster go-forward innovation. This transition
will allow us to improve our site merchandising, browse and
search functionality and add significant personalization
features. We expect this transition to occur in a phased
approach, with worldwide points of sale migrating to the new
platform by early 2008.

We also intend to continue innovating on behalf of our
suppliers. As an example, we have developed proprietary,
supplier-oriented technology that streamlines the interaction
between some of our websites and hotel central reservation
systems, making it easier and more cost-effective for hotels to
manage reservations made through our brands. Through this
“direct connect” technology, hotels can upload
information about available products and services and rates
directly from their central reservation systems into our
websites, as well as automatically confirm hotel reservations
made by our travelers. In the absence of direct connect
technology, both of these processes are generally completed
manually via a proprietary



extranet. Our travelers can book reservations with over 25,000
worldwide merchant hotel properties, of which over 30% are now
fully direct-connected. We expect that this number will increase
in the future.

We are also adding a significant upgrade to our data aggregation
and mining capabilities across Expedia with the installation of
an enterprise data warehouse, which will allow enhanced
personalization on both our websites and

e-mail

communications
with our travelers. This investment will also yield phased
benefits, with the full project scheduled for completion in 2008.

Expand our International and Corporate Travel Businesses.

We currently operate Expedia-branded sites in the U.S., Canada,
U.K., Germany, France, Italy, the Netherlands and Australia.
Through our controlling ownership in eLong, we maintain a point
of sale for Chinese travelers, and through Hotels.com,
Hotwire.com and TripAdvisor brands we maintain additional points
of presence beyond the U.S. In 2005, our international
gross bookings accounted for approximately 22% of worldwide
gross bookings.

We intend to continue investing in and growing our existing
international points of sale. In addition, we anticipate
launching point of sales in additional countries in the future
where we find large travel markets and rapid growth of online
commerce. As an example, we plan to enter the Japanese travel
sector by the end of 2006. Future launches may occur under our
flagship Expedia brand or our other brands, or through
acquisition of third party brands, as in the case of eLong.

ECT currently conducts operations in the U.S., Canada, U.K.,
France, Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg. We believe the
corporate travel sector represents a large opportunity for
Expedia, and we believe we offer a compelling technology
solution to small and medium-sized businesses seeking to control
travel costs and improve their employees’ travel
experiences. Expanding our corporate travel business also
increases our appeal to travel product and service suppliers, as
the average corporate traveler has a higher incidence of first
class and international travel than the average leisure traveler.

We intend to continue investing in and expanding the geographic
footprint of our ECT business. ECT currently accounts for less
than 5% of our worldwide gross bookings, but we anticipate
growth over the next few years.

Expand our Product and Service Offerings Worldwide.

In
general, our Expedia.com site has offered the most comprehensive
array of innovation and selection of travel products and
services to travelers. We plan to continue improving and growing
these offerings at Expedia.com, as well as expand them to our
worldwide points of sale.

The majority of our revenue comes from transactions involving
the sale of airline tickets and the booking of hotel
reservations, either as stand-alone products or as part of
package transactions. We are working to grow our package
business as it results in higher revenue per transaction, and we
also seek to continue diversifying our revenue mix beyond core
air and hotel products to car rental, destination services,
cruise and other offerings.

Leverage our Scale in Technology and Operations.

The
travel brands comprising Expedia, Inc. have invested over
$3 billion dollars in technology, operations, brand
building, supplier integration and relationships and other areas
since the launch of Expedia.com in 1996.

It is our intention to continue leveraging this substantial
investment by launching new countries, introducing site
features, adding supplier products and services or adding
value-added content for travelers. We have been able to launch
the Italy and Australia websites relatively quickly and
inexpensively by leveraging Expedia’s existing technology
and product supply.

Our scale of operations also enhances the value of technology
innovations we introduce on behalf of our travelers and
suppliers. As an example, our traveler review
feature — whereby Expedia travelers have created over
100,000 qualified reviews of hotel properties — is
able to accumulate a larger base of reviews due to the higher
base of online traffic that frequents our various sites.



Merchant and Agency Business Models

We make travel products and services available on a stand-alone
and package basis, primarily through two business models: the
merchant model and the agency model. Under the merchant model,
we facilitate the booking of hotel rooms, airline seats, car
rentals and destination services from our travel suppliers and
for such bookings, we are the merchant of record. Under the
agency model, we act as an agent in the transaction, passing
reservations booked by our travelers to the relevant airline,
hotel, car rental company or cruise line.

As merchant of record, we generally have certain latitude to
establish prices charged to travelers (as compared to agency
transactions). Also, we negotiate inventory allocation and
pricing with our suppliers which enables us to achieve a higher
level of net revenue per transaction as compared to those
provided through the agency model.

Through our Expedia-branded websites, travelers can dynamically
assemble multiple component travel packages in a single
transaction at a lower price as compared to booking each
component separately. Packages assembled by travelers through
the packaging model on these websites include a merchant hotel
component and an air or car component. Travelers select packages
based on the total package price, without being provided
component pricing. The use of the merchant travel components in
packages enables us to make certain travel products available at
prices lower than those charged on an individual component basis
by travel suppliers without impacting their established pricing
and position models.

Our agency business is comprised of the sale of airline tickets,
hotel, cruise and car rental reservations. Airline ticket
transactions make up the majority of this business. Although net
revenue per transaction is lower (as compared to the merchant
model), due to the high volume of airline tickets sold, our
agency gross bookings accounted for 59% of total gross bookings
for the year ended December 31, 2005.

Relationships with Travel Suppliers, Distribution and
    Fulfillment Partners

Overview.

We make travel products and services available
from a variety of large and small commercial and charter
airlines, lodging properties, car rental companies, cruise lines
and destination service providers. We seek to build and maintain
long-term, strategic relationships with travel suppliers and
global distribution system (“GDS”) partners. An
important component of the success of our business depends on
our ability to maintain our existing, as well as build new,
relationships with travel suppliers and GDS partners.

Travel Suppliers.

We strive to deliver value to our
travel suppliers through a wide range of innovative, targeted
merchandising and promotional strategies designed to increase
their revenue, while simultaneously reducing their marketing
transaction and customer service costs. We maintain a Partner
Services Group, which consists mainly of strategic account
managers and local market managers who work directly with travel
suppliers to increase the marketing of their travel products
through our brands.

In addition, we have developed proprietary, supplier-oriented
technology that streamlines the interaction between some of our
websites and hotel central reservation systems, making it easier
and more cost-effective for hotels to manage reservations made
through our brands. Through this “direct connect”
technology, hotels can upload information about available
products and services and rates directly from their central
reservation systems into our websites, as well as automatically
confirm hotel reservations made by our travelers. In the absence
of direct connect technology, both of these processes are
generally completed manually. Our travelers can book
reservations with over 25,000 merchant hotel properties
worldwide, of which over 30% are now fully direct-connected. We
expect that this number will increase in the future.

Distribution Partners.

GDS, also referred to as computer
reservation services, provide a centralized, comprehensive
repository of travel suppliers “content” —
such as availability and pricing of seats on various airline

point-to

-point flights,
or “segments.” The GDSs act as intermediaries between
the travel



suppliers and online and offline travel agencies, allowing
agents to reserve and book flights, rooms or other travel
products.

While we have historically used Worldspan as our primary GDS, in
light of the deregulated GDS environment and our desire to
ensure the widest possible supply of air content for our
travelers, we also have distribution agreements with both
Amadeus and Sabre.

Fulfillment Partners.

We outsource our airline ticket
fulfillment function to third-party suppliers. This function
includes the issuance of airline tickets and related customer
services.

Marketing and Promotions

Our marketing programs are intended to build and maintain the
value of our various brands, drive traffic and conversion
through our various brands and businesses, lower ongoing
traveler acquisition costs and strategically position our brands
in relation to one another. Our long-term success depends on our
continued ability to increase the overall number of traveler
transactions in a cost-effective manner.

Our marketing channels primarily include direct and/or
personalized traveler communications, search engine marketing
and online and offline advertising. In addition, our
Expedia-branded websites provide content and services to the
travel channel on the MSN.com website in the U.S. and MSN
websites in Canada, the United Kingdom, Italy, France and
Germany. Our marketing programs and initiatives include
promotional offers such as coupons and gift cards. In addition,
we anticipate launching a significant loyalty effort for our
travelers.

We also make use of affiliate marketing. The Expedia.com and
Hotels.com-branded websites receive bookings from consumers who
have clicked-through to the respective websites through links
posted on affiliate partner websites, including the IAN, or
www.IAN.com, and WWTE, or www.wwte.com. We have agreements with
thousands of third party affiliate partners, including a number
of leading travel companies, pursuant to which we pay a
commission for bookings originated from their websites.
Affiliate partners can make travel products and services
available through an Expedia-branded website, a co-branded
website or their own private label website. We also provide our
affiliates with technology and access to a wide range of
products and services.

Operations and Technology

We provide

24-hour

-a-day,
seven-day-a-week traveler support by telephone or via

e-mail.

For purposes of
operational flexibility, we provide this support infrastructure
with a combination of in-house and outsourced call centers which
are located in various locations throughout the world.

Our systems infrastructure and web and database servers are
hosted by third-party web hosting suppliers in various
locations, mainly in the United States, which provide
communication links, as well as

24-hour

monitoring and
engineering support. The web hosting facilities have their own
generators and multiple

back-up

systems.
Significant amounts of our computer hardware for operating the
websites are also located at these facilities.

We have developed innovative technology to power our global
travel marketplace. For example, our Expert Searching and
Pricing Platform (“ESP Platform”), which our
Expedia-branded websites use, is an industry leading platform
that includes two components: (1) a fare-searching engine
that enables broad and deep airline fare and schedule searches
and (2) a common database platform that allows our
Expedia-branded websites and our travelers to bundle diverse
types of travel services together dynamically, which further
enables our Expedia-branded websites to cross-market and package
travel inventory. The ESP Platform has been historically an
important contributor to our growth in the online travel
industry.

Another core technology advantage is our best fare search
technology. This technology essentially deconstructs the segment
feeds from GDS partners for air flight searches and recommends
the best way to re-assemble multi-leg itineraries so that they
are less expensive and more flexible for the traveler.



We plan to significantly invest in our technology platform over
the next two years. We are investing in and building a
scaleable, extensible, service-oriented technology platform
which will extend across our portfolio of brands. This will
result in long-term cost savings, improved flexibility and
faster go-forward innovation. This transition will allow us to
improve our site merchandising, browse and search functionality,
add significant personalization features, and ultimately improve
our ability to drive higher

return-on

-investment in
our online and offline advertising. We expect this transition to
occur in a phased approach, with worldwide points of sale
migrating to the new platform over the next two years.

We are also adding a significant upgrade to our data aggregation
and mining capabilities across Expedia with the installation of
an enterprise data warehouse over the next two years.

Competition

Our brands compete in rapidly evolving and intensely competitive
markets. We believe the relatively low percentage of total
travel sales transacted online in the global travel industry
indicates that these markets represent especially large
opportunities for Expedia and those of its competitors that wish
to expand their brands and businesses abroad.

Our competition, which is strong and increasing, includes online
and offline travel companies that target leisure and corporate
travelers including travel agencies, tour operators, travel
supplier direct websites and their call centers, consolidators
and wholesalers of travel products and services and other
companies offering travel search engines including meta-search
engines in each case, on a local, regional, national and/or
international basis.

We believe that maintaining and enhancing our brands is a
critical component of our effort to compete. We differentiate
our brands from our competitors primarily based on quality and
breadth of travel products, channel features and usability,
price, traveler service and quality of travel planning content
and advice. The emphasis on one or more of these factors varies,
depending on the brand or business and the related target
demographic.

Our brands face increasing competition from travel supplier
direct websites. In some cases, supplier direct channels offer
advantages to travelers, such as loyalty programs or lower
transaction fees. Our websites feature travel products and
services from numerous travel suppliers (as opposed to a single
supplier). We face competition from airlines, hotels, rental car
companies, cruise operators and other travel service providers,
whether working individually or collectively, some of which are
suppliers to our websites. Our business is generally sensitive
to changes in the competitive landscape, including the emergence
of new competitors.

Intellectual Property Rights

We regard our intellectual property rights, including our
patents, service marks, trademarks, domain names, copyrights,
trade secrets and other intellectual property, as critical to
our success. For example, we rely heavily upon the software
code, informational databases and other components that make up
our travel planning service.

We rely on a combination of laws and contractual obligations
with employees, travelers, suppliers, affiliates and others to
establish and protect our trade secrets. Despite these
precautions, it may be possible for a third party to copy or
otherwise obtain and use our trade secrets or our intellectual
property without authorization which, if discovered, might
require the uncertainty of legal action to correct. In addition,
there can be no assurance that others will not independently and
lawfully develop substantially similar properties.

We have registered and continue to apply to register, or secure
by contract when appropriate, our trademarks as they are
developed and used. We also register domain names as we deem
appropriate. While we seek to protect our trademarks and domain
names, effective trademark protection may not be available or
may not be sought by us for every trademark used in every
country, and contractual disputes may affect the use of
trademarks governed by private contract. Similarly, not every
variation of a domain



name may be available, or may be registered by us, even if
available. The failure to protect our intellectual property in a
meaningful manner or challenges to our intellectual property
rights, could materially adversely affect our business, result
in erosion of our brand names and/or limit our ability to
control marketing on or through the internet using our various
domain names.

We have considered, and will continue to consider, the
appropriateness of filing for patents to protect future
inventions, as circumstances may warrant. However, many patents
protect only specific inventions and there can be no assurance
that others may not create new products or methods that achieve
similar results without infringing upon patents owned by us.

From time to time, we may be subject to legal proceedings and
claims in the ordinary course of our business, including claims
of alleged infringement by us of the trademarks, copyrights,
patents and other intellectual property rights of third parties.
In addition, litigation may be necessary in the future to
enforce our intellectual property rights, protect our trade
secrets or to determine the validity and scope of proprietary
rights claimed by others. Any such litigation, regardless of
outcome or merit, could result in substantial costs and
diversion of management and technical resources, any of which
could materially harm our business.

Regulation

We must comply with laws and regulations relating to the travel
industry and the provision of travel services, including
registration in various states as “sellers of travel”
and compliance with certain disclosure requirements and
participation in state restitution funds. In addition, our
businesses are subject to regulation by the U.S. Department
of Transportation and must comply with various rules and
regulations governing the provision of air transportation,
including those relating to advertising and accessibility.

As we continue to expand the reach of our brands into the
European, Asia-Pacific and other international markets, we may
increasingly be subject to laws and regulations applicable to
travel agents in those markets, including laws regulating the
provision of travel packages and industry specific value-added
tax regimes. For example, the EEC Council Directive on Package
Travel Package Holidays and Package Tours imposes various
obligations upon marketers of travel packages, such as
disclosure obligations to consumers and liability to consumers
for improper performance of the package, including supplier
failure.

Employees

As of February 28, 2006, we employed approximately
6,500 full-time and part-time employees of whom
approximately 1,800 are based at eLong. In addition, we contract
for the services of approximately 350 employees of temporary
staffing firms. Our employees are not represented by any
collective bargaining unit. We believe we generally have good
relations with our employees.

Part I. Item 1A.

Risk
Factors

You should carefully consider each of the following risks and
uncertainties associated with our company and the ownership of
our securities. Additional risks not presently known to us or
that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business
operations.

We operate in a very competitive environment and face
increasing competition from a variety of companies with respect
to products and services we offer.

The market for the services we offer is intensely competitive.
We compete with both established and emerging online and
traditional sellers of travel services with respect to each of
the services we offer. Some of our competitors, including travel
suppliers such as airlines and hotels, may offer services and
products on more favorable terms such as no fees and with unique
access to loyalty programs, such as points and miles. Many of
these competitors, such as airlines, hotel and rental car
companies, are also focusing on driving online demand to their
own websites in lieu of third-party distributors like us. For
instance, many low cost airlines, which are having increasing
success in the marketplace, distribute their inventory
exclusively through their own websites. Suppliers who sell on
their own websites typically do not charge a processing fee,
and, in some instances, offer advantages such as bonus miles or
loyalty points, which could make their offerings more attractive
to consumers than models like ours. The introduction of new
technologies and the expansion of existing technologies, such as
metasearch products, may increase competitive pressures.
Increased competition may result in reduced operating margins,
as well as loss of travelers, transactions and brand
recognition. We cannot assure you that we will be able to
compete successfully against current, emerging and future
competitors or provide differentiated products and services to
our traveler base. Increased competition could result in reduced
operating margins, loss of segment share and damage to our
brand. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete
successfully against current and future competitors or that
competition will not have a material adverse effect on our
business, results of operations and financial condition.

Over the last several years, travel suppliers have generally
reduced or eliminated commissions and payments to travel agents
and other travel intermediaries; these reductions could
adversely affect our business, financial condition and results
of operations.

A portion of our agency revenue is derived from compensation
paid by travel suppliers and GDS partners for bookings made
through our websites. We generally negotiate these commissions
and fees with our travel suppliers and GDS partners. Over the
last several years, travel suppliers have generally reduced or
eliminated commissions and payments to travel agents and other
travel intermediaries. No assurances can be given that GDS
partners or travel suppliers will not reduce current industry
compensation or our compensation, either of which could reduce
our agency revenue and margins thereby adversely affecting our
business, financial condition and results of operations. GDS
partners in particular face renegotiations of their long-term
contracts with airlines in 2006 that could result in decreased
compensation to them and to us.



Declines or disruptions in the travel industry, such as those
caused by terrorism, war, inclement weather, health concerns,
bankruptcies and/or general economic downturns, could adversely
affect our business, financial condition and results of
operations.

Our business, financial condition and results of operations are
affected by the health of the worldwide travel industry.
Accordingly, downturns or weaknesses in the travel industry
could adversely affect our business. Travel expenditures are
sensitive to business and personal discretionary spending levels
and tend to decline during general economic downturns. Events or
weakness in the travel industry that could negatively affect our
business include price escalation in the airline industry or
other travel-related industries, airline or other travel related
strikes, airline bankruptcies or liquidations and fuel price
escalation. Additionally, our business is sensitive to safety
concerns, and thus may decline after incidents of terrorism,
during periods of political instability or geopolitical conflict
in which travelers become concerned about safety issues, as a
result of inclement weather such as the hurricanes that affected
the markets around the Gulf of Mexico in 2005 or when travel
might involve health-related risks, such as avian flu. Such
concerns could result in a protracted decrease in demand for our
travel services. This decrease in demand, depending on its scope
and duration, together with any future issues affecting travel
safety, could significantly and adversely affect our business,
financial condition and results of operations over the short and
long-term. In addition, the disruption of the existing travel
plans of a significant number of travelers upon the occurrence
of certain events, such as terrorist activity or war, could
result in the incurrence of significant additional costs if we
provide relief to affected travelers by not charging
cancellation fees or by refunding the price of airline tickets,
hotel reservations and other travel products and services.

We depend on our relationships with travel suppliers and any
adverse changes in these relationships could adversely affect
our business, financial condition and results of operations.

An important component of our business success depends on our
ability to maintain our existing, as well as build new,
relationships with travel suppliers and global distribution
system (“GDS”) partners. Adverse changes in existing
relationships, or our inability to enter into new arrangements
with these parties on favorable terms, if at all, could reduce
the amount, quality and breadth of attractively priced travel
products and services that we are able to offer, which could
adversely affect our business, financial condition and results
of operations.

Travel suppliers are increasingly seeking to lower their travel
distribution costs by promoting direct online bookings through
their own websites. In some cases, supplier direct channels
offer advantages to consumers, such as loyalty programs or lower
transaction fees. In addition, travel suppliers may choose not
to make their travel products and services available through our
distribution channels. To the extent that consumers continue to
increase the percentage of their travel purchases through
supplier direct websites and/or if travel suppliers choose not
to make their products and services available to us, our
business may suffer.

Our failure to attract and retain travelers in a
cost-effective manner could adversely affect our business,
financial condition and results of operations.

Our long-term success depends on our continued ability to
increase the overall number of traveler transactions in a
cost-effective manner. In order to increase the number of
traveler transactions, we must capture repeat business from
existing travelers and also attract new visitors to our websites
and other distribution channels and convert these visitors into
paying travelers. Similarly, our corporate travel business is
dependent on enlisting new corporate travelers and attracting
their travel booking activity online to our corporate travel
websites as well as retaining existing travelers. One manner in
which we cost-effectively attract travelers to our websites is
through affiliate programs. If the number of travelers being
driven to our websites through affiliates participating in these
programs were to decrease significantly, costs relating to our
sales and marketing commitments could increase. In addition, we
believe that rates for desirable offline and online advertising
and marketing placements are likely to increase in the
foreseeable future. No assurances can be provided that we will
be successful in acquiring new travelers in a cost-effective
manner.



We rely on the performance of highly skilled personnel and,
if we are unable to retain or motivate key personnel or hire,
retain and motivate qualified personnel, our business would be
harmed.

Our performance is largely dependent on the talents and efforts
of highly skilled individuals. Our future success depends on our
continuing ability to identify, hire, develop, motivate and
retain highly skilled personnel for all areas of our
organization. In particular the contributions of Barry Diller,
our Chairman and Senior Executive, and Dara Khosrowshahi, our
Chief Executive Officer, are critical to the overall management
of the company.

In addition, our future success will depend on the performance
of our senior management and key employees, many of whom joined
Expedia recently. Expedia cannot ensure that it will be able to
retain the services of Mr. Diller, Mr. Khosrowshahi or
any other member of our senior management or key employees, the
loss of whom could seriously harm our business. In addition,
competition for well-qualified employees in all aspects of our
business, including software engineers and other technology
professionals, is intense. Our continued ability to compete
effectively depends on our ability to attract new employees and
to retain and motivate our existing employees. If we do not
succeed in attracting well-qualified employees or retaining or
motivating existing employees, our business would be adversely
affected.

Many of our business units use separate operational and
financial systems that have not been integrated and that rely
heavily on manual procedures.

Expedia is composed of multiple business units that were
unaffiliated companies prior to being acquired by IAC. These
multiple business units use disparate systems, processes and
personnel to support operations, including bookings and
fulfillment, accounting and budgeting, tax filings, vendor
payments and back office support. In addition, certain of the
business units rely on manual procedures for critical business
systems and financial reporting processes. We expect to incur
significant costs in our ongoing efforts to integrate and
automate these disparate systems into an efficient, effective
and unified operation.

The continued lack of automation, and the ongoing reliance on
manual procedures in critical business processes and financial
reporting functions increases the risk of errors. If we are not
able to successfully implement the changes necessary to operate
a unified system, or automate critical financial reporting
processes then:

If any of these events were to occur, it could have a material
adverse effect on our reputation or results of operations.

If we fail to establish and maintain an effective system of
internal controls over financial reporting, we may not be able
to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud.
This could adversely affect our operating results and our
brand.

We may not be able to establish or maintain adequate internal
controls over financial reporting. Many of our internal controls
and reporting systems were designed and originally implemented
in smaller, separate business units while they were part of IAC
and may not function as intended in an entity separate from IAC.
In addition, we have a new senior financial management team,
with only limited experience evaluating and managing these
controls and processes. Additionally, certain functions,
including equity transactions, income taxes, derivatives,
treasury functions, and periodic reporting in accordance with
SEC rules and regulations were previously handled by IAC and
have only recently been established at the Company.

Although we are taking steps to strengthen our internal
controls, we cannot be certain that these measures will ensure
that we implement and maintain adequate controls over our
financial processes and



reporting in the future. We also cannot be certain that the
interim steps we have taken, pending full implementation of
these measures, to preserve our ability to accurately record,
process, and summarize financial data and prepare our financial
statements and reporting, will be effective. Many of these
interim steps are time and labor intensive and rely on manual
procedures, which makes them difficult to maintain for an
extended period and increases the risk of errors.

Any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or
difficulties encountered in their implementation, could harm our
operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting
obligations.

Our internal control over financial reporting may not be
considered effective which could result in a loss of investor
confidence in our financial reports, and in turn have an adverse
effect on our stock price.

Pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002,
beginning with our Annual Report on
Form

10-K

for the
fiscal year ending December 31, 2006, we will be required
to furnish a report by our management on our internal control
over financial reporting. Such report will contain, among other
matters, an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal
control over financial reporting as of the end of our fiscal
year, including a statement as to whether our internal control
over financial reporting is effective. This assessment must
include disclosure of any material weaknesses in our internal
control over financial reporting identified by management. Such
report will also contain a statement that our auditors have
issued an attestation report on management’s assessment of
such internal controls.

We are currently performing the system and process documentation
and evaluation needed to comply with Section 404, which is
both costly and challenging. Although we have not identified any
material weaknesses as of the date of this filing, management
may, during this process, identify one or more material
weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting; if
such occurs, we will be unable to assert such internal control
is effective. If we are unable to assert that our internal
control over financial reporting is effective as of
December 31, 2006 (or if our auditors are unable to attest
that our management’s report is fairly stated or they are
unable to express an opinion on our management’s evaluation
or on the effectiveness of the internal controls), we could lose
investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our
financial reports, which in turn could have an adverse effect on
our stock price.

Our success depends on maintaining the integrity of our
systems and infrastructure. System interruption and the lack of
integration and redundancy in our information systems may affect
our businesses.

A fundamental requirement for online commerce and communications
is the secure transmission of confidential information, such as
credit card numbers or other personal information, over public
networks. Our security measures may be inadequate and, if any
compromise of security were to occur, it could have a
detrimental effect on our reputation and adversely affect our
ability to maintain our existing travelers and/or attract new
travelers.

We may experience occasional system interruptions that make some
or all systems unavailable or prevent us from efficiently
fulfilling orders or providing services to third parties. We
rely on our affiliates’ and third party computer systems
and service providers to facilitate and process a portion of our
transactions. Any interruptions, outages or delays in our
systems or third party providers’ systems, or deterioration
in their performance, could impair each company’s ability
to process transactions for its travelers and the quality of
service that we can offer to our travelers. We do not have
backup systems for certain critical aspects of our operations,
many other systems are not fully redundant and our disaster
recovery planning may not be sufficient. Fire, flood, power
loss, telecommunications failure, break-ins, earthquakes, acts
of war or terrorism, acts of God, computer viruses, physical or
electronic break-ins and similar events or disruptions may
damage or interrupt computer or communications systems at any
time. Any of these events could cause system interruption,
delays and loss of critical data, and could prevent us from
providing services to our travelers and/or third parties for a
significant period of time. In addition, we may have inadequate
insurance coverage or insurance limits to compensate for losses
from a major



interruption, remediation may be costly and have a material
adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.

Our expansion places a significant strain on our management,
technical, operational and financial resources.

We have rapidly and significantly expanded our operations both
domestically and internationally and anticipate expanding
further to pursue growth of our product and service offerings
and customer base. Such expansion increases the complexity of
our business and places a significant strain on our management,
operations, technical performance, financial resources, and
internal financial control and reporting functions.

There can be no assurance that we will be able to manage our
expansion effectively. Our current and planned personnel,
systems, procedures and controls may not be adequate to support
and effectively manage our future operations, especially as we
employ personnel in multiple geographic locations. We may not be
able to hire, train, retain, motivate and manage required
personnel, which may limit our growth. If any of this were to
occur, it could damage our reputation, limit our growth,
negatively affect our operating results, and hard our business.

We may experience operational and financial risks in
connection with any acquisitions. In addition, some of the
businesses acquired by us may incur significant losses from
operations or experience impairment of carrying value.

Our future growth may depend, in part, on acquisitions. To the
extent that we continue to grow through acquisitions, we may
face the operational and financial risks that commonly accompany
that strategy. We would also face operational risks, such as
failing to assimilate the operations and personnel of the
acquired businesses, disrupting their ongoing businesses,
impairing management resources and their relationships with
employees and travelers as a result of changes in their
ownership and management Further, the evaluation and negotiation
of potential acquisitions, as well as the integration of an
acquired business, will divert management time and other
resources. Some acquisitions may not be successful and their
performances may result in the impairment of their carrying
value.

Certain financial and operational risks related to acquisitions
that may have a material impact on our business are:



Our results of operations are difficult to predict and may
fluctuate substantially from the estimates of securities
analysts or expectations of our investors.

In the event that our operating results fall below the
expectations of securities analysts or investors, the trading
price of our securities may decline significantly. In addition
to the risks identified herein, our business is sensitive to
general economic conditions, the health of the worldwide travel
industry, consumer confidence, consumer retail spending, trends
in technology, competition, levels of personal discretionary
income, weather, acts of war or terrorism, safety concerns and
acts of God. Our business is also subject to the effects of
seasonality with revenue typically lowest in the first quarter
of the year and highest in the third quarter.

We have a limited operating history and our stock price is
highly volatile.

We have a relatively short operating history as a separate
company and a rapidly evolving and unpredictable business model.
The trading price of our common stock fluctuates significantly.
Trading prices of our common stock may fluctuate in response to
a number of events and factors, such as:

Any of these events may cause our stock price to rise or fall
and may adversely affect our business and financing
opportunities. A a result, we may experience extreme price and
volume fluctuations that are unrelated or disproportionate to
changes in our operating performance. In the past, following
periods of volatility in the general market, or a particular
companies securities, securities class actions have been brought
against affected companies. This litigation, if instituted
against us, could result in substantial costs and diversion of
our management’s attention and resources.

Future volatility in our stock price could force us to increase
our cash compensation to employees or grant larger stock awards
than we have historically, which could hurt our operating
results or reduce the percentage ownership of our existing
stockholders, or both.

We may not be able to engage in desirable strategic
transactions and equity issuances due to our tax-sharing
arrangements.

Our ability to engage in significant stock transactions could be
limited or restricted to preserve the tax free nature of our
Spin-Off from IAC. Current federal income tax law creates a
presumption that the



Spin-Off would be taxable to IAC, but not to its stockholders,
if either IAC or we enter into a transaction that would result
in a 50% or greater change, by vote or value, in IAC’s or
our stock ownership during the four-year period that begins two
years before the date of the Spin-Off, unless it is established
that the transaction is not pursuant to a plan or series of
transactions related to the Spin-Off. Treasury regulations
currently in effect generally provide that whether an
acquisition transaction and a Spin-Off are part of a plan is
determined based on all of the facts and circumstances,
including, but not limited to, specific factors described in the
regulations. In addition, the regulations provide several
“safe harbors” for acquisition transactions that are
not considered to be part of a plan. These restrictions may
prevent us from entering into transactions which might be
advantageous to our stockholders, such as selling the company or
substantially all of the assets of the company, issuing equity
securities to satisfy financing needs, acquiring businesses or
assets with equity securities.

Under the tax sharing agreement with IAC, there are restrictions
on our ability to take actions that could cause the Spin-Off to
fail to qualify as a tax free transaction, including redeeming
substantial amounts of our equity securities and selling or
otherwise disposing of a substantial portion of our assets, in
each case, for a period of 25 months following the
Spin-Off. We would be required to indemnify IAC against the
taxes described in the preceding sentence if such tax is
incurred by a breach of our covenants under the tax sharing
agreement.

Mr. Diller currently controls Expedia. If
Mr. Diller ceases to control the company, Liberty Media
Corporation may effectively control the company.

Subject to the terms of the Stockholders Agreement,
Mr. Diller holds an irrevocable proxy to vote shares of
Expedia stock held by Liberty Media Corporation
(“Liberty”). Accordingly, Mr. Diller effectively
controls the outcome of all matters submitted to a vote or for
the consent of our stockholders (other than with respect to the
election by the holders of common stock of 25% of the members of
the Board of Directors and matters as to which Delaware law
requires a separate class vote). Upon Mr. Diller’s
permanent departure from Expedia, the irrevocable proxy
terminates and depending on the capitalization of Expedia at
such time, Liberty may effectively control the voting power of
our capital stock. Mr. Diller, through shares he owns
beneficially as well as those subject to the irrevocable proxy,
controls approximately 53% of the combined voting power of the
outstanding Expedia capital stock.

In addition, under the Governance Agreement, each of
Mr. Diller and Liberty generally has the right to consent
to limited matters in the event that our ratio of total debt to
EBITDA, as defined in the Governance Agreement, equals or
exceeds 4:1 over a continuous

12-month

period. We
cannot assure you that Mr. Diller and Liberty will consent
to any such matter at a time when we are highly leveraged, in
which case we would not be able to engage in such transactions
or take such actions.

As a result of Mr. Diller’s ownership interests and
voting power, and Liberty’s ownership interests and voting
power upon Mr. Diller’s permanent departure from us,
Mr. Diller is currently, and in the future Liberty may be
in a position to control or influence significant corporate
actions, including, corporate transactions such as mergers,
business combinations or dispositions of assets and
determinations with respect to our significant business
direction and policies. This concentrated control could
discourage others from initiating any potential merger, takeover
or other change of control transaction that may otherwise be
beneficial to us. As a result, the market price of our
securities could be adversely affected.

Actual or potential conflicts of interest may develop between
Expedia management and directors, on the one hand, and the
management and directors of IAC, on the other.

Mr. Diller serves as our Chairman of the Board of Directors
and Senior Executive, while retaining his role as Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer of IAC, and Mr. Kaufman serves as
Vice Chairman of both Expedia and IAC. The fact that
Messrs. Diller and Kaufman hold positions with both
companies and own both IAC and Expedia stock could create, or
appear to create, potential conflicts of interest for each of
Messrs. Diller and Kaufman when he faces decisions that may
affect both IAC and Expedia. Both Messrs. Diller and
Kaufman may also face conflicts of interest with regard to the
allocation of their time between IAC and Expedia.



Our certificate of incorporation provides that no officer or
director of Expedia who is also an officer or director of IAC
will be liable to Expedia or its stockholders for breach of any
fiduciary duty by reason of the fact that any such individual
directs a corporate opportunity to IAC instead of Expedia, or
does not communicate information regarding a corporate
opportunity to Expedia because the officer or director has
directed the corporate opportunity to IAC. This corporate
opportunity provision may have the effect of exacerbating the
risk of conflicts of interest between IAC and Expedia because
the provision effectively shields an overlapping
director/executive officer from liability for breach of
fiduciary duty in the event that such director or officer
chooses to direct a corporate opportunity to IAC instead of
Expedia.

Changing laws, rules and regulations and legal uncertainties
may adversely affect our business, financial condition and
results of operations.

Our business, financial condition and results of operations
could be adversely affected by unfavorable changes in or
interpretations of existing, or the promulgation of new laws,
rules and regulations applicable to us and our businesses,
including those relating to the internet and online commerce,
consumer protection and privacy, escheat and sales, use,
occupancy, value-added and other taxes, could decrease demand
for products and services, increase costs and/or subject us to
additional liabilities. For example, there is, and will likely
continue to be, an increasing number of laws and regulations
pertaining to the internet and online commerce, which may relate
to liability for information retrieved from or transmitted over
the internet, user privacy, taxation and the quality of products
and services. Furthermore, the growth and development of online
commerce may prompt calls for more stringent consumer protection
laws that may impose additional burdens on online businesses
generally.

In addition, the application of various domestic and
international sales, use, occupancy, value-added and other tax
laws, rules and regulations to our historical and new products
and services is subject to interpretation by the applicable
taxing authorities. While we believe that we are compliant with
these tax provisions, there can be no assurances that taxing
authorities will not take a contrary position, or that such
positions will not have an adverse effect on our businesses,
financial condition and results of operations. If the tax laws,
rules and regulations were amended or if current interpretations
of the laws were to change adversely to us, particularly with
respect to occupancy or value-added taxes, the results could
have an adverse affect on our businesses, financial condition
and results of operations.

Our international opportunities and investments involve risks
relating to travel patterns, practices, Internet-based commerce,
regulations and exchange rate fluctuations.

We operate in a number of jurisdictions abroad and intend to
continue to expand our international presence. In order to
achieve widespread acceptance in the countries and markets we
enter, we must continue to tailor our services to the unique
customs and cultures of such countries and markets. Learning the
customs and cultures of various countries, particularly with
respect to travel patterns and practices, can be difficult,
costly and divert management and personnel resources. Our
failure to learn such customs and cultures successfully could
slow our international growth.

We expect to continue to face additional risks in international
operations. These risks include political instability, acts of
terrorism, unexpected changes in regulatory requirements, our
ability to comply with local laws and regulations, increased
risk and limits on our ability to enforce intellectual property
rights, slower adoption of the internet as an advertising and
commerce medium in those markets as compared to the United
States and difficulties in managing operations due to distance,
language and cultural differences, including issues associated
with establishing management systems and infrastructures and
staffing and managing foreign operations.

Through our international operations, we also have exposure to
different economic climates, political arenas, tax systems and
regulations that could negatively affect foreign exchange rates.
Because we transact in foreign currency and record the activity
in U.S. dollars, changes in exchange rates between the
U.S. dollar and these other currencies could have a
negative effect on our results of operations. Our exchange rate
risk will increase as we increase our operations in
international markets.



Our investment in eLong creates risks and uncertainties
relating to the laws of the People’s Republic of China.

The success of our investment in eLong, a Cayman Island company,
whose principal business is the operation of an internet-based
travel business in China, is subject to risks and uncertainties
regarding the interpretation of China’s laws and
regulations. The China legal system is a civil law system based
on written statutes. Unlike common law systems, it is a system
in which decided legal cases have limited value as precedent.
The lack of precedent causes the interpretation and enforcement
of China law to involve uncertainties that could limit the
available legal protections. In addition, we cannot predict the
effect of future developments in the China’s legal system,
particularly with respect to the travel industry or the
internet, including the introduction of new laws, changes to
existing laws or the interpretation or enforcement of current or
future laws and regulations, or the preemption of local
regulations by national laws. In addition, the laws and
regulations of China restrict foreign investment in the
air-ticketing, travel agency, internet content provision and
advertising businesses. Such laws and regulations require that
we establish effective control through a series of agreements
with eLong’s affiliated Chinese entities and could restrict
our ability to engage in desirable strategic transactions.
Finally, China does not have treaties with the United States or
most other western countries providing for the reciprocal
recognition and enforcement of judgment of courts. As a result,
court judgments obtained in jurisdictions with which China does
not have treaties on reciprocal recognition of judgment and in
relation to any matter not subject to a binding arbitration
provision may be difficult or impossible to be enforced in China.

Our processing, storage, use and disclosure of personal data
could give rise to liabilities as a result of governmental
regulation, conflicting legal requirements or differing views of
personal privacy rights.

In the processing of our traveler transactions, we receive and
store a large volume of personally identifiable information.
This information is increasingly subject to legislation and
regulations in numerous jurisdictions around the world. This
government action is typically intended to protect the privacy
of personal information that is collected, processed and
transmitted in or from the governing jurisdiction. We could be
adversely affected if legislation or regulations are expanded to
require changes in our business practices or if governing
jurisdictions interpret or implement their legislation or
regulations in ways that negatively affect our business,
financial condition and results of operations. As privacy and
data protection have become more sensitive issues, we may also
become exposed to potential liabilities as a result of differing
views on the privacy of travel data. These and other privacy
developments that are difficult to anticipate could adversely
affect our business, financial condition and results of
operations.

We rely on the Internet infrastructure which may be unable to
support increased levels of demand.

The internet infrastructure may not expand fast enough to meet
the increased levels of demand. In particular, the expected
benefits from our international operations may be reduced if
internet usage does not continue to grow in our overseas markets
or grows at significantly lower rates compared to expected
trends. In addition, activities that diminish the experience for
internet users, such as spyware, spoof

e-mails,

viruses and
spam directed at internet users, as well as viruses and
“denial of service” attacks directed at internet
companies and service providers, may discourage people from
using the internet, including for commerce. If consumer use
diminishes or grows at a slower rate, then our business and
results of operations could be adversely affected.

We may be found to have infringed on intellectual property
rights of others that could expose us to substantial damages and
restrict our operations.

We could face claims that we have infringed the patents,
copyrights or other intellectual property rights of others. In
addition, we may be required to indemnify travel suppliers for
claims made against them. Any claims against us could require us
to spend significant time and money in litigation, delay the
release of new products or services, pay damages, develop new
intellectual property or acquire licenses to intellectual
property that is the subject of the infringement claims. These
licenses, if required, may not be available on acceptable terms
or at all. As a result, intellectual property claims against us
could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating
results and financial condition.



Our websites rely on intellectual property, and we cannot be
sure that this intellectual property is protected from copying
or use by others, including potential competitors.

We regard much of our content and technology as proprietary and
try to protect our proprietary technology by relying on
trademarks, copyrights, trade secret laws and confidentiality
agreements. In connection with our license agreements with third
parties, we seek to control access to and distribution of our
technology, documentation and other proprietary information.
Even with all of these precautions, it is possible for someone
else to copy or otherwise obtain and use our proprietary
technology without our authorization or to develop similar
technology independently. Effective trademark, copyright and
trade secret protection may not be available in every country in
which our services are made available through the internet, and
policing unauthorized use of our proprietary information is
difficult and expensive. We cannot be sure that the steps we
have taken will prevent misappropriation of our proprietary
information. This misappropriation could have a material adverse
effect on our business. In the future, we may need to go to
court to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect
our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the
proprietary rights of others. This litigation might result in
substantial costs and diversion of resources and management
attention.

We currently license from third parties some of the technologies
incorporated into our websites. As we continue to introduce new
services that incorporate new technologies, we may be required
to license additional technology. We cannot be sure that such
technology licenses will be available on commercially reasonable
terms, if at all.

Part I. Item 3.

Legal
Proceedings

In the ordinary course of business, Expedia and its subsidiaries
are parties to legal proceedings and claims involving property,
personal injury, contract, alleged infringement of third party
intellectual property rights and other claims. The amounts that
may be recovered in such matters may be subject to insurance
coverage.

Rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission require the
description of material pending legal proceedings, other than
ordinary, routine litigation incident to the registrant’s
business, and advise that proceedings ordinarily need not be
described if they primarily involve damages claims for amounts
(exclusive of interest and costs) not individually exceeding 10%
of the current assets of the registrant and its subsidiaries on
a consolidated basis. In the judgment of management, none of the
pending litigation matters which the Company and its
subsidiaries are defending, including those described below,
involves or is likely to involve amounts of that magnitude. The
litigation matters described below are as of March 1, 2006,
and involve issues or claims that may be of particular interest
to our stockholders, regardless of



whether any of these matters may be material to our financial
position or operations based upon the standard set forth in the
SEC’s rules.

Securities Class Action Litigation against IAC.

Beginning on September 20, 2004, twelve purported
shareholder class actions were commenced in the United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York against IAC
and certain of its officers and directors, alleging violations
of the federal securities laws. These cases arose out of
IAC’s August 4, 2004 announcement of its earnings for
the second quarter of 2004 and generally alleged that the value
of the Company’s stock was artificially inflated by
pre-announcement statements about its financial results and
forecasts that were false and misleading due to the
defendants’ alleged failure to disclose various problems
faced by IAC’s travel businesses. On December 20,
2004, the district court consolidated the twelve lawsuits,
appointed co-lead plaintiffs, and designated co-lead
plaintiffs’ counsel. See

In re IAC/ InterActiveCorp
Securities Litigation,

No. 04-CV-7447 (S.D.N.Y.).
Expedia is not a party to this litigation, however, under the
terms of its Separation Agreement with IAC, Expedia has
generally agreed to bear a portion of the costs and liabilities,
if any, associated with any securities law litigation relating
to conduct prior to the Spin-Off of the businesses or entities
that comprise Expedia following the Spin-Off.

On October 18, 2004, a related shareholder derivative
action,

Stuart Garber, Derivatively on Behalf of IAC/
InterActiveCorp v. Barry Diller et al.

,
No. 04-603416, was commenced in the Supreme Court of the
State of New York (New York County) against certain of
IAC’s officers and directors. On November 15, 2004,
another related shareholder derivative action,

Lisa Butler,
Derivatively on Behalf of IAC/ InterActiveCorp v. Barry
Diller et al.

, No. 04-CV-9067, was filed in the
United States District Court for the Southern District of New
York against certain of IAC’s current and former directors.
On January 24, 2005, the federal district court
consolidated the

Butler

case with the securities class
action for pre-trial purposes only. On April 11, 2005, the
district court issued a similar consolidation order in respect
of the

Garber

case.

On July 5, 2005, the plaintiffs in the related shareholder
suits filed a consolidated shareholder derivative complaint
against IAC (as a nominal defendant) and sixteen current or
former officers or directors of IAC or its former travel
business. The complaint, which is based upon factual allegations
similar to those in the securities class action, purports to
assert claims for breach of fiduciary duty, abuse of control,
gross mismanagement, waste of corporate assets, unjust
enrichment, violation of Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act,
and contribution and indemnification. The complaint seeks an
order voiding the election of the IAC’s current Board of
Directors, as well as damages in an unspecified amount, various
forms of equitable relief, restitution, and disgorgement of
remuneration received by the individual defendants from IAC.

On September 15, 2005, IAC and the other defendants filed
motions to dismiss both the securities class action and the
shareholder derivative suits. On November 30, 2005, the
plaintiffs filed their opposition to the motions. On
January 6, 2006, the defendants filed reply papers in
further support of the motions. Both motions to dismiss remain
pending.

Expedia believes that the claims in the class action and
derivative suits lack merit and that the claims will be
vigorously defended.

Litigation Relating to the IAC/ Hotels.com Merger
Agreement

A putative class action on behalf of Hotels.com stockholders was
filed in the Delaware Chancery Court against Hotels.com, IAC,
and members of the board of directors of Hotels.com on
April 10, 2003, the day of the announcement of the IAC/
Hotels.com merger agreement.

See Michael Garvey, on Behalf of
Himself and All Others Similarly Situated v. Jonathan F.
Miller et al

., No. 20248-NC (New Castle County).
Also on April 10, 2003, the plaintiff in a purported
shareholder derivative action on behalf of Hotels.com filed an
amended complaint to include class allegations regarding the
merger transaction.

See Alex Solodovnikov, Derivatively on
Behalf of Hotels.com v. Robert Diener et al.

,
No.

03-02663

(District Court, 160th Judicial District, Dallas County).
In addition, on April 17, 2003, the plaintiffs in a



consolidated action pending in the Delaware Chancery Court,
which had consolidated a number of putative class actions filed
against Hotels.com, IAC and members of the board of directors of
Hotels.com as a result of IAC’s announcement in June 2002
of its intention to enter into a Hotels.com acquisition
transaction, filed a consolidated and amended class-action
complaint.

See In re Hotels.com Shareholders Litigation,

No. 16662-NC (New Castle County). Pursuant to an
agreement among the parties, the defendants’ time to
respond to this complaint and to the complaint in the

Garvey

case has been adjourned indefinitely. The complaints in
these three actions allege, in essence, that the defendants
breached their fiduciary duties to Hotels.com’s public
shareholders by entering into and/or approving the merger
agreement, which allegedly did not reflect the true value of
Hotels.com. Expedia believes that the allegations in these
lawsuits are without merit and will continue to defend
vigorously against them.

Litigation Relating to Hotels.com’s Guidance for the
Fourth Quarter of 2002

Securities Class Action.

On January 10, 2003, a
putative class action,

Daniel Taubenfeld et al., on
Behalf of Themselves and All Others Similarly Situated v.
Hotels.com et al.

, No. 3:03-CV-0069-N, was filed
in the United States District Court for the Northern District of
Texas, arising out of Hotels.com’s downward revision of its
guidance for the fourth quarter of 2002. Three other
substantially similar securities class actions were filed in the
same court shortly thereafter and were later consolidated with
the Taubenfeld action. The lead plaintiffs in this action filed
a consolidated class-action complaint on August 18, 2003
alleging violations of federal securities laws against
Hotels.com and three of its former executives. On
September 27, 2004, the district court dismissed all of the
plaintiffs’ claims with prejudice, with the exception of
two claims involving statements by analysts. On August 10,
2005 the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit
entered an order dismissing the plaintiffs’ appeal of the
district court’s ruling with prejudice.

Shareholder Derivative Suit.

The action

In re
Hotels.com Derivative Litigation,

No. 3:03-CV

-501-K,

pending in United States District Court for the Northern
District of Texas arises out of the same events as the

Taubenfeld

action and consolidated two shareholder
derivative actions,

Behalf of Nominal Defendant Hotels.com v. Elan J. Blutinger
et al

.,
No. 3:03-CV

-0501-K,

and

Alex Solodovnikov, Derivatively on Behalf of
Hotels.com v. Robert Diener et al

.,
No. 3:03-CV

-0812-K

originally filed in Texas state court on January 14, 2003
and March 14, 2003, respectively. On April 26, 2004,
the lead plaintiff filed a consolidated amended complaint
against Hotels.com (as a nominal defendant only) and sixteen
current or former directors of Hotels.com. The amended complaint
alleges breach of fiduciary duty, abuse of control, gross
mismanagement, waste of corporate assets and unjust enrichment.
The lawsuit seeks damages, restitution and disgorgement of
profits in an unspecified amount and imposition of a
constructive trust in favor of Hotels.com on the profits
obtained by the selling defendants on their sales of Hotels.com
stock during a specified period. On March 7, 2005, the
district court issued orders staying the case until further
notice and directing that the case be administratively closed
pending a decision in the appeal of the Taubenfeld action. On
August 17, 2005, after the Taubenfeld appeal was dismissed,
the defendants filed a motion for a pretrial conference with the
Court giving notice of the Taubenfeld dismissal. The lead
plaintiffs responded to the motion on September 7, 2005 and
the defendants filed their reply on September 15, 2005. The
Court has not ruled on this motion and the case remains
administratively closed.

Litigation Relating to Hotel Occupancy Taxes

Hotels.com.

On June 20, 2003, a purported class
action was filed in Texas state court against certain
Hotels.com-affiliated entities (“Hotels.com”).

See
Nora J. Olvera, Individually and on Behalf of All Others
Similarly Situated v. Hotels.com, Inc.

,
No. DC-03-259 (District Court, 229th Judicial
District, Duval County). The complaint and subsequent amended
complaints filed August 12, 2003 and May 6, 2004,
allege that Hotels.com collects “excess” hotel
occupancy taxes from consumers (i.e., allegedly charges
consumers more for occupancy taxes than it pays to the hotels
for the hotels’ use in satisfying their obligations to the
taxing authorities). The complaint sought certification of a
nationwide class of all persons who have purchased hotel
accommodations from Hotels.com since June 20, 1999, as well
as



restitution of, disgorgement of, and the imposition of a
constructive trust upon all “excess” occupancy taxes
allegedly collected by Hotels.com. On September 25, 2003,
the plaintiff filed a demand for arbitration containing
substantially the same factual allegations as the

Olvera

lawsuit. On September 2, 2004, the arbitrator issued a
final award granting Hotels.com’s motion to dismiss the
arbitration claim.

On May 6, 2003, a purported class action was filed in Texas
state court against Hotels.com, L.P. (“Hotels.com”),

Mary Canales, Individually and on Behalf of All Others
Similarly Situated v. Hotels.com, L.P

.,
No. DC

-03-162

(District Court, 229th Judicial District, Duval County).
The complaint, as amended, alleges that Hotels.com charges
customers “taxes” that exceed the amount required by
or paid to the applicable taxing authorities and that Hotels.com
charges customers “fees” that do not correspond to any
specific services provided. The complaint seeks restitution of,
disgorgement of, and the imposition of a constructive trust upon
all “excess” occupancy taxes allegedly collected by
Hotels.com. On April 29, 2005, the court issued an order
granting the plaintiff’s motion for class certification. On
February 1, 2006, the court of appeals reversed the holding
certifying the class and remanded the case to the trial court.

Consumer Case against Various Internet Travel Companies.

On February 17, 2005, a purported class action was filed in
California state court against a number of internet travel
companies, including Expedia, Hotels.com, Priceline.com and
Orbitz.

See Ronald Bush et al. v. CheapTickets,
Inc. et al

., No. BC329021 (Superior Court, Los
Angeles County). The complaint alleges that the defendants are
improperly charging and/or failing to pay hotel occupancy taxes
and engaging in other deceptive practices in charging customers
for taxes and fees. The complaint seeks certification of a
statewide class of all California residents who were assessed a
charge for “taxes/fees” when booking rooms through the
defendants and alleges violation of Section 17200 of the
California Business and Professions Code and common-law
conversion. The complaint seeks the imposition of a constructive
trust on monies received from the plaintiff class, as well as

,
No. BC326693 (Superior Court, Los Angeles County). The

and/or failing to pay hotel occupancy taxes. The complaint seeks
certification of a statewide class of all California cities and
counties that have enacted uniform transient occupancy-tax
ordinances effective on or after December 30, 1990. The

section 17200 of the California Business and Professions
Code, and common-law conversion. The complaint seeks a
declaratory judgment that the defendants are subject to hotel
occupancy taxes on the hotel rate charged to consumers and
imposition of a constructive trust on all monies owed by the
defendants to the government, as well as disgorgement,
restitution, interest and penalties. On September 26, 2005,

of a constructive trust and declaratory judgment. The complaint
seeks damages and other relief in an unspecified amount.

The Company believes that the claims in all of these litigations
relating to hotel occupancy taxes lack merit and will continue
to defend vigorously against them.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
    Condition and Results of Operations

Overview

Expedia, Inc. is an online travel company, empowering business
and leisure travelers with the tools and information they need
to efficiently research, plan, book and experience travel. We
have created a global travel marketplace used by a broad range
of leisure and corporate travelers and offline retail travel
agents. We make available, on a stand-alone and package basis,
travel products and services provided by numerous airlines,
lodging properties, car rental companies, destination service
providers, cruise lines and other travel products and services.

We refer to Expedia, Inc. and its subsidiaries collectively as
“Expedia,” the “Company,” “us,”
“we” and “our” in this management’s
discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of
operations. For additional information about our portfolio of
brands, see the disclosure set forth in Part  I,
Item 1, Business, under the caption “Management
Overview.”

Trends

The travel industry, which includes travel agencies and travel
suppliers has been characterized by rapid and significant
change. The U.S. airline sector has experienced significant
turmoil in recent years, with several of the largest airlines
seeking the protection of Chapter 11 bankruptcy
proceedings. The need to rationalize high fixed cost structures
to better compete with low cost carriers offering no frills
flights at discounted prices, as well as the pressure of high
priced jet fuel has caused the airlines to aggressively pursue
cost reductions in every aspect of their operations. These cost
reduction efforts include distribution costs, which the airlines
have pursued by seeking to reduce travel agent commissions. The
airlines are also pursuing reduced fees with the GDS
intermediaries as their contracts with the GDSs come up for
renewal in 2006. In addition, the US airline industry has
experienced increased load factors and ticket prices. These
trends have affected our ability to obtain inventory in our
merchant air business as suppliers lower discounting of merchant
air tickets. Although these competitive forces have caused our
air revenue per ticket to decline, our worldwide air revenue has
grown year over year, primarily due to increases in the number
of air tickets sold.

The hotel sector has recently been characterized by robust
demand and constrained supply, resulting in increasing occupancy
rates and average daily rates. The higher occupancy rates and
increasing average daily rates have had a positive effect on our
operations by contributing to growth in our merchant hotel
revenue.

Increased usage and familiarity with the internet has driven
rapid growth in online penetration of travel expenditures.
According to PhoCusWright, 29% of U.S. leisure and
unmanaged travel expenditures occurred online in 2005, more than
double the 14% rate in 2002. An estimated 14% of European travel
was booked online in 2005, up from just 4% in 2002. In addition
to the growth of online travel agencies, airlines, and lodging
companies have aggressively pursued direct online distribution
of their products and services over the last several years, with
supplier growth outpacing online growth since 2002.
Differentiation among the various website offerings have
narrowed in the past several years, and the travel landscape has
grown extremely competitive, with the need for competitors to
generally differentiate their offerings on a feature other than
price.

Strategy

We are in the early stages of leveraging our historic strength
as an efficient transaction processor to become a retailer and
merchandiser of travel experiences. Our business strategy to
accomplish this is as follows:

Leverage our portfolio of travel brands.

We seek to
appeal to the broadest possible range of travelers and suppliers
through our collection of industry-leading brands. We target
several different demographics, from the value-conscious
traveler through our Hotwire brand to luxury travelers seeking a
high-touch,



customized vacation package through our Classic Vacations brand.
We believe our flagship Expedia brand appeals to the broadest
range of travelers, with its extensive product offering and
facilitation of single item purchases of discounted product to
complex bundling of higher-end travel packages. Our Hotels.com
site and its international versions target travelers with
premium content about lodging properties, and generally appeal
to travelers with shorter booking windows who prefer to drive to
their destination.

Innovate on behalf of travelers and supplier partners.

We
have a long tradition of innovation, from Expedia.com’s
inception as a division of Microsoft, to our introduction of
Best Fare Search and dynamic packaging technologies to more
recent innovations such as traveler reviews, Personal Trip
Guides, Best Price Guarantee, Expedia Corporate Travel’s
TripController software and our AirShopper

e-mail

campaign.

We will continue to aggressively innovate on behalf of our
travelers and suppliers. As an example, for our travelers, we
are currently investing in and building a scaleable, extensible,
service-oriented technology platform, which will extend across
our portfolio of brands. This transition will allow us to
improve our site merchandising, browse and search functionality
and add significant personalization features. We expect this
transition to occur in a phased approach, with worldwide points
of sale migrating to the new platform by early 2008. For our
suppliers, we have developed proprietary, supplier-oriented
technology that streamlines the interaction between some of our
websites and hotel property management systems, making it easier
and more cost-effective for hotels to manage reservations made
through our brands.

Expand our international and corporate travel businesses.

We currently operate Expedia-branded sites in the U.S., Canada,
U.K., Germany, France, Italy, the Netherlands and Australia. We
intend to continue investing in and growing our existing
international points of sale. We anticipate launching additional
countries in the future where we find large travel markets and
rapid growth of online commerce. In addition, we operate sites
in the People’s Republic of China through eLong, which we
acquired in January 2005.

Expedia Corporate Travel (“ECT”) currently conducts
operations in the U.S., Canada, U.K., France, Belgium, the
Netherlands and Luxembourg. We believe the corporate travel
sector represents a large opportunity for Expedia, and we
believe we offer a compelling technology solution to small and
medium-sized businesses seeking to control travel costs and
improve their employees’ travel experiences. Expanding our
corporate travel business also increases our appeal to travel
product and service suppliers, as the average corporate traveler
has a higher incidence of first class and international travel
than the average leisure traveler.

Expand our product and service offerings worldwide.

In
general, through our websites, we offer the most comprehensive
array of innovation and selection of travel products and
services to travelers. We plan to continue improving and growing
these offerings, as well as expanding them to our worldwide
points of sale over time.

Leverage our scale in technology and operations.

The
travel brands comprising Expedia, Inc. have invested over
$3 billion in technology, operations, brand building,
supplier integration and relationships and other areas since the
launch of Expedia.com in 1996. We intend to continue leveraging
our substantial investment when launching new countries,
introducing site features, adding supplier products and services
or adding value-added content for travelers. We have been able
to launch the Italy and Australia websites relatively quickly
and inexpensively by leveraging our existing technology and
product supply.

For additional information about our brands, see the disclosure
set forth under the caption “Description of Business.”

Seasonality

We generally experience seasonal fluctuations in the demand for
our travel products and services. For example, traditional
leisure travel bookings are generally the highest in the first
three quarters as travelers plan and book their spring, summer
and holiday travel. The number of bookings decreases in the
fourth quarter. Because revenue in the merchant business is
generally recognized when the travel takes place



rather than when it is booked, revenue typically lags bookings
by a month or longer. As a result, revenue is typically the
lowest in the first quarter and highest in the third quarter.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

To understand our financial position and results of operations,
it is important to understand our critical accounting policies
and estimates and the extent to which we use judgment and
estimates in applying those policies. We prepared our
consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the
United States. Preparation of the consolidated financial
statements and accompanying notes requires that we make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial
statements and revenue and expenses during the periods reported.
We base our estimates on historical experience, where
applicable, and other assumption that we believe are reasonable
under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from our
estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

There are certain critical estimates that we believe require
significant judgment in the preparation of our consolidated
financial statements. We consider an accounting estimate to be
critical if:

•

It requires us to make assumption because information was not
    available at the time or it included matters that were highly
    uncertain at the time we were making the estimate, and

•

Changes in the estimate or different estimates that we could
    have selected may have had a material impact on our financial
    condition or results of operations.

For more information on each of these policies, see the notes to
consolidated financial statements. We discuss information about
the nature and rationale for our critical accounting estimates
below.

Accounting for Certain Merchant Revenue

We accrue the cost of certain merchant revenue based on the
amount we expect from suppliers’ invoices. In certain
instances when a supplier invoices us for less than the cost we
accrued, we recognize those amounts as revenue six months in
arrears, net of an allowance, when we determine it is not
probable that we will be required to pay the supplier, based on
historical experience. Actual revenue could be greater or lower
than the amounts estimated due to changes in hotel billing
practices or changes in traveler behavior. Historically
adjustments related to this account have not been material.

Recoverability of Goodwill and Indefinite and Definite
    Long-Lived Intangible Assets

Goodwill.

In accordance with SFAS No. 142,
“Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,”
(“SFAS 142”), we assess goodwill for impairment
annually at the beginning of the fourth quarter, or more
frequently, if an event occurs or circumstances change that more
likely than not reduce the fair values of our reporting units
below their carrying values. The impairment test requires us to
estimate the fair value of our reporting units. If the carrying
value of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value, the goodwill
of the reporting unit is potentially impaired and we proceed to
step two of the impairment analysis. In step two of the
analysis, we will record an impairment loss equal to the excess
of the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill over
its implied fair value should such a circumstance arise.

We generally base our measurement of fair value of reporting
units on a blended analysis of the present value of future
discounted cash flows and market valuation approach weighted at
75% and 25% of the indicated fair value, respectively. The
discounted cash flows model indicates the fair value of the
reporting units based on the present value of the cash flows
that we expect the reporting units to generate in the future.
Our significant estimate in the discounted cash flows model
include: our weighted average cost of capital; long-term rate of
growth and profitability of our business; and effective income
tax rate. The market valuation approach indicates the fair value
of the business based on a comparison of the company to
comparable firms in similar lines of business that are publicly
traded. Our significant estimates in the market approach model
include identifying similar companies with comparable business
factors such



as size, growth, profitability, risk and return on investment
and assessing comparable revenue and operating income multiples
in estimating the fair value of the reporting units.

We believe the weighted use of discounted cash flows and market
approach is the best method for determining the fair value of
our reporting units because:

The use of different estimates or assumptions in determining the
fair value of our goodwill may result in different values for
these assets, which could result in an impairment.

Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets.

We base our
measurement of fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets,
which primarily consist of tradename and trademarks, using the
relief-from-royalty method. This method assumes that the
tradename and trademarks have value to the extent that their
owner is relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the
benefits received from them. This method requires us to estimate
the future revenue and expenses for the related brands, the
appropriate royalty rate and the weighted average cost of
capital.

The use of different estimates or assumptions in determining the
fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets may result
in different values for these assets, which could result in an
impairment.

Definite-Lived Intangible Assets.

In accordance with
SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or
Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,” we review the carrying
value of intangible assets with definite lives and other
long-lived assets, which we amortize over the estimated useful
lives of two to ten years, on a regular basis for the existence
of facts that may indicate that the assets are impaired. If such
facts indicate a potential impairment, we estimate the fair
value of the asset using appropriate valuation methodologies,
usually based on estimated future discounted cash flows. If the
fair value is determined to be less than an asset’s
carrying value, we then evaluate if the carrying value is deemed
to be unrecoverable. Our analysis is based on available
information and on assumptions and projections that we consider
to be reasonable and supportable. This analysis requires us to
estimate current and future cash flows attributable to the group
of assets, the time period for which they will be held and used
as well as a discount rate to incorporate the time value of
money and the risks inherent in future cash flows.

The use of different estimates or assumptions in determining the
fair value of our definite-lived intangible assets may result in
different values for these assets, which could result in an
impairment.

Income Taxes

In accordance with SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for
Income Taxes,” we record income taxes under the liability
method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect our
estimation of the future tax consequences of temporary
differences between the carrying amounts of assets and
liabilities for book and tax purposes. We determine deferred
income taxes based on the differences in accounting methods and
timing between financial statement and income tax reporting.
Accordingly, we determine the deferred tax asset or liability
for each temporary difference based on the tax rates that we
expect will be in effect when we realize the underlying items of
income and expense.

We consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future
realization of our deferred tax assets, including our recent
earnings experience by jurisdiction, expectations of future
taxable income, the



carryforward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes,
as well as other relevant factors. We may establish a valuation
allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount we expect
to realize. Due to inherent complexities arising from the nature
of our businesses, future changes in income tax law, tax sharing
agreements or variances between our actual and anticipated
operating results, we make certain judgments and estimates.
Therefore, actual income taxes could vary from these estimates.

In conjunction with the Spin-Off we entered into a Tax Sharing
Agreement with IAC. We will file a consolidated tax return with
IAC for the period from January 1, 2005, to August 8,
2005. There are two methods that can be used for the calculation
of income taxes for that period:

close-the

-book or
pro-rata. IAC has sole discretion to determine which method. We
have made assumptions as to how IAC will choose to characterize
certain transactions and as to which method it will choose.
Should these assumptions differ materially from actions IAC
takes, our balance sheet classification could be materially
affected as could our use of certain deductions and the period
in which our net operating loss carryforwards are fully utilized.

Other Long-Term Liabilities

Various Legal and Tax Contingencies.

We record
liabilities to address potential exposures related to business
and tax positions we have taken that have been or could be
challenged by taxing authorities. In addition, we record
liabilities associated with legal proceedings and lawsuits.
These liabilities are recorded when the likelihood of payment is
probable and the amounts can be reasonably estimated. The
determination for required liabilities is based upon analysis of
each individual tax issue, or legal proceeding, taking into
consideration the likelihood of adverse judgments and the range
of possible loss. In addition, our analysis may be based on
discussions with outside legal counsel. The ultimate resolution
of these potential tax exposures and legal proceedings may be
greater or less than the liabilities recorded.

Occupancy Tax.

Some states and localities impose a
transient occupancy or accommodation tax, or a form of sales
tax, on the use or occupancy of hotel accommodations. Hotel
operators generally collect and remit these taxes to the various
tax authorities. Consistent with this practice, when a customer
books a room through one of our travel services, the hotel
charges taxes based on the room rate paid to the hotel, we pay
those taxes invoiced by the hotel and we recover an equivalent
amount from the customer. We do not collect or remit occupancy
taxes, nor do we pay occupancy taxes to the hotel operator on
the portion of the customer payment we retain. Some
jurisdictions have questioned our practice in this regard. While
the applicable tax provisions vary among the jurisdictions, we
generally believe that we are not required to collect and remit
such occupancy taxes. We are engaged in discussions with tax
authorities in various jurisdictions to resolve this issue. Some
tax authorities have brought lawsuits asserting that we are
required to collect and remit occupancy tax. The ultimate
resolution in all jurisdictions cannot be determined at this
time.

We have established a reserve with respect to potential
occupancy tax liability for prior and current periods,
consistent with applicable accounting principles and in light of
all current facts and circumstances. A variety of factors could
affect the amount of the liability (both past and future), which
factors include, but are not limited to, the number of, and
amount of revenue represented by, jurisdictions that ultimately
assert a claim and prevail in assessing such additional tax or
negotiate a settlement and changes in relevant statutes.

We note that there are more than 7,000 taxing jurisdictions in
the United States, and it is not feasible to analyze the
statutes, regulations and judicial and administrative rulings in
every jurisdiction. Rather, we have obtained the advice of state
and local tax experts with respect to tax laws of certain states
and local jurisdictions that represent a large portion of our
hotel revenue. It is possible that some jurisdictions may
introduce new legislation regarding the imposition of occupancy
taxes on businesses that arrange the booking of hotel
accommodations. We will continue to monitor the issue closely
and provide additional disclosure, as well as adjust the level
of reserves, as developments warrant. Additionally, we and
certain of our businesses are involved in occupancy tax related
litigation which is discussed in “Item 3 —
Legal Proceedings.”



Stock-Based Compensation

We record stock-based compensation expense net of estimated
forfeitures. In determining the estimated forfeiture rates, we
periodically conduct an assessment of the actual number of
instruments that have been forfeited to date as well as those
expected to be forfeited in the future. We consider many factors
when estimating expected forfeitures, including the type of
award, the employee class and historical experience. The
estimation of stock awards that will ultimately be forfeited
requires significant judgment and to the extent that actual
results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates,
such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the
period such estimates are revised. In 2005, we recognized
changes in estimates related to our forfeiture rate.

New Accounting Pronouncements

For a discussion of new accounting pronouncements, see
Note 4, New Accounting Pronouncements, in the notes to
consolidated financial statements.

Operating Metrics

Our operating results are affected by certain metrics that
represent the selling activities generated by our travel
products and services. As travelers have increased their use of
the internet to book their travel arrangements, we have seen our
gross bookings increase, reflecting the growth in the online
travel industry and our business acquisitions. Gross bookings
include the total price due from travelers, including taxes,
fees and other charges, and are generally not reduced for
cancellations and traveler refunds.

Gross bookings increased $2.8 billion, or 22%, in 2005
compared to 2004, and $3.2 billion, or 33%, in 2004
compared to 2003. Gross bookings represent the total retail
value of transactions recorded for both agency and merchant
transactions at the time of booking. In 2005, domestic gross
bookings increased 15% and international gross bookings
increased 50%, compared to 2004. In 2004, domestic gross
bookings increased 24% and international gross bookings
increased 103%, compared to 2003. The increases in 2005 and 2004
were primarily due to increases in transaction volumes and
acquisitions.

Beginning January 1, 2004, as part of the integration of
our businesses, Hotels.com conformed its merchant hotel business
practices with those of our other businesses. As a result, we
commenced prospectively reporting revenue for Hotels.com on a
net basis. We have presented certain of our 2003 information in
the table above on an as reported and comparable net basis.

Revenue margin, which is defined as revenue as a percentage of
gross bookings, decreased 80 basis points in 2005 compared
to 2004. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in air
revenue per ticket and hotel margins. In 2005, revenue margin
decreased 90 basis points in our domestic operations and
21 basis points in our international operations. Revenue
margin decreased by 20 basis points in 2004 compared to
2003 due primarily to the decline in merchant hotel raw margins
and lower air revenue per transaction. This decrease was
partially offset by higher merchant hotel average daily room
rates and acquisitions.

In 2005, the increase in revenue was primarily due to increases
in worldwide merchant hotel business, worldwide air revenue,
growth in our car rental business and acquisitions. Worldwide
merchant hotel revenue increased 10% in 2005 compared to 2004.
The increase was primarily due to a 9% increase in room nights
and a 1% increase in revenue per room night. The increase in
revenue per room night was primarily due to a 7% increase in
average daily rates, offset by a contraction in hotel raw margin
(defined as hotel net revenue as a percentage of hotel gross
bookings).

Worldwide air revenue increased 5% in 2005 compared to 2004.
Year-over-year, the air tickets sold increased by 17%, offset by
an 11% decrease in air revenue per ticket. The increase in air
tickets sold is primarily due to the growth in domestic ticket
sales while the decrease in air revenue per tickets resulted
from less inventory allocation and lower discounting of merchant
air tickets, as the industry experienced high load factors.

Other revenue, which includes car rental, destination services
and cruise, increased by 57% in 2005 compared to 2004, primarily
due to acquisitions and growth in the car rental business.
International revenue increased by 48% in 2005 compared to 2004,
primarily due to our acquisitions and continued growth from
international websites.

In 2004, the decrease in revenue compared to 2003 revenue (as
reported) was due to a change in business practice at Hotels.com
to conform its business practice to the approach used by the
other Expedia Businesses. Our 2004 revenue increased compared to
2003 revenue (on a net comparable basis) primarily due to
increases in worldwide merchant hotel business, worldwide air
revenue, packages and acquisitions. In 2003, revenue included a
favorable adjustment of $22.4 million related to estimated
merchant supplier payables.

Worldwide merchant hotel revenue increased 24% in 2004 compared
to 2003, primarily due to an increase in hotel room nights
stayed, combined with an increase in revenue per room night.
Year-over-year, merchant hotel room nights stayed, including
rooms booked as a component of packages, increased 21%,
reflecting continued growth in international demand,
acquisitions and growth in our private label and affiliate
programs. Revenue per room night increased 3% primarily due to
increases in average daily room rates, partially offset by a
decline in merchant hotel raw margins.

The domestic merchant hotel business in 2004 presented a more
challenging environment than the prior year, primarily due to
increased third party distributor competition, promotion by
hotel chains from their own direct sites and higher overall
occupancy rates. These increases resulted in decreased
availability of favorably priced travel products and services
when compared with 2003.

Worldwide air revenue increased 34% in 2004 compared to 2003.
Year-over-year, the number of air tickets sold increased by 33%
primarily due to the growth in domestic and international ticket
sales. Acquisitions also contributed to the increase in
worldwide air revenue.



International revenue increased 111% in 2004 compared to 2003.
This was primarily due to growth in the hotel and air businesses
from acquisitions and increased activity from international
websites.

Cost of revenue primarily consists of (1) credit card
merchant fees, (2) reserves and related payments for
product and services purchased with fraudulent credit cards and
other chargebacks, (3) fees paid to our fulfillment vendors
for issuing airline tickets and related traveler services,
(4) costs for the operations of our data center and call
centers, including personnel-related costs, and (5) costs
paid to suppliers for destination service inventory related to
the portion of our destination services that is reported on a
gross basis.

The cost of revenue increase in 2005 was primarily due to costs
associated with an increase in transaction volumes and
acquisitions. In 2004, the decrease in cost of revenue compared
to 2003 revenue (as reported) was due to a change in business
practice at Hotels.com to conform its business practice to the
approach used by the other Expedia Businesses. On a comparable
net basis, the cost of revenue increased in 2004 compared to
2003 primarily due to costs associated with an increase in
transaction volumes.

Gross profit increased in 2005 compared to 2004, primarily due
to an increase in transaction volumes, while gross margin
decreased by 1% due to our acquisition of a destination services
company, which records its revenue on a gross basis. Gross
profit increased in 2004 compared to 2003, primarily due to the
growth in our merchant hotel business, including increased
revenue from international websites and packages.

Selling and marketing expense relates to direct advertising and
distribution expense, including traffic generation from internet
portals, search engines, private label and affiliate programs.
The remainder of the expense relates to personnel costs,
including market manager staffing in our Partner Services Group
(“PSG”), which enhances our relationships with both
supplier relationships and destination services desk personnel.



In 2005, the increase in selling and marketing expense was
primarily due to growth in personnel costs, including costs
associated with the PSG team expansion and destination services
staffing assumed in our acquisitions, offset by a decrease in
offline marketing spend for certain businesses and keyword
search efficiencies. Selling and marketing expense in 2004
includes a favorable adjustment for the reversal of
$6.4 million associated with the resolution of a
contractual dispute.

In 2004, the increase in selling and marketing expense was
primarily due to higher search-related costs and increased
marketing volume, offset by a favorable adjustment related to
the reversal of $6.4 million associated with the resolution
of a contractual dispute. Higher costs of traffic acquisition
online and greater emphasis on international businesses also
contributed to higher expenses. Our international businesses
have higher selling and marketing costs compared to revenue as
they are in early development stages compared to our
U.S. businesses. Acquisitions also contributed to the
increase in selling and marketing expense.

While we remain focused on optimizing the efficiency of our
various selling and marketing channels, we expect the absolute
amounts spent in selling and marketing to increase over time due
to continued expansion of our international businesses, reduced
opportunities for offline spend efficiencies, inflation in
search-related and other traffic acquisition vehicles, increased
marketing volumes and increased fixed costs associated with the
increase in staffing in our market management area. In 2006, we
expect selling and marketing expense to increase as a percentage
of revenue as we continue to support and invest in our brand
portfolio.

General and administrative expense consists primarily of
(1) personnel-related costs for support functions that
include our executive leadership, finance, legal, tax and human
resources and (2) fees for external professional services
including legal, tax and accounting.

In 2005, the increase in general and administrative expense was
primarily due to acquisitions, an increase in our use of
professional services and costs to build our executive teams and
supporting staff levels largely in connection with being a
stand-alone public company. In addition, we incurred one-time
expenses specifically related to the Spin-Off. We expect
absolute amounts spent on corporate personnel and professional
services to increase over time as we add personnel and continue
incurring incremental costs as a stand-alone public company.

In 2004, the increase in general and administrative expense was
primarily due to increased personnel in administrative
functions, such as legal, tax, accounting and information
technology and acquisitions. In addition, due to the increasing
complexity of our businesses, we utilized external professional
services for legal, tax and accounting to a greater extent in
2004 than in 2003.

Technology and content expense consists of expenses for
customizing our websites, amortization of website and internal
software development costs, localization of our websites, and
product development expenses such as personnel-related costs.

The year over year increases were primarily due to an increase
in the number of personnel involved in website development and
engineering teams working on increasing our level of site
innovation. In 2003, technology and content expense includes a
$4.7 million write-down related to the packaging technology
used by Hotels.com as a result of adopting Expedia.com’s
packaging technology.

Given the increasing complexity of our business, geographic
expansion, initiatives in corporate travel, increased supplier
integration, service-oriented architecture improvements and
other initiatives, we expect absolute amounts spent on
technology and content expenses to increase over time.

Amortization of intangible assets consists of amortization of
intangible assets with definite lives related to business
acquisitions.

In 2005, amortization of intangibles expense was flat compared
to 2004, because the amortization of intangibles related to new
business acquisitions was offset by the decrease in amortization
related to intangibles that were fully amortized.

In 2004, the increase in amortization of intangibles expense was
primarily due to the addition of intangible assets associated
with IAC’s acquisition of the minority interest in
Expedia.com and Hotels.com in 2003, as well as the acquisition
of Hotwire.com in 2003.

For additional information about our acquisitions, see
Note 5, Business Acquisitions, in the notes to consolidated

Stock-based compensation expense consists primarily of the
amortization of the fair value of equity awards that we assumed
from IAC related to the Expedia.com and Hotels.com acquisitions
as well as expense for restricted stock unit (“RSU”)
grants to employees. In addition, we capitalize stock-based
compensation, net of estimated future forfeitures, related to
personnel who develop our internal use software. We record
amortization expense related to these capitalized costs in
stock-based compensation expense on a straight line basis over
the useful life of the internal use software.

In 2005, we recorded stock-based compensation expense of
$91.7 million primarily relating to stock options and RSU
grants. Our 2005 stock-based compensation expense includes a
benefit of $44.7 million related to changes in estimated
forfeiture rates for stock options, RSUs and other equity
compensation and capitalization of software development costs,
partially offset by a modification charge on stock option awards
related to the Spin-Off. In 2005, we completed assessments of
the estimated forfeiture rates including analyses of the actual
number of instruments that had forfeited to date compared to
prior estimates and an evaluation of future estimated
forfeitures.

RSUs have been the primary form of stock-based awards granted to
our employees since 2003. Because RSUs contain no exercise
price, the number of RSUs awarded is typically less than the
number of options that might have been granted in the past.

Assuming, among other things, that our stock price does not vary
widely from present levels, we anticipate the stock-based
compensation expense will decrease from $136.4 million
(before the benefit of $44.7 million discussed above) as
stock options granted in 2003 and prior are fully amortized and
replaced with amortization expense from RSU.

In 2004, the increase in stock-based compensation expense was
due to acquisitions of Expedia.com and Hotels.com in 2003, which
resulted in the conversion of all Expedia.com and Hotels.com
stock options, warrants and RSU grants into IAC equity grants
and valued at the time of conversion.

Amortization of non-cash distribution and marketing expense
consists mainly of advertising from Universal Television
contributed to us by IAC at Spin-Off. We use this advertising
without any cash cost.

In 2005, the decrease in amortization of non-cash distribution
and marketing expense compared to 2004 was due to a decline in
the amount of television advertising that we used.

In 2004, the decrease in amortization of non-cash distribution
and marketing expense compared to 2003 was primarily due to the
termination of Hotels.com’s distribution agreement with
Travelocity in 2003.

In 2005, the increase in operating income was primarily due to
increased revenue, which contributed to a higher gross profit,
and a decrease in stock-based compensation due to changes in the
estimated forfeiture rates used to determine stock-based
compensation, offset by an increase in selling and marketing,
general and administrative, and technology and content expense
as discussed above. In 2005, operating income included a
$79.7 million decrease to stock-based compensation expense
mainly due the benefit of $44.7 million related to changes
in estimated forfeiture rates for stock options, RSUs and other
equity compensation and capitalization of software development
costs, partially offset by a modification charge on stock option
awards related to the Spin-Off. Operating income was favorably
impacted in 2004 by a $12.1 million net reserve adjustment
primarily related to the reversal of an air excise tax reserve
and the resolution of a contractual dispute.

In 2004, the decrease in operating income was due to an increase
in the amortization of intangibles principally due to the
increase in intangible assets upon IAC’s acquisition of the
minority interest in Hotels.com and Expedia.com in 2003 and
other acquisitions, an increase in stock-based compensation due
to the Expedia.com and Hotels.com mergers in 2003, partially
offset by a decrease in non-cash distribution and marketing
expense due to the termination of Hotels.com distribution
agreement with Travelocity and a decrease in merger costs.
Operating income was favorably impacted by a $4.7 million
write-down relating to packaging technology by Hotels.com in
2003.

In 2005, the increase in OIBA was primarily due to increases in
revenue that contributed to a higher gross profit, offset by
increases in selling and marketing, general and administrative,
and technology and content expense discussed above.

In 2004, the increase in OIBA was primarily due to increases in
revenue that contributed to higher gross profit, profitability
from our European operations and acquisitions, partially offset
by an increase in selling and marketing, general and
administrative, and technology and content expense discussed
above.

Definition of OIBA

We provide OIBA as a supplemental measure to GAAP. We define
OIBA as operating income plus: (1) amortization of non-cash
distribution and marketing expense (2) stock-based
compensation expense, (3) amortization of intangibles and
goodwill impairment, if applicable and (4) certain one-time
items, if applicable.

OIBA is one of the primary metrics by which management evaluates
the performance of the business, on which internal budgets are
based, and by which management is compensated. Management
believes that investors should have access to the same set of
tools that management uses to analyze our results. This non-GAAP
measure should be considered in addition to results prepared in
accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute
for or superior to GAAP. We endeavor to compensate for the
limitation of the non-GAAP measure presented by also providing
the comparable GAAP measures, GAAP financial statements, and
descriptions of the reconciling items and adjustments, to derive
the non-GAAP measure. We present a reconciliation of this
non-GAAP financial measure from GAAP to non-GAAP below.

OIBA represents the combined operating results of Expedia,
Inc.’s businesses, taking into account depreciation, which
we believe is an ongoing cost of doing business, but excluding
the effects of other non-



cash expenses that may not be indicative of our core business
operations. We believe this measure is useful to investors for
the following reasons:

•

It corresponds more closely to the cash operating income
    generated from our core operations by excluding significant
    non-cash operating expenses.

•

It aids in forecasting and analyzing future operating income as
    stock-based compensation and non-cash distribution and marketing
    expenses are likely to decline significantly going forward.

•

It provides greater insight into management decision making at
    Expedia, as OIBA is our primary internal metric for evaluating
    the performance of our businesses.

OIBA has certain limitations in that it does not take into
account the impact to Expedia, Inc.’s statements of income
of certain expenses, including stock-based compensation,
non-cash payments to partners, acquisition-related accounting
and certain one-time items. Due to the high variability and
difficulty in predicting certain items that affect net income,
such as interest rates and tax rates, we are unable to provide
reconciliation to net income on a forward-looking basis without
unreasonable efforts.

    Income

Interest income increased due to the growth in our intercompany

interest rates earned on these balances. The intercompany
receivable balances were covered by a cash management
arrangement with IAC until the Spin-Off. Because we extinguished
our intercompany receivable balances with IAC at Spin-Off, we
expect our interest income to decrease significantly in 2006. In
2005, other interest income (expense), net includes interest

non-deductible stock-based compensation expense, unrealized

In 2003, our effective tax rate was higher than the 35%

For additional information about income taxes, see Note 13,

Financial Position, Liquidity and Capital Resources

Sources and Uses of Cash

In July 2005, we entered into a $1.0 billion revolving
credit facility. As of December 31, 2005, our outstanding
balance on the revolving credit facility was
$230.0 million, which consisted of short-term borrowings.
We repaid this balance during the first quarter of 2006, and as
of March 24, 2006, we did not have any outstanding
borrowing under the revolving credit facility. At
December 31, 2005, we were in compliance with all related
financial covenants.

In the merchant business, we receive cash from travelers at the
time of booking and we record these amounts on our consolidated
balance sheets as deferred merchant bookings. We pay our
suppliers related to these bookings approximately one week after
completing the transaction for air travel and, for all other
merchant bookings, after the travelers’ use and the
subsequent billing from the supplier. Therefore, especially for
the hotel business, which represents the majority of our
merchant bookings, there is generally some time from the receipt
of the cash from the traveler to the payment to the suppliers.

As long as the merchant hotel business continues to grow, as it
has historically, and our business model does not change, we
expect that the change in working capital will continue to be
positive. If these businesses decline or if the model changes,
it could negatively affect our working capital. As of
December 31, 2005, we had a deficit in our working capital
of $848.0 million, compared to a positive amount of
$1.3 billion as of December 31, 2004. The fluctuation
in our working capital was due to the $2.5 billion net
intercompany receivable balance we extinguished through a
non-cash distribution to IAC upon our Spin-Off on August 9,
2005.

Seasonal fluctuations in our merchant bookings affect our cash
flows. During the first half of the year, hotel bookings have
traditionally exceeded stays, resulting in much higher cash flow
related to working capital. During the second half of the year,
this pattern reverses. While we expect the impact of seasonal
fluctuations to continue, changes in the rate of growth of
merchant bookings may affect working capital, which might
counteract or intensify the anticipated seasonal fluctuations.

We anticipate continued investment in the development and
expansion of our operations. These investments include but are
not limited to improvements of our product support
infrastructure, marketing and sales strategy, corresponding
distribution channels and existing technology. Our future
capital requirements may include capital needs for acquisitions,
legal risks and to support our business strategy. In



the event we have acquisitions, this may reduce our cash balance
and increase our debt. Legal risks and challenges to our
business strategy may also negatively affect our cash balance.

In our opinion, available cash, funds from operations and
available borrowings, in the form of the revolving credit
facility, will provide sufficient capital resources to meet our
foreseeable liquidity needs.

Cash Flows

In 2005, net cash provided by operating activities increased by
$47.0 million, to $849.9 million. This increase was
primarily due to an increase in cash flows from operating
income. In addition, we made tax payments of $11.1 million,
an increase of $3.9 million from 2004, reducing cash
provided by operations. Cash used in investing activities
decreased by $131.1 million from 2004 primarily due to a
$515.5 million decrease in transfers to IAC and the absence
of the 2004 cash acquisitions. Cash provided by financing
activities decreased due to withholding taxes for stock option
exercises of $86.6 million that we paid on behalf of a
senior executive in exchange for surrendering a portion of his
vested shares, and distributions to IAC of $52.8 million,
offset by an increase in short-term borrowings of
$230.8 million and proceeds from the exercise of stock
option exercises of $29.1 million.

In 2004, net cash provided by operating activities increased by
$158.8 million, to $802.9 million. This increase was
primarily due to cash flows from the merchant hotel business and
changes in working capital. In addition, we made tax payments of
$7.3 million, an increase of $2.8 million from 2003,
reducing cash provided by operations. Cash used in investing
activities decreased $319.1 million from 2003 primarily due
to a $1.3 billion decrease in marketable securities
purchased and a $443.5 million decrease in cash used for
acquisitions, offset by a $724.4 million increase in
transfers to IAC and a $606.8 million decrease in
marketable securities sales proceeds. These net transfers of our
excess cash to IAC facilitated centralization of their
investment management. These activities ceased upon Spin-Off.
Cash provided by financing activities decreased
$478.4 million in 2004 reflecting a decrease in IAC
contributions of $524.9 million.

Part II. Item 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market
    Risk

Market Risk Management

Market risk is the potential loss from adverse changes in
interest rates, foreign exchange rates and market prices. Our
exposure to market risk includes our revolving credit facility,
derivative instruments and marketable and debt securities. We
manage our exposure to these risks through established policies
and procedures. Our objective is to mitigate potential income
statement, cash flow and market exposures from changes in
interest and foreign exchange rates.

Interest Rate Risk

In July 2005, we entered into a $1.0 billion revolving
credit facility. The revolving credit facility bears interest
based on our financial leverage and as of December 31,
2005, was equal to LIBOR plus 0.50%. As a result, we may be
susceptible to fluctuations in interest rates if we do not hedge
the interest rate exposure arising from any borrowings under our
revolving credit facility.

As of December 31, 2005, our outstanding borrowing under
the revolving credit facility was $230.0 million. We repaid
this balance in March 2006. We did not experience any
significant impact from changes in interest rate during the year
ended December 31, 2005.

Foreign Exchange Risk

We conduct business in certain international markets, primarily
in Australia, Canada, China and the European Union. Because we
operate in international markets, we have exposure to different
economic climates, political arenas, tax systems and regulations
that could affect foreign exchange rates. Our primary exposure
to foreign currency risk relates to transacting in foreign
currency and recording the activity in U.S. dollars. We
mitigate this exposure by maintaining natural hedges between our
foreign currency denominated current assets and current
liabilities. Changes in exchange rates between the
U.S. dollar and these other currencies will result in a
transaction gain or loss, which we will recognize in our
consolidated statements of income.



As we increase our operations in international markets, our
exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates
increases. The economic impact to us of foreign currency
exchange rate movements is linked to variability in real growth,
inflation, interest rates, governmental actions and other
factors. These changes, if material, could cause us to adjust
our financing and operating strategies.

As foreign currency exchange rates fluctuate, translation of the
income statements of our international businesses into
U.S. dollars affects year-over-year comparability of
operating results. Historically, we have not hedged foreign
exchange risks because we generally reinvested cash flows from
international operations locally. We periodically review our
strategy for hedging foreign exchange risks. Our goal in
managing our foreign exchange risk is to minimize our potential
exposure to the changes that exchange rates might have on our
earnings, cash flows and financial position.

We use cross-currency swaps to hedge against the change in value
of an asset denominated in a currency other than the
subsidiary’s functional currency. For additional
information about our cross-currency swaps, see Note 10,
Derivative Instruments, in the notes to consolidated financial
statements.

Equity Price Risk

We do not maintain any investments in equity securities as part
of our marketable securities investment strategy. Our equity
price risk relates to fluctuation in our stock price, which
affects our derivative liabilities related to outstanding stock
warrants and Ask Jeeves Notes. We base the fair value of the
these derivative instruments on the changes in the market price
of our common stock.

In January 2006, certain of these notes were converted for
approximately $68.2 million of common stock, or
2.6 million shares. As notes conversion occur, and reduce
the value of the derivative liabilities, our equity price risk
will decrease accordingly. The Ask Jeeves Notes are due
June 1, 2008; upon maturity of these notes, our obligation
ceases.

As of March 1, 2006, each $1.00 fluctuation in our common
stock will result in approximately $1.7 million change in
the aggregate fair value. An increase in our common stock price
will result in a charge to our consolidated statements of income
and visa versa for a decrease in our common stock price.

For additional information about the stock warrants and Ask
Jeeves Notes, see Note 10, Derivative Instruments, in the
notes to consolidated financial statements.

Controls and Procedures

Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures.

The Company’s management, including the CEO and CFO, does
not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control
over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and
all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and
operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute assurance
that the control system’s objectives will be met. The
design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are
resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be
considered relative to their costs. The design of any system of
controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the
likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that
any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all
potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in
the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.



As required by
Rule

13a-15(b)

under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,as amended (the
“Exchange Act”), our management, including our
Chairman and Senior Executive, Chief Executive Officer and our
Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our
disclosure controls and procedures (as defined by
Rule

13a-15(e)

and

15d-15(e)

under the
Exchange Act).

Based upon that evaluation, our Chairman and Senior Executive,
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded
that as of the end of the period covered by this report, our
disclosure controls and procedures were effective in providing
reasonable assurance that information we are required to
disclose in our filings with the SEC under the Exchange Act is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and include
controls and procedures designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or
submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to
management, including our principal executive and principal
financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure.

Changes in internal control over financial
    reporting.

We have been evaluating, designing and enhancing controls
related to processes that previously were handled by IAC,
including equity transactions, income taxes, derivatives,
treasury functions, and periodic reporting in accordance with
SEC rules and regulations. We also have been evaluating our
internal controls over financial reporting and discussing these
matters with our independent accountants and our audit committee.

Based on these evaluations and discussions, we consider what
revisions, improvements, or corrections are necessary in order
for us to conclude that our internal controls are effective. As
part of this process we have identified a number of areas where
there is a need for improvement in our internal controls over
financial reporting. We are in the process of designing and
implementing controls and processes to address the issues
identified through this review.

As part of this ongoing process to improve our internal controls
over financial reporting, we have taken the following actions:

Except as set forth in (a)-(e) above, there were no changes
to our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred
during the period covered by this report that have materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our
internal control over financial reporting. We expect to continue
monitoring and evaluating our disclosure controls and internal
control over financial reporting on an ongoing basis in an
effort to improve their overall effectiveness. In the course of
this evaluation, we anticipate we will continue to modify and
refine our internal processes over several reporting periods.

stockholders’ equity and comprehensive income and cash
flows for the year ended December 31, 2005. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company’s
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. We were not engaged to perform an
audit of the Company’s internal control over financial
reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control
over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not
for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of
the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
financial position of Expedia, Inc. at December 31, 2005,
and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash

NOTE 1 — Organization and Basis of
Presentation

Description of Business

Expedia, Inc. and its subsidiaries provide travel products and
services to leisure and corporate travelers in the United States
(“U.S.”) and abroad. These travel products and
services are offered through a diversified portfolio of brands
including: Expedia-branded websites, Hotels.com, Hotwire.com,
our private label programs (Worldwide Travel Exchange and
Interactive Affiliate Network), Classic Vacations, Expedia
Corporate Travel (“ECT”), eLong, Inc.
(“eLong”) and TripAdvisor. We refer to Expedia, Inc.
and its subsidiaries collectively as “Expedia,” the
“Company,” “us,” “we” and
“our” in these consolidated financial statements.

Spin-Off from IAC/ InterActiveCorp

On December 21, 2004, IAC/ InterActiveCorp
(“IAC”) announced its plan to separate into two
independent public companies to allow each company to focus on
its individual strategic objectives. We refer to this
transaction as the “Spin-Off.” A new company, Expedia,
Inc., was incorporated under Delaware law in April 2005, to hold
substantially all of IAC’s travel and travel-related
businesses (“Expedia Businesses”).

On August 9, 2005, the Spin-Off of the Expedia Businesses
from IAC was completed. Shares of Expedia, Inc. began trading on
The Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc. (“NASDAQ”) under the
symbol “EXPE.” The Spin-Off affected our consolidated
financial statements as described below.

Cash Transfer.

Upon the Spin-Off, we transferred to IAC
all cash in excess of $100 million, excluding the cash and
cash equivalents held by eLong.

Distribution of Intercompany Receivable and Payable Balances
with IAC.

Upon the Spin-Off, we extinguished all
intercompany receivable and payable balances with IAC by
recording a non-cash distribution to IAC for approximately
$2.5 billion.

Contribution of Airplane.

In conjunction with the
Spin-Off, we entered into a joint ownership and cost sharing
agreement with IAC, under which IAC transferred to us 50%
ownership in an airplane, with a value of $17.4 million,
which is available for use by both companies. We will share
equally in capital costs; operating costs will be pro-rated
based on actual usage. We have recorded our ownership interest
in long-term investments and other assets.

Contribution of Media Time.

In conjunction with the
Spin-Off, we entered into a separation agreement with IAC, under
which Expedia retained rights to media time, with a value of
$17.1 million, in IAC’s media channels. The media
time, if unused, expires in July 2007. We have recorded the
asset rights in prepaid expenses and other assets and recognize
the related expense as we use the media time. We currently
anticipate that the media time will be substantially utilized,
and expensed, in 2006.

Derivative Instruments.

Upon the Spin-Off, we assumed
certain obligations to IAC related to IAC’s Ask Jeeves
Convertible Subordinated Notes (“Ask Jeeves Notes”)
and certain IAC stock warrants. We have recorded these
obligations as derivative liabilities at their fair values on
our consolidated balance sheet. For additional information about
these obligations, see Note 10, Derivative Instruments.

Modification of Stock-Based Compensation Awards.

Upon the
Spin-Off, we issued restricted stock units (“RSU”),
stock options and warrants to replace the IAC stock-based
compensation awards. For additional information about the
modifications, see Note 12, Stock-Based Awards and Other
Equity Instruments.

Recapitalization.

Upon the Spin-Off, IAC common
stockholders received one share of Expedia common stock for each
share of IAC common stock they held, and IAC Class B common
stockholders

F-8


Expedia, Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements — (Continued)

received one share of Expedia Class B common stock for each
share of IAC Class B common stock they held. The holders of
IAC preferred stock were entitled to receive shares of Expedia
preferred stock based on a formula or cash ($50 per share
plus accrued and unpaid dividends). Substantially all of the IAC
Series A preferred stockholders elected to receive cash.
This transaction was recorded by IAC immediately prior to the
Spin-Off and is not reflected in the financial statements. For
additional information about our common stock, Class B
common stock and preferred stock, see Note 14, Common
Stock, Class B Common Stock and Preferred Stock.

Basis of Presentation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include
Expedia, Inc., our wholly owned subsidiaries, and entities we
control. We record our investments in entities that we do not
control, but over which we have the ability to exercise
significant influence, using the equity method. We record our
investments in entities over which we do not have the ability to
exercise significant influence using the cost method. We have
eliminated significant intercompany transactions and accounts.

These consolidated financial statements present our results of
operations, financial position, stockholders’ equity and
comprehensive income, and cash flows since IAC acquired each of
the Expedia Businesses on a combined basis up through the
Spin-Off on August 9, 2005, and on a consolidated basis
thereafter.

We have prepared the combined financial statements from the
historical results of operations and historical bases of the
assets and liabilities of Expedia with the exception of income
taxes. We have computed income taxes using our stand-alone tax
rate.

We believe that the assumptions underlying our consolidated
financial statements are reasonable. However, these consolidated
financial statements do not present our future financial
position, the results of our future operations and cash flows,
nor do they present what our historical financial position,
results of operations and cash flows would have been prior to
Spin-Off had we been a stand-alone company.

Seasonality

We generally experience seasonal fluctuations in the demand for
our travel products and services. For example, traditional
leisure travel bookings are generally the highest in the first
three quarters as travelers plan and book their spring, summer
and holiday travel. The number of bookings decreases in the
fourth quarter. Because revenue in the merchant business is
generally recognized when the travel takes place rather than
when it is booked, revenue typically lags bookings by a month or
longer. As a result, revenue is typically the lowest in the
first quarter and highest in the third quarter.

NOTE 2 — Significant Accounting Policies

Consolidation

Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
Expedia, Inc., our wholly owned subsidiaries, and entities for
which we control a majority of the entity’s outstanding
common stock. We record minority interest in our consolidated
financial statements to recognize the minority ownership
interest in our consolidated subsidiaries. Minority interests in
the earnings and losses of consolidated subsidiaries represent
the share of net income or loss allocated to members or partners
in our consolidated entities, which include the minority
interest share of net income or loss from eLong, TripAdvisor and
ECT — Europe (formerly Egencia). We have eliminated
significant intercompany transactions and accounts in our
consolidated financial statements.

Expedia, Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements — (Continued)

Accounting Estimates

We use estimates and assumptions in the preparation of our
consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States
(“GAAP”). Our estimates and assumptions affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of our
consolidated financial statements. These estimates and
assumptions also affect the reported amount of net income during
any period. Our actual financial results could differ
significantly from these estimates. Our significant estimates
underlying our consolidated financial statements include revenue
recognition, accounting for merchant payables, recoverability of
long-lived and intangible assets and goodwill, income taxes,
occupancy tax, stock-based compensation and accounting for
derivative instruments.

Revenue Recognition

We offer travel products and services on a stand-alone and
package basis primarily through two business models: the
merchant model and the agency model.

Under the merchant model, we facilitate the booking of hotel
rooms, airline seats, car rentals and destination services from
our travel suppliers and we are the merchant of record for such
bookings.

Under the agency model, we act as the agent in the transaction,
passing reservations booked by the traveler to the relevant
travel provider. We receive commissions or ticketing fees from
the travel supplier and/or traveler. For agency airline, hotel
and car transactions, we also receive fees from global
distribution systems partners that control the computer systems
through which these reservations are booked.

We record revenue based principally on Staff Accounting Bulletin
(“SAB”) No. 104 “Revenue Recognition.”
We recognize revenue when it is earned and realizable based on
the following criteria: persuasive evidence of an arrangement
exists, services have been rendered, the price is fixed or
determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured.

The prevailing accounting guidance with respect to the
presentation of revenue on a gross versus a net basis is
contained in Emerging Issues Task Force
No.

99-19,

“Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an
Agent
(“EITF

99-19”).”

The consensus of this literature is that the presentation of
revenue as “the gross amount billed to a customer because
it has earned revenue from the sale of goods or services or the
net amount retained (that is, the amount billed to a customer
less the amount paid to a supplier) because it has earned a
commission or fee” is a matter of judgment that depends on
the relevant facts and circumstances. If the conclusion drawn is
that we perform as an agent or a broker without assuming the
risks and rewards of ownership of goods, revenue should be
reported on a net basis.

In making an evaluation of this issue, some of the factors that
should be considered are: whether we are the primary obligor in
the arrangement (strong indicator); whether we have general
inventory risk (before customer order is placed or upon customer
return) (strong indicator); and whether we have latitude in
establishing price.
EITF

99-19

clearly
indicates that the evaluations of these factors, which at times
can be contradictory, are subject to significant judgment and
subjectivity.

Merchant Hotel

Our travelers pay us for merchant hotel transactions prior to
departing on their trip, generally when they book the
reservation. We record the payment in deferred merchant bookings
until the stay occurs, at which point we record the revenue. In
certain non-refundable, non-changeable transactions where we
have no significant post-delivery obligations, we record revenue
when the traveler completes the transaction on our website, less
a reserve for chargebacks and cancellations based on historical
experience. In certain instances when a supplier invoices us for
less than the cost we accrued, we recognize those amounts as

F-10


Expedia, Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements — (Continued)

revenue six months in arrears, net of an allowance, when we
determine it is not probable that we will be required to pay the
supplier, based on historical experience.

We generally contract in advance with lodging providers to
obtain access to room allotments at wholesale rates. Certain
contracts specifically identify the number of potential rooms
and the negotiated rate of the rooms to which we may have access
over the terms of the contracts, which generally range from one
to three years. Other contracts are not specific with respect to
the number of rooms and the rates of the rooms to which we may
have access over the terms of the contracts. In either case we
may return unbooked hotel room allotments with no obligation to
the lodging providers within a period specified in each
contract. For hotel rooms that are cancelled by the traveler
after the specified period of time, we charge the traveler a
cancellation fee or penalty that is at least equal to the amount
a hotel may invoice us for the cancellation.

Beginning January 1, 2004, as part of the integration of
our businesses, Hotels.com conformed its merchant hotel business
practices with those of our other businesses. As a result, we
commenced prospectively reporting revenue for Hotels.com on a
net basis. This change in reporting did not affect gross profit,
operating income or net income.

Merchant Air

Generally, we determine the ticket price for merchant air
transactions. We pay the cost of the airline ticket within two
weeks after booking. We record cash paid by the traveler as
deferred merchant bookings and the cost of the airline ticket as
prepaid merchant bookings. When the flight occurs, we record the
difference between the deferred merchant bookings and the
prepaid merchant bookings as revenue on a net basis.

When we have nonrefundable and generally noncancelable merchant
air transactions, with no significant post-delivery obligations,
we record revenue upon booking. We record a reserve for
chargebacks and cancellations at the time of the transaction
based on historical experience.

Agency Air, Hotel, Car and Cruise

Our agency revenue comes from airline ticket transactions,
certain hotel transactions as well as cruise and car rental
reservations. We record agency revenue on air transactions when
the traveler books the transaction, as we have no significant
post-delivery obligations. We record agency revenue on hotel
reservations, cruise and car rental reservations either on an
accrual basis for payments from a commission clearinghouse, or
on receipt of commissions from an individual supplier. We record
an allowance for cancellations and chargebacks on this revenue
based on historical experience.

Click-Through Fees

We record revenue from click-through fees charged to our travel
partners for traveler leads sent to the travel partners’
websites. We record revenue from click-through fees after the
traveler makes the click-through to the related travel
partners’ websites.

Advertising

We record advertising revenue ratably over the advertising
period or upon delivery of advertising impressions, depending on
the terms of the advertising contract.

Other

We record revenue from all other sources either upon delivery or
when we provide the service.

F-11


Expedia, Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements — (Continued)

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Our cash and cash equivalents include cash and liquid financial
instruments with original maturities of 90 days or less
when purchased.

Accounts Receivable

Accounts receivable are generally due within thirty days and are
recorded net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. We consider
accounts outstanding longer than the contractual payment terms
as past due. We determine our allowance by considering a number
of factors, including the length of time trade accounts
receivable are past due, previous loss history, a specific
traveler’s ability to pay its obligations to us, and the
condition of the general economy and industry as a whole.

Property and Equipment

We record property and equipment at cost, net of accumulated
depreciation and amortization. We also capitalize certain costs
incurred related to the development of internal use software in
accordance with Statement of Position 98-1, “Accounting for
the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for
Internal Use,” and EITF
No.

00-02,

“Accounting for Website Development Costs.” We
capitalize costs incurred during the application development
stage related to the development of internal-use software. We
expense costs incurred related to the planning and
post-implementation phases of development as incurred.

We compute depreciation using the straight-line method over the
estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from three to
five years for computer equipment and capitalized software
development, and three to seven years for furniture and other
equipment. We amortize leasehold improvement using the
straight-line method, over the shorter of the estimated useful
life of the improvement or the remaining term of the lease.

Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets

In accordance with SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and
Other Intangible Assets,” (“SFAS 142”),
goodwill is assigned to reporting units that are expected to
benefit from the synergies of the business combination as of the
acquisition date. We assess goodwill and indefinite-lived
intangible assets, neither of which are amortized, for
impairment annually at the beginning of the fourth quarter, or
more frequently if events and circumstances indicate impairment
may have occurred.

In the evaluation of goodwill for impairment, we first compare
the fair value of reporting unit to the carrying value. If the
carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value, the
goodwill of the reporting unit is potentially impaired and we
proceed to step two of the impairment analysis which we will
record an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying
value of the reporting unit’s goodwill over its implied
fair value.

In evaluation of indefinite-lived intangible assets, an
impairment charge is recorded for the excess the carrying value
of indefinite-lived intangible assets over their fair value.

We generally base our measurement of fair value of reporting
units on a blend of an analysis of the present value of
estimated future discounted cash flows and a comparison of
revenue and operating income multiples for companies of similar
industry and/or size. Our analysis is based on available
information and on assumptions and projections that we consider
to be reasonable and supportable. The discounted cash flow
analysis considers the likelihood of possible outcomes and is
based on our best estimates of projected future cash flows. We
base our measurement of fair value of indefinite-lived
intangible asset, which primarily consist of tradename and
trademarks using the relief-from-royalty method. This method
assumes

F-12


Expedia, Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements — (Continued)

that the tradename and trademarks have value to the extent that
their owner is relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for
the benefits received from them.

Intangible Assets with Definite Lives and Other Long-Lived
    Assets

In accordance with SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for
the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,” we review
the carrying value of intangible assets with definite lives and
other long-lived assets, which we amortize on a straight-line
basis over the estimated useful lives of two to ten years, on a
regular basis for the existence of facts that may indicate that
the assets are impaired. If such facts indicate a potential
impairment, we estimate the fair value of the asset using
appropriate valuation methodologies, usually based on estimated
future discounted cash flows. If the fair value is determined to
be less than an asset’s carrying value, we then further
evaluate to determine whether or not the carrying value is
unrecoverable. Our analyses are based on available information
and on assumptions and projections that we consider to be
reasonable and supportable.

Our impairment evaluations as of October 1, 2005, 2004 and
2003, indicated that we did not have any impairment to our
goodwill, intangible assets and long-lived assets.

Investments

We record investments using the cost basis when we do not have
the ability to exercise significant influence over the investee
and generally when our ownership in the investee is less than
20%. We record investments using the equity method when we have
the ability to exercise significant influence over the investee.
We periodically evaluate the recoverability of investments and
record a write-down if a decline in value is determined to be
other-than-temporary.

Income Taxes

In accordance with SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for
Income Taxes,” we record income taxes under the liability
method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect the expected
future tax consequences of temporary differences between the
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for book and tax
purposes. We determine deferred income taxes based on the
differences in accounting methods and timing between financial
statement and income tax reporting. Accordingly, we determine
the deferred tax asset or liability for each temporary
difference based on the tax rates that we expect will be in
effect when we realize the underlying items of income and
expense. We consider many factors when assessing the likelihood
of future realization of our deferred tax assets, including our
recent earnings experience by jurisdiction, expectations of
future taxable income, and the carryforward periods available to
us for tax reporting purposes, as well as other relevant
factors. We may establish a valuation allowance to reduce
deferred tax assets to the amount we expect to realize. Due to
inherent complexities arising from the nature of our businesses,
future changes in income tax law, tax sharing agreements or
variances between our actual and anticipated operating results,
we make certain judgments and estimates. Therefore, actual
income taxes could vary from these estimates.

Occupancy Tax

Some states and localities impose a transient occupancy or
accommodation tax, or a form of sales tax, on the use or
occupancy of hotel accommodations. Hotel operators generally
collect and remit these taxes to the various tax authorities.
Consistent with this practice, when a customer books a room
through one of our travel services, the hotel charges the
customer taxes based on the room rate paid to the hotel, we pay
the hotel those taxes invoiced by the hotel and we recover an
equivalent amount from the customer. We do not collect or remit
occupancy taxes on the portion of the customer payment we
retain, and some jurisdictions have questioned our practice in
this regard. While the applicable tax provisions vary among

F-13


Expedia, Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements — (Continued)

the jurisdictions, we generally believe that we are not required
to collect and remit such occupancy taxes. We are engaged in
discussions with tax authorities in various jurisdictions to
resolve this issue, but the ultimate resolution in all
jurisdictions cannot be determined at this time. We have
established a reserve with respect to potential occupancy tax
liability and we do not believe, however, that the amount of
liability on account of this issue, if any, will have a material
adverse effect on our past or future financial results.

Derivative Instruments

We record the fair value of derivative instruments on our
consolidated balance sheets in accordance with
SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities”
(“SFAS 133”), as amended. We use derivative
instruments to manage certain foreign currency risks. We record
the changes in the fair value of a derivative that qualifies as
and that we designate as a cash flow hedge, to the extent that
the hedge is effective, in other comprehensive income, until
earnings are affected by the variability of cash flows of the
hedged transaction. We reclassify amounts recorded in other
comprehensive income to other income or expense during the
period in which the hedged transaction affects earnings. We
report the ineffective portion of a derivative instruments
change in fair value immediately in other income or expense in
our consolidated statements of income. We report the change in
the fair value of derivative instruments that do not qualify for
hedge accounting treatment in other income or expense in our
consolidated statements of income. We do not hold or issue
financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes. For
additional information about derivative instruments, see
Note 10, Derivative Instruments.

Foreign Currency Translation and Transaction Gains and
    Losses

We record foreign currency transactions in accordance with
SFAS No. 52, “Foreign Currency Translation.”
Our operations outside of the United States use the related
local currency as their functional currency. We translate
revenue and expense at average rates of exchange during the
period. We translate assets and liabilities at the rates of
exchange as of the consolidated balance sheet dates and include
foreign currency translation gains and losses as a component of
accumulated other comprehensive income. We record transaction
gains and losses in our consolidated statements of income.

Advertising Expense

We incur advertising expense consisting of offline costs,
including television and radio advertising, and online
advertising expense to promote our brands. We expense the
production costs associated with advertisements in the period in
which the advertisement first takes place. We expense the costs
of communicating the advertisement (e.g. television airtime) as
incurred each time that the advertisement is shown. For the
years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, our
advertising expense was $425.2 million, $452.9 million
and $389.6 million.

Stock-Based Compensation

On January 1, 2003, we adopted the expense provisions of
SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation”, (“SFAS 123”), and we record
expense for stock-based compensation in accordance with
SFAS No. 123 and SFAS No. 148,
“Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation —
Transition and Disclosure”, for all periods presented in
our consolidated statements of income.

We measure the value of RSUs issued at the grant date at fair
value and amortize the value, net of forfeitures, as stock-based
compensation expense over the vesting term on a straight-line
basis. The terms of our RSU awards vary, but generally provide
for the underlying shares to vest over a period of 5 years.
We measure the value of stock options and warrants issued since
January 1, 2003, including unvested options assumed in
acquisitions, on the grant date (or acquisition dates, if
applicable) at fair value, using

F-14


Expedia, Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements — (Continued)

the Black-Scholes option valuation model and amortize the fair
value over the remaining vesting term on a straight-line basis.

In determining the estimated forfeiture rates, we periodically
conduct an assessment of the actual number of instruments that
have been forfeited to date as well as those expected to be
forfeited in the future. We consider many factors when
estimating expected forfeitures, including the type of award,
the employee class and historical experience. The estimation of
stock awards that will ultimately be forfeited requires
significant judgment and to the extent that actual results or
updated estimates differ from our current estimates, such
amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the
period such estimates are revised. For additional information
about the changes in estimated forfeiture rates, see
Note 12, Stock-Based Awards and Other Equity Instruments.

The following table presents the effect on net income if the
fair value based method was applied to the outstanding and
unvested awards for the year ended December 31, 2003. For
the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, the stock-based
compensation expense included in net income equaled the
stock-based compensation expense determined under the fair value
based method for all awards.

Earnings Per Share

We compute basic earnings per share, in accordance with
SFAS No. 128, “Earnings per Share,”
(“SFAS 128”), by taking net income available to
common shareholders divided by the weighted average number of
common and Class B common shares outstanding during the
period excluding restricted stock and stock held in escrow.
Diluted earnings per share include the potential dilution that
could occur from stock-based awards and other stock-based
commitments using the treasury stock or the as if converted
methods, as applicable. For additional information on how we
compute earnings per share, see Note 15, Earnings Per Share.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents and restricted
cash and cash equivalents reported on our consolidated balance
sheets approximate fair value as we maintain them with various
high-quality financial institutions or in short-term duration
high-quality debt securities. The accounts and notes receivable
are short-term in nature and are generally settled shortly after
the sale. The carrying amounts for the short-term borrowings and
all other financial instruments approximate their fair value. We
maintain the carrying amounts of the derivative liabilities
created in the Spin-Off at fair value, which is based upon
appropriate valuation methodologies.

Certain Risks and Concentrations

Our business is subject to certain risks and concentrations
including dependence on relationships with travel suppliers,
primarily airlines and hotels, dependence on third party
technology providers, exposure to risks associated with online
commerce security and credit card fraud. We are highly dependent
on our

F-15


Expedia, Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements — (Continued)

relationships with six major airlines in the United States. We
also depend on global distribution system partners and third
party service providers for certain fulfillment services.

Financial instruments, which potentially subject us to
concentration of credit risk, consist primarily of cash and cash
equivalents. We maintain some cash and cash equivalents balances
with financial institutions that are in excess of Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance limits.

Contingent Liabilities

We have a number of regulatory and legal matters outstanding, as
discussed further in Note 16, Commitments and
Contingencies. We provide for contingent liabilities in
accordance with SFAS No. 5 “Accounting for
Contingencies,” (“SFAS 5”). In accordance
with SFAS 5 a loss contingency is charged to income when
(i) it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a
liability has been incurred at the date of the consolidated
financials statements and (ii) the amount of the loss can
be reasonably estimated. Disclosure in the notes to the
financial statements is required for loss contingencies that do
not meet both these conditions if there is a reasonable
possibility that a loss may have been incurred. We do not record
gain contingencies until realized. We expense all related legal
costs as incurred. Periodically, we review the status of each
significant matter to assess the potential financial exposure.
If a potential loss is considered probable and the amount can be
reasonably estimated as defined by SFAS 5, we record the
estimated loss in our consolidated statements of income.
Significant judgment is required to determine the probability
that a liability has been incurred and whether such liability is
reasonably estimable. We base accruals made on the best
information available at the time and are highly subjective. The
final outcome of these matters could vary significantly from the
amounts included in the accompanying consolidated financial
statements.

NOTE 3 — Reclassifications

We reclassified certain amounts relating to our prior
periods’ results to conform with our current year
presentation. The significant reclassifications were as follows:

Consolidated Statements of Income.

During 2005, we
aligned our financial statement classification across the
Company. As a result, we reclassified certain amounts in 2004
and 2003 to conform to the current year presentation as follows:

The following table present a summary of the amounts as reported
and as reclassified in our consolidated statements of income for
the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003.

Consolidated Balance Sheets.

We reclassified
$13.3 million from cash and cash equivalents to restricted
cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2004.

Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

In our
consolidated statements of cash flows, we reclassified the
following items:

•

Transfers to IAC

— We reclassified
    $1.3 billion and $548.4 million of transfers to IAC
    from financing activities to investing activities for the years
    ended December 31, 2004 and 2003. We previously reported
    these transfers to IAC with contribution from (distribution to)
    IAC, net in financing activities of the consolidated statements
    of cash flows.

•

Restricted Cash and Cash Equivalents

— We
    reclassified $13.3 million, $11.0 million and
    $10.4 million as of December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002,
    of restricted cash and cash equivalents from cash and cash
    equivalents to changes in restricted cash and cash equivalents
    in financing activities in the consolidated statements of cash
    flows.

NOTE 4 — New Accounting Pronouncements

Stock-Based Compensation

In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123(R)
“Share-Based Payment” (“SFAS 123(R)”),
and related guidance, which are revisions of SFAS 123.
Generally, the approach in SFAS 123(R) is similar to the
approach described in SFAS 123; however, SFAS 123(R)
requires that companies record all share-based payments to
employees, including grants of employee stock options, in the
statement of income based on their fair values. SFAS 123(R)
also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of
recorded compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash
flow, rather than as an operating cash flow as required under
current literature. We expect to continue using the
Black-Scholes option valuation model upon the required adoption
of SFAS 123(R) on January 1, 2006.

F-17


Expedia, Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements — (Continued)

In March 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued
SAB 107, which provides additional guidance related to the
implementation of SFAS 123(R), including guidance regarding
valuation methods and related assumptions, and classification of
compensation expense and income tax effects of share-based
payment arrangements.

We adopted SFAS 123(R) and related guidance on
January 1, 2006, and we do not expect it to have a material
effect on our results of operations or financial position.

Accounting Changes and Error Corrections

In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154,
“Accounting Changes and Error Corrections,”
(“SFAS 154”), which changes the requirements for
the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting
principle. SFAS 154 will require companies to account for
and apply changes in accounting principles retrospectively to
prior periods’ financial statements, instead of recording a
cumulative effect adjustment within the period of the change,
unless it is impracticable to determine the effects of the
change to each period presented. SFAS 154 is effective for
accounting changes and corrections made in fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2005. We adopted SFAS 154
on January 1, 2006, and we do not expect it to have a
material impact on our financial position, results of operations
or cash flows.

NOTE 5 — Business Acquisitions

On August 9, 2005, we completed the Spin-Off of the Expedia
Businesses, all of which had been acquired by IAC, either
directly or through its subsidiaries. We have included these
entities in our historical combined financial statements from
the dates of their respective acquisitions. We discuss the
significant business acquisitions below.

(A)

We acquired a majority ownership interest in these entities
    prior to 2003; as such there was no significant amount of

step-up

in basis of net
    tangible assets when we acquired the remaining shares of these
    companies in 2003.

F-18


Expedia, Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements — (Continued)

We generally obtain a third-party valuation of identifiable
intangible assets acquired to support our allocation of the
purchase price to these assets. We based the net purchase price
for our acquisitions on historical as well as expected
performance metrics, which include net income and cash flow. In
certain situations, we agreed to a purchase price that resulted
in a significant amount of goodwill for the following reasons:
(1) the acquisitions’ market leading position and
brand, (2) business model which complements the business
models of our other brands, and (3) growth opportunities in
the markets in which they operate. As a result, we based the
predominant portion of purchase price on the expected financial
performance of the business acquisition, and not the net asset
value on the books at the time of the acquisition. As a result,
a significant amount of the purchase price was allocated to
goodwill. Generally, none of the amounts allocated to goodwill
or intangible assets are tax deductible.

eLong

In August 2004, we purchased a 30% ownership interest in eLong,
a publicly-traded Cayman Island company, whose principal
business is the operation of an internet-based travel business
in the People’s Republic of China, for approximately
$59.0 million in cash, which we accounted for under the
equity method. eLong’s American Depositary Shares
(“ADS”) trade on the NASDAQ under the symbol
“LONG.” Each ADS is equivalent to two shares of eLong
capital stock. Concurrent with this investment, eLong issued a
warrant to allow us to acquire additional shares, with an
exercise price of approximately $6.21 per share, or
$108 million.

In January 2005, we exercised the warrant that increased our
ownership interest to 59% and total voting rights to
approximately 96%. We accounted for the transaction under the
purchase method and have consolidated the operating results of
eLong since the date of the warrant exercise. The aggregate
purchase price of $170.6 million included our initial
investment, exercise of the warrant and related transaction
costs. Of the consideration paid on the exercise of the warrant,
we used approximately $54 million to purchase newly issued
eLong common shares and approximately $54 million to
purchase shares from existing eLong shareholders. Net cash
inflow as a result of cash paid on the warrant exercise, less
the equity infusion on the purchase of new common shares and
acquisition of eLong’s existing cash balance of
approximately $78 million, was approximately
$19 million. As of December 31, 2005, our ownership
interest in eLong was 57%.

TripAdvisor

In April 2004 and July 2005, we acquired 94.1% and an additional
1%, respectively, of TripAdvisor, a travel search engine and
directory that enables consumers to research their travel and
destination place through the internet. The aggregate purchase
price for our acquisition in April 2004 was $219.3 million.

Egencia

In April 2004, we acquired 91.4% of the ownership of Egencia
(renamed ECT-Europe), an online corporate travel agency in
France, for an aggregate purchase price of $65.7 million.

Hotwire.com

In November 2003, we completed our acquisition of Hotwire.com, a
discount travel website for $666.7 million in cash, plus
the assumption of options to acquire approximately
0.5 million shares of IAC common stock, warrants to acquire
approximately 0.1 million shares of IAC common stock and
0.3 million restricted stock units.

F-19


Expedia, Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements — (Continued)

Expedia.com

In August 2003, we completed our acquisition of all the
outstanding shares of Expedia.com. Prior to the acquisition, we
owned approximately 59% of Expedia.com. The purchase price,
after deducting the fair value of unvested options and warrants
to purchase IAC common stock, was $3.6 billion.

Hotels.com

In June 2003, we completed our acquisition of all the
outstanding shares of Hotels.com. Prior to the acquisition, we
owned approximately 67% of Hotels.com. The purchase price, after
deducting the fair value of unvested options and warrants to
purchase IAC common stock, was $1.2 billion.

NOTE 6 — Property and Equipment, Net

Our property and equipment consists of the following:

As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, our recorded capitalized
software development costs, net of accumulated amortization, of
$49.5 million and $38.7 million. For the years ended
December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, we recorded amortization
of capitalized software development costs of $38.6 million,
$24.0 million and $12.9 million.

NOTE 7 — Long-Term Investment and Other
Assets

Write-off of Long-Term Investment

In 2005, we received information regarding the deteriorating
financial condition of our long-term investment in a leisure
travel company and we determined that it was not likely we would
recover any of our investment because the decline in its value
was determined to be other-than-temporary. As a result, we
recorded a loss related to this impairment of
$23.4 million, which consisted of $22.5 million of
preferred stock and $0.9 million of stock warrants.

eLong. In August 2004, we purchased a 30% ownership interest in
eLong, a publicly-traded Cayman Island company, whose principal

warrant to allow us to acquire additional shares, with an
exercise price of approximately $6.21 per share, or
$108 million.

In October 2004, eLong completed an initial public offering
(“IPO”) of its shares. As a result of the IPO, our
warrant became subject to the

mark-to

-market
provisions of SFAS No. 115 “Accounting for
Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities.” As
such, we recorded an unrealized gain of $27.2 million, net
of deferred taxes of $16.4 million, related to the warrant
in other comprehensive income in 2004. We reversed the
unrealized gain in January 2005 upon exercise of our warrant.

NOTE 9 — Short-term Borrowings

In July 2005, we entered into a $1.0 billion five-year
unsecured revolving credit facility with a group of lenders,
which was effective as of the Spin-Off. Certain Expedia
subsidiaries have unconditionally guaranteed Expedia,
Inc.’s obligation under this facility. The facility bears
interest based on our financial leverage, which as of
December 31, 2005, was equal to LIBOR plus 0.50%. The
facility also contains financial covenants consisting of a
leverage ratio and a minimum net worth requirement. As of
December 31, 2005, we were in compliance with all financial
covenants.

The amount of stand-by letters of credit issued under the
facility reduces the amount available to us under the facility.
As of December 31, 2005, there were $53.2 million of
outstanding stand-by letters of credit issued under the
facility. We capitalized $3.5 million in financing costs
related to the facility, and we will amortize these costs to
interest expense over the facility’s five-year life. The
annual fee to maintain the facility is 0.1% on the unused
portion of the facility, or approximately $1.0 million if
all of the facility is unused.

As of December 31, 2005, we had $230.8 million of
outstanding short-term borrowings, of which $230.0 million
was borrowing under the revolving credit facility. As of
March 24, 2006, we fully repaid the revolving credit
facility.

Ask Jeeves Notes

As a result of the Spin-Off, when holders of IAC’s Ask
Jeeves Notes convert their notes, they will receive shares of
both IAC and Expedia common stock, Under the terms of the
Spin-Off, we are obligated to issue shares of our common stock
to IAC for delivery to the holders of the Ask Jeeves Notes, or
receive cash in equal value, in lieu of issuing such shares, at
our option. This obligation represents a derivative liability in
our consolidated balance sheet because it is not indexed solely
to shares of our common stock. We record the fair value of this
derivative obligation on our consolidated balance sheets with
any changes in fair value recorded in our consolidated
statements of income. The estimated fair value of this liability
fluctuates based on changes in the price of our common stock. As
of August 9, 2005, we estimated that we could be required
to issue up to 4.3 million shares of our common stock (or
pay cash in equal value, in lieu of issuing such shares, at our
option), with a value of $99.7 million, upon conversion of
these notes.

In 2005, we recorded in other income an unrealized loss of
$6.0 million related to the derivative liability on the
outstanding Ask Jeeves Notes, and a realized loss of
$0.1 million related to Ask Jeeves Notes that were
converted. In December 2005, certain of these notes were
converted for $0.9 million of cash. Our estimated liability
was $104.8 million as of December 31, 2005. In January
2006, certain of these notes were converted for approximately
2.6 million shares at a value of approximately
$68.2 million. The Ask Jeeves Notes are due June 1,
2008; upon maturity of these notes, our obligation ceases.

Cross-Currency Swaps

We enter into cross-currency swaps to hedge against the change
in value of assets denominated in a currency other than our
subsidiary’s functional currency.

In November 2003, we entered into a swap with a notional amount
of Euro 39.0 million that matures in October 2013. Under
the terms of this swap, we pay Euro at a rate of the three-month
EURIBOR plus 0.50% on Euro 39.0 million and we receive
4.90% interest on $46.4 million in U.S. dollars.

In April 2004, we entered into a swap with a notional amount of
Euro 38.2 million that matures in April 2014. Under the
terms of this swap, we pay Euro at a rate of the six-month
EURIBOR plus 0.90% on Euro 38.2 million and we receive
5.47% interest on $45.9 million in U.S. dollars.

Upon maturity, these cross-currency swap agreements call for the
exchange of notional amounts. We have designated these
derivative contracts as cash flow hedges for accounting
purposes. We record foreign exchange re-measurement gains and
losses related to these contracts and assets, which are
offsetting, in each period in other income (expense) in our
consolidated statements of income.

Because these derivatives are perfectly effective, we record the
net gain and loss in other comprehensive income and will
reclassify the gains and losses into other income or expense
when we extinguish the hedged items. There was no
ineffectiveness related to these cash flow hedges for the years
ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003.

In addition, as of December 31, 2005, we had
$5.1 million of cash held by counterparties as collateral
for our cross-currency swaps.

Stock Warrants

In connection with prior transactions, IAC assumed a number of
stock warrants that were adjusted to become exercisable into IAC
common stock and subsequent to the Spin-Off, also in our common
stock. As of December 31, 2005, there are approximately
43,800 of these stock warrants outstanding with expiration dates
through May 2010. In addition, IAC is potentially obligated to
issue an additional 509,500 stock warrants to its vendor upon
the vendor meeting certain performance targets. Each stock
warrant

Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements — (Continued)

represents the right to receive the number of shares of IAC
common stock and Expedia common stock that the stock warrant
holder would have received had the holder exercised the stock
warrant immediately prior to the Spin-Off. Under the terms of
the Spin-Off between IAC and Expedia, we assumed the obligation
to deliver our common stock to the stock warrant holders upon
exercise and will receive a portion of the proceeds from
exercise. This obligation represents a derivative instrument
that we record at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets
with any changes in value recorded in our consolidated
statements of income. The estimated fair value of this liability
fluctuates based on changes in the price of our common stock.

NOTE 11 — Employee Benefit Plans

Our U.S. employees are generally eligible to participate in a
retirement and savings plan that qualifies under
Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Participating
employees may contribute up to 16% of their pretax salary, but
not more than statutory limits. We contribute fifty cents for
each dollar a participant contributes in this plan, with a
maximum contribution of 3% of a participant’s earnings. Our
contribution vests with the employee after the employee
completes two years of service. Participating employees have the
option to invest in our common stock, but there is no
requirement for participating employees to invest their
contribution or our matching contribution in our common stock.
Our matching contribution was $6.0 million,
$4.1 million and $2.1 million for the years ended
December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003.

In connection with the Spin-Off, we established a Voluntary
Employees’ Beneficiary Association trust (“VEBA
trust”) to fund costs associated with self-insuring
medical, dental and vision benefits that we provide to our
employees. The VEBA trust is a separate legal entity that is
administered by a third-party. Our contributions to the VEBA
trust represent the employees’ and employer’s cost,
which is based on actuarial estimates that are calculated by an
outside consulting firm on a quarterly basis. As of
December 31, 2005, the VEBA trust was appropriately funded.

NOTE 12 — Stock-Based Awards and Other Equity
Instruments

As described below in “Modification of Stock-Based
Compensation Awards,” certain stock options, restricted
stock, RSUs and other equity based awards granted to our
employees, officers, directors and consultants by IAC prior to
the Spin-Off were converted into awards based on our common
stock in connection with the Spin-Off. We generally recognize
compensation expense for these awards to the extent that they
are unvested in accordance with SFAS 123. For the period
from January 1, 2005 to August 8, 2005, and for the
years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, IAC allocated to us
stock-based compensation expense that was attributable to our
employees.

In connection with the Spin-Off, our Board of Directors approved
our 2005 Stock and Annual Incentive Plan. Under this plan we can
grant restricted stock, restricted stock awards
(“RSA”), RSUs, stock options, and other stock-based
awards to officers, employees and consultants.

RSUs, which are awards in the form of phantom shares or units
that are denominated in a hypothetical equivalent number of
shares of our common stock, are our primary form of stock-based
award. At the time of grant, we determine if we will settle the
RSUs in cash, stock or both. We record RSUs that will settle in
cash as a liability and we remeasure them to fair value at the
end of each reporting period. Our RSUs generally vest over five
years, but may accelerate in certain circumstances, including
changes in control.

While we do not generally compensate our employees with stock
options, when we do make such grants, they are granted at an
exercise price not less than the fair market value of the stock
on the grant date. The terms and conditions upon which the stock
options become exercisable vary.

We have stock warrants outstanding, certain of which trade on
the NASDAQ under the symbols “EXPEW” and
“EXPEZ.” These stock warrants have expiration dates
through February 2012. Almost all of these stock warrants are
vested. Each stock warrant is exercisable for a certain number
of shares of our common stock or a fraction thereof.

As of December 31, 2005, we had approximately
11.5 million shares of common stock reserved for new
stock-based awards under the 2005 Stock and Annual Incentive
Plan.

As of December 31, 2005, we had 5.6 million RSUs and

The following table presents a summary of our stock options
outstanding and exercisable at December 31, 2005:

Evaluation of Estimated Equity Award Forfeitures

In 2005, we changed the estimated forfeiture rates we use in the
determination of our stock-based compensation expense; this
change was a result of an assessment that included an analysis
of the actual number of equity awards that had been forfeited to
date compared to prior estimates and an evaluation of future
estimated forfeitures. We periodically evaluate our forfeiture
rates and update the rates we use in the determination of our
stock-based compensation expense. We recorded a cumulative
benefit from the change in estimate of approximately
$43.4 million, which reduced non-cash compensation expense
in the consolidated statements of income for the year ended
December 31, 2005.

Modification of Stock-Based Awards

In connection with the Spin-Off, all existing IAC stock-based
awards, which included RSUs, stock options and warrants, were
converted as follows:

The adjustments to the number of shares subject to each option
and the option exercise prices were based on the relative market
capitalization of IAC and Expedia following the Spin-Off. These
modifications resulted in a one-time expense of
$5.4 million due to the increase in the estimated fair value

of vested stock options. Expenses related to incremental value
due to modification of warrants, RSUs and unvested stock options
were not material.

The following table presents a summary of our income tax expense
components.

For all periods presented, we have computed current and deferred
tax expense using our stand-alone effective tax rate. As of
December 31, 2005, our current income tax payable
represents amounts that we will pay to the Internal Revenue
Service and other tax authorities based on our taxable income
after the Spin-Off.

For the period January 1, 2005 through the Spin-Off date,
we were a member of the IAC consolidated tax group. Accordingly,
IAC will file a federal income tax return and certain state
income tax returns on a combined basis with us for that period.
IAC will pay the entire combined income tax liability related to
these filings. As such, our estimated income tax liability for
this period was transferred to IAC upon Spin-Off and is not
included in income taxes payable at December 31, 2005.
Under the terms of the Tax Sharing Agreement, IAC can make
certain elections in preparation of these tax returns, which may
change the amount of income taxes we owe for the period after
the Spin-Off. We intend to record such changes as adjustments to
stockholders’ equity in accordance with Emerging Issues
Task Force
No.

(“EITF

We reduced our current income tax payable by $50.6 million,
$120.8 million and $106.2 million for the years ended
December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, for tax deductions
attributable to stock-based

compensation. For 2005, we recorded $25.3 million of the
related income tax benefits of this stock-based compensation as
a reduction of goodwill.

The tax effect of cumulative temporary differences and net
operating losses that give rise to our deferred tax assets and
deferred tax liabilities as of December 31, 2005 and 2004
are as follows:

At December 31, 2005, we had federal, state and foreign net
operating loss carryforwards (“NOLs”) of approximately
$44.7 million, $83.4 million and $49.7 million.
If not utilized, the federal NOLs will expire at various times
between 2018 and 2023; the state NOLs will expire at various
times between 2007 and 2024; and the foreign NOLs can be carried
forward indefinitely. Changes in ownership, as defined by
Sections 382 and 1502 of the Internal Revenue Code, as
amended, may limit the amount of federal and state net operating
loss carryforwards utilized in any one year.

At December 31, 2005, we had federal research credit
carryforwards of approximately $5.4 million and foreign
research credit carryforwards of approximately
$1.2 million. Unused federal research credit carryforwards
will expire at various times between 2020 and 2024 and
$0.6 million of the foreign research credit will expire in
2014, if unused, while the remainder can be carried forward
indefinitely.

At December 31, 2005, we had a valuation allowance of
approximately $25.5 million related to the portion of tax
operating loss carryforwards and other items for which it is
more likely than not that the tax benefit will not be realized.
This amount represented an increase of approximately
$14.1 million over the amount recorded as of
December 31, 2004 and was primarily attributable to an
investment impairment and

foreign operating losses. The tax benefit for approximately
$4.6 million of the valuation allowance recorded at
December 31, 2005 will be recorded as a reduction of
goodwill if recognized in future years.

A reconciliation of total income tax expense to the amounts
computed by applying the statutory federal income tax rate to
earnings from continuing operations before income taxes and
minority interest is as follows:

By virtue of the previously filed separate company and
consolidated income tax returns filed with IAC, we are routinely
under audit by federal, state, local and foreign authorities.
These audits include questioning the timing and the amount of
deductions and the allocation of income among various tax
jurisdictions. Annual tax provisions include amounts considered
sufficient to pay assessments that may result from the
examination of prior year returns; however, the amount
ultimately paid upon resolution of issues raised may differ from
the amount provided. Differences between our contingent tax
liabilities and the amounts actually owed are recorded in the
period they become known. We believe our contingent tax
liabilities are adequate in the event the tax positions are not
ultimately upheld.

In addition, we have a tax allocation agreement with the
Microsoft Corporation as well as the Tax Sharing Agreement with
IAC. For additional information about these agreements, see
Note 17, Related Party Transactions.

NOTE 14 — Common Stock, Class B Common
Stock and Preferred Stock

Common Stock and Class B Common Stock

Our authorized common stock consists of 1.6 billion shares
of common stock with par value of $0.001 per share, and
400 million shares of Class B common stock with par
value of $0.001 per share. Both classes of common stock
qualify for and would share equally in dividends, if declared by
our board of directors, and generally vote together on all
matters. Common stock carries one vote per share and
Class B common stock carries 10 votes per share. Holders of
common stock, voting as a single, separate class are entitled to
elect 25% of the total number of directors. Class B common
stockholders may, at any time, convert their shares into common
stock, on a one for one share basis. Upon conversion, the
Class B common stock is retired and is not available for
reissue. In the event of liquidation, dissolution, distribution
of assets or

winding-up

of Expedia, Inc., the holders of both classes of common stock
have equal rights to receive all the assets of Expedia, Inc.
after the rights of the holders of the preferred stock have been
satisfied.

Preferred Stock

Our preferred stock has a face value of $22.23 per share;
each share is entitled to an annual dividend of 1.99%. Each
preferred stockholder is entitled to two votes per share.
Preferred stockholders may, at

certain times through 2017, elect to have their shares redeemed
or elect to convert their shares into common stock based upon
formulas described in the related Certificate of Designations of
Series A Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock of Expedia,
Inc. Beginning February 4, 2012, we may redeem the
preferred stock for cash or common stock. On February 4,
2022, all outstanding shares of preferred stock automatically
convert into common stock.

NOTE 15 — Earnings Per Share

Basic Earnings Per Share

For the year ended December 31, 2005, we computed basic
earnings per share using the number of shares of common stock
and Class B common stock outstanding immediately following
the Spin-Off, as if such shares were outstanding for the entire
period prior to the Spin-Off, plus the weighted average of such
shares outstanding following the Spin-Off.

For the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, we computed
basic earnings per share using the number of shares of common
stock and Class B common stock outstanding immediately
following the Spin-Off, as if such shares were outstanding for
the entire period.

Diluted Earnings Per Share

For the year ended December 31, 2005, we computed diluted
earnings per share using (i) the number of shares of common
stock and Class B common stock used in the basic earnings
per share calculation as indicated above (ii) if dilutive,
the incremental common stock that we would issue upon the
assumed exercise of stock options and stock warrants and the
vesting of restricted stock units using the treasury stock
method, and (iii) the shares we are contractually obligated
to issue associated with the Ask Jeeves Notes, if converted, and
other stock-based commitments.

For the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, we computed
diluted earnings per share using (i) the number of shares
of common stock and Class B common stock used in the basic
earnings per share calculation as indicated above, and
(ii) if dilutive, the incremental common stock that we
would issue upon exercise of potentially dilutive stock-based
commitments if the terms of the agreement under which the
commitments were issued obligate us to issue the instrument as
of the Spin-Off. Some of the stock warrant agreements meet this
requirement, but options to purchase common stock and other
potentially dilutive items do not. Warrants meeting this
requirement were included in our diluted earnings per share
calculation for the year ended December 31, 2004 and 2003,
based on the number of days they were outstanding at Spin-Off.
We treated all other securities as if they were granted as of
the Spin-Off.

We have guarantees primarily related to a specific country

packaged travel sold in that country. The authority also
requires that a portion of the total amount of packaged travel
sold be bonded.

Our LOCs consist of standby LOCs, underwritten by a group of
lenders, which we primarily issue to certain hotel properties to
secure our payment for hotel room transactions. There were no
claims made against any standby LOCs during the year ended
December 31, 2005 and 2004.

Legal Proceedings

In the ordinary course of business, we are a party to various
lawsuits. In the opinion of management, none of these lawsuits
should have a material impact on the liquidity, results of
operations, or financial condition of Expedia. We also evaluate
other potential contingent matters, including value-added tax,
transient occupancy or accommodation tax and similar matters. We
do not believe that the amount of liability that could be
reasonably possible with respect to these matters would have a
material adverse affect on our financial results.

Securities Related Class Action Litigations. While we are
not a party to the securities litigation filed against IAC,
under the terms of our Separation Agreement with IAC, we have
generally agreed to bear a portion of the costs and liabilities,
if any, associated with any securities law litigation relating
to conduct prior to the Spin-Off of the businesses or entities
that comprise Expedia following the Spin-Off. This case arises
out of IAC’s August 4, 2004, announcement of its
earnings for the second quarter of 2004.

Litigation relating to the IAC/ Hotels.com merger agreement
announced April 10, 2003, is pending in Delaware. The
principal claim in these actions is that the defendants breached
their fiduciary duty to the plaintiffs by entering into or
approving the merger agreement.

Hotels.com is also a party to a securities class action and a
shareholder derivative suit relating to Hotels.com’s
guidance for the fourth quarter of 2002. The principal claim in
these actions is that the defendants violated federal securities
laws by making misstatements of material facts, failing to
disclose material information, and trading in the company’s
securities while in possession of material, non-public
information. In 2004, the court dismissed virtually all of the
plaintiffs’ claims with prejudice in the securities class
action. In the shareholder derivative suit, on March 7,
2005, the district court issued orders staying the case until
further notice and directing that the case be administratively
closed pending a decision in the appeal of the action discussed
above. The case remains administratively closed.

Litigation Relating to Hotel Occupancy Taxes. Expedia and
certain of its businesses are parties to consumer and
municipality litigation involving hotel occupancy taxes.

We believe that the claims in the litigation discussed above
lack merit and will continue to defend vigorously against them.

Put and Call Option Agreements

In connection with our acquisitions of TripAdvisor and Egencia,
we have call and put option agreements in place to acquire the
remaining shares held by the minority shareholders of each
company. In March 2006, the minority holders of Egencia notified
us of their intention to exercise their put right whereby they
would sell their remaining minority ownership interest in
exchange for approximately $6.4 million in cash. We expect
the put exercise to be executed in April 2006. We estimate that
the call option value for TripAdvisor is approximately
$16.0 million as of December 31, 2005.

NOTE 17 — Related Party Transactions

Expenses Allocated from IAC

Prior to Spin-Off, our operating expenses include allocations
from IAC for accounting, treasury, legal, tax, corporate
support, human resource functions and internal audit. Expenses
allocated from IAC were $5.0 million for the period from
January 1, 2005 to August 8, 2005, and
$7.5 million and $2.0 million for the years ended
December 31, 2004 and 2003. We recorded the expense
allocation from IAC in general and administrative expense in our
consolidated statements of income.

Additional allocations from IAC prior to the Spin-Off related to
stock-based compensation expense attributable to our employees.
Stock-based compensation expense allocated from IAC was
$56.5 million for the period from January 1, 2005 to
August 8, 2005, and $171.4 million and
$79.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2004
and 2003.

Interest Income from IAC

The majority of the interest income recorded in our consolidated
statements of income arose from intercompany receivable balances
from IAC. The interest income from IAC ceased upon Spin-Off on
August 9, 2005.

Relationship Between IAC and Expedia, Inc. after the
    Spin-Off

In connection with the Spin-Off, we entered into various
agreements with IAC to provide for an orderly transition and to
govern our ongoing relationships with IAC. These agreements
include the following:

F-34


Expedia, Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements — (Continued)

Commercial Agreements

We continue to work with some of the businesses that comprise
IAC after the Spin-Off pursuant to a variety of commercial
relationships. These commercial agreements generally include
(i) distribution agreements, pursuant to which certain
subsidiaries of IAC distribute their respective products and
services via arrangements with Expedia, and vice versa,
(ii) services agreements, pursuant to which certain
subsidiaries of IAC provide Expedia with various services and
vice versa and (iii) office space lease agreements. The
distribution agreements typically involve the payment of fees,
usually on a fixed amount-per-transaction, revenue share or
commission basis, from the party seeking distribution of the
product or service to the party that is providing the
distribution. From August 8, 2005 to December 31,
2005, we received $0.8 million from IAC and paid
$10.7 million to IAC. At December 31, 2005, amounts
receivable from IAC totaled $0.6 million; amounts payable
to IAC totaled $3.6 million. These amounts are included in
accounts and notes receivable and accounts payable, trade,
respectively.

Agreements with Microsoft Corporation

We have various agreements with Microsoft Corporation
(“Microsoft”), which is currently the beneficial owner
of more than 5% of our outstanding common stock, including an
agreement that maintains our presence as the provider of travel
shopping services on MSN.com and several international MSN
websites and, in 2004 and 2003, a data center services
agreement. Total fees we paid with respect to these agreements
were $20.0 million, $12.6 million and
$20.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2005,
2004 and 2003. Amounts payable related to these agreements was
$6.2 million and $3.4 million as of December 31,
2005 and 2004.

Prior to November 1999, Microsoft owned 100% of our outstanding
common stock. Concurrent with our separation from them, we
entered into a number of agreements with them to facilitate the
separation. Currently, we have a tax allocation agreement where
we must pay Microsoft for a portion of the tax savings resulting
from the exercise of certain stock options. We have recorded
$36.3 million in other long-term liabilities on our
consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2005 and
2004, related to this agreement. We will pay Microsoft under
this agreement when we realize the tax savings on our tax
return. As of December 31, 2005, we have not realized the
tax savings related to the exercise of these stock options.

NOTE 18 — Segment Information

We determine our operating segments based on how our chief
operating decision makers manage our businesses, including
making operating decisions and evaluating operating performance.
We operate in several operating segments; however, there is only
one reportable segment as the significant operating segments
exhibit similar economic characteristics and meet the
aggregation criteria pursuant to SFAS No. 131,
“Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related
Information.” As such, we have aggregated them for
reporting purposes. Each of the significant operating segments
is a supplier of travel services whether by a merchant model or
as an agency model.

In conjunction with the reorganization of our business, which we
began in 2005, our chief operating decision makers have been
assessing our operations to determine how we will manage the
business and report our financial results. We expect, beginning
with the first quarter of 2006 financial statements, that we
will report our results based primarily on geographic location.
