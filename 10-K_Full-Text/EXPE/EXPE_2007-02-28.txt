contains “forward-looking statements” within the
    meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
    These forward-looking statements reflect the views of our
    management regarding current expectations and projections about
    future events and are based on currently available information.
    Actual results could differ materially from those contained in
    these forward-looking statements for a variety of reasons,
    including, but not limited to, those discussed in the section

    readers should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking
    statements. The use of words such as “anticipates,”
    “estimates,” “expects,” “intends,”

    generally identify forward-looking statements; however, these
    words are not the exclusive means of identifying such

Management
    Overview

General
    Description of our Business

Expedia, Inc. is an online travel company, empowering business
    and leisure travelers with the tools and information they need
    to efficiently research, plan, book and experience travel. We
    have created a global travel marketplace used by a broad range
    of leisure and corporate travelers and offline retail travel
    agents as well as travel service providers. We make available,
    on a stand-alone and package basis, travel products and services
    provided by numerous airlines, lodging properties, car rental
    companies, destination service providers, cruise lines and other
    travel product and service companies.

Our portfolio of brands, which is described below, includes:
    Expedia.com

    Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Summary
    of the Spin-Off from IAC/InterActiveCorp

On December 21, 2004, IAC/InterActiveCorp (“IAC”)
    announced its plan to separate into two independent public
    companies to allow each company to focus on its individual
    strategic objectives. We refer to this transaction as the
    “Spin-Off.” A new company, Expedia, Inc., was
    incorporated under Delaware law in April 2005, to hold
    substantially all of IAC’s travel and travel-related
    businesses.

On August 9, 2005, the Spin-Off was completed and Expedia,
    Inc. shares began trading on The Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc.
    (“NASDAQ”) under the symbol “EXPE.” In
    conjunction with the Spin-Off, we completed the following
    transactions: (1) transferred to IAC all cash in excess of
    $100 million, excluding the cash and cash equivalents held
    by eLong; (2) extinguished all intercompany receivable
    balances from IAC, which



totaled $2.5 billion, by recording a non-cash distribution
    to IAC; (3) recorded a non-cash contribution from IAC of a
    joint ownership interest in an airplane, with a value of
    $17.4 million; (4) recorded a non-cash contribution of
    media time, with a value of $17.1 million;
    (5) recorded derivative liabilities for the stock warrants
    and Ask Jeeves Convertible Subordinated Notes (“Ask Jeeves
    Notes”) with a fair value of $101.6 million;
    (6) recorded a modification of stock-based compensation
    awards of $5.4 million; and (7) recapitalized the
    invested equity balance with common stock, Class B common
    stock and preferred stock, whereby holders of IAC stock received
    shares of Expedia stock based on a formula.

Equity
    Ownership and Voting Control

As of December 31, 2006, there were approximately
    305,901,048 shares of Expedia common stock,
    25,599,998 shares of Expedia Class B common stock and
    846 shares of Expedia preferred stock outstanding. Liberty
    Media Corporation (“Liberty”), through companies owned
    by Liberty and companies owned jointly by Liberty and Barry
    Diller, Chairman and Senior Executive of Expedia, beneficially
    owned approximately 19% of Expedia’s outstanding common
    stock and 100% of Expedia’s outstanding Class B common
    stock. As of such date, Mr. Diller (through his own
    holdings and holdings of Liberty, over which Mr. Diller
    generally has voting control pursuant to an irrevocable proxy
    granted by Liberty under the Stockholders Agreement described
    below) controlled approximately 55% of the outstanding total
    voting power of Expedia. Following our repurchase of
    30 million shares of our common stock on January 19,
    2007, Mr. Diller controlled approximately 58% of the
    outstanding voting power of Expedia.

Pursuant to the Stockholders Agreement, dated as of
    August 9, 2005, between Liberty and Mr. Diller,
    Mr. Diller is effectively able to control the outcome of
    nearly all matters submitted to a vote or for the consent of
    Expedia’s stockholders (other than with respect to the
    election by the Expedia common stockholders of 25% of the
    members of Expedia’s Board of Directors and certain matters
    as to which a separate class vote of the holders of Expedia
    common stock or Expedia preferred stock is required under
    Delaware law). In addition, pursuant to the Governance
    Agreement, dated as of August 9, 2005, among Expedia,
    Liberty and Mr. Diller, each of Mr. Diller and Liberty
    generally has the right to consent to certain significant
    corporate actions in the event that Expedia’s ratio of
    total debt to EBITDA, as defined therein, equals or exceeds four
    to one over a continuous

12-month

period.

Portfolio
    of Brands

Expedia leverages its brand portfolio to target the broadest
    possible range of travel suppliers and travelers looking for
    travel options. Our brands provide a wide selection of travel
    products and services, from simple, discounted travel to more
    complex, luxury travel. Our products primarily consist of
    airline flights, hotel stays, car rentals, destination services
    and cruises.

Expedia

®

.  Our
    Expedia-branded websites make a large variety of travel products
    and services available directly to travelers through our

U.S.-based

website, www.expedia.com, as well as through localized versions
    of our website in Australia, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany,
    Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and the United
    Kingdom. Expedia-branded websites also serve as the travel
    channel on MSN.com, Microsoft Corporation’s
    (“Microsoft”) online services network in the United
    States, as well as certain international MSN sites.
    Expedia-branded websites target many different types of
    travelers, from families booking a summer vacation to individual
    travelers arranging a quick weekend getaway. Travelers can
    search for, compare information about (including pricing and
    availability) and book travel products and services on
    Expedia-branded websites, including airline tickets, lodging,
    car rentals, cruises and many destination services —
    such as attractions and tours — from a large number of
    suppliers, on both a stand-alone and package basis.

Hotels.com

®

.

Our
    Hotels.com website makes available a large variety of lodging
    options to travelers, who can plan, shop for and book lodging
    accommodations, from traditional hotels to vacation rentals.
    Hotels.com seeks to provide travelers with premium content and
    service through our

U.S.-based

website, www.hotels.com, as well as through localized versions
    in the Americas, Europe, Asia Pacific and South Africa.



With Hotels.com, we differentiate our offering by positioning
    the brand as a hotel expert with premium content about lodging
    properties.

Hotwire.com

tm

.  Our
    discount travel website, Hotwire.com, makes available airline
    tickets, hotel rooms, rental cars, cruises and vacation
    packages. Hotwire.com’s approach matches flexible,
    price-sensitive travelers with suppliers who have excess seats,
    rooms and cars they wish to fill without affecting the
    public’s perception of their brands. Hotwire.com travelers
    may enjoy significant discounts by electing to book travel
    services “opaquely” or “semi-opaquely,”
    without knowing certain itinerary details such as brand, time of
    departure and exact hotel location, while suppliers create value
    from excess inventory without diluting their core brand-loyal
    traveler base. Hotwire.com works with many domestic and
    international airlines, including U.S. full-service major
    network airlines, top hotels in hundreds of cities and resort
    destinations in the United States, Europe, Canada, Mexico and
    the Caribbean and major car rental companies in the United
    States.

Worldwide Travel Exchange and Interactive Affiliate
    Network.

Our private label programs make travel
    products and services available to travelers through third-party
    company-branded websites. The products and services made
    available through our websites, www.wwte.com and www.ian.com,
    are substantially similar to those made available on
    Expedia-branded and Hotels.com-branded websites, respectively.
    We generally compensate participants in the
    WWTE

®

and
    IAN

tm

private label programs on a revenue-share basis.

Classic
    Vacations

®

.  We
    offer individually tailored vacations that we provide primarily
    through a national network of third-party retail travel agents.
    We deliver a full line of premium vacation packages —
    air, hotels, car rentals, activities and private
    transportation — to create customized luxury vacations
    in Hawaii, the Caribbean, Mexico, Costa Rica, Europe, Australia,
    New Zealand and Tahiti. Travel agents and travelers can preview
    our product offering through our websites,
    www.classicforagents.com and www.classicvacations.com.

Destination Services.

Our network of travel
    desks located at hotels and resorts in Florida, Hawaii, and
    Mexico makes available to travelers the opportunity to obtain
    tours, attractions, airport transfer services and other
    travel-related services. Our network expanded through our
    acquisition of Activity World and Activity Hut, destination
    service providers in Hawaii in 2004 and 2006, and our 2005
    acquisition of Premier Getaways in Florida.

Expedia

®

Corporate Travel.

Our full-service travel
    management company makes travel products and services available
    to corporate travelers in the United States, Canada and Europe.
    In 2004, we established ECT — Europe, which includes
    Egencia and World Travel Management, both of which were acquired
    in 2004. ECT provides, among other things, centralized booking
    tools for employees of our corporate travelers, support of
    negotiated airfares and consolidated reporting aimed at small-
    and mid-sized businesses. ECT charges corporate client companies
    account management fees, as well as transactional fees for
    making or changing bookings. In addition, ECT provides

on-site

agents to some corporate clients in order to more fully support
    the account.

eLong

tm

.
    Our majority owned online travel service company, based in
    Beijing, the People’s Republic of China
    (“China”), specializes in travel products and services
    in China. eLong uses web-based distribution technologies and a

24-hour

nationwide call center to provide consumers with consolidated
    travel information and the ability to access hotel reservations
    at discounted rates at over 3,500 hotels in major cities across
    China. eLong also offers air ticketing and other travel related
    services, such as rental cars and vacation packages. Travelers
    can access travel products and services through the websites,
    www.elong.com and www.elong.net.

TripAdvisor

®

.  Our
    comprehensive online travel search engine and directory
    aggregates unbiased articles, guidebook reviews and user
    opinions on cities, hotels and activities in a variety of
    destinations from a number of online sources through our
    websites, www.tripadvisor.com and www.tripadvisor.co.uk. In
    addition to travel-related information, TripAdvisor’s
    destination-specific search results provide links to the
    websites of TripAdvisor’s travel partners (travel service
    providers and marketers) through which travelers can make
    related travel arrangements.



Business
    Strategy

Expedia, Inc. is building the world’s largest and most
    intelligent travel marketplace. We play a fundamental role in
    facilitating travel, whether for leisure or business. We are
    committed to providing our travelers with the best set of
    resources to serve their travel needs by taking advantage of our
    critical assets — our brand portfolio, our
    technologies and continuous innovation, our global reach, and
    our breadth of product offering. In doing so, we take advantage
    of our growing base of knowledge about our destinations,
    suppliers and travelers based on our unique position in the
    travel value chain.

A discussion of the critical assets that we leverage in
    achieving our business strategy follows:

Portfolio of Travel Brands.

We seek to appeal
    to the broadest possible range of travelers and suppliers
    through our collection of industry-leading brands. We target
    several different demographics, from the value-conscious
    traveler through our Hotwire brand to luxury travelers seeking a
    high-touch, customized vacation package through our Classic
    Vacations brand. We believe our flagship Expedia brand appeals
    to the broadest range of travelers, with our extensive product
    offering and facilitation of single item bookings of discounted
    product to complex bundling of higher-end travel packages. Our
    Hotels.com site and its international versions target travelers
    with premium content about lodging properties, and generally
    appeal to travelers with shorter booking windows who prefer to
    drive to their destinations.

We believe our appeal to suppliers is enhanced by our brand
    portfolio and our international points of sale, by allowing
    suppliers to access the broadest possible range of travelers
    with their product and service offerings. We intend to continue
    supporting and investing in our brand portfolio for the benefit
    of travelers and suppliers.

Technologies and Continuous
    Innovation.

Expedia has an established tradition
    of innovation, from Expedia.com’s inception as a division
    of Microsoft, to our introduction of more recent innovations
    such as our ThankYou Rewards Network offered in conjunction with
    Citigroup,
    Expedia

®

Fare Alerts, Travel
    Ticker

tm

by
    Hotwire

®

,
    TripAdvisor’s wikis and ECT’s business intelligence
    toolset.

We intend to continue to aggressively innovate on behalf of our
    travelers, including our current efforts in building a
    scaleable, extensible, service-oriented technology platform,
    which will extend across our portfolio of brands. We expect this
    to result in improved flexibility and faster go-forward
    innovation. This transition should allow us to improve our site
    merchandising, browse and search functionality and add
    significant personalization features. We expect this transition
    to occur in a phased approach, with portions of our worldwide
    points of sale migrating to the new platform beginning in 2007.

We also intend to continue innovating on behalf of our
    suppliers. As an example, we have developed proprietary,
    supplier-oriented technology that streamlines the interaction
    between some of our websites and hotel central reservation
    systems, making it easier and more cost-effective for hotels to
    manage reservations made through our brands. Through this
    “direct connect” technology, hotels can upload
    information about available products and services and rates
    directly from their central reservation systems into our
    websites, as well as automatically confirm hotel reservations
    made by our travelers. In the absence of direct connect
    technology, both of these processes are generally completed
    manually via a proprietary extranet. Our travelers can book
    reservations with over 30,000 worldwide merchant hotel
    properties, of which over 35% are now fully direct-connected. We
    are planning to offer more streamlined application programming
    interfaces for our lodging partners in 2007, to enable faster
    and simpler integration of real-time hotel content.

We are also improving our data handling capabilities across
    Expedia with the installation of an enterprise data warehouse,
    which will allow enhanced personalization on both our websites
    and

e-mail

communications with our travelers. The project is scheduled to
    begin yielding benefits to our travelers beginning in 2007.

Global Reach.

In 2006, our international gross
    bookings accounted for approximately 26% of worldwide gross
    bookings and 28% of revenue. We currently operate over 50
    branded points of sale across the globe, including
    Expedia-branded sites in the United States, Australia, Canada,
    Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway,
    Sweden and the United Kingdom. Our Hotels.com and TripAdvisor
    brands



also maintain both U.S. points of sale and additional
    points of sale outside the United States. Lastly, we offer
    Chinese travelers a wide array of products and services through
    our majority ownership in eLong.

We intend to continue investing in and growing our existing
    international points of sale, including the expected launch of
    an Expedia-branded site in India in 2007. We anticipate
    launching points of sale in additional countries where we find
    large travel markets and rapid growth of online commerce. Future
    launches, such as India, may occur under our flagship Expedia
    brand, through one of our other brands, or through acquisition
    of third-party brands, as in the case of eLong.

ECT currently conducts operations in the United States, Belgium,
    Canada, France, Germany and the United Kingdom. We believe the
    corporate travel sector represents a large opportunity for
    Expedia, and we believe we offer a compelling technology
    solution to small and medium-sized businesses seeking to control
    travel costs and improve their employees’ travel
    experiences. We also believe that expanding our corporate travel
    business also increases our appeal to travel product and service
    suppliers, as the average corporate traveler has a higher
    incidence of first class and international travel than the
    average leisure traveler. We intend to continue investing in and
    expanding the geographic footprint of our ECT business.

In expanding our global reach, we are leveraging our significant
    investment in technology, operations, brand building, supplier
    integration and relationships and other areas since the launch
    of Expedia.com in 1996.

We intend to continue leveraging this investment when launching
    new countries, introducing website features, adding supplier
    products and services or adding value-added content for
    travelers. As a result, we have been able to launch several
    websites — including Expedia-branded sites in Japan,
    Denmark, Norway and Sweden — relatively quickly and
    cost effectively.

Our scale of operations also enhances the value of technology
    innovations we introduce on behalf of our travelers and
    suppliers. As an example, our traveler review
    feature — whereby Expedia travelers have created over
    300,000 qualified reviews of hotel properties — is
    able to accumulate a larger base of reviews due to the higher
    base of online traffic that frequents our various websites.

Breadth of Product Offering.

In general,
    through our websites, we believe we offer a comprehensive array
    of innovative travel products and services to travelers. We plan
    to continue improving and growing these offerings, as well as
    expand them to our worldwide points of sale over time.

The majority of our revenue comes from transactions involving
    the sale of airline tickets and the booking of hotel
    reservations, either as stand-alone products or as part of
    package transactions. We are working to grow our package
    business as it results in higher revenue per transaction, and we
    also seek to continue diversifying our revenue mix beyond core
    air and hotel products to car rental, destination services,
    cruise and other product offerings, as well as by increasing the
    mix of revenue from advertising we derive from our travel
    partners and suppliers.

Merchant
    and Agency Business Models

We make travel products and services available both on a
    stand-alone and package basis, primarily through two business
    models: the merchant model and the agency model. Under the
    merchant model, we facilitate the booking of hotel rooms,
    airline seats, car rentals and destination services from our
    travel suppliers and for such bookings, we are the merchant of
    record. Under the agency model, we act as an agent in the
    transaction, passing reservations booked by our travelers to the
    relevant airline, hotel, car rental company or cruise line.

As merchant of record, we generally have certain latitude to
    establish prices charged to travelers (as compared to agency
    transactions). Also, we negotiate inventory allocation and
    pricing with our suppliers which enables us to achieve a higher
    level of net revenue per transaction as compared to those
    provided through the agency model.

Through our Expedia-branded websites, travelers can dynamically
    assemble multiple component travel packages in a single
    transaction at a lower price as compared to booking each
    component separately. Packages assembled by travelers through
    the packaging model on these websites include a merchant hotel
    component



and an air or car component. Travelers select packages based on
    the total package price, without being provided component
    pricing. The use of the merchant travel components in packages
    enables us to make certain travel products available at prices
    lower than those charged on an individual component basis by
    travel suppliers without impacting their established pricing and
    position models. We are also expanding our use of third-party
    provided pre-assembled package offerings, particularly through
    our international points of sale, further broadening our scope
    of products and services to travelers.

Our agency business is comprised of the sale of airline tickets,
    hotel, cruise and car rental reservations. Airline ticket
    transactions make up the majority of this business. Although net
    revenue per transaction is lower (as compared to the merchant
    model), due to the high volume of airline tickets sold, our
    agency gross bookings accounted for 59% of total gross bookings
    for the year ended December 31, 2006.

Relationships
    with Travel Suppliers, Distribution and Fulfillment
    Partners

Overview.

We make travel products and services
    available from a variety of large and small commercial and
    charter airlines, lodging properties, car rental companies,
    cruise lines and destination service providers. We seek to build
    and maintain long-term, strategic relationships with travel
    suppliers and global distribution system (“GDS”)
    partners. An important component of the success of our business
    depends on our ability to maintain our existing, as well as
    build new, relationships with travel suppliers and GDS partners.

Travel Suppliers.

We strive to deliver value
    to our travel suppliers through a wide range of innovative,
    targeted merchandising and promotional strategies designed to
    increase their revenue, while simultaneously reducing their
    marketing transaction and customer service costs. Our Partner
    Services Group consists mainly of strategic account managers and
    local market managers who work directly with travel suppliers to
    increase the marketing of their travel products and brands
    through our points of sale.

In addition, we have developed proprietary, supplier-oriented
    technology that streamlines the interaction between some of our
    websites and hotel central reservation systems, making it easier
    and more cost-effective for hotels to manage reservations made
    through our brands. Through this “direct connect”
    technology, hotels can upload information about available
    products and services and rates directly from their central
    reservation systems into our websites, as well as automatically
    confirm hotel reservations made by our travelers. In the absence
    of direct connect technology, both of these processes are
    generally completed manually via a proprietary extranet. Our
    travelers can book reservations with over 30,000 merchant hotel
    properties worldwide, of which over 35% are now fully
    direct-connected.

Distribution Partners.

GDSs, also referred to
    as computer reservation services, provide a centralized,
    comprehensive repository of travel suppliers
    “content” — such as availability and pricing
    of seats on various airline

point-to-point

flights, or “segments.” The GDSs act as intermediaries
    between the travel suppliers and online and offline travel
    agencies, allowing agents to reserve and book flights, rooms or
    other travel products.

While we have historically used Worldspan as our primary GDS, in
    light of the deregulated GDS environment and our desire to
    ensure the widest possible supply of air content for our
    travelers, in 2006 we diversified our use of GDS providers
    through distribution agreements, and now use Worldspan, Amadeus
    and Sabre.

Fulfillment Partners.

We outsource certain of
    our airline ticket fulfillment functions to third-party
    suppliers. Such functions include the issuance of airline
    tickets and related customer services.

Marketing
    and Promotions

Our marketing programs are intended to build and maintain the
    value of our various brands, drive traffic and conversion
    through our various brands and businesses, lower ongoing
    traveler acquisition costs and strategically position our brands
    in relation to one another. Our long-term success depends on our
    continued ability to increase the overall number of traveler
    transactions in a cost-effective manner.

Our marketing channels primarily include direct

and/or

personalized traveler communications on our websites and through

e-mail

communications, search engine marketing and optimization as well
    as online and



offline advertising. In addition, our Expedia-branded websites
    provide content and services to the travel channel on the
    MSN.com website in the United States and MSN websites in Canada,
    France, Germany, Italy, and the United Kingdom. Our marketing
    programs and initiatives include promotional offers such as
    coupons and gift cards. In addition, we introduced the ThankYou
    Rewards Network during the fourth quarter of 2006, whereby
    travelers earn points for their travel bookings.

We also make use of affiliate marketing. The Expedia.com and
    Hotels.com-branded websites receive bookings from consumers who
    have clicked-through to the respective websites through links
    posted on affiliate partner websites. We have agreements with
    thousands of third-party affiliate partners, including a number
    of leading travel companies, pursuant to which we pay a
    commission for bookings originated from their websites.
    Affiliate partners can make travel products and services
    available through an Expedia-branded website, a co-branded
    website or their own private label website. We also provide our
    affiliates with technology and access to a wide range of
    products and services.

Operations
    and Technology

We provide

24-hour-a-day,

seven-day-a-week

traveler support by telephone or via

e-mail.

For
    purposes of operational flexibility, we provide this support
    infrastructure with a combination of in-house and outsourced
    call centers which are located in various locations throughout
    the world.

Our systems infrastructure and web and database servers are
    hosted by third-party web hosting suppliers in various
    locations, mainly in the United States, which provide
    communication links, as well as

24-hour

monitoring and engineering support. The web hosting facilities
    have their own generators and multiple

back-up

systems. Significant amounts of our computer hardware for
    operating the websites are also located at these facilities.

We have developed innovative technology to power our global
    travel marketplace. For example, our Expert Searching and
    Pricing Platform (“ESP Platform”), which our
    Expedia-branded websites use, includes two components:
    (1) a fare-searching engine that enables broad and deep
    airline fare and schedule searches and (2) a common
    database platform that allows our Expedia-branded websites and
    our travelers to bundle diverse types of travel services
    together dynamically, which further enables our Expedia-branded
    websites to cross-market and package travel inventory. The ESP
    Platform has been historically an important contributor to our
    growth in the online travel industry.

Another core piece of our technology suite is our Best Fare
    Search technology. This technology essentially deconstructs the
    segment feeds from GDS partners for air flight searches and
    recommends the best way to re-assemble multi-leg itineraries so
    that they are less expensive and more flexible for the traveler.

We are investing in and building a scaleable, extensible,
    service-oriented technology platform which will extend across
    our portfolio of brands. We plan to significantly invest in this
    platform in 2007 and 2008. We expect this investment to result
    in long-term cost savings, improved flexibility and faster
    go-forward innovation. This transition should also allow us to
    improve our site merchandising, browse and search functionality,
    add significant personalization features, and ultimately improve
    our ability to drive higher

return-on-investment

in our online and offline advertising. We expect this transition
    to occur in a phased approach, with portions of our worldwide
    points of sale migrating to the new platform beginning in 2007.

We are also adding a significant upgrade to our data aggregation
    and mining capabilities across Expedia with the installation of
    an enterprise data warehouse, which is scheduled to begin
    yielding traveler-facing benefits in 2007.

Competition

Our brands compete in rapidly evolving and intensely competitive
    markets. We believe the relatively low percentage of total
    travel sales transacted online in the global travel industry
    indicates that these markets represent especially large
    opportunities for Expedia and those of its competitors that wish
    to expand their brands and businesses abroad.



Our competition, which is strong and increasing, includes online
    and offline travel companies that target leisure and corporate
    travelers including travel agencies, tour operators, travel
    supplier direct websites and their call centers, consolidators
    and wholesalers of travel products and services and other
    companies offering travel search engines including meta-search
    engines. We face these competitors in local, regional, national

and/or

international markets.

We believe that maintaining and enhancing our brands is a
    critical component of our effort to compete. We differentiate
    our brands from our competitors primarily based on quality and
    breadth of travel products, channel features and usability,
    price, traveler service and quality of travel planning content
    and advice. The emphasis on one or more of these factors varies,
    depending on the brand or business and the related target
    demographic.

Our brands face increasing competition from travel supplier
    direct websites. In some cases, supplier direct channels offer
    advantages to travelers, such as loyalty programs or lower
    transaction fees. Our websites feature travel products and
    services from numerous travel suppliers (as opposed to a single
    supplier), and allow travelers to combine products and services
    from multiple providers in one transaction. We face competition
    from airlines, hotels, rental car companies, cruise operators
    and other travel service providers, whether working individually
    or collectively, some of which are suppliers to our websites.
    Our business is generally sensitive to changes in the
    competitive landscape, including the emergence of new
    competitors.

Intellectual
    Property Rights

We regard our intellectual property rights, including our
    patents, service marks, trademarks, domain names, copyrights,
    trade secrets and other intellectual property, as critical to
    our success. For example, we rely heavily upon the software
    code, informational databases and other components that make up
    our travel planning service.

We rely on a combination of laws, business practices and
    contractual obligations with employees, suppliers, affiliates
    and others to establish and protect our trade secrets. Despite
    these precautions, it may be possible for a third-party to copy
    or otherwise obtain and use our trade secrets or our
    intellectual property without authorization which, if
    discovered, might require the uncertainty of legal action to
    correct. In addition, there can be no assurance that others will
    not independently and lawfully develop substantially similar
    properties.

We maintain our trademark portfolio by filing trademark
    applications with the appropriate international trademark
    offices, maintaining our current registrations, securing
    contractual trademark rights when appropriate, and relying on
    common law trademark rights when appropriate. We also register
    domain names as we deem appropriate. We protect our trademarks
    and domain names with an enforcement program and use of
    trademark licenses. While we seek to protect our trademarks and
    domain names, effective trademark and domain name protection may
    not be available or may not be sought by us for every trademark
    and domain name used in every country, and contractual disputes
    may affect the use of trademarks and domain names governed by
    private contract. In addition, our infringement monitoring
    resources may not locate every trademark or domain name
    infringement that exists. Similarly, not every variation of a
    domain name may be available, or may be registered by us, even
    if available. The failure to protect our intellectual property
    in a meaningful manner, or challenges to our intellectual
    property rights, could materially adversely affect our business,
    result in erosion of our brand names

and/or

limit
    our ability to control marketing on or through the internet
    using our various domain names.

We have considered, and will continue to consider, the
    appropriateness of filing for patents to protect future
    inventions, as circumstances may warrant. However, many patents
    protect only specific inventions and there can be no assurance
    that others may not create new products or methods that achieve
    similar results without infringing upon patents owned by us.

From time to time, we may be subject to legal proceedings and
    claims in the ordinary course of our business, including claims
    of alleged infringement by us of the trademarks, copyrights,
    patents and other intellectual property rights of third-parties.
    In addition, litigation may be necessary in the future to
    enforce our



intellectual property rights, protect our trade secrets or to
    determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights claimed
    by others. Any such litigation, regardless of outcome or merit,
    could result in substantial costs and diversion of management
    and technical resources, any of which could materially harm our
    business.

Regulation

We must comply with laws and regulations relating to the travel
    industry and the provision of travel services, including
    registration in various states as “sellers of travel”
    and compliance with certain disclosure requirements and
    participation in state restitution funds. In addition, our
    businesses are subject to regulation by the U.S. Department
    of Transportation and must comply with various rules and
    regulations governing the provision of air transportation,
    including those relating to advertising and accessibility.

As we continue to expand the reach of our brands into the
    European, Asia-Pacific and other international markets, we are
    increasingly subject to laws and regulations applicable to
    travel agents in those markets, including, in some countries,
    laws regulating the provision of travel packages and industry
    specific value-added tax regimes. For example, the European
    Economic Community Council Directive on Package Travel Package
    Holidays and Package Tours imposes various obligations upon
    marketers of travel packages, such as disclosure obligations to
    consumers and liability to consumers for improper performance of
    the package, including supplier failure.

Financial
    Information about Segments and Geographic Areas

We generate our revenue through a diverse customer base, and
    there is no reliance on a single customer or small group of
    customers; no customer represented 10% or more of our total
    revenue in the periods presented in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

In the first quarter of 2006, we began reporting two segments:
    North America and Europe. The change from a single reportable
    segment is a result of the reorganization of our business. We
    have not reported segment information for the years ended
    December 31, 2005 and 2004, as it is not practicable to do
    so. Beginning in the first quarter of 2007, we will disclose
    comparable financial information. The segment and geographic
    information required herein is contained in
    Note 16 — Segment Information, in the notes to
    our consolidated financial statements

.

Additional
    Information

Company Website and Public Filings.

We
    maintain a corporate website at www.expediainc.com. Except as
    explicitly noted, the information on our website, as well as the
    websites of our various brands and businesses, is not
    incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K,

or in any other filings with, or in any information furnished or
    submitted to, the SEC.

We make available, free of charge through our website, our
    Annual Reports on

Form 10-K,

Quarterly Reports on

Form 10-Q

and Current Reports on

Form 8-K

filed or furnished pursuant to Sections 13(a) or
    Section 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
    amended, as soon as reasonably practicable after they have been
    electronically filed with, or furnished to, the SEC.

Code of Ethics.

We post our code of business
    conduct and ethics, which applies to all employees, including
    all executive officers, senior financial officers and directors,
    on our corporate website at www.expediainc.com. Our code of
    business conduct and ethics complies with Item 406 of SEC

Regulation S-K

and the rules of the NASDAQ. We intend to disclose any changes
    to the code that affect the provisions required by Item 406
    of

Regulation S-K,

and any waivers of the code of ethics for our executive
    officers, senior financial officers or directors, on our
    corporate website.

Employees

As of December 31, 2006, we employed approximately
    6,600 full-time and part-time employees, including
    approximately 1,650 employees of eLong. We believe we have good
    relationships with our



employees, including relationships with employees represented by
    works councils or other similar organizations.

Part I. Item 1A.

Risk
    Factors

You should carefully consider each of the following risks and
    uncertainties associated with our company and the ownership of
    our securities. Additional risks not presently known to us or
    that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business
    operations.

We operate in an increasingly competitive environment.

The market for the services we offer is increasingly and
    intensely competitive. We compete with both established and
    emerging online and traditional sellers of travel services with
    respect to each of the services we offer. Some of our
    competitors, particularly travel suppliers such as airlines and
    hotels, may offer products and services on more favorable terms
    such as no fees and with unique access to proprietary loyalty
    programs, such as points and miles. Many of these competitors,
    such as airlines, hotel and rental car companies, have been
    steadily focusing on increasing online demand on their own
    websites in lieu of third-party distributors like us. For
    instance, many low cost airlines, which are having increasing
    success in the marketplace, distribute their online inventory
    exclusively through their own websites. Suppliers who sell on
    their own websites typically do not charge a processing fee,
    and, in some instances, offer advantages such as their own bonus
    miles or loyalty points, which could make their offerings more
    attractive to consumers than offerings like ours. The
    introduction of new technologies and the expansion of existing
    technologies, such as metasearch and other search engine
    technologies, may increase competitive pressures. Increased
    competition may result in reduced margins, as well as loss of
    travelers, transactions and brand recognition. We cannot assure
    you that we will be able to compete successfully against
    current, emerging and future competitors or provide
    differentiated products and services to our traveler base. This
    competition may result in reduced margins, loss of segment share
    and damage to our brand.

Over the last several years, we have experienced downward
    pressure on commissions and payments to us from our
    suppliers.

A portion of our revenue is derived from compensation paid by
    travel suppliers and GDS partners for bookings made through our
    websites. We generally negotiate these commissions and fees with
    our travel suppliers and GDS partners. Over the last several
    years, travel suppliers have generally reduced or eliminated
    commissions and payments to travel agents and other travel
    intermediaries. In particular, in 2006, GDS partners faced the
    renegotiation of long-term contracts with airlines on terms that
    generally resulted in decreased compensation to them. We also
    renegotiated several long-term contracts with airlines and GDSs
    with reduced economic benefits. We are currently negotiating and
    expect to renegotiate other long-term airline and hotel
    contracts in 2007. No assurances can be given that GDS partners
    or travel suppliers will not further reduce current industry
    compensation or our compensation, either of which could reduce
    our revenue and margins thereby adversely affecting our business
    and financial performance.

Declines or disruptions in the travel industry could
    adversely affect our business or financial performance.

Our business and financial performance are affected by the
    health of the worldwide travel industry. Accordingly, downturns
    or weaknesses in the travel industry could adversely affect our
    business. Travel expenditures are sensitive to business and
    personal discretionary spending levels and tend to decline
    during general economic downturns. Events or weakness in the
    travel industry that could negatively affect our business
    include price escalation in the airline industry or other
    travel-related industries, airline or other travel-related
    strikes, airline bankruptcies, liquidations or consolidations
    and fuel price escalation. Additionally, our business is
    sensitive to safety concerns, and thus our business may decline
    after incidents of actual or threatened terrorism, during
    periods of political instability or geopolitical conflict in
    which travelers become concerned about safety issues, as a
    result of inclement weather such as hurricanes or when travel
    might involve health-related risks, such as avian flu. Such
    concerns could result in a protracted decrease in



demand for our travel services. This decrease in demand,
    depending on its scope and duration, together with any future
    issues affecting travel safety, could significantly and
    adversely affect our business and financial performance over the
    short and long-term. In addition, the disruption of the existing
    travel plans of a significant number of travelers upon the
    occurrence of certain events, such as actual or threatened
    terrorist activity or war, could result in the incurrence of
    significant additional costs if we provide relief to affected
    travelers by not charging cancellation fees

and/or

by
    refunding the price of airline tickets, hotel reservations and
    other travel products and services.

Our business depends on our relationships with travel
    suppliers.

An important component of our business success depends on our
    ability to maintain our existing relationships and to build new
    relationships with travel suppliers and GDS partners. Adverse
    changes in existing relationships, or our inability to enter
    into new arrangements with these parties on favorable terms, if
    at all, could reduce the amount, quality and breadth of
    attractively priced travel products and services that we are
    able to offer, which could adversely affect our business and
    financial performance.

Travel suppliers are increasingly seeking to lower their travel
    distribution costs by promoting direct online bookings through
    their own websites. In some cases, supplier direct channels
    offer advantages to consumers, such as loyalty programs

and/or

lower
    transaction fees. In addition, travel suppliers may choose not
    to make their travel products and services available through our
    distribution channels. To the extent that consumers continue to
    increase the percentage of their travel purchases through
    supplier direct websites

and/or

if
    travel suppliers choose not to make their products and services
    available to us, our business may suffer.

We rely on the performance of highly skilled personnel and,
    if we are unable to retain or motivate key personnel or hire,
    retain and motivate qualified personnel, our business would be
    harmed.

Our performance is largely dependent on the talents and efforts
    of highly skilled individuals. Our future success depends on our
    continuing ability to identify, hire, develop, motivate and
    retain highly skilled personnel for all areas of our
    organization. In particular, the contributions of Barry Diller,
    our Chairman and Senior Executive, and Dara Khosrowshahi, our
    Chief Executive Officer, are critical to the overall management
    of the company.

In addition, we have experienced a high rate of executive
    turnover during the last two years. Our future success will
    depend on the performance of our senior management and key
    employees, many of whom joined Expedia recently. Expedia cannot
    ensure that it will be able to retain the services of
    Mr. Diller, Mr. Khosrowshahi or any other member of
    our senior management or key employees, the loss of whom could
    seriously harm our business. In addition, competition for
    well-qualified employees in all aspects of our business,
    including software engineers and other technology professionals,
    is intense. Our continued ability to compete effectively depends
    on our ability to attract new employees and to retain and
    motivate our existing employees. If we do not succeed in
    attracting well-qualified employees or retaining or motivating
    existing employees, our business would be adversely affected. We
    do not maintain any key person life insurance policies.

System interruption and the lack of integration and
    redundancy in our information systems may harm our
    businesses.

We rely on our own and third-party computer systems and service
    providers to facilitate and process a portion of our
    transactions. We have experienced and may in the future
    experience system interruptions that make some or all of these
    systems unavailable or prevent us from efficiently fulfilling
    orders or providing services to third-parties. Any
    interruptions, outages or delays in our systems or third-party
    providers’ systems, or deterioration in their performance,
    could impair each company’s ability to process transactions
    for its travelers and decrease the quality of service that we
    can offer to our travelers. If we were to experience frequent or
    persistent system failures, our reputation and brands could be
    harmed.

In addition, we do not have backup systems for certain critical
    aspects of our operations, many other systems are not fully
    redundant and our disaster recovery planning may not be
    sufficient. Fire, flood, power



loss, telecommunications failure, break-ins, earthquakes, acts
    of war or terrorism, acts of God, computer viruses, physical or
    electronic break-ins and similar events or disruptions may
    damage or interrupt computer or communications systems at any
    time. Any of these events could cause system interruption,
    delays and loss of critical data, and could prevent us from
    providing services to our travelers

and/or

third
    parties for a significant period of time. Remediation may be
    costly and we may not have adequate insurance to cover such
    costs. Moreover, the costs of enhancing infrastructure to attain
    improved stability and redundancy may be time consuming and
    expensive and may require resources and expertise that are
    difficult to obtain.

Our expansion places a significant strain on our management,
    technical, operational and financial resources.

We have rapidly and significantly expanded our operations both
    domestically and internationally and anticipate expanding
    further to pursue growth of our product and service offerings
    and customer base. Such expansion increases the complexity of
    our business and places a significant strain on our management,
    operations, technical performance, financial resources and
    internal financial control and reporting functions.

There can be no assurance that we will be able to manage our
    expansion effectively. Our current and planned personnel,
    systems, procedures and controls may not be adequate to support
    and effectively manage our future operations, especially as we
    employ personnel in multiple geographic locations. We may not be
    able to hire, train, retain, motivate and manage required
    personnel, which may limit our growth. If any of this were to
    occur, it could damage our reputation, limit our growth,
    negatively affect our financial performance, and hurt our
    business.

Acquisitions could result in operating and financial
    difficulties.

Our future growth may depend, in part, on acquisitions. To the
    extent that we grow through acquisitions, we will face the
    operational and financial risks that commonly accompany that
    strategy. We would also face operational risks, such as failing
    to assimilate the operations and personnel of the acquired
    businesses, disrupting their ongoing businesses, impairing
    management resources and their relationships with employees and
    travelers as a result of changes in their ownership and
    management. Further, the evaluation and negotiation of potential
    acquisitions, as well as the integration of an acquired
    business, may divert management time and other resources. Some
    acquisitions may not be successful and their performances may
    result in the impairment of their carrying value.

Certain financial and operational risks related to acquisitions
    that may have a material impact on our business are:

•

Use of cash resources and incurrence of debt and contingent
    liabilities in funding acquisitions;

•

Amortization expenses related to acquired intangible assets and
    other adverse accounting consequences;

•

Costs incurred in identifying and performing due diligence on
    potential acquisition targets that may or may not be successful;

•

Difficulties and expenses in assimilating the operations,
    products, technology, information systems or personnel of the
    acquired company;

•

Impairment of relationships with employees, suppliers and
    affiliates of our business and the acquired business;

•

The assumption of known and unknown debt and liabilities of the
    acquired company;

•

Entrance into markets in which we have no direct prior
    experience; and

•

Impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets arising from
    our acquisitions (for example, in the quarter ended
    September 30, 2006, we recognized a $47.0 million
    impairment charge related to an indefinite lived intangible
    asset of Hotwire).



Our stock price is highly volatile.

The market price of our common stock is highly volatile and
    could continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to
    factors such as the following, some of which are beyond our
    control:

•

Quarterly variations in our operating results;

•

Operating results that vary from the expectations of securities
    analysts and investors;

•

Changes in expectations as to our future financial performance,
    including financial estimates by securities analysts and
    investors;

•

Changes in our capital structure;

•

Changes in market valuations of other internet or online service
    companies;

•

Announcements of technological innovations or new services by us
    or our competitors;

•

Announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts,
    acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital
    commitments;

•

Loss of a major supplier participant, such as an airline or
    hotel chain;

•

Changes in the status of our intellectual property rights;

•

Lack of success in the expansion of our business model
    geographically;

•

Announcements by third parties of significant claims or
    proceedings against us or adverse developments in pending
    proceedings;

•

Additions or departures of key personnel; and

•

Market and volume fluctuations in the stock markets in general.

We may not be able to engage in desirable strategic
    transactions and equity issuances due to our tax sharing
    arrangements.

Our ability to engage in significant stock transactions could be
    limited or restricted to preserve the tax free nature of our
    Spin-Off from IAC. Current federal income tax law creates a
    presumption that the Spin-Off would be taxable to IAC, but not
    to its stockholders, if either IAC or we enter into a
    transaction that would result in a 50% or greater change, by
    vote or value, in IAC’s or our stock ownership during the
    four-year period that begins two years before the date of the
    Spin-Off, unless it is established that the transaction is not
    pursuant to a plan or series of transactions related to the
    Spin-Off. Treasury regulations currently in effect generally
    provide that whether an acquisition transaction and a Spin-Off
    are part of a plan is determined based on all of the facts and
    circumstances, including, but not limited to, specific factors
    described in the regulations. In addition, the regulations
    provide several “safe harbors” for acquisition
    transactions that are not considered to be part of a plan. These
    restrictions may prevent us from entering into transactions
    which might be advantageous to our stockholders, such as selling
    the company or substantially all of the assets of the company,
    issuing equity securities to satisfy financing needs or
    acquiring businesses or assets with equity securities.

Under the tax sharing agreement with IAC, there are restrictions
    on our ability to take actions that could cause the Spin-Off to
    fail to qualify as a tax-free transaction, including redeeming
    substantial amounts of our equity securities and selling or
    otherwise disposing of a substantial portion of our assets, in
    each case, for a period of 25 months following the
    Spin-Off, which period ends in September 2007. We would be
    required to indemnify IAC against the taxes described in the
    preceding sentence if such tax is incurred by a breach of our
    covenants under the tax sharing agreement.



Mr. Diller currently controls Expedia; and if
    Mr. Diller ceases to control the company, Liberty Media
    Corporation may effectively control the company.

Subject to the terms of the Stockholders Agreement,
    Mr. Diller holds an irrevocable proxy to vote shares of
    Expedia stock held by Liberty. Accordingly, Mr. Diller
    effectively controls the outcome of all matters submitted to a
    vote or for the consent of our stockholders (other than with
    respect to the election by the holders of common stock of 25% of
    the members of the Board of Directors and matters as to which
    Delaware law requires a separate class vote). Upon
    Mr. Diller’s permanent departure from Expedia, the
    irrevocable proxy would terminate and depending on the
    capitalization of Expedia at such time, Liberty may effectively
    control the voting power of our capital stock. Mr. Diller,
    through shares he owns beneficially as well as those subject to
    the irrevocable proxy, controlled approximately 55% of the
    combined voting power of the outstanding Expedia capital stock
    as of December 31, 2006 and approximately 58% as of
    January 19, 2007, following our repurchase of
    30 million shares of our common stock.

In addition, under the Governance Agreement, each of
    Mr. Diller and Liberty generally has the right to consent
    to limited matters in the event that our ratio of total debt to
    EBITDA, as defined in the Governance Agreement, equals or
    exceeds 4:1 over a continuous

12-month

period. We cannot assure you that Mr. Diller and Liberty
    will consent to any such matter at a time when we are highly
    leveraged, in which case we would not be able to engage in such
    transactions or take such actions.

As a result of Mr. Diller’s ownership interests and
    voting power, and Liberty’s ownership interests and voting
    power upon Mr. Diller’s permanent departure from us,
    Mr. Diller is currently, and in the future Liberty may be,
    in a position to control or influence significant corporate
    actions, including, corporate transactions such as mergers,
    business combinations or dispositions of assets and
    determinations with respect to our significant business
    direction and policies. This concentrated control could
    discourage others from initiating any potential merger, takeover
    or other change of control transaction that may otherwise be
    beneficial to us.

Actual or potential conflicts of interest may develop between
    Expedia management and directors, on the one hand, and the
    management and directors of IAC, on the other.

Mr. Diller serves as our Chairman of the Board of Directors
    and Senior Executive, while retaining his role as Chairman and
    Chief Executive Officer of IAC, and Mr. Kaufman serves as
    Vice Chairman of both Expedia and IAC. The fact that
    Messrs. Diller and Kaufman hold positions with both
    companies and own both IAC and Expedia stock could create, or
    appear to create, potential conflicts of interest for each of
    Messrs. Diller and Kaufman when facing decisions that may
    affect both IAC and Expedia. Both Messrs. Diller and
    Kaufman may also face conflicts of interest with regard to the
    allocation of their time between IAC and Expedia.

Our certificate of incorporation provides that no officer or
    director of Expedia who is also an officer or director of IAC
    will be liable to Expedia or its stockholders for breach of any
    fiduciary duty by reason of the fact that any such individual
    directs a corporate opportunity to IAC instead of Expedia, or
    does not communicate information regarding a corporate
    opportunity to Expedia because the officer or director has
    directed the corporate opportunity to IAC. This corporate
    opportunity provision may have the effect of exacerbating the
    risk of conflicts of interest between IAC and Expedia because
    the provision effectively shields an overlapping
    director/executive officer from liability for breach of
    fiduciary duty in the event that such director or officer
    chooses to direct a corporate opportunity to IAC instead of
    Expedia.

Changing laws, rules and regulations and legal uncertainties
    may adversely affect our business or financial performance.

Our business and financial performance could be adversely
    affected by unfavorable changes in or interpretations of
    existing, or the promulgation of new laws, rules and regulations
    applicable to us and our businesses, including those relating to
    the internet and online commerce, consumer protection and
    privacy, could decrease demand for products and services,
    increase costs

and/or

subject us to additional liabilities. For example, there is, and
    will likely continue to be, an increasing number of laws and
    regulations pertaining to the internet and online commerce,
    which may relate to liability for information retrieved from or
    transmitted



over the internet, user privacy, taxation and the quality of
    products and services. Furthermore, the growth and development
    of online commerce may prompt calls for more stringent consumer
    protection laws that may impose additional burdens on online
    businesses generally.

Adverse application of tax laws, rules or regulations could
    have an adverse effect on our businesses and financial
    performance.

In addition, the application of various domestic and
    international sales, use, occupancy, value-added and other tax
    laws, rules and regulations to our historical and new products
    and services is subject to interpretation by the applicable
    taxing authorities. Many of the fundamental statutes and
    regulations that impose these taxes were established before the
    growth of the internet and

e-commerce.

If the tax laws, rules and regulations were amended or if
    current laws are interpreted adversely to our interests,
    particularly with respect to occupancy or value-added taxes, the
    results could decrease the demand for our products and services
    if we pass on such costs to the consumer, increase our tax
    payments and/or subject us to penalties. As a result these
    changes could have an adverse affect on our businesses or
    financial performance. We continue to work with relevant tax
    authorities and legislators to clarify our obligations under
    existing, new and emerging laws and regulations. There have
    been, and will continue to be, substantial ongoing costs
    associated with complying with the various indirect tax
    requirements in the numerous markets in which we conduct or will
    conduct business.

Our international operations involve risks relating to
    differing customs and cultures as well as commercial and
    regulatory environments.

We operate in a number of jurisdictions outside of the United
    States and intend to continue to expand our international
    presence. In order to achieve widespread acceptance in the
    countries and markets we enter, we must continue to tailor our
    services to the unique customs and cultures of such countries
    and markets. Learning the customs and cultures of various
    countries, particularly with respect to travel patterns and
    practices, can be difficult, costly and divert management and
    personnel resources. Our failure to learn such customs and
    cultures successfully could slow our international growth.

We expect to continue to face additional risks in international
    operations. These risks include political instability,
    threatened or actual acts of terrorism, unexpected changes in
    regulatory requirements, our ability to comply with additional
    U.S. and local laws and regulations, increased risk and limits
    on our ability to enforce intellectual property rights, slower
    adoption of the internet as an advertising and commerce medium
    in those markets as compared to the United States and
    difficulties in managing operations due to distance, language
    and cultural differences, including issues associated with
    establishing management systems and infrastructures and staffing
    and managing foreign operations.

We have foreign exchange risk.

As a result of our international websites and acquisitions, we
    conduct a significant and growing portion of our business
    outside the United States. Further, due to the nature of our
    operations and our corporate structure, we have subsidiaries
    that have significant transactions in foreign currencies other
    than their functional currency. As a result, we face exposure to
    movements in currency exchange rates, particularly those related
    to the British Pound Sterling, the Euro, Canadian dollar and
    Chinese Renminbi. Foreign exchange rate fluctuations may
    adversely impact our results of operations as exchange rate
    fluctuations on transactions denominated in currencies other
    than the functional currency results in gains and losses that
    are reflected in our consolidated statements of operations.
    Additionally, the results of operations of our foreign
    subsidiaries are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations
    as the financial results of our foreign subsidiaries are
    translated from local currency into U.S. dollars upon
    consolidation. If the U.S. dollar weakens against the local
    currency, the translation of these foreign-currency-denominated
    balances will result in increased net assets, net revenues,
    operating expenses, net income or loss as well as decreased cash
    flows from operations. Similarly, our net assets, net revenues,
    operating expenses, and net income or loss will decrease if the
    U.S. dollar strengthens against the local currency.



Our investment in eLong creates risks and uncertainties
    relating to the laws of the People’s Republic of China.

The success of our investment in eLong, a company organized
    under Cayman law, whose principal business is the operation of
    an internet-based travel business in the People’s Republic
    of China, is subject to risks and uncertainties regarding the
    interpretation of China’s laws and regulations. The Chinese
    legal system is a civil law system based on written statutes.
    Unlike common law systems, it is a system in which decided legal
    cases have limited value as precedent. The lack of precedent
    causes the interpretation and enforcement of Chinese law to
    involve uncertainties that could limit the available legal
    protections. In addition, we cannot predict the effect of future
    developments in China’s legal system, particularly with
    respect to the travel industry, the internet, foreign investment
    or licensing, including the introduction of new laws, changes to
    existing laws or the interpretation or enforcement of current or
    future laws and regulations, or the preemption of local
    regulations by national laws. In addition, the laws and
    regulations of China restrict foreign investment in the
    air-ticketing, travel agency, internet content provision and
    advertising businesses. Such laws and regulations require that
    we establish effective control through a series of agreements
    with eLong’s affiliated Chinese entities and could restrict
    our ability to engage in desirable strategic transactions.
    Finally, China does not have treaties with the United States or
    most other western countries providing for the reciprocal
    recognition and enforcement of judgment of courts. As a result,
    court judgments obtained in jurisdictions with which China does
    not have treaties on reciprocal recognition of judgment and in
    relation to any matter not subject to a binding arbitration
    provision may be difficult or impossible to be enforced in China.

Our processing, storage, use and disclosure of personal data
    could give rise to liabilities as a result of governmental
    regulation, conflicting legal requirements, differing views of
    personal privacy rights, or data security breaches.

In the processing of our traveler transactions, we receive and
    store a large volume of personally identifiable information.
    This information is increasingly subject to legislation and
    regulations in numerous jurisdictions around the world. This
    government action is typically intended to protect the privacy
    and security of personal information that is collected,
    processed and transmitted in or from the governing jurisdiction.
    We could be adversely affected if legislation or regulations are
    expanded to require changes in our business practices or if
    governing jurisdictions interpret or implement their legislation
    or regulations in ways that negatively affect our business,
    financial condition and results of operations. As privacy and
    data protection have become more sensitive issues, we may also
    become exposed to potential liabilities as a result of differing
    views on the privacy of travel data.

We cannot guarantee that our security measures will prevent data
    breaches. Substantial data breaches could significantly harm our
    business, damage our reputation, expose us to a risk of loss or
    litigation and possible liability

and/or

cause
    customers and potential customers to lose confidence in our
    security, which would have a negative effect on the value of our
    brands.

These and other privacy and security developments that are
    difficult to anticipate could adversely affect our business,
    financial condition and results of operations.

Our business could be negatively affected by changes in
    search engine algorithms and dynamics.

We utilize internet search engines, principally through the
    purchase of travel-related keywords, to generate traffic to our
    websites. In a similar way, a significant amount of our European
    business is directed to our own websites through participation
    in

pay-per-click

advertising campaigns on internet search engines whose pricing
    and operating dynamics can experience rapid change both
    technically and competitively. If a major search engine changes
    its algorithms in a manner that further negatively affects the
    search engine ranking of us or our third-party distribution
    partners or changes its pricing, operating or competitive
    dynamics in a negative manner, our business and financial
    performance would be adversely affected.



We cannot be sure that our intellectual property is protected
    from copying or use by others, including potential
    competitors.

Our websites rely on content and technology intellectual
    property, much of which we regard as proprietary. We protect our
    proprietary technology by relying on trademarks, copyrights,
    trade secret laws and confidentiality agreements. In connection
    with our license agreements with third-parties, we seek to
    control access to and distribution of our technology,
    documentation and other proprietary information. Even with all
    of these precautions, it is possible for someone else to copy or
    otherwise obtain and use our proprietary technology without our
    authorization or to develop similar technology independently.
    Effective trademark, copyright and trade secret protection may
    not be available in every country in which our services are made
    available through the internet, and policing unauthorized use of
    our proprietary information is difficult and expensive. We
    cannot be sure that the steps we have taken will prevent
    misappropriation of our proprietary information. This
    misappropriation could have a material adverse effect on our
    business. In the future, we may need to go to court to enforce
    our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets
    or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights
    of others. This litigation might result in substantial costs and
    diversion of resources and management attention.

We currently license from third-parties some of the technologies
    incorporated into our websites. As we continue to introduce new
    services that incorporate new technologies, we may be required
    to license additional technology. We cannot be sure that such
    technology licenses will be available on commercially reasonable
    terms, if at all.

Part I. Item 3.

Legal
    Proceedings

In the ordinary course of business, Expedia and its subsidiaries
    are parties to legal proceedings and claims involving property,
    personal injury, contract, alleged infringement of third-party
    intellectual property rights and other claims. The amounts that
    may be recovered in such matters may be subject to insurance
    coverage.

Rules of the SEC require the description of material pending
    legal proceedings, other than ordinary, routine litigation
    incident to the registrant’s business, and advise that
    proceedings ordinarily need not be described if they primarily
    involve damages claims for amounts (exclusive of interest and
    costs) not individually exceeding 10% of the current assets of
    the registrant and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. In
    the judgment of management, none of the pending litigation
    matters which the Company and its subsidiaries are defending,
    including those described below, involves or is likely to
    involve amounts of that magnitude. The litigation matters
    described below are as of December 31, 2006, and involve
    issues or claims that may be of particular interest to our
    stockholders, regardless of whether any of these matters may be
    material to our financial position or results of operations
    based upon the standard set forth in the SEC’s rules.



Securities
    Class Action Litigation against IAC.

Beginning on September 20, 2004, twelve purported
    shareholder class actions were commenced in the United States
    District Court for the Southern District of New York against IAC
    and certain of its officers and directors, alleging violations
    of the federal securities laws. These cases arose out of
    IAC’s August 4, 2004 announcement of its earnings for
    the second quarter of 2004 and generally alleged that the value
    of the Company’s stock was artificially inflated by
    pre-announcement statements about its financial results and
    forecasts that were false and misleading due to the
    defendants’ alleged failure to disclose various problems
    faced by IAC’s travel businesses. On December 20,
    2004, the district court consolidated the twelve lawsuits,
    appointed co-lead plaintiffs, and designated co-lead
    plaintiffs’ counsel. See

In re IAC/InterActiveCorp
    Securities Litigation,

No. 04-CV-7447

(S.D.N.Y.). Expedia is not a party to this litigation, however,
    under the terms of its Separation Agreement with IAC, Expedia
    has generally agreed to bear a portion of the costs and
    liabilities, if any, associated with any securities law
    litigation relating to conduct prior to the Spin-Off of the
    businesses or entities that comprise Expedia following the
    Spin-Off.

On October 18, 2004, a related shareholder derivative
    action,

Stuart Garber, Derivatively on Behalf of
    IAC/InterActiveCorp v. Barry Diller et al.

,

No. 04-603416,

was commenced in the Supreme Court of the State of New York (New
    York County) against certain of IAC’s officers and
    directors. On November 15, 2004, another related
    shareholder derivative action,

Lisa Butler, Derivatively on
    Behalf of IAC/InterActiveCorp v. Barry Diller
    et al.

,

No. 04-CV-9067,

was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern
    District of New York against certain of IAC’s current and
    former directors. On January 24, 2005, the federal district
    court consolidated the

Butler

case with the securities
    class action for pre-trial purposes only. On April 11,
    2005, the district court issued a similar consolidation order in
    respect of the

Garber

case.

On July 5, 2005, the plaintiffs in the related shareholder
    suits filed a consolidated shareholder derivative complaint
    against IAC (as a nominal defendant) and sixteen current or
    former officers or directors of IAC or its former travel
    business. The complaint, which is based upon factual allegations
    similar to those in the securities class action, purports to
    assert claims for breach of fiduciary duty, abuse of control,
    gross mismanagement, waste of corporate assets, unjust
    enrichment, violation of Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act,
    and contribution and indemnification. The complaint seeks an
    order voiding the election of the IAC’s current Board of
    Directors, as well as damages in an unspecified amount, various
    forms of equitable relief, restitution, and disgorgement of
    remuneration received by the individual defendants from IAC.

On September 15, 2005, IAC and the other defendants filed
    motions to dismiss both the securities class action and the
    shareholder derivative suits. On November 30, 2005, the
    plaintiffs filed their opposition to the motions. On
    January 6, 2006, the defendants filed reply papers in
    further support of the motions. Both motions to dismiss remain
    pending. On October 12, 2006, the Court heard oral argument
    on the motions to dismiss, but has not yet issued a ruling on
    those motions.

Expedia believes that the claims in the class action and
    derivative suits lack merit and that the claims will be
    vigorously defended.

Litigation
    Relating to the IAC/Hotels.com Merger Agreement

A putative class action on behalf of Hotels.com stockholders was
    filed in the Delaware Chancery Court against Hotels.com, IAC,
    and members of the Board of Directors of Hotels.com on
    April 10, 2003, the day of the announcement of the
    IAC/Hotels.com merger agreement.

See Michael Garvey, on
    Behalf of Himself and All Others Similarly Situated v.
    Jonathan F. Miller et al

.,

No. 20248-NC

(New Castle County). Also on April 10, 2003, the plaintiff
    in a purported shareholder derivative action on behalf of
    Hotels.com filed an amended complaint to include class
    allegations regarding the merger transaction.

See Alex
    Solodovnikov, Derivatively on Behalf of Hotels.com v.
    Robert Diener et al.

,

No. 03-02663

(District Court, 160th Judicial District, Dallas County).
    In addition, on April 17, 2003, the plaintiffs in a
    consolidated action pending in the Delaware Chancery Court,
    which had consolidated a number of putative class actions filed
    against Hotels.com, IAC and members of the Board of Directors of
    Hotels.com as a result of IAC’s announcement in June 2002
    of its intention to enter into a Hotels.com acquisition
    transaction, filed a consolidated and amended

class-action

complaint.

See In re Hotels.com Shareholders Litigation,

No. 16662-NC

(New Castle County). Pursuant to an



agreement among the parties, the defendants’ time to
    respond to this complaint and to the complaint in the

Garvey

case has been adjourned indefinitely. The complaints in
    these three actions allege, in essence, that the defendants
    breached their fiduciary duties to Hotels.com’s public
    shareholders by entering into

and/or

approving the merger agreement, which allegedly did not reflect
    the true value of Hotels.com. Expedia believes that the
    allegations in these lawsuits are without merit and will
    continue to defend vigorously against them.

Litigation
    Relating to Hotels.com’s Guidance for the Fourth Quarter of

Securities Class Action.

On
    January 10, 2003, a putative class action,

Daniel
    Taubenfeld et al., on Behalf of Themselves and All Others
    Similarly Situated v. Hotels.com et al.

,

No. 3:03-CV-0069-N,

was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern
    District of Texas, arising out of Hotels.com’s downward
    revision of its guidance for the fourth quarter of 2002. Three
    other substantially similar securities class actions were filed
    in the same court shortly thereafter and were later consolidated
    with the Taubenfeld action. The lead plaintiffs in this action
    filed a consolidated

class-action

complaint on August 18, 2003 alleging violations of federal
    securities laws against Hotels.com and three of its former
    executives. On September 27, 2004, the district court
    dismissed all of the plaintiffs’ claims with prejudice,
    with the exception of two claims involving statements by
    analysts. On August 10, 2005 the United States Court of
    Appeals for the Fifth Circuit entered an order dismissing the
    plaintiffs’ appeal of the district court’s ruling with
    prejudice.

Shareholder Derivative Suit.

The action

In
    re Hotels.com Derivative Litigation,

No. 3:03-CV-501-K,

pending in United States District Court for the Northern
    District of Texas arises out of the same events as the

Taubenfeld

action and consolidated two shareholder
    derivative actions,

Anita Pomilo Wilson, Derivatively on
    Behalf of Nominal Defendant Hotels.com v. Elan J. Blutinger
    et al

.,

No. 3:03-CV-0501-K,

and

Alex Solodovnikov, Derivatively on Behalf of
    Hotels.com v. Robert Diener et al

.,

No. 3:03-CV-0812-K,

originally filed in Texas state court on January 14, 2003
    and March 14, 2003, respectively. On April 26, 2004,
    the lead plaintiff filed a consolidated amended complaint
    against Hotels.com (as a nominal defendant only) and sixteen
    current or former directors of Hotels.com. The amended complaint
    alleges breach of fiduciary duty, abuse of control, gross
    mismanagement, waste of corporate assets and unjust enrichment.
    The lawsuit seeks damages, restitution and disgorgement of
    profits in an unspecified amount and imposition of a
    constructive trust in favor of Hotels.com on the profits
    obtained by the selling defendants on their sales of Hotels.com
    stock during a specified period. On March 7, 2005, the
    district court issued orders staying the case until further
    notice and directing that the case be administratively closed
    pending a decision in the appeal of the Taubenfeld action. On
    August 17, 2005, after the Taubenfeld appeal was dismissed,
    the defendants filed a motion for a pretrial conference with the
    Court giving notice of the Taubenfeld dismissal. The lead
    plaintiffs responded to the motion on September 7, 2005 and
    the defendants filed their reply on September 15, 2005. The
    Court held a pretrial conference on April 13, 2006 and
    dismissed the derivative claims with prejudice and allowed
    deposition discovery on the claim that the price paid by IAC for
    Hotels.com was unfair. On July 18, 2006, the plaintiff
    agreed to dismiss his lawsuit in exchange for an agreement that
    each side would bear its own costs. On October 25, 2006,
    the Court dismissed the lawsuit.

Litigation
    Relating to Hotel Occupancy Taxes

Hotels.com.

On June 20, 2003, a purported
    class action was filed in Texas state court against certain
    Hotels.com-affiliated entities (“Hotels.com”).

See
    Nora J. Olvera, Individually and on Behalf of All Others
    Similarly Situated v. Hotels.com, Inc.

,

No. DC-03-259

(District Court, 229th Judicial District, Duval County).
    The complaint and subsequent amended complaints filed
    August 12, 2003 and May 6, 2004, allege that
    Hotels.com collects “excess” hotel occupancy taxes
    from consumers (i.e., allegedly charges consumers more for
    occupancy taxes than it pays to the hotels for the hotels’
    use in satisfying their obligations to the taxing authorities).
    The complaint sought certification of a nationwide class of all
    persons who have purchased hotel accommodations from Hotels.com
    since June 20, 1999, as well as restitution of,
    disgorgement of, and the imposition of a constructive trust upon
    all “excess” occupancy taxes allegedly collected by
    Hotels.com. On September 25, 2003, the plaintiff filed a
    demand for arbitration containing substantially the same factual



allegations as the

Olvera

lawsuit. On September 2,
    2004, the arbitrator issued a final award granting
    Hotels.com’s motion to dismiss the arbitration claim.

On May 6, 2003, a purported class action was filed in Texas
    state court against Hotels.com, L.P. (“Hotels.com”),

Mary Canales, Individually and on Behalf of All Others
    Similarly Situated v. Hotels.com, L.P

.,

No. DC-03-162

(District Court, 229th Judicial District, Duval County).
    The complaint, as amended, alleges that Hotels.com charges
    customers “taxes” that exceed the amount required by
    or paid to the applicable taxing authorities and that Hotels.com
    charges customers “fees” that do not correspond to any
    specific services provided. The complaint seeks restitution of,
    disgorgement of, and the imposition of a constructive trust upon
    all “excess” occupancy taxes allegedly collected by
    Hotels.com. On April 29, 2005, the court issued an order
    granting the plaintiff’s motion for class certification. On
    February 1, 2006, the court of appeals reversed the holding

Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations

Overview

Expedia, Inc. is an online travel company, empowering business
    and leisure travelers with the tools and information they need
    to efficiently research, plan, book and experience travel. We
    have created a global travel marketplace used by a broad range
    of leisure and corporate travelers and offline retail travel
    agents. We make available, on a stand-alone and package basis,
    travel products and services provided by numerous airlines,
    lodging properties, car rental companies, destination service
    providers, cruise lines and other travel product and service
    companies. For additional information about our portfolio of
    brands, see the disclosure set forth in Part I,
    Item 1, Business, under the caption “Management
    Overview.”

Trends

The travel industry, which includes travel agencies and travel
    suppliers has been characterized by rapid and significant
    change. The U.S. airline sector has experienced significant
    turmoil in recent years, with several of the largest airlines
    seeking the protection of Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings.



The need to rationalize high fixed cost structures to better
    compete with low cost carriers offering “no frills”
    flights at discounted prices, as well as jet fuel inflation have
    caused the airlines to recently consider a series of merger
    opportunities to better share fixed costs and reduce redundant
    flight routes. In addition, carriers have aggressively pursued
    cost reductions in every aspect of their operations. These cost
    reduction efforts include distribution costs, which the airlines
    have pursued by increasing direct distribution through their
    proprietary websites, as well as seeking to reduce travel agent
    commissions and overrides. The airlines have also generally
    successfully reduced their fees with the GDS intermediaries as
    their contracts with the GDSs expired in mid to late 2006. These
    reductions impacted offline and online travel agents as large
    agencies, including Expedia, have historically received a
    meaningful portion of their air remuneration from GDS providers.

In addition, the U.S. airline industry has experienced
    increased load factors and ticket prices. At the same time, the
    airline carriers which participate in the Expedia marketplace
    have been reducing their relative flight capacities; while the
    lower cost carriers that are largely replacing this capacity
    generally do not currently participate in the Expedia
    marketplace. These trends have affected our ability to obtain
    inventory in our agency and merchant air businesses, reduced
    discounts for merchant air tickets and limited supply of
    merchant air tickets for use in our package travel offerings.

As a result of these industry dynamics and reduced economics
    stemming from recently negotiated GDS and airline agreements,
    Expedia’s air revenue per ticket has declined significantly
    since the fourth quarter of 2004, and we anticipate it will
    continue to decline further in 2007.

The hotel sector has recently been characterized by robust
    demand and constrained supply, resulting in increasing occupancy
    rates and average daily rates (“ADR”). Industry
    experts expect demand growth to continue to outstrip supply
    through at least 2007. While increasing ADRs generally have a
    positive effect on our merchant hotel operations as our
    remuneration increases proportionally with the room price,
    higher ADRs can impact underlying demand, and higher occupancies
    can restrict our ability to obtain merchant hotel room
    allocation, particularly in high occupancy destinations popular
    with our travel base, including Orlando, Las Vegas and New York.
    Higher occupancies also have historically tended to drive lower
    margins as hotel room suppliers have less need for third-party
    intermediaries to meet demand. A large number of our contracts
    with major chain hotel operators are scheduled for renewal in
    2007.

Increased usage and familiarity with the internet has driven
    rapid growth in online penetration of travel expenditures.
    According to PhoCusWright, an independent travel, tourism and
    hospitality research firm, in 2006 49% of leisure, unmanaged and
    corporate travel expenditures occurred online in the United
    States, compared with 22% of European travel and 12% in the Asia
    Pacific region. These penetration rates have increased
    considerably over the past few years, and are expected to
    continue growing.

In addition to the growth of online travel agencies, airlines
    and lodging companies have aggressively pursued direct online
    distribution of their products and services over the last
    several years, with supplier growth outpacing online growth
    since 2002. Differentiation among the various website offerings
    have narrowed in the past several years, and the travel
    landscape has grown extremely competitive, with the need for
    competitors to generally differentiate their offerings on a
    feature other than price.

Strategy

We play a fundamental role in facilitating travel, whether for
    leisure or business. We are committed to providing our travelers
    with the best set of resources to serve their travel needs by
    taking advantage of our critical assets — our brand
    portfolio, our technologies and continuous innovation, our
    global reach, and our breadth of product offering. In doing so,
    we take advantage of our growing base of knowledge about our
    destinations, suppliers and travelers based on our unique
    position in the travel value chain.

A discussion of the critical assets that we leverage in
    achieving our business strategy follows:

Portfolio of Travel Brands.

We seek to appeal
    to the broadest possible range of travelers and suppliers
    through our collection of industry-leading brands. We target
    several different demographics, from the value-conscious
    traveler through our Hotwire brand to luxury travelers seeking a
    high-touch, customized vacation



package through our Classic Vacations brand. We believe our
    flagship Expedia brand appeals to the broadest range of
    travelers, with our extensive product offering and facilitation
    of single item bookings of discounted product to complex
    bundling of higher-end travel packages. Our Hotels.com site and
    its international versions target travelers with premium content
    about lodging properties, and generally appeal to travelers with
    shorter booking windows who prefer to drive to their
    destinations.

Technologies and Continuous
    Innovation.

Expedia has an established tradition
    of innovation, from Expedia.com’s inception as a division
    of Microsoft, to our introduction of more recent innovations
    such as our ThankYou Rewards Network offered in conjunction with
    Citigroup,
    Expedia

®

Fare Alerts, Travel
    Ticker

tm

by
    Hotwire

®

,
    TripAdvisor’s wikis and ECT’s business intelligence
    toolset.

We intend to continue to aggressively innovate on behalf of our
    travelers and suppliers, including our current efforts in
    building a scaleable, extensible, service-oriented technology
    platform for our travelers, which will extend across our
    portfolio of brands. We expect this to result in improved
    flexibility and faster go-forward innovation. This transition
    should allow us to improve our site merchandising, browse and
    search functionality and add significant personalization
    features. We expect this transition to occur in a phased
    approach, with portions of our worldwide points of sale
    migrating to the new platform beginning in 2007. For our
    suppliers, we have developed proprietary, supplier-oriented
    technology that streamlines the interaction between some of our
    websites and hotel central reservation systems, making it easier
    and more cost-effective for hotels to manage reservations made
    through our brands. We are planning to offer more streamlined
    application programming interfaces for our lodging partners in
    2007, to enable faster and simpler integration of real-time
    hotel content.

Global Reach.

In 2006, our international gross
    bookings accounted for approximately 26% of worldwide gross
    bookings and 28% of revenue. We currently operate over 50
    branded points of sale across the globe, including
    Expedia-branded sites in the United States, Australia, Canada,
    Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway,
    Sweden and the United Kingdom. Our Hotels.com and TripAdvisor
    brands also maintain both U.S. points of sale and
    additional points of sale outside the United States. Lastly, we
    offer Chinese travelers a wide array of products and services
    through our majority ownership in eLong.

We intend to continue investing in and growing our existing
    international points of sale, including the expected launch of
    an Expedia-branded site in India in 2007. We anticipate
    launching points of sale in additional countries where we find
    large travel markets and rapid growth of online commerce.

ECT currently conducts operations in the United States, Belgium,
    Canada, France, Germany and the United Kingdom. We believe the
    corporate travel sector represents a large opportunity for
    Expedia, and we believe we offer a compelling technology
    solution to small and medium-sized businesses seeking to control
    travel costs and improve their employees’ travel
    experiences. We intend to continue investing in and expanding
    the geographic footprint of our ECT business.

In expanding our global reach, we are leveraging our significant
    investment in technology, operations, brand building, supplier
    integration and relationships and other areas since the launch
    of Expedia.com in 1996. We intend to continue leveraging this
    investment when launching new countries, introducing website
    features, adding supplier products and services or adding
    value-added content for travelers.

Breadth of Product Offering.

In general,
    through our websites, we believe we offer a comprehensive array
    of innovative travel products and services to travelers. We plan
    to continue improving and growing these offerings, as well as
    expand them to our worldwide points of sale over time.

The majority of our revenue comes from transactions involving
    the sale of airline tickets and the booking of hotel
    reservations, either as stand-alone products or as part of
    package transactions. We are working to grow our package
    business as it results in higher revenue per transaction, and we
    also seek to continue diversifying our revenue mix beyond core
    air and hotel products to car rental, destination services,
    cruise and other product offerings, as well as by increasing the
    mix of revenue from advertising we derive from our travel
    partners and suppliers.



Seasonality

We generally experience seasonal fluctuations in the demand for
    our travel products and services. For example, traditional
    leisure travel bookings are generally the highest in the first
    three quarters as travelers plan and book their spring, summer
    and holiday travel. The number of bookings decreases in the
    fourth quarter. Because revenue in the merchant business is
    generally recognized when the travel takes place rather than
    when it is booked, revenue typically lags bookings by several
    weeks or longer. As a result, revenue is typically the lowest in
    the first quarter and highest in the third quarter. The
    continued growth of our international operations or a change in
    our product mix may influence the typical trend of our
    seasonality in the future.

Critical
    Accounting Policies and Estimates

Critical accounting policies and estimates are those that we
    believe are important in the preparation of our consolidated
    financial statements because they require that we use judgment
    and estimates in applying those policies. We prepare our
    consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in
    accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the
    United States (“GAAP”). Preparation of the
    consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes
    requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the
    reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of
    contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the
    consolidated financial statements as well as revenue and
    expenses during the periods reported. We base our estimates on
    historical experience, where applicable, and other assumption
    that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Actual
    results may differ from our estimates under different
    assumptions or conditions.

There are certain critical estimates that we believe require
    significant judgment in the preparation of our consolidated
    financial statements. We consider an accounting estimate to be
    critical if:

•

It requires us to make assumption because information was not
    available at the time or it included matters that were highly
    uncertain at the time we were making the estimate; and

•

Changes in the estimate or different estimates that we could
    have selected may have had a material impact on our financial
    condition or results of operations.

For more information on each of these policies, see
    Note 2 — Significant Accounting Policies, in the
    notes to consolidated financial statements. We discuss
    information about the nature and rationale for our critical
    accounting estimates below.

Accounting
    for Certain Merchant Revenue

We accrue the cost of certain merchant revenue based on the
    amount we expect from suppliers’ invoices. In certain
    instances when a supplier invoices us for less than the cost we
    accrued, we generally recognize those amounts as revenue six
    months in arrears, net of an allowance, when we determine it is
    not probable that we will be required to pay the supplier, based
    on historical experience and contract terms. Actual revenue
    could be greater or lower than the amounts estimated due to
    changes in hotel billing practices or changes in traveler
    behavior.

Marketing
    Promotions

We periodically provide incentive offers to our customers to
    encourage booking of travel products and services, which include
    inducement offers. Inducement offers include discounts granted
    at the time of a current purchase to be applied against a future
    qualifying purchase. We treat inducement offers as a reduction
    to revenue based on estimated future redemption rates. We
    allocate the discount amount between the current purchase and
    the potential future purchase based on our expected relative
    value of the transactions. We estimate our redemption rates
    using our historical experience for similar inducement offers,
    and the amounts we record as a reduction to revenue on current
    purchases could vary significantly based on the redemption
    estimates used.



Recoverability
    of Goodwill and Indefinite and Definite-Lived Intangible
    Assets

Goodwill.

We assess goodwill for impairment
    annually as of October 1, or more frequently, if events and
    circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred. The
    impairment test requires us to estimate the fair value of our
    reporting units. If the carrying value of the reporting unit
    exceeds the fair value, the goodwill of the reporting unit is
    potentially impaired and we proceed to step two of the
    impairment analysis. In step two of the analysis, we will record
    an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying value of
    the reporting unit’s goodwill over its implied fair value
    should such a circumstance arise.

We generally base our measurement of fair value of reporting
    units on a blended analysis of the present value of future
    discounted cash flows and market valuation approach. The
    discounted cash flows model indicates the fair value of the
    reporting units based on the present value of the cash flows
    that we expect the reporting units to generate in the future.
    Our significant estimates in the discounted cash flows model
    include: our weighted average cost of capital; long-term rate of
    growth and profitability of our business; working capital
    effects; and effective income tax rate. The market valuation
    approach indicates the fair value of the business based on a
    comparison of the company to comparable firms in similar lines
    of business that are publicly traded. Our significant estimates
    in the market approach model include identifying similar
    companies with comparable business factors such as size, growth,
    profitability, risk and return on investment and assessing
    comparable revenue and operating income multiples in estimating
    the fair value of the reporting units.

We believe the weighted use of discounted cash flows and market
    approach is the best method for determining the fair value of
    our reporting units because:

•

It excludes the impact of short-term volatility;

•

It includes all information available to management, which is
    generally more than that is available to the external capital
    markets;

•

Both models are the most common valuation methodologies used
    within the travel industry; and

•

The blended use of both models compensate for the inherent risks
    associated with each model if used on a stand-alone basis.

The use of different estimates or assumptions in determining the
    fair value of our goodwill may result in different values for
    these assets, which could result in an impairment.

Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets.

We base
    our measurement of fair value of indefinite-lived intangible
    assets, which primarily consist of trade name and trademarks,
    using the

relief-from-royalty

method. This method assumes that the trade name and trademarks
    have value to the extent that their owner is relieved of the
    obligation to pay royalties for the benefits received from them.
    This method requires us to estimate the future revenue for the
    related brands, the appropriate royalty rate and the weighted
    average cost of capital.

The use of different estimates or assumptions in determining the
    fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets may result
    in different values for these assets, which could result in an
    impairment.

Definite-Lived Intangible Assets.

We review
    the carrying value of long-lived assets to be used in operations
    whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
    carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable. Factors
    that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a
    significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an
    asset is used, a significant adverse change in legal factors or
    the business climate that could affect the value of the asset,
    or a significant decline in the observable market value of an
    asset, among others. If such facts indicate a potential
    impairment, an impairment loss would only be recorded if the
    asset’s carrying amount is not recoverable through its
    undiscounted cash flows. Any impairment would be measured as the
    difference between the asset’s carrying amount and
    estimated fair value, determined using appropriate valuation
    methodologies which would typically include an estimate of
    discounted cash flows. Our impairment analysis is based on
    available information and on assumptions and projections that we
    consider to be reasonable and supportable. This analysis
    requires us to estimate current and future cash flows



attributable to the group of assets, the time period for which
    they will be held and used as well as a discount rate to
    incorporate the time value of money and the risks inherent in
    future cash flows.

The use of different estimates or assumptions in determining the
    fair value of our definite-lived intangible assets may result in
    different values for these assets, which could result in an
    impairment.

Income
    Taxes

In accordance with SFAS No. 109,

Accounting for Income
    Taxes

, we record income taxes under the liability method.
    Deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect our estimation of
    the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the
    carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for book and tax
    purposes. We determine deferred income taxes based on the
    differences in accounting methods and timing between financial
    statement and income tax reporting. Accordingly, we determine
    the deferred tax asset or liability for each temporary
    difference based on the tax rates that we expect will be in
    effect when we realize the underlying items of income and
    expense. We consider many factors when assessing the likelihood
    of future realization of our deferred tax assets, including our
    recent earnings experience by jurisdiction, expectations of
    future taxable income, and the carryforward periods available to
    us for tax reporting purposes, as well as other relevant
    factors. We may establish a valuation allowance to reduce
    deferred tax assets to the amount we believe is more likely than
    not to be realized. Due to inherent complexities arising from
    the nature of our businesses, future changes in income tax law,
    tax sharing agreements or variances between our actual and
    anticipated operating results, we make certain judgments and
    estimates. Therefore, actual income taxes could materially vary
    from these estimates.

Other
    Long-Term Liabilities

Various Legal and Tax Contingencies.

We record
    liabilities to address potential exposures related to business
    and tax positions we have taken that have been or could be
    challenged by taxing authorities. In addition, we record
    liabilities associated with legal proceedings and lawsuits.
    These liabilities are recorded when the likelihood of payment is
    probable and the amounts can be reasonably estimated. The
    determination for required liabilities is based upon analysis of
    each individual tax issue, or legal proceeding, taking into
    consideration the likelihood of adverse judgments and the range
    of possible loss. In addition, our analysis may be based on
    discussions with outside legal counsel. The ultimate resolution
    of these potential tax exposures and legal proceedings may be
    greater or less than the liabilities recorded.

Occupancy Tax.

Some states and localities
    impose a transient occupancy or accommodation tax, or a form of
    sales tax, on the use or occupancy of hotel accommodations.
    Generally, hotels charge taxes based on the room rate paid to
    the hotel and remit these taxes to the various tax authorities.
    When a customer books a room through one of our travel services,
    we collect a tax recovery charge from the customer which we pay
    to the hotel. We do not collect or remit occupancy taxes, nor do
    we pay occupancy taxes to the hotel operator on the portion of
    the customer payment we retain. Some jurisdictions have
    questioned our practice in this regard. While the applicable tax
    provisions vary among the jurisdictions, we generally believe
    that we are not required to collect and remit such occupancy
    taxes. We are engaged in discussions with tax authorities in
    various jurisdictions to resolve this issue. Some tax
    authorities have brought lawsuits asserting that we are required
    to collect and remit occupancy tax. The ultimate resolution in
    all jurisdictions cannot be determined at this time.

We have established a reserve for the potential settlement of
    issues related to hotel occupancy taxes for prior and current
    periods, consistent with applicable accounting principles and in
    light of all current facts and circumstances. A variety of
    factors could affect the amount of the liability (both past and
    future), which factors include, but are not limited to, the
    number of, and amount of revenue represented by, jurisdictions
    that ultimately assert a claim and prevail in assessing such
    additional tax or negotiate a settlement and changes in relevant
    statutes.

We note that there are more than 7,000 taxing jurisdictions in
    the United States, and it is not feasible to analyze the
    statutes, regulations and judicial and administrative rulings in
    every jurisdiction. Rather, we have obtained the advice of state
    and local tax experts with respect to tax laws of certain states
    and local jurisdictions that represent a large portion of our
    hotel revenue. Many of the fundamental statutes and



regulations that impose these taxes were established before the
    growth of the internet and

e-commerce.

It is possible that some jurisdictions may introduce new
    legislation regarding the imposition of occupancy taxes on
    businesses that arrange the booking of hotel accommodations. We
    continue to work with the relevant tax authorities and
    legislators to clarify our obligations under new and emerging
    laws and regulations. We will continue to monitor the issue
    closely and provide additional disclosure, as well as adjust the
    level of reserves, as developments warrant. Additionally,
    certain of our businesses are involved in occupancy tax related
    litigation which is discussed in Part I, Item 3, Legal
    Proceedings.

Stock-Based
    Compensation

We record stock-based compensation expense net of estimated
    forfeitures. In determining the estimated forfeiture rates for
    stock-based awards, we periodically conduct an assessment of the
    actual number of equity awards that have been forfeited to date
    as well as those expected to be forfeited in the future. We
    consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures,
    including the type of award, the employee class and historical
    experience. The estimate of stock awards that will ultimately be
    forfeited requires significant judgment and to the extent that
    actual results or updated estimates differ from our current
    estimates, such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative
    adjustment in the period such estimates are revised. In 2005, we
    recognized significant changes in estimates related to our
    forfeiture rate.

New
    Accounting Pronouncements

For a discussion of new accounting pronouncements, see
    Note 2 — Significant Accounting Policies, in the
    notes to consolidated financial statements.

Operating
    Metrics

Our operating results are affected by certain metrics that
    represent the selling activities generated by our travel
    products and services. As travelers have increased their use of
    the internet to book their travel arrangements, we have seen our
    gross bookings increase, reflecting the growth in the online
    travel industry and our business acquisitions. Gross bookings
    represent the total retail value of transactions booked for both
    agency and merchant transactions, recorded at the time of
    booking reflecting the total price due for travel, including
    taxes, fees and other charges, and are generally not reduced for
    cancellations and refunds.

Operating
    Metrics Reclassifications

For the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, we adjusted
    allocations for certain points of sale to conform to the current
    period presentation. The allocation adjustment impacted domestic
    and international gross bookings, revenue and revenue margin but
    did not impact gross bookings, revenue or revenue margin on a
    consolidated basis.

The increase in domestic and international gross bookings for
    2006 compared to 2005 was 6% and 26% and would have been 5% and
    29% under our prior allocation method. The change in domestic
    and international revenue for 2006 compared to 2005 was flat and
    an increase of 24% and would have been a decrease of 3% and an
    increase of 36% under our prior allocation method. The change in
    domestic and international revenue margin for 2006 compared to
    2005 was a decrease of 76 basis points and 19 basis points and
    would have been a decrease of 103 basis points and an increase
    of 75 basis points under the prior allocation method.

The allocation adjustment did not have an impact on the change
    in domestic and international gross bookings for 2005 compared
    to 2004. The increase in domestic and international revenue for
    2005 compared to 2004 was 7% and 50% versus 8% and 48% under our
    prior allocation method. The decline in domestic and
    international revenue margin for 2005 compared to 2004 was 100
    basis points and 4 basis points versus 90 basis points and 21
    basis points under the prior allocation method.

Gross bookings increased $1.6 billion, or 10%, in 2006

    compared to 2004. Gross bookings represent the total retail
    value of transactions recorded for both agency and merchant
    transactions, recorded at the time of booking. In 2006, domestic
    gross bookings increased 6% and international gross bookings
    increased 26% compared to 2005. In 2005, domestic gross bookings
    increased 15% and international gross bookings increased 50%
    compared to 2004. The increases in 2006 and 2005 were primarily
    due to increases in transaction volumes.

Revenue margin, which is defined as revenue as a percentage of
    gross bookings, decreased 59 basis points in 2006 compared
    to 2005. In 2006, revenue margin decreased 76 basis points
    in our domestic operations and 19 basis points in our
    international operations. The decline in worldwide revenue
    margin was primarily due to the decline in air revenue per
    ticket, coupled with an increase in average worldwide airfares
    of 9% for 2006 compared to 2005, as our remuneration generally
    does not vary with the price of the ticket. Revenue margin
    decreased 80 basis points in 2005 compared to 2004. The
    decrease was primarily due to a decrease in air revenue per
    ticket and hotel margins. In 2005, revenue margin decreased
    100 basis points in our domestic operations and
    4 basis points in our international operations.

In 2006, the increase in revenue was primarily driven by
    increased worldwide merchant hotel revenue, partially offset by
    a decline in our domestic air revenue. In 2006, domestic revenue
    growth remained flat and international revenue increased by 24%
    compared to 2005.

Worldwide merchant hotel revenue increased 13% in 2006 compared
    to 2005 primarily due to a 10% increase in room nights stayed,
    including rooms delivered as a component of vacation packages,
    as well as a 2% increase in revenue per room night. Revenue per
    room night increased due to a 6% increase in worldwide ADRs,
    partially offset by a decrease in hotel raw margins (defined as
    hotel net revenue as a percentage of hotel gross revenue). Our
    merchant hotel raw margins decreased in 2006 and 2005 as hotel
    room suppliers have taken advantage of higher occupancies and
    the efficacy of their own online distribution to negotiate more
    favorable terms.

Worldwide air revenue decreased 14% in 2006 compared to 2005 due
    to a 13% decrease in revenue per air ticket and a
    2% decrease in air tickets sold. The decrease in revenue
    per air ticket reflects decreased compensation from air carriers
    and GDS providers. The decrease in air tickets sold reflects the
    reduction in relative capacity of carriers participating in our
    marketplace and continued challenges in obtaining merchant air
    inventory in light of record industry load factors. Lesser
    availability of merchant air inventory also impacted our
    packages revenue, which grew only 1% in 2006 compared to 2005.



Other revenue, which includes car rental, destination services,
    cruise and advertising, increased by 7% in 2006 compared to 2005
    primarily due to an increase in advertising revenue.

In 2005, the increase in revenue was primarily due to increases
    in worldwide merchant hotel business, worldwide air revenue,
    growth in our car rental business and acquisitions. Worldwide
    merchant hotel revenue increased 10% in 2005 compared to 2004.
    The increase was primarily due to a 9% increase in room
    nights and a 1% increase in revenue per room night. The
    increase in revenue per room night was primarily due to a 7%
    increase in ADRs, partially offset by a contraction in hotel raw
    margins.

Worldwide air revenue increased 5% in 2005 compared to 2004.

Year-over-year,

air tickets sold increased by 17%, partially offset by an
    11% decrease in revenue per air ticket. The increase in air
    tickets sold is primarily due to the growth in domestic ticket
    sales while the decrease in revenue per air ticket resulted from
    less inventory allocation and lower discounting of merchant air
    tickets, as the industry experienced high load factors. Our
    packages revenue grew 16% in 2005 compared to 2004.

Other revenue increased by 57% in 2005 compared to 2004
    primarily due to acquisitions and growth in the car rental
    business. International revenue increased by 50% in 2005
    compared to 2004, primarily due to our acquisitions and
    continued growth from international websites.

Cost of revenue primarily consists of (1) costs of our data
    and call centers, including telesales, (2) credit card
    merchant fees, (3) fees paid to fulfillment vendors for
    processing airline tickets and related customer services,
    (4) costs paid to suppliers for certain destination
    inventory, (5) reserves and related payments to airlines
    for tickets purchased with fraudulent credit cards and
    (6) stock-based compensation.

The cost of revenue increase in 2006 compared to 2005 was
    primarily due to higher costs associated with the increase in
    transaction volumes. The cost of revenue increase in 2005
    compared to 2004 was primarily due to costs associated with an
    increase in transaction volumes and acquisitions, partially
    offset by lower stock-based compensation. Our 2005 stock-based
    compensation expense included a benefit related to changes in
    estimated forfeiture rates and capitalization of software
    development costs, partially offset by a modification charge on
    stock option awards related to the Spin-Off.

The year over year increases in gross profit are primarily due
    to the increases in revenue. Gross margin increased in 2006
    compared to 2005 primarily due to the increased mix of merchant
    hotel revenue, which has a higher gross margin than our overall
    business.

Selling and marketing expense relates to direct advertising and

    The remainder of the expense relates to indirect costs,
    including stock-based



compensation costs and market manager staffing in our Partner
    Services Group (“PSG”) and destination services.

In 2006, the increase in selling and marketing expenses was
    primarily due to growth in indirect PSG and destination services
    staffing costs. Direct selling and marketing expense grew 7% in
    2006.

In 2005, the increase in selling and marketing expense was
    primarily due to growth in personnel costs, including costs
    associated with the PSG team expansion and destination services
    staffing assumed in our acquisitions, partially offset by a
    decrease in offline marketing spend for certain businesses,
    keyword search efficiencies and a decrease in stock-based
    compensation costs. Selling and marketing expense in 2004
    includes a favorable adjustment for the reversal of
    $6.4 million associated with the resolution of a
    contractual dispute.

We expect absolute amounts spent on selling and marketing to
    increase in 2007. The direction of selling and marketing expense
    as a percentage of revenue in 2007 will primarily depend on our
    ability to drive efficiencies as well as geographic and product

General and administrative expense consists primarily of

    include our executive leadership, finance, legal, tax and human
    resource functions, (2) stock-based compensation costs and
    (3) fees for external professional services including
    legal, tax and accounting.

In 2006, the increase in general and administrative expense was
    primarily due to an increase in our headcount and accompanying
    compensation resulting from our being a stand-alone public
    company for the full year as well as increased legal expenses,
    partially offset by a decrease in stock-based compensation
    expense. Stock-based compensation expense decreased in 2006
    compared to 2005 primarily due to stock options that are
    completing their vesting cycles. We expect general and
    administrative expense to increase in absolute dollars but
    decrease as a percentage of revenue for 2007 versus 2006 as we
    have largely completed our overhead additions as a stand-alone
    public company.

In 2005, the increase in general and administrative expense was
    primarily due to acquisitions, an increase in our use of
    professional services and costs to build our executive teams and
    supporting staff levels largely in connection with being a
    stand-alone public company. In addition, we incurred one-time
    expenses specifically related to the Spin-Off. These increases
    were partially offset by a decrease in stock-based compensation.

Technology and content expense consists of expenses for

    software development costs, localization of our websites, and
    product development expenses such as personnel-related costs,
    including stock-based compensation.

The

year-over-year

expense increases were primarily due to growth in
    personnel-related expenses in our software development and
    engineering teams as we increase our level of website
    innovation, net of the capitalization of software development
    efforts that we began placing into service in the fourth quarter
    of 2006 and will continue to place into service in early 2007.
    The increase in 2005 was partially offset by a decrease in
    stock-based compensation costs.



Given our historical and ongoing investments in our enterprise
    data warehouse, new platform, geographic expansion, data
    centers, redundancy, call center technology, site merchandising,
    content management, site monitoring, networking, corporate
    travel, supplier integration and other initiatives, as well as
    the incremental amortization of capitalized software placed into

In 2006, amortization of intangibles expense decreased compared

    In 2005, amortization of intangibles expense was flat compared
    to 2004, because the amortization of intangibles related to new

    related to intangibles that were fully amortized.

Impairment
    of Intangible Asset

Based on lower than expected revenue growth in 2006, we
    determined that our indefinite lived trade name intangible asset
    related to Hotwire might be impaired during the third quarter of
    2006. Accordingly, we performed a valuation of that asset and
    determined that its carrying amount exceeded its fair value and

Amortization of non-cash distribution and marketing expense

    amortization of non-cash distribution and marketing expense
    compared to 2004 was due to a decline in the amount of
    television advertising that we used.

In 2006, the decrease in operating income was primarily due to
    the impairment charge of $47.0 million and higher selling
    and marketing and general and administrative expenses. These
    increases were partially offset by an increase in gross profit,
    lower amortization expense related to intangible assets and
    lower stock-based compensation.



In 2005, the increase in operating income was primarily due to
    increased revenue, which contributed to a higher gross profit,
    and a decrease in stock-based compensation due to changes in the
    estimated forfeiture rates used to determine stock-based
    compensation, partially offset by an increase in selling and
    marketing, general and administrative, and technology and
    content expense as discussed above. In 2005, operating income
    included a $79.7 million decrease to stock-based
    compensation expense mainly due the benefit of
    $44.7 million related to changes in estimated forfeiture
    rates and capitalization of software development costs,
    partially offset by a modification charge on stock option awards
    related to the Spin-Off. Operating income was favorably impacted
    in 2004 by a $12.1 million net reserve adjustment primarily
    related to the reversal of an air excise tax reserve and the
    resolution of a contractual dispute.

In 2006, the decrease in OIBA was primarily due to higher
    operating expenses, partially offset by higher revenue and the
    improvement in gross margin.

In 2005, the increase in OIBA was primarily due to increases in
    revenue that contributed to a higher gross profit, partially
    offset by increases in higher operating expenses.

Definition
    of OIBA

We provide OIBA as a supplemental measure to GAAP. We define
    OIBA as operating income plus: (1) amortization of non-cash
    distribution and marketing expense, (2) stock-based
    compensation expense, (3) amortization of intangible assets
    and goodwill and intangible asset impairment, if applicable and
    (4) certain one-time items, if applicable.

OIBA is the primary operating metric used by which management
    evaluates the performance of our business, on which internal
    budgets are based, and by which management is compensated.
    Management believes that investors should have access to the
    same set of tools that management uses to analyze our results.
    This non-GAAP measure should be considered in addition to
    results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be
    considered a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP. We endeavor
    to compensate for the limitation of the non-GAAP measure
    presented by also providing the comparable GAAP measures, GAAP
    financial statements, and descriptions of the reconciling items
    and adjustments, to derive the non-GAAP measure. We present a
    reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial measure to GAAP below.

OIBA represents the combined operating results of Expedia,
    Inc.’s businesses, taking into account depreciation, which
    we believe is an ongoing cost of doing business, but excluding
    the effects of other non-cash expenses that may not be
    indicative of our core business operations. We believe this
    measure is useful to investors for the following reasons:

•

it corresponds more closely to the cash operating income
    generated from our core operations by excluding significant
    non-cash operating expenses;

•

it aids in forecasting and analyzing future operating income as
    stock-based compensation, non-cash distribution and marketing
    expenses and intangible assets amortization, assuming no
    subsequent acquisitions, are likely to decline going
    forward; and

•

it provides greater insight into management decision making at
    Expedia, as OIBA is our primary internal metric for evaluating
    the performance of our business.

OIBA has certain limitations in that it does not take into
    account the impact of certain expenses to our consolidated
    statements of income, including stock-based compensation,
    non-cash payments to partners, acquisition-related accounting
    and certain one-time items, if applicable. Due to the high
    variability and



difficulty in predicting certain items that affect net income,
    such as tax rates, stock price and interest rates, we are unable
    to provide a reconciliation to net income on a forward-looking
    basis without unreasonable efforts.

Prior to the Spin-Off, the intercompany receivable balances were
    subject to a cash management arrangement with IAC. Since we
    extinguished our intercompany receivable balances with IAC at
    Spin-Off with a non-cash distribution to IAC, we no longer
    receive interest income from IAC. The increase in interest
    income in 2005 compared to 2004 was due to the growth in our
    intercompany receivable balances with IAC, as well as an
    increase in the interest rates earned on these balances.

Other interest income increased in 2006 compared to 2005
    primarily due to higher cash balances, which resulted from
    operating cash flow and the $500.0 million senior unsecured
    notes (the “Notes”) that we issued in August 2006.

Write-off
    of Long-Term Investment

In 2005, we received information regarding the deteriorating
    financial condition of our long-term investment in a leisure
    travel company and we determined that it was not likely we would
    recover any of our investment because the decline in its value
    was determined to be

other-than-temporary.

As a result, we recorded a loss related to this impairment of
    $23.4 million. In 2006, we sold our investment for nil
    consideration.

In 2006, our effective tax rate was affected by state taxes,

    gains related to our derivative liabilities.

In 2005 and 2004, our effective tax rate was higher than the 35%
    statutory rate primarily due to state taxes and an increase in
    the valuation allowance related to foreign operating losses. In
    addition, in 2005, our effective tax rate was affected by
    non-deductible stock-based compensation expense, unrealized
    losses on derivative instruments and loss from the write-off of
    our long-term investment.

During 2006, we utilized all of our federal net operating losses
    and expect to be a full U.S. cash taxpayer going forward.
    For additional information about income taxes, see
    Note 10 — Income Taxes, in the notes to
    consolidated financial statements.

Segment
    Operating Results

In the first quarter of 2006, we began reporting two segments;
    North America and Europe. The change from a single reportable
    segment is a result of the reorganization of our business. We
    determined our segments based on how our chief operating
    decision makers manage our business, make operating decisions
    and evaluate operating performance. Our primary operating metric
    for evaluating segment performance is OIBA (defined above). We
    have not reported segment information for the years ended
    December 31, 2005 and 2004, as it is not practicable to do
    so. For additional information about our segment results, see
    Note 16 — Segment Information, in the notes to
    consolidated financial statements.

Financial
    Position, Liquidity and Capital Resources

Our principal sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from
    operations, our cash and cash equivalents balances which were
    $853.3 million and $297.4 million at December 31,
    2006 and 2005, and our $1.0 billion



revolving credit facility, of which $948 million was
    available to us as of December 31, 2006 representing the
    total of the facility less $52 million of outstanding
    stand-by letters of credit (“LOC”). As of
    December 31, 2006, we were in compliance with our financial
    covenants consisting of leverage and minimum net worth related
    to the facility.

Under the merchant model, we receive cash from travelers at the
    time of booking and we record these amounts on our consolidated
    balance sheets as deferred merchant bookings. We pay our
    suppliers related to these bookings generally within two weeks
    after completing the transaction for air travel and, for all
    other merchant bookings, which is primarily our merchant hotel
    business, after the travelers’ use and subsequent billing
    from the supplier. Therefore there is generally a greater time
    from the receipt of cash from the traveler to the payment to the
    supplier, and this operating cycle represents a working capital
    source of cash to us. As long as the merchant hotel business
    continues to grow and our business model does not change, we
    expect that changes in working capital will positively impact
    operating cash flows. If this business declines relative to our
    other businesses, or if there are changes to the model which
    compress the time between receipts of cash from travelers to
    payments to suppliers, our working capital benefits could be
    reduced, as was the case to a certain degree in 2006 as we
    increased the efficiency of our supplier payment process.

Seasonal fluctuations in our merchant hotel bookings affect the
    timing of our annual cash flows. During the first half of the
    year, hotel bookings have traditionally exceeded stays,
    resulting in much higher cash flow related to working capital.
    During the second half of the year, this pattern reverses. While
    we expect the impact of seasonal fluctuations to continue,
    merchant hotel growth rates or model changes as discussed above
    may affect working capital, which might counteract or intensify
    the anticipated seasonal fluctuations.

As of December 31, 2006, we had a deficit in our working
    capital of $217.4 million, compared to a deficit of
    $848.0 million as of December 31, 2005. The 2005
    deficit resulted from the $2.5 billion of net intercompany
    receivable balances we extinguished through a non-cash
    distribution to IAC upon our Spin-Off on August 9, 2005.

We anticipate continued investment in the development and
    expansion of our operations. These investments include but are
    not limited to improvements to infrastructure, which include our
    enterprise data warehouse investment, servers, networking
    equipment and software, release improvements to our software
    code and continuing efforts to build a scaleable, extensible,
    service-oriented technology platform that will extend across our
    portfolio of brands. We expect portions of our worldwide points
    of sale to migrate to the new platform beginning in 2007.
    Capital expenditures are expected to increase 5% to 15% in 2007.
    Our future capital requirements may include capital needs for
    acquisitions or expenditures in support of our business
    strategy. In the event we have acquisitions, this may reduce our
    cash balance and increase our debt. Legal risks and challenges
    to our business strategy may also negatively affect our cash
    balance.

Our cash flows are as follows:

In 2006, net cash provided by operating activities decreased by
    $241.7 million primarily due to an increase in tax payments
    and a decrease in cash flows from operating income as well as a
    reduced benefit from working capital. We made tax payments of
    $126.1 million, an increase of $115.7 million over
    2005, reducing cash provided by operations due primarily to
    IAC’s payment of taxes on behalf of Expedia prior to our
    becoming an independent public company after which point we
    became responsible for our tax obligations.



In 2005, net cash provided by operating activities increased by
    $67.0 million primarily due to an increase in cash flows
    from operating income, partially offset by tax payments of
    $10.4 million, an increase of $12.3 million from 2004,
    reducing cash provided by operations.

Cash used in investing activities decreased by
    $687.8 million in 2006 primarily due to the absence of
    transfers to IAC of $757.2 million, partially offset by net
    cash used in acquisitions and a $40.3 million increase in
    capital expenditures in the current period in part due to
    capitalized software costs incurred for the development of our
    enterprise data warehouse and other improvements to our
    technology infrastructure. In 2005, cash used in investing
    activities decreased by $131.1 million from 2004 primarily
    due to a $515.5 million decrease in transfers to IAC and
    reduction of cash acquisitions as well as the decrease in
    marketable securities proceeds in 2005 compared to 2004.

Cash provided by financing activities decreased in 2006 due to
    $295.7 million of treasury stock activity primarily related
    to open market share repurchases and the $230.0 million
    repayment of our revolving credit facility, which was initially
    borrowed in 2005, partially offset by the net proceeds of
    $495.3 million from the Notes issuance in 2006. In 2005,
    cash provided by financing activities decreased due to
    withholding taxes for stock option exercises of
    $86.6 million that we paid on behalf of our senior
    executive in exchange for surrendering a portion of his vested
    shares to treasury, and 2005 distributions to IAC versus 2004
    contributions from IAC, partially offset by an increase in
    short-term borrowings of $230.7 million and proceeds from
    the exercise of stock option exercises of $29.1 million.

During the third quarter of 2006, we issued $500.0 million
    Notes for net proceeds of $495.3 million. The Notes are due
    August 2018 and bear a fixed interest rate of 7.456% with
    interest payable semi-annually in February and August of each
    year, beginning in February 2007. The Notes are repayable in
    whole or in part on August 15, 2013, at the option of the
    Note holders, and are redeemable in whole or in part at any time
    at our option. As of December 31, 2006, we were in
    compliance with all related covenants.

During the second and third quarters of 2006, we repurchased, in
    open market trades at an average per share price of $14.42,
    20 million shares of our common stock for a total cost of
    $288 million.

We reclassified certain foreign exchange effects on our cash
    balances from operating activities to effect of foreign exchange
    rate changes for the periods presented. The effect of foreign
    exchange on our cash balances denominated in foreign currency in
    2006 showed a net increase of $50.7 million from 2005 due
    to the benefit of foreign currency appreciation during that time
    period versus our reporting currency, as well as the increase in
    our cash balances.

On January 19, 2007, we completed a tender offer pursuant
    to which we acquired 30 million tendered shares of our
    common stock at a purchase price of $22.00 per share, for a
    total cost of $660 million plus fees and expenses relating
    to the tender offer. These shares represent approximately 9.8%
    of the shares of common stock outstanding and 9.0% of the total
    number of shares of common stock and Class B common stock
    outstanding as of December 31, 2006. We paid for the
    tendered shares with cash on-hand and by drawing
    $150 million on our revolving credit facility.

As of February 15, 2007, we have Board of Directors
    authorization for additional share repurchases of up to
    20 million outstanding shares of our common stock. There is
    no fixed termination date for the repurchases.

In our opinion, available cash, funds from operations and
    available borrowings will provide sufficient capital resources
    to meet our foreseeable liquidity needs.

Contractual
    Obligations and Commercial Commitments

Our contractual obligations and commercial commitments are as
    follows:

•

Our Notes include interest payments through maturity in 2018.

•

We have obligations related to the Ask Jeeves Notes. As a result
    of the Spin-Off, when holders of IAC’s Ask Jeeves Notes
    convert their notes, they will receive shares of both IAC and
    Expedia common stock. Under the terms of the Spin-Off, we are
    obligated to issue shares of our common stock to IAC



for delivery to the holders of the Ask Jeeves Notes, or pay cash
    in equal value, in lieu of issuing such shares, at our option.
    The Ask Jeeves Notes are due June 1, 2008; upon maturity of
    these notes, our obligation to satisfy demands for conversion
    ceases.

•

The operating leases are for office space and related office
    equipment. We account for these leases on a monthly basis.
    Certain leases contain periodic rent escalation adjustments and
    renewal options. Operating lease obligations expire at various
    dates with the latest maturity in 2014.

•

Our purchase obligations represent the minimum obligations we
    have under agreements with certain of our vendors. These minimum
    obligations are less than our projected use for those periods.
    Payments may be more than the minimum obligations based on
    actual use. In addition, if certain obligations are met by our
    counterparties, our obligations will increase.

•

Guarantees and LOCs are commitments that represent funding
    responsibilities that may require our performance in the event
    of third-party demands or contingent events. These commitments
    consist of stand-by LOCs and guarantees. We use our stand-by
    LOCs to secure payment for hotel room transactions to particular
    hotel properties. The outstanding balance of our stand-by LOCs
    directly reduces the amount available to us from our revolving
    credit facility. In addition, we provide a guarantee to the
    aviation authority of one country to protect against potential
    non-delivery of our packaged travel services sold within that
    country. This country holds all travel agents and tour companies
    to the same standard.

Part II.
    Item 7A.

Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Market
    Risk Management

Market risk is the potential loss from adverse changes in
    interest rates, foreign exchange rates and market prices. Our
    exposure to market risk includes our Notes, our revolving credit
    facility, derivative instruments, cash and cash equivalents,
    merchant accounts payable and deferred merchant bookings
    denominated in foreign currencies. We manage our exposure to
    these risks through established policies and procedures. Our
    objective is to mitigate potential income statement, cash flow
    and market exposures from changes in interest and foreign
    exchange rates.



Interest
    Rate Risk

In August 2006, we issued $500.0 million Notes with a fixed
    rate of 7.456%. As a result, if market rates decline, our
    required payments will exceed those based on market rates. The
    fair value of our Notes was approximately $520 million as
    of December 31, 2006 based on the quoted market price. A
    50 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would
    decrease or increase the fair value of our Notes by
    approximately $20 million.

In July 2005, we entered into a $1.0 billion revolving
    credit facility. The revolving credit facility bears interest
    based on our financial leverage and as of December 31, 2006
    was equal to LIBOR plus 0.50%. As a result, we may be
    susceptible to fluctuations in interest rates if we do not hedge
    the interest rate exposure arising from any borrowings under our
    revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2005, our
    outstanding borrowing under the revolving credit facility was
    $230.0 million, which we fully repaid during 2006. No
    borrowings were outstanding under the revolving credit facility
    as of December 31, 2006. In 2007, we paid for the
    30 million tendered shares, in part, by drawing on our
    revolving credit facility. As of February 15, 2007, the
    outstanding balance on the credit facility was $150 million.

We did not experience any significant impact from changes in
    interest rates for the years ended December 31, 2006 or
    2005.

Foreign
    Exchange Risk

We conduct business in certain international markets, primarily
    in Australia, Canada, China and the European Union. Because we
    operate in international markets, we have exposure to different
    economic climates, political arenas, tax systems and regulations
    that could affect foreign exchange rates. Our primary exposure
    to foreign currency risk relates to transacting in foreign
    currency and recording the activity in U.S. dollars.
    Changes in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and these
    other currencies will result in transaction gains or losses,
    which we recognize in our consolidated statements of income. To
    the extent practicable, we minimize this exposure by maintaining
    natural hedges between our current assets and current
    liabilities in similarly denominated foreign currencies.

Future net transaction gains and losses are inherently difficult
    to predict as they are reliant on how the multiple currencies in
    which we transact fluctuate in relation to the U.S. dollar,
    the relative composition and denomination of the current assets
    and liabilities each period, and our ability to maintain natural
    offsets of such exposures. During 2006 we recorded net foreign
    exchange rate gains of $10.4 million; and during 2005 and
    2004 we recorded net foreign exchange rate losses of
    $0.6 million and $7.5 million.

As we increase our operations in international markets, our
    exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates
    increases. The economic impact to us of foreign currency
    exchange rate movements is linked to variability in real growth,
    inflation, interest rates, governmental actions and other
    factors. These changes, if material, could cause us to adjust
    our financing and operating strategies.

As foreign currency exchange rates fluctuate, translation of the
    income statements of our international businesses into
    U.S. dollars affects

year-over-year

comparability of operating results. Historically, we have not
    hedged foreign exchange risks; we periodically review our
    strategy for hedging foreign exchange risks. Our goal in
    managing our foreign exchange risk is to reduce to the extent
    practicable our potential exposure to the changes that exchange
    rates might have on our earnings, cash flows and financial
    position.

We use cross-currency swaps to hedge against the change in value
    of certain intercompany loans denominated in currencies other
    than the lending subsidiaries’ functional currency. For
    additional information about our cross-currency swaps, see
    Note 7 — Derivative Instruments, in the notes to
    consolidated financial statements.



Equity
    Price Risk

We do not maintain any minority investments in equity securities
    as part of our marketable securities investment strategy. Thus,
    our equity price risk primarily relates to fluctuations in our
    stock price, which affects our derivative liabilities related to
    outstanding Ask Jeeves Notes. We base the fair value of these
    derivative instruments primarily on the changes in the market
    price of our common stock.

In 2006, certain of these notes were converted at fair value for
    $80.8 million of common stock, or 3.5 million shares.
    As additional notes are converted, the value of the derivative
    liability will be reduced and our equity price risk will
    decrease accordingly. The conversion of the Ask Jeeves Notes
    during 2006, reduced our obligation to issue our common stock
    from 4.3 million shares as of December 31, 2005, to
    0.8 million shares as of December 31, 2006.

As of December 31, 2006, each $1.00 fluctuation in our
    common stock will result in approximately $0.8 million of
    change in the aggregate fair value of our Ask Jeeves Notes
    derivative liability. An increase in our common stock price will
    result in a charge to our consolidated statements of income and
    a decrease in our common stock price will result in a credit.
    The Ask Jeeves Notes are due June 1, 2008; upon maturity of
    these notes, our obligation to satisfy demands for conversion
    ceases.

For additional information about the Ask Jeeves Notes, see
    Note 7 — Derivative Instruments, in the notes to
    consolidated financial statements.

Controls
    and Procedures

Changes
    in Internal Control over Financial Reporting.

We have been evaluating, designing and enhancing controls
    related to our internal controls over financial reporting and
    discussing these matters with our independent accountants and
    our Audit Committee. Based on these evaluations and discussions,
    we considered what revisions, improvements or corrections were
    necessary in order for us to conclude that our internal controls
    are effective. As part of this process, we identified a number
    of areas where there was a need for improvement in our internal
    controls over financial reporting. We have completed the
    remediation of these areas. Besides the internal control
    improvements discussed above, there were no changes to our
    internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during
    the quarter ended December 31, 2006 that have materially
    affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our
    internal control over financial reporting.

Evaluation
    of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.

Our management, including our Chairman and Senior Executive,
    Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated
    the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure
    controls and procedures pursuant to

Rule 13a-15(e)

of the Exchange Act. Based upon that evaluation, our Chairman
    and Senior Executive, Chief Executive Officer and Chief
    Financial Officer concluded that, as of the end of the period
    covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures
    were effective.



Management’s
    Report on Internal Control over Financial
    Reporting.

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
    adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined
    in

Rule 13a-15(f)

of the Exchange Act. Internal control over financial reporting
    is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of our financial reporting for external purposes in
    accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
    United States of America. Management conducted an evaluation of
    the effectiveness of our internal control over financial
    reporting based on the criteria for effective control over
    financial reporting described in

Internal Control —
    Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this
    evaluation, management has concluded that, as of
    December 31, 2006, the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting was effective. Management has reviewed its
    assessment with the Audit Committee. Ernst & Young LLP,
    an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited
    management’s assessment of the effectiveness of our
    internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2006, as stated in their report which is
    included below.

Limitations
    on Controls.

Management does not expect that our disclosure controls and
    procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will
    prevent or detect all error and fraud. Any control system, no
    matter how well designed and operated, is based upon certain
    assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute,
    assurance that its objectives will be met. Further, no
    evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that
    misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all
    control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the
    Company have been detected.

Report
    of Ernst & Young LLP, Independent Registered Public
    Accounting Firm on Internal Control Over Financial
    Reporting

We have audited management’s assessment, which is contained
    above under the heading “Management’s Report on
    Internal Control over Financial Reporting,” that Expedia,
    Inc. maintained effective internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on criteria
    established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework
    issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
    Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Expedia, Inc.’s
    management is responsible for maintaining effective internal
    control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
    effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our
    responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s
    assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the
    company’s internal control over financial reporting based
    on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
    management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design
    and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
    such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
    circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
    basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.



Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that Expedia, Inc.
    maintained effective internal control over financial reporting
    as of December 31, 2006, is fairly stated, in all material
    respects, based on the COSO criteria. Also in our opinion,
    Expedia, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective
    internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2006, based on the COSO criteria.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    2006 consolidated financial statements of Expedia, Inc. and our
    report dated February 26, 2007 expressed an unqualified
    opinion thereon.

Report of
    Ernst & Young LLP, Independent Registered Public Accounting
    Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Expedia, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    Expedia, Inc. as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, and the
    related consolidated statements of income, shareholders’
    equity and comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the
    two years in the period ended December 31, 2006. These
    financial statements are the responsibility of the
    Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
    opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
    present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
    financial position of Expedia, Inc. at December 31, 2006
    and 2005, and the consolidated results of its operations and its
    cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended
    December 31, 2006, in conformity with U.S. generally
    accepted accounting principles.

As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, in 2006
    the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standard
    No. 123 (revised 2004),

Share-Based Payment

,
    effective January 1, 2006.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    effectiveness of Expedia, Inc.’s internal control over
    financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on
    criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework
    issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
    Treadway Commission and our report dated February 26, 2007
    expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Report of

    Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Expedia, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying combined statements of income,
    stockholders’ equity and comprehensive income, and cash
    flows of Expedia, Inc. for the year ended December 31,
    2004. These financial statements are the responsibility of the
    Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
    opinion on these financial statements based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. We were not engaged to perform an
    audit of the Company’s internal control over financial
    reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control
    over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit
    procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not
    for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of
    the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
    Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes
    examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
    disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
    presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
    basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
    present fairly, in all material respects, the combined results
    of operations and cash flows of Expedia, Inc. for the year ended
    December 31, 2004, in conformity with U.S. generally
    accepted accounting principles.

Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements

NOTE 1 —
    Organization and Basis of Presentation

Description
    of Business

Expedia, Inc. and its subsidiaries provide travel products and
    services to leisure and corporate travelers in the United States
    and abroad. These travel products and services are offered
    through a diversified portfolio of brands including: Expedia,
    Hotels.com, Hotwire.com, our private label programs (Worldwide
    Travel Exchange and Interactive Affiliate Network), Classic
    Vacations, Expedia Corporate Travel (“ECT”), eLong,
    Inc. (“eLong”) and TripAdvisor. In addition, many of
    these brands have related international points of sale. We refer
    to Expedia, Inc. and its subsidiaries collectively as
    “Expedia,” the “Company,” “us,”
    “we” and “our” in these consolidated
    financial statements.

Spin-Off
    from IAC/InterActiveCorp

On December 21, 2004, IAC/InterActiveCorp (“IAC”)
    announced its plan to separate into two independent public
    companies to allow each company to focus on its individual
    strategic objectives. We refer to this transaction as the
    “Spin-Off.” A new company, Expedia, Inc., was
    incorporated under Delaware law in April 2005, to hold
    substantially all of IAC’s travel and travel-related
    businesses (“Expedia Businesses”).

On August 9, 2005, the Spin-Off of the Expedia Businesses
    from IAC was completed. Shares of Expedia, Inc. began trading on
    The Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc. (“NASDAQ”) under the
    symbol “EXPE.” In conjunction with the Spin-Off, we
    completed the following transactions: (1) transferred to
    IAC all cash in excess of $100 million, excluding the cash
    and cash equivalents held by eLong; (2) extinguished all
    intercompany receivable balances from IAC, which totaled
    $2.5 billion by recording a non-cash distribution to IAC;
    (3) recorded a non-cash contribution from IAC of a joint
    ownership interest in an airplane, with a value of
    $17.4 million; (4) recorded a non-cash contribution of
    media time, with a value of $17.1 million;
    (5) recorded derivative liabilities for the stock warrants
    and Ask Jeeves Convertible Subordinated Notes (“Ask Jeeves
    Notes”) with a fair value of $101.6 million;
    (6) recorded a modification of stock-based compensation
    awards of $5.4 million; and (7) recapitalized the
    invested equity balance with common stock, Class B common
    stock and preferred stock, whereby holders of IAC stock received
    shares of Expedia stock based on a formula or cash ($50 per
    share plus accrued and unpaid dividends).

Basis
    of Presentation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include
    Expedia, Inc., our wholly-owned subsidiaries, and entities we
    control, or in which we have a variable interest and are the
    primary beneficiary of future cash profits or losses. We record
    our investments in entities that we do not control, but over
    which we have the ability to exercise significant influence,
    using the equity method. We record our investments in entities
    over which we do not have the ability to exercise significant
    influence using the cost method. We have eliminated significant
    intercompany transactions and accounts.

These consolidated financial statements present our results of
    operations, financial position, change in stockholders’
    equity and comprehensive income, and cash flows on a combined
    basis through the Spin-Off on August 9, 2005, and on a
    consolidated basis thereafter. We have prepared the combined
    financial statements from the historical results of operations
    and historical bases of the assets and liabilities with the
    exception of income taxes. We have computed income taxes using
    our stand-alone tax rate.

We believe that the assumptions underlying our consolidated
    financial statements are reasonable. However, these consolidated
    financial statements do not present our future financial
    position, the results of our future operations and cash flows,
    nor do they present what our historical financial position,
    results of operations and cash flows would have been prior to
    Spin-Off had we been a stand-alone company.

Expedia,
    Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

Seasonality

We generally experience seasonal fluctuations in the demand for
    our travel products and services. For example, traditional
    leisure travel bookings are generally the highest in the first
    three quarters as travelers plan and book their spring, summer
    and holiday travel. The number of bookings decreases in the
    fourth quarter. Because revenue in the merchant business is
    generally recognized when the travel takes place rather than
    when it is booked, revenue typically lags bookings by several
    weeks or longer. As a result, revenue is typically the lowest in
    the first quarter and highest in the third quarter.

NOTE 2 —
    Significant Accounting Policies

Consolidation

Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
    Expedia, Inc., our wholly-owned subsidiaries, and entities for
    which we control a majority of the entity’s outstanding
    common stock. We record minority interest in our consolidated
    financial statements to recognize the minority ownership
    interest in our consolidated subsidiaries. Minority interests in
    the earnings and losses of consolidated subsidiaries represent
    the share of net income or loss allocated to members or partners
    in our consolidated entities, which includes the minority
    interest share of net income or loss from eLong.

In addition, we hold variable interests in certain affiliated
    entities of eLong in order to meet the laws and regulations of
    the People’s Republic of China, which restricts foreign
    investment in the air-ticketing, travel agency, internet content
    provision and advertising businesses. Through a series of
    agreements with affiliated Chinese entities, eLong is the
    primary beneficiary of future cash losses or profits by
    contractual right. As such, although we do not own capital stock
    of the Chinese affiliates, we consolidate their results.

We have eliminated significant intercompany transactions and
    accounts in our consolidated financial statements.

Accounting
    Estimates

We use estimates and assumptions in the preparation of our
    consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting
    principles generally accepted in the United States
    (“GAAP”). Our estimates and assumptions affect the
    reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
    contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of our
    consolidated financial statements. These estimates and
    assumptions also affect the reported amount of net income during
    any period. Our actual financial results could differ
    significantly from these estimates. The significant estimates
    underlying our consolidated financial statements include revenue
    recognition, recoverability of long-lived and intangible assets
    and goodwill, income taxes, occupancy tax, stock-based
    compensation and accounting for derivative instruments.

Reclassifications

We have reclassified prior period financial statements to
    conform to the current period presentation.

In our consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended
    December 31, 2005 and 2004, we reclassified net foreign
    exchange gains and losses on cash of U.S. functional
    subsidiaries held in foreign currencies from operating cash
    flows to effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash
    equivalents to appropriately reflect foreign currency impacts on
    cash and cash equivalents for the periods presented.

In our consolidated statements of income for the years ended
    December 31, 2005 and 2004, we reclassified stock-based
    compensation expense to the same operating expense line items as
    cash compensation paid to employees in accordance with SEC Staff
    Accounting Bulletin (“SAB”) No. 107.

In our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2005,
    we reclassified $19.7 million from accounts payable, other,
    to accounts payable, merchant ($19.3 million) and other
    current liabilities ($0.4 million).

Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

Revenue
    Recognition

We recognize revenue when it is earned and realizable based on
    the following criteria: persuasive evidence that an arrangement
    exists, services have been rendered, the price is fixed or
    determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured.

We also evaluate the presentation of revenue on a gross versus a
    net basis through application of Emerging Issues Task Force No.
    (“EITF”)

99-19,

Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an
    Agent

. The consensus of this literature is that the
    presentation of revenue as “the gross amount billed to a
    customer because it has earned revenue from the sale of goods or
    services or the net amount retained (that is, the amount billed
    to a customer less the amount paid to a supplier) because it has
    earned a commission or fee” is a matter of judgment that
    depends on the relevant facts and circumstances. In making an
    evaluation of this issue, some of the factors that should be
    considered are: whether we are the primary obligor in the
    arrangement (strong indicator); whether we have general
    inventory risk (before customer order is placed or upon customer
    return) (strong indicator); and whether we have latitude in
    establishing price. The guidance clearly indicates that the
    evaluations of these factors, which at times can be
    contradictory, are subject to significant judgment and
    subjectivity. If the conclusion drawn is that we perform as an
    agent or a broker without assuming the risks and rewards of
    ownership of goods, revenue should be reported on a net basis.
    For our primary revenue models, discussed below, we have
    determined net presentation is appropriate for the majority of
    revenue transactions.

We offer travel products and services on a stand-alone and
    package basis primarily through two business models: the
    merchant model and the agency model.

Under the merchant model, we facilitate the booking of hotel
    rooms, airline seats, car rentals and destination services from
    our travel suppliers and we are the merchant of record for such
    bookings.

Under the agency model, we act as the agent in the transaction,
    passing reservations booked by the traveler to the relevant
    travel provider. We receive commissions or ticketing fees from
    the travel supplier

and/or

traveler. For agency airline, hotel and car transactions, we
    also receive fees from global distribution systems partners that
    control the computer systems through which these reservations
    are booked.

Merchant Hotel.

Our travelers pay us for
    merchant hotel transactions prior to departing on their trip,
    generally when they book the reservation. We record the payment
    in deferred merchant bookings until the stay occurs, at which
    point we record the revenue. In certain non-refundable,
    non-changeable transactions where we have no significant
    post-delivery obligations, we record revenue when the traveler
    completes the transaction on our website, less a reserve for
    chargebacks and cancellations based on historical experience.
    Amounts received from customers are presented net of amounts
    paid to suppliers. In certain instances when a supplier invoices
    us for less than the cost we accrued, we generally recognize
    those amounts as revenue six months in arrears, net of an
    allowance, when we determine it is not probable that we will be
    required to pay the supplier, based on historical experience and
    contract terms.

We generally contract in advance with lodging providers to
    obtain access to room allotments at wholesale rates. Certain
    contracts specifically identify the number of potential rooms
    and the negotiated rate of the rooms to which we may have access
    over the terms of the contracts, which generally range from one
    to three years. Other contracts are not specific with respect to
    the number of rooms and the rates of the rooms to which we may
    have access over the terms of the contracts. In either case we
    may return unbooked hotel room allotments with no obligation to
    the lodging providers within a period specified in each
    contract. For hotel rooms that are cancelled by the traveler
    after the specified period of time, we charge the traveler a
    cancellation fee or penalty that is at least equal to the amount
    a hotel may invoice us for the cancellation.

Merchant Air.

Generally, we determine the
    ticket price for merchant air transactions. We pay the cost of
    the airline ticket generally within two weeks after booking. We
    record cash paid by the traveler as deferred merchant bookings
    and the cost of the airline ticket as prepaid merchant bookings.
    When the flight occurs, we

F-10


Expedia,
    Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

record the difference between the deferred merchant bookings and
    the prepaid merchant bookings as revenue on a net basis.

When we have nonrefundable and generally noncancelable merchant
    air transactions, with no significant post-delivery obligations,
    we record revenue upon booking. We record a reserve for
    chargebacks and cancellations at the time of the transaction
    based on historical experience.

Agency Air, Hotel, Car and Cruise.

Our agency
    revenue comes from airline ticket transactions, certain hotel
    transactions as well as cruise and car rental reservations. We
    record agency revenue on air transactions when the traveler
    books the transaction, as we have no significant post-delivery
    obligations. We record agency revenue on hotel reservations,
    cruise and car rental reservations either on an accrual basis
    for payments from a commission clearinghouse, or on receipt of
    commissions from an individual supplier. We record an allowance
    for cancellations and chargebacks on this revenue based on
    historical experience.

Click-Through Fees.

We record revenue from
    click-through fees charged to our travel partners for traveler
    leads sent to the travel partners’ websites. We record
    revenue from click-through fees after the traveler makes the
    click-through to the related travel partners’ websites.

Advertising.

We record advertising revenue
    ratably over the advertising period or upon delivery of
    advertising impressions, depending on the terms of the
    advertising contract.

Other.

We record revenue from all other
    sources either upon delivery or when we provide the service.

Cash
    and Cash Equivalents

Our cash and cash equivalents include cash and liquid financial
    instruments with maturities of 90 days or less when
    purchased.

Accounts
    Receivable

Accounts receivable are generally due within thirty days and are
    recorded net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. We consider
    accounts outstanding longer than the contractual payment terms
    as past due. We determine our allowance by considering a number
    of factors, including the length of time trade accounts
    receivable are past due, previous loss history, a specific
    customer’s ability to pay its obligations to us, and the
    condition of the general economy and industry as a whole.

Property
    and Equipment

We record property and equipment at cost, net of accumulated
    depreciation and amortization. We also capitalize certain costs
    incurred related to the development of internal use software in
    accordance with Statement of Position

98-1,

Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or
    Obtained for Internal Use

, and EITF

No. 00-02,

Accounting for Website Development Costs

. We capitalize
    costs incurred during the application development stage related
    to the development of internal-use software. We expense costs
    incurred related to the planning and post-implementation phases
    of development as incurred.

We compute depreciation using the straight-line method over the
    estimated useful lives of the assets, which is three years for
    computer equipment and capitalized software development, and
    range from three to five years for furniture and other
    equipment. We amortize leasehold improvement using the
    straight-line method, over the shorter of the estimated useful
    life of the improvement or the remaining term of the lease.

In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    (“SFAS”) No. 143,

Accounting for Asset
    Retirement Obligations,

we establish assets and liabilities
    for the present value of estimated future costs to return
    certain of our leased facilities to their original condition.
    Such assets are depreciated over the lease period into operating
    expense, and the recorded liabilities are accreted to the future
    value of the estimated restoration costs.

Goodwill
    and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets

Goodwill is assigned to reporting units that are expected to
    benefit from the synergies of the business combination as of the
    acquisition date. We assess goodwill and indefinite-lived
    intangible assets, neither of which is amortized, for impairment
    annually as of October 1 or more frequently if events and
    circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred.

In the evaluation of goodwill for impairment, we first compare
    the fair value of the reporting unit to the carrying value. If
    the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value,
    the goodwill of the reporting unit is potentially impaired and
    we proceed to step two of the impairment analysis. In step two
    of the analysis, we will record an impairment loss equal to the
    excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit’s
    goodwill over its implied fair value should such a circumstance
    arise.

In the evaluation of indefinite-lived intangible assets, an
    impairment charge is recorded for the excess of the carrying
    value of indefinite-lived intangible assets over their fair
    value.

We generally base our measurement of fair value of reporting
    units on a blended analysis of the present value of estimated
    future discounted cash flows and market valuation approach,
    which compares revenue and operating income multiples for
    companies of similar industry

and/or

size.
    Our analysis is based on available information and on
    assumptions and projections that we consider to be reasonable
    and supportable. The discounted cash flow analysis considers the
    likelihood of possible outcomes and is based on our best
    estimates of projected future cash flows. We base our
    measurement of fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets,
    which primarily consist of trade name and trademarks, using the
    relief-from-royalty method. This method assumes that the trade
    name and trademarks have value to the extent that their owner is
    relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits
    received from them.

Intangible
    Assets with Definite Lives and Other Long-Lived
    Assets

Intangible assets with definite lives and other long-lived
    assets are carried at cost and are amortized on a straight-line
    basis over their estimated useful lives of two to ten years. We
    review the carrying value of long-lived assets to be used in
    operations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
    that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable.
    Factors that would necessitate an impairment assessment include
    a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an
    asset is used, a significant adverse change in legal factors or
    the business climate that could affect the value of the asset,
    or a significant decline in the observable market value of an
    asset, among others. If such facts indicate a potential
    impairment, an impairment loss would only be recorded if the
    asset’s carrying amount is not recoverable through its
    undiscounted cash flows. Any impairment would be measured as the
    difference between the asset’s carrying amount and
    estimated fair value, determined using appropriate valuation
    methodologies which would typically include an estimate of
    discounted cash flows.

Assets held for sale, to the extent we have any, are reported at
    the lower of cost or fair value less costs to sell.

Investments

We record investments, which are non-marketable, using the cost
    basis when we do not have the ability to exercise significant
    influence over the investee and generally when our ownership in
    the investee is less than 20%. We record investments using the
    equity method when we have the ability to exercise significant
    influence over the investee.

At December 31, 2006 and 2005, we had a joint venture with
    Société Nationale des Chemins de Fer Français
    (“SNCF”), the state-owned railway group in France,
    which operates www.voyages-sncf.com, an online site for

e-tourism

in
    France. The investment is recorded under the equity method of
    accounting. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, SNCF owned 50.1%
    and we owned 49.9% of the joint venture.

F-12

    Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

We periodically evaluate the recoverability of investments and
    record a write-down if a decline in value is determined to be

other-than-temporary.

This evaluation resulted in the write-off of an investment in
    2005. See Note 13 — Other Income (Expense).

Income
    Taxes

In accordance with SFAS No. 109,

Accounting for
    Income Taxes

, we record income taxes under the liability
    method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect our
    estimation of the future tax consequences of temporary
    differences between the carrying amounts of assets and
    liabilities for book and tax purposes. We determine deferred
    income taxes based on the differences in accounting methods and
    timing between financial statement and income tax reporting.
    Accordingly, we determine the deferred tax asset or liability
    for each temporary difference based on the tax rates that we
    expect will be in effect when we realize the underlying items of
    income and expense. We consider many factors when assessing the
    likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets,
    including our recent earnings experience by jurisdiction,
    expectations of future taxable income, and the carryforward
    periods available to us for tax reporting purposes, as well as
    other relevant factors. We may establish a valuation allowance
    to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount we believe is more
    likely than not to be realized. Due to inherent complexities
    arising from the nature of our businesses, future changes in
    income tax law, tax sharing agreements or variances between our
    actual and anticipated operating results, we make certain
    judgments and estimates. Therefore, actual income taxes could
    materially vary from these estimates.

Occupancy
    Tax

Some states and localities impose a transient occupancy or
    accommodation tax, or a form of sales tax, on the use or
    occupancy of hotel accommodations. Generally, hotels charge
    taxes based on the room rate paid to the hotel and remit these
    taxes to the various tax authorities. When a customer books a
    room through one of our travel services, we collect a tax
    recovery charge from the customer which we pay to the hotel. We
    do not collect or remit occupancy taxes, nor do we pay occupancy
    taxes to the hotel operator on the portion of the customer
    payment we retain. Some jurisdictions have questioned our
    practice in this regard. While the applicable tax provisions
    vary among the jurisdictions, we generally believe that we are
    not required to collect and remit such occupancy taxes. We are
    engaged in discussions with tax authorities in various
    jurisdictions to resolve this issue. Some tax authorities have
    brought lawsuits asserting that we are required to collect and
    remit occupancy tax. The ultimate resolution in all
    jurisdictions cannot be determined at this time. We have
    established a reserve for the potential settlement of issues
    related to hotel occupancy taxes.

Derivative
    Instruments

Derivative instruments are carried at fair value on our
    consolidated balance sheets.

We have designated cross currency swap agreements as cash flow
    hedges of certain inter-company loan agreements denominated in
    currencies other than the lending subsidiaries’ functional
    currency (the “hedged items”). The hedges have been
    determined to be highly effective, at designation and on an
    ongoing basis. As such, we record the total change in the fair
    value of the hedges in other comprehensive income
    (“OCI”) each period, and concurrently reclassify a
    portion of the gain or loss to other, net to perfectly offset
    gains or losses related to transactional remeasurement of the
    hedged items.

We report the change in the fair value of derivative instruments
    that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment in other, net
    in our consolidated statements of income. We do not hold or
    issue financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes.
    For additional information about derivative instruments, see
    Note 7 — Derivative Instruments.

Foreign
    Currency Translation and Transaction Gains and
    Losses

Our operations outside of the United States use the related
    local currency as their functional currency. We translate
    revenue and expense at average rates of exchange during the
    period. We translate assets and liabilities at the rates of
    exchange as of the consolidated balance sheet dates and include
    foreign currency translation gains and losses as a component of
    accumulated OCI. Due to the nature of our operations and our
    corporate structure, we also have subsidiaries that have
    significant transactions in foreign currencies other than their
    functional currency. We record transaction gains and losses in
    our consolidated statements of income related to the recurring
    remeasurement and settlement of such transactions. To the extent
    practicable, we attempt to minimize this exposure by maintaining
    natural hedges between our current assets and current
    liabilities of similarly denominated foreign currencies.

Debt
    Issuance Costs

We defer costs we incur to issue debt and amortize these costs
    to interest expense over the term of the debt or, when the debt
    can be redeemed at the option of the holders, over the term of
    the redemption option.

Marketing
    Promotions

We periodically provide incentive offers to our customers to
    encourage booking of travel products and services. Generally,
    our incentive offers are as follows:

Current Discount Offers.

These promotions
    include dollar off discounts to be applied against current
    purchases. We record the discounts as reduction in revenue at
    the date we record the corresponding revenue transaction.

Inducement Offers.

These promotions include
    discounts granted at the time of a current purchase to be
    applied against a future qualifying purchase. We treat
    inducement offers as a reduction to revenue based on estimated
    future redemption rates. We allocate the discount amount between
    the current purchase and the potential future purchase based on
    our expected relative value of the transactions. We estimate our
    redemption rates using our historical experience for similar
    inducement offers.

Concession Offers.

These promotions include
    discounts to be applied against a future purchase to maintain
    customer satisfaction. Upon issuance, we record these concession
    offers as a reduction to revenue based on estimated future
    redemption rates. We estimate our redemption rates using our
    historical experience for concession offers.

Advertising
    Expense

We incur advertising expense consisting of offline costs,
    including television and radio advertising, and online
    advertising expense to promote our brands. We expense the
    production costs associated with advertisements in the period in
    which the advertisement first takes place. We expense the costs
    of communicating the advertisement (e.g., television airtime) as
    incurred each time the advertisement is shown. For the years
    ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004, our advertising
    expense was $427.2 million, $425.2 million and
    $452.9 million. As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, we
    had $12.6 million and $19.3 million of prepaid
    marketing expenses included in prepaid expenses and other
    current assets on our consolidated balance sheets.

Stock-Based
    Compensation

Effective January 1, 2006, we began accounting for
    stock-based compensation under the modified prospective method
    provisions of SFAS No. 123(R),

Share-Based
    Payment

, and related guidance. Under SFAS 123(R), we
    continue to measure and amortize the fair value for all
    share-based payments consistent with our past practice under
    SFAS 123,

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,

and SFAS No. 148,

Accounting

F-14


Expedia,
    Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

for Stock-Based Compensation — Transition and
    Disclosure

. As a result, the adoption of SFAS 123(R)
    did not have a material impact on our financial position.

We measure and amortize the fair value of restricted stock
    units, stock options and warrants as follows:

Restricted Stock Units.

Restricted stock units
    (“RSU”) are stock awards that are granted to employees
    entitling the holder to shares of common stock as the award
    vests, typically over a five-year period. We measure the value
    of RSUs at fair value based on the number of shares granted and
    the quoted price of our common stock at the date of grant. We
    amortize the fair value, net of estimated forfeitures, as
    stock-based compensation expense over the vesting term on a
    straight-line basis. We record RSUs that may be settled by the
    holder in cash, rather than shares, as a liability and we
    remeasure these instruments at fair value at the end of each
    reporting period. Upon settlement of these awards, our total
    compensation expense recorded over the vesting period of the
    awards will equal the settlement amount, which is based on our
    stock price on the settlement date.

Performance-based RSUs vest upon achievement of certain
    company-based performance conditions. On the date of grant, we
    assess whether it is probable that the performance targets will
    be achieved, and if assessed as probable, we determine the fair
    value of the performance-based award based on the fair value of
    our common stock at that time. We record compensation expense
    for these awards over the estimated performance period using the
    accelerated method under Financial Accounting Standards Board
    (“FASB”) Interpretation No. (“FIN”) 28,

Accounting for Stock Appreciation Rights and Other Variable
    Stock Option or Award Plans — an interpretation of
    Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 15 and 25

. At
    each reporting period, we reassess the probability of achieving
    the performance targets and the performance period required to
    meet those targets. The estimation of whether the performance
    targets will be achieved and of the performance period required
    to achieve the targets requires judgment, and to the extent
    actual results or updated estimates differ from our current
    estimates, the cumulative effect on current and prior periods of
    those changes will be recorded in the period estimates are
    revised, or the change in estimate will be applied prospectively
    depending on whether the change affects the estimate of total
    compensation cost to be recognized or merely affects the period
    over which compensation cost is to be recognized. The ultimate
    number of shares issued and the related compensation expense
    recognized will be based on a comparison of the final
    performance metrics to the specified targets.

Stock Options and Warrants.

We measure the
    value of stock options and warrants issued or modified,
    including unvested options assumed in acquisitions, on the grant
    date (or modification or acquisition dates, if applicable) at
    fair value, using the Black-Scholes option valuation model. We
    amortize the fair value, net of estimated forfeitures, over the
    remaining vesting term on a straight-line basis.

Estimates of fair value are not intended to predict actual
    future events or the value ultimately realized by employees who
    receive these awards, and subsequent events are not indicative
    of the reasonableness of our original estimates of fair value.
    In determining the estimated forfeiture rates for stock-based
    awards, we periodically conduct an assessment of the actual
    number of equity awards that have been forfeited to date as well
    as those expected to be forfeited in the future. We consider
    many factors when estimating expected forfeitures, including the
    type of award, the employee class and historical experience. The
    estimate of stock awards that will ultimately be forfeited
    requires significant judgment and to the extent that actual
    results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates,
    such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the
    period such estimates are revised. For additional information
    about the changes in estimated forfeiture rates, see
    Note 9 — Stock-Based Awards and Other Equity
    Instruments.

We have calculated an additional paid-in capital
    (“APIC”) pool pursuant to the provisions of
    SFAS 123(R). The APIC pool represents the excess tax
    benefits related to stock-based compensation that are available
    to absorb future tax deficiencies. We include only those excess
    tax benefits that have been realized in accordance with
    SFAS No. 109,

Accounting for Income Taxes

. If
    the amount of future tax deficiencies is greater than the
    available APIC pool, we will record the excess as income tax
    expense in our consolidated statements of

F-15


Expedia,
    Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

income. In 2006, we recorded tax deficiencies of
    $11.6 million against the APIC pool; as a result, such
    deficiencies did not affect our results of operations. Excess
    tax benefits or tax deficiencies are a factor in the calculation
    of diluted shares used in computing dilutive earnings per share.
    The adoption of SFAS 123(R) did not have a material impact
    on our dilutive shares.

Prior to our adoption of SFAS 123(R), we recorded cash
    retained as a result of tax benefit deductions relating to
    stock-based compensation in operating activities in our
    consolidated statements of cash flows, along with other tax cash
    flows, in accordance with the provisions of the EITF

No. 00-15,

Classification in the Statement of Cash Flows of the Income
    Tax Benefit Received by a Company upon Exercise of a
    Nonqualified Employee Stock Option

. SFAS 123(R)
    supersedes EITF

00-15,

amends SFAS No. 95,

Statement of Cash Flows

,
    and requires that, upon adoption, we present the tax benefit
    deductions relating to excess stock-based compensation
    deductions as a financing activity in our consolidated
    statements of cash flows. In 2006, we reported $1.3 million
    of tax benefit deductions as a financing activity that
    previously would have been reported as an operating activity.

Earnings
    Per Share

We compute basic earnings per share by taking net income
    available to common shareholders divided by the weighted average
    number of common and Class B common shares outstanding
    during the period excluding restricted stock and stock held in
    escrow. Diluted earnings per share include the potential
    dilution that could occur from stock-based awards and other
    stock-based commitments using the treasury stock or the as if
    converted methods, as applicable. For additional information on
    how we compute earnings per share, see Note 12 —
    Earnings Per Share.

Fair
    Value of Financial Instruments

The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents and restricted
    cash and cash equivalents reported on our consolidated balance
    sheets approximate fair value as we maintain them with various
    high-quality financial institutions or in short-term duration
    high-quality debt securities. The accounts and notes receivable
    are short-term in nature and are generally settled shortly after
    the sale. We maintain the carrying amounts of the derivative
    liabilities created in the Spin-Off at fair value, which is
    based upon appropriate valuation methodologies.

Certain
    Risks and Concentrations

Our business is subject to certain risks and concentrations
    including dependence on relationships with travel suppliers,
    primarily airlines and hotels, dependence on third-party
    technology providers, exposure to risks associated with online
    commerce security and credit card fraud. We are highly dependent
    on our relationships with six major airlines in the United
    States. We also depend on global distribution system partners
    and third-party service providers for certain fulfillment
    services.

Financial instruments, which potentially subject us to
    concentration of credit risk, consist primarily of cash and cash
    equivalents. We maintain some cash and cash equivalents balances
    with financial institutions that are in excess of Federal
    Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance limits.

Contingent
    Liabilities

We have a number of regulatory and legal matters outstanding, as
    discussed further in Note 14 — Commitments and
    Contingencies. Periodically, we review the status of all
    significant outstanding matters to assess the potential
    financial exposure. When (i) it is probable that an asset
    has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and
    (ii) the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated, we
    record the estimated loss in our consolidated statements of
    income. We provide disclosure in the notes to the consolidated
    financial statements for loss contingencies that do not meet
    both these conditions if there is a reasonable possibility that

F-16


Expedia,
    Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

a loss may have been incurred. Significant judgment is required
    to determine the probability that a liability has been incurred
    and whether such liability is reasonably estimable. We base
    accruals made on the best information available at the time
    which can be highly subjective. The final outcome of these
    matters could vary significantly from the amounts included in
    the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

New
    Accounting Pronouncements

Presentation of Taxes in the Income
    Statement.

In June 2006, the FASB reached a
    consensus on EITF Issue

No. 06-3,

How Taxes Collected from Customers and Remitted to
    Governmental Authorities Should Be Presented in the Income
    Statement (That Is, Gross versus Net Presentation)

. EITF

06-3

indicates that the income statement presentation on either a
    gross basis or a net basis of the taxes within the scope of the
    issue is an accounting policy decision that should be disclosed.
    EITF

06-3

is
    effective for interim and annual periods beginning after
    December 15, 2006. We present the taxes within the scope of
    EITF

06-3

on
    a net basis.

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes.

In
    July 2006, the FASB issued FIN 48,

Accounting for
    Uncertainty in Income Taxes — an interpretation of
    FASB Statement No. 109

, which clarifies the accounting
    for uncertainty in tax positions. FIN 48 prescribes
    guidance related to the financial statement recognition and
    measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a
    tax return. FIN 48 requires that we recognize in our
    financial statements the impact of a tax position, if that
    position is more likely than not to be sustained upon an
    examination, based on the technical merits of the position.
    FIN 48 must be applied to all existing tax positions upon
    initial adoption. The cumulative effect of applying FIN 48
    at adoption, if any, is to be reported as an adjustment to
    opening retained earnings for the year of adoption. The
    provisions of FIN 48 are effective for fiscal years
    beginning after December 15, 2006. We are in the process of
    determining the impact, if any, of this interpretation on our
    results from operations and financial position.

Fair Value Measurements.

In September 2006,
    the FASB issued SFAS No. 157,

Fair Value
    Measurements.

SFAS 157 defines fair value,
    establishes a framework for measuring fair value in GAAP, and
    expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS 157
    only applies when another standard requires or permits assets or
    liabilities to be measured at fair value and does not require
    any new fair value measurements. SFAS 157 is effective for
    fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. We are in
    the process of determining the impact, if any, of this statement
    on our results from operations, financial position or cash flows.

    Business Acquisitions

eLong.

In August 2004, we purchased a 30%
    ownership interest in eLong, a publicly-traded Cayman Island
    company, whose principal business is the operation of an
    internet-based travel business in the People’s Republic of
    China, for approximately $59.0 million in cash, and were
    concurrently issued a warrant to allow us to acquire additional
    shares, with an exercise price of approximately $6.21 per
    share of common stock, or $108 million.

In January 2005, we exercised the warrant resulting in an
    aggregate purchase price of $170.6 million, including our
    initial investment, exercise of the warrant and related
    transaction costs, a total ownership position of 59% and voting
    rights of approximately 96%. From August 2004 to the warrant
    exercise the investment was accounted for under the equity
    method, and from the warrant exercise forward we have
    consolidated the operating results of eLong. As of
    December 31, 2006, our ownership interest in eLong was 55%.

eLong’s American Depositary Shares (“ADS”) trade
    on the NASDAQ under the symbol “LONG.” Each ADS is
    equivalent to two shares of eLong common stock.

TripAdvisor.

In April 2004 and July 2005, we
    acquired 94.1% and an additional 1%, respectively, of
    TripAdvisor, a travel search engine and directory that enables
    consumers to research their travel and

destination place through the internet. The aggregate purchase
    price for our acquisition in April 2004 was $219.3 million.
    In 2006, we purchased the remaining 4.9% minority ownership in
    TripAdvisor for $18.3 million in cash.

Egencia.

In April 2004, we acquired 91.4% of
    the ownership of Egencia (renamed ECT-Europe), an online
    corporate travel agency in France, for an aggregate purchase
    price of $65.7 million. In April 2006, we acquired the
    remaining 8.6% minority ownership interest in Egencia for
    $3.3 million in cash and recorded a $3.1 million
    liability that will be paid in cash through April 2008.

We perform our annual assessment of possible impairment of

    October 1, or more frequently if events and circumstances
    indicate that impairment may have occurred. We performed our
    annual impairment assessment for goodwill and intangible assets
    as of October 1, 2006 and had no impairments.

Our indefinite lived intangible assets relate principally to
    trade names and trademarks acquired in various acquisitions.
    Based on lower than expected

year-to-date

revenue growth, we determined that our indefinite lived trade
    name intangible asset related to Hotwire might be impaired
    during the third quarter of 2006. Accordingly, we performed a
    valuation of that asset and determined that its carrying amount
    exceeded its fair

value and recognized an impairment charge of $47.0 million
    in “Impairment of intangible asset” in our
    consolidated statements of income. We based our measurement of
    fair value of the trade name intangible asset using the
    relief-from-royalty method. This method assumes that a trade
    name has value to the extent that its owner is relieved of the
    obligation to pay royalties for the benefits received therefrom.

As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, approximately 80% of our
    goodwill was assigned to our North American segment and
    approximately 17% to our European segment.

In 2006, the additions to goodwill relate primarily to the
    remaining purchase of TripAdvisor and Egencia shares and other
    miscellaneous business acquisitions. The deductions from
    goodwill primarily relate to the income tax benefit realized
    pursuant to the exercise of stock options assumed in business
    acquisitions that were vested at the transaction date and are
    treated as a reduction in purchase price when the deductions are
    realized.

In 2005, the additions to goodwill relate to new acquisitions,
    primarily eLong, as well as adjustments to the carrying value of
    goodwill based upon the finalization of the valuation of
    intangible assets and their related deferred tax impacts, and
    the deductions from goodwill relate to the income tax benefit
    realized pursuant to the exercise of stock options assumed in
    business acquisitions that were vested at the transaction date
    and are treated as a reduction in purchase price when the
    deductions are realized.

Short-term
    Borrowings

In July 2005, we entered into a $1.0 billion five-year
    unsecured revolving credit facility with a group of lenders,
    which was effective as of the Spin-Off, and is unconditionally
    guaranteed by certain Expedia subsidiaries. The facility bears
    interest based on our financial leverage, which as of
    December 31, 2006 and 2005, was equal to LIBOR plus .50%.
    The annual fee to maintain the facility is 0.1% on the unused
    portion of the facility, or approximately $1.0 million if
    all of the facility is unused. The facility also contains
    financial covenants consisting of a leverage ratio and a minimum
    net worth requirement. As of December 31, 2006, we were in
    compliance with our financial covenants which relate to leverage
    and minimum net worth.

The amount of stand-by letters of credit (“LOC”)
    issued under the facility reduces the amount available to us. As
    of December 31, 2006, and December 31, 2005, there was
    $52.0 million and $53.2 million of outstanding
    stand-by LOCs issued under the facility. As of December 31,
    2005, we had $230.0 million outstanding under the facility,
    which we fully repaid during the quarter ended March 31,
    2006. The $230.0 million carrying amount of the short-term
    borrowing approximates its fair value as of December 31,
    2005. As of December 31, 2006, there was no amount
    outstanding under the facility.

On January 19, 2007, we completed a tender offer for
    30 million common shares and paid for the tendered shares
    acquired, in part, by drawing on our revolving credit facility.
    As of February 15, 2007, the outstanding balance on the
    credit facility was $150 million, not including the
    stand-by LOCs also issued under the facility. For additional
    information about the tender offer, see
    Note 11

Stockholders’ Equity.

Long-term
    Debt

In August 2006, we privately placed $500.0 million of
    senior unsecured notes due 2018 (the “Notes”). The
    Notes bear a fixed rate interest of 7.456% with interest payable
    semi-annually in February and August of each year, beginning in
    February 2007. The amount of accrued interest related to the
    Notes was $13.4 million as of December 31, 2006. The
    Notes are repayable in whole or in part on August 15, 2013,
    at the option of the holders of such Notes, at 100% of the
    principal amount plus accrued interest. We may redeem the Notes
    in accordance with the terms of the agreement, in whole or in
    part at any time at our option.

On February 14, 2007, we commenced an offer to exchange the
    Notes for registered notes having substantially the same
    financial terms and covenants as the privately placed notes. The
    offer will expire, unless extended, on March 15, 2007.

The fair value of our Notes was approximately $520 million

The Notes are senior unsecured obligations guaranteed by certain
    domestic Expedia subsidiaries and rank equally in right of
    payment with all of our existing and future unsecured and
    unsubordinated obligations. For further information, see

    substantially all of our assets. As of December 31, 2006,
    we were in compliance with all covenants.

Ask
    Jeeves Notes

As a result of the Spin-Off, we assumed certain obligations to
    IAC related to IAC’s Ask Jeeves Notes. When holders of the
    Ask Jeeves Notes convert their notes, they will receive shares
    of both IAC and Expedia common stock. Under the terms of the
    Spin-Off, we are obligated to issue shares of our common stock
    to IAC for delivery to the holders of the Ask Jeeves Notes, or
    pay cash in equal value, in lieu of issuing such shares, at our
    option. This obligation represents a derivative liability on our
    consolidated balance sheet because it is not indexed solely to
    shares of our common stock. We record the fair value of this
    derivative obligation on our consolidated balance sheets with
    any changes in fair value recorded in our consolidated
    statements of income. The estimated fair value of this liability
    fluctuates primarily based on changes in the price of our common
    stock.

In 2006 and 2005, certain of these notes were converted and we
    released approximately 3.5 million and 37,000 shares
    of our common stock from escrow with a fair value of
    $80.8 million and $0.9 million to satisfy the
    conversion requirements. In 2006 and 2005, we recognized a net
    unrealized gain (loss) of $8.1 million and
    $(6.0) million related to these Ask Jeeves Notes.

As of December 31, 2006, we estimate that we could be
    required to release from escrow up to 0.8 million shares of
    our common stock (or pay cash in equal value, in lieu of issuing
    such shares, at our option). The Ask Jeeves Notes are due
    June 1, 2008; upon maturity of these notes, our obligation
    to satisfy demands for conversion ceases.

Cross-Currency
    Swaps

We enter into cross-currency swaps to hedge against the change
    in value of certain intercompany loans denominated in currencies
    other than the lending subsidiaries’ functional currency.

F-21


Expedia,
    Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

In November 2003, we entered into a swap with a notional amount
    of Euro 39.0 million that matures in October 2013. Under
    the terms of this swap, we pay Euro at a rate of the three-month
    EURIBOR plus 0.50% on Euro 39.0 million and we receive
    4.90% interest on $46.4 million in U.S. dollars.

In April 2004, we entered into a swap with a notional amount of
    Euro 38.2 million that matures in April 2014. Under the
    terms of this swap, we pay Euro at a rate of the six-month
    EURIBOR plus 0.90% on Euro 38.2 million and we receive
    5.47% interest on $45.9 million in U.S. dollars.

Upon maturity, these cross-currency swap agreements call for the
    exchange of notional amounts. These swaps have been designated
    as cash flow hedges and are re-measured at fair value each
    reporting period. The hedges have been determined to be
    perfectly effective, at designation and on an ongoing basis. As
    such, we record the total change in the fair value of the hedges
    in OCI each period, and concurrently reclassify a portion of the
    gain or loss to other income (expense), net to perfectly offset
    gains or losses related to transactional remeasurement of the
    hedged items. We are not able to predict future gains or losses
    due to remeasurement of the hedged items, or the equivalent
    reclassifications of the gains or losses on the hedges from
    accumulated OCI to earnings. There was no ineffectiveness
    related to these cash flow hedges for the years ended
    December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004.

In addition, as of December 31, 2006, we had
    $14.1 million of cash held by counterparties as collateral
    for our cross-currency swaps, which is classified in long-term
    investments and other assets on our consolidated balance sheet.

Stock
    Warrants

In connection with prior transactions, IAC assumed a number of
    stock warrants that were adjusted to become exercisable into IAC
    common stock and subsequent to the Spin-Off, also in our common
    stock. As of December 31, 2006, there are approximately
    42,700 of these stock warrants outstanding with expiration dates
    through May 2010. Each stock warrant represents the right to
    receive the number of shares of IAC common stock and Expedia
    common stock that the stock warrant holder would have received
    had the holder exercised the stock warrant immediately prior to
    the Spin-Off. Under the terms of the Spin-Off between IAC and
    Expedia, we assumed the obligation to deliver our common stock
    to the stock warrant holders upon exercise and will receive a
    portion of the proceeds from exercise. This obligation
    represents a derivative instrument that we record at fair value
    on our consolidated balance sheets with any changes in value
    recorded in our consolidated statements of income. The estimated
    fair value of this liability fluctuates based on changes in the
    price of our common stock.

NOTE 8 —
    Employee Benefit Plans

Our U.S. employees are generally eligible to participate in
    a retirement and savings plan that qualifies under
    Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Participating
    employees may contribute up to 16% of their pretax salary, but
    not more than statutory limits. We contribute fifty cents for
    each dollar a participant contributes in this plan, with a
    maximum contribution of 3% of a participant’s earnings. Our
    contribution vests with the employee after the employee
    completes two years of service. Participating employees have the
    option to invest in our common stock, but there is no
    requirement for participating employees to invest their
    contribution or our matching contribution in our common stock.
    We also have various defined contribution plans for our
    international employees. Our contributions to these benefit
    plans was $8.0 million, $6.0 million and
    $4.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2006,
    2005 and 2004.

NOTE 9 —

Stock-Based
    Awards and Other Equity Instruments

Pursuant to the 2005 Expedia, Inc. Stock and Annual Incentive
    Plan, we may grant restricted stock, restricted stock awards
    (“RSA”), RSUs, stock options and other stock-based
    awards to directors, officers, employees and consultants. As of
    December 31, 2006, we had approximately 7.1 million
    shares of common

Expedia,

Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

stock reserved for new stock-based awards under the 2005 Stock
    and Annual Incentive Plan. We issue new shares to satisfy the
    exercise or release of stock-based awards.

As described below in “Modification of Stock-Based
    Compensation Awards,” certain stock options, restricted
    stock, RSUs and other equity based awards granted to our
    employees, officers, directors and consultants by IAC prior to
    the Spin-Off were converted into awards based on our common
    stock in connection with the Spin-Off. For the period from
    January 1, 2005 to August 8, 2005, and for the year
    ended December 31, 2004, IAC allocated to us stock-based
    compensation expense that was attributable to our employees.

RSUs, which are stock awards that are granted to employees
    entitling the holder to shares of our common stock as the award
    vests, are our primary form of stock-based award. We record RSUs
    that will settle in cash as a liability and we remeasure them to
    fair value at the end of each reporting period. These awards
    that settle in cash and the resulting liability are
    insignificant. Our RSUs generally vest over five years, but may
    accelerate in certain circumstances, including changes in
    control.

We have fully vested stock warrants with expiration dates
    through February 2012 outstanding, certain of which trade on the
    NASDAQ under the symbols “EXPEW” and
    “EXPEZ.” Each stock warrant is exercisable for a
    certain number of shares of our common stock or a fraction
    thereof.

    December 31, 2006, based on our the closing stock price of
    $20.98 as of the last trading date. The total intrinsic value of
    stock options exercised was $34.7 million and
    $213.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2006
    and 2005. Since the Spin-off on August 9, 2005, we have not
    granted options. The expected to vest balance as of
    December 31, 2006 is equal to the outstanding balance at
    that date.

In 2006, 2005 and 2004, we recognized stock-based compensation
    expense of $80.3 million, $91.7 million and
    $171.4 million. In 2005, we recorded a cumulative benefit
    from the change in estimated forfeiture rates of approximately
    $43.4 million, which reduced the stock-based compensation
    expense. The total income tax benefit related to stock-based
    compensation expense was $27.0 million, $31.3 million
    and $64.5 million for 2006, 2005 and 2004.

Cash received from stock-based award exercises for the year
    ended December 31, 2006 was $35.3 million. Our
    employees that held vested stock options prior to the Spin-Off
    received vested stock options in both Expedia and IAC. As these
    stock options are exercised, we receive a tax deduction. Total
    current income tax benefits realized during the year ended
    December 31, 2006 associated with the exercise of IAC and
    Expedia stock-based awards held by our employees were
    $34.3 million, of which we recorded approximately
    $16.9 million as a reduction of goodwill.

As of December 31, 2006, there was approximately
    $145 million of unrecognized stock-based compensation
    expense, net of estimated forfeitures, related to unvested
    stock-based awards, which is expected to be recognized in
    expense over a weighted-average period of 1.7 years.

Modification
    of Stock-Based Awards

In connection with the Spin-Off, all existing IAC stock-based
    awards, which included RSUs, stock options and warrants, were
    converted as follows:

•

each vested stock option to purchase shares of IAC common stock
    converted into an option to purchase shares of IAC common stock
    and an option to purchase shares of Expedia common stock,

•

each unvested stock option to purchase shares of IAC common
    stock converted into a stock option to purchase shares of common
    stock of the applicable company for which the employee worked
    following the Spin-Off,

•

all RSUs converted into RSUs of the applicable company for which
    the employee worked following the Spin-Off, and

F-25


Expedia,
    Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

•

each vested and unvested warrant converted into a warrant to
    purchase shares of IAC common stock and a warrant to purchase
    shares of Expedia common stock.

The adjustments to the number of shares subject to each option
    and the option exercise prices were based on the relative market
    capitalization of IAC and Expedia following the Spin-Off. These
    modifications resulted in a one- time expense of
    $5.4 million due to the increase in the estimated fair
    value of vested stock options. Expenses related to incremental
    value due to modification of warrants, RSUs and unvested stock
    options were not material.

For all periods presented, we have computed current and deferred
    tax expense using our stand-alone effective tax rate. As of
    December 31, 2006, our current income tax payable
    represents amounts that we will pay to the Internal Revenue
    Service and other tax authorities based on our taxable income.

For the period January 1, 2005 through the Spin-Off date,
    we were a member of the IAC consolidated tax group. Accordingly,
    IAC filed a federal income tax return and certain state income
    tax returns on a combined basis with us for that period. IAC
    paid the entire combined income tax liability related to these
    filings. As such, our estimated income tax liability for this
    period was transferred to IAC upon Spin-Off and is not included
    in income taxes payable at December 31, 2005. Under the
    terms of the Tax Sharing Agreement, IAC can make certain
    elections in preparation of these tax returns, which may change
    the amount of income taxes we owe for the period after the
    Spin-Off. We intend to record such changes as adjustments to

We reduced our current income tax payable by $34.3 million,
    $50.6 million and $120.8 million for the years ended
    December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, for tax deductions
    attributable to stock-based compensation. For 2006 and 2005, we
    recorded $16.9 million and $25.3 million of the
    related income tax benefits of this stock-based compensation as
    a reduction of goodwill.

The tax effect of cumulative temporary differences and net

At December 31, 2006, we had state and foreign net
    operating loss carryforwards (“NOLs”) of approximately
    $43.0 million and $49.0 million. If not utilized, the
    state NOLs will expire at various times between 2007 and 2025,
    $46.8 million foreign NOLs can be carried forward
    indefinitely, and $2.2 million foreign NOLs will expire at
    various times between 2007 and 2011.

At December 31, 2006, we had a valuation allowance of
    approximately $24.2 million related to the portion of tax
    operating loss carryforwards and other items for which it is
    more likely than not that the tax benefit will not be realized.
    This amount represented a decrease of approximately
    $1.3 million over the amount recorded as of
    December 31, 2005 and was primarily attributable to a
    reduction of state NOLs, offset by an increase in foreign
    operating losses. The tax benefit for approximately
    $3.5 million of the valuation allowance recorded at
    December 31, 2006 will be recorded as a reduction of
    goodwill if recognized in future years.

By virtue of the previously filed separate company and
    consolidated income tax returns filed with IAC, we are routinely
    under audit by federal, state, local and foreign authorities.
    These audits include questioning the timing and the amount of
    deductions and the allocation of income among various tax
    jurisdictions. Annual tax provisions include amounts considered
    sufficient to pay assessments that may result from the
    examination of prior year returns; however, the amount
    ultimately paid upon resolution of issues raised may differ from
    the amount provided. Differences between our contingent tax
    liabilities and the amounts actually owed are recorded in the
    period they become known.

In addition, we have a tax allocation agreement with Microsoft
    Corporation (“Microsoft”) as well as the Tax Sharing
    Agreement with IAC. For additional information about these
    agreements, see Note 15 — Related Party
    Transactions.

    Stockholders’ Equity

Common
    Stock and Class B Common Stock

Our authorized common stock consists of 1.6 billion shares
    of common stock with par value of $0.001 per share, and
    400 million shares of Class B common stock with par
    value of $0.001 per share. Both classes of common stock
    qualify for and would share equally in dividends, if declared by
    our Board of Directors, and generally vote together on all
    matters. Common stock is entitled to one vote per share and
    Class B common stock is entitled to 10 votes per share.
    Holders of common stock, voting as a single, separate class are
    entitled to elect 25% of the total number of directors.
    Class B common stockholders may, at any time, convert their
    shares into common stock, on a one for one share basis. Upon
    conversion, the Class B common stock is retired and is not
    available for reissue. In the event of liquidation, dissolution,
    distribution of assets or

winding-up

of Expedia, Inc., the holders of both classes of common stock
    have equal rights to receive all the assets of Expedia, Inc.
    after the rights of the holders of the preferred stock have been
    satisfied.

Preferred
    Stock

Our preferred stock has a face value of $22.23 per share;
    each share is entitled to an annual dividend of 1.99%. Each
    preferred stockholder is entitled to two votes per share.
    Preferred stockholders may, at certain times through 2017, elect
    to have their shares redeemed or elect to convert their shares
    into common stock based upon formulas described in the related
    Certificate of Designations of Series A Cumulative
    Convertible Preferred Stock of Expedia, Inc. Beginning
    February 4, 2012, we may redeem the preferred stock for
    cash or common stock. On February 4, 2022, all outstanding
    shares of preferred stock automatically convert into common
    stock.

Share
    Repurchases

During 2006, we completed the repurchase of 20 million
    shares of our common stock for a total cost of
    $288 million, representing an average price of
    $14.42 per share including transaction costs. All shares
    were repurchased in the open market at prevailing market prices.

In addition, our Board of Directors authorized additional share
    repurchases of up to 20 million outstanding shares of our
    common stock during 2006. As of February 15, 2007, we have
    not made any share repurchases under this authorization. There
    is no fixed termination date for the repurchase.

On January 19, 2007, we completed a tender offer pursuant
    to which we acquired 30 million tendered shares of our
    common stock at a purchase price of $22.00 per share, for a
    total cost of $660 million plus fees and expenses relating
    to the tender offer. These shares represent approximately 9.8%
    of the shares of common stock outstanding and 9.0% of the total
    number of shares of common stock and Class B common stock
    outstanding as of December 31, 2006. We paid for the
    tendered shares, in part, by drawing on our revolving credit

As such, we

NOTE 12 —
    Earnings Per Share

Basic
    Earnings Per Share

Basic earnings per share was calculated for the year ended
    December 31, 2006 using the weighted average number of
    common and Class B common shares outstanding during the
    period excluding restricted stock and stock held in escrow. We
    have 846 shares of preferred stock outstanding, the impact
    of which on our earnings per share calculation is immaterial.

For the year ended December 31, 2005, we computed basic
    earnings per share using the number of shares of common stock
    and Class B common stock outstanding immediately following
    the Spin-Off, as if such shares were outstanding for the entire
    period prior to the Spin-Off, plus the weighted average of such
    shares outstanding following the Spin-Off. For the year ended
    December 31, 2004, we computed basic earnings per share
    using the number of shares of common stock and Class B
    common stock outstanding immediately following the Spin-Off, as
    if such shares were outstanding for the entire period.

Diluted
    Earnings Per Share

For the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, we computed
    diluted earnings per share using (i) the number of shares
    of common stock and Class B common stock used in the basic
    earnings per share calculation

F-30


Expedia,
    Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

as indicated above (ii) if dilutive, the incremental common
    stock that we would issue upon the assumed exercise of stock
    options and stock warrants and the vesting of restricted stock
    units using the treasury stock method, and (iii) the shares
    we are contractually obligated to issue associated with the Ask
    Jeeves Notes, if converted, and other stock-based commitments.

For the year ended December 31, 2004, we computed diluted
    earnings per share using (i) the number of shares of common
    stock and Class B common stock used in the basic earnings
    per share calculation as indicated above, and (ii) if
    dilutive, the incremental common stock that we would issue upon
    exercise of potentially dilutive stock-based commitments if the
    terms of the agreement under which the commitments were issued
    obligate us to issue the instrument as of the Spin-Off. Some of
    the stock warrant agreements meet this requirement, but options
    to purchase common stock and other potentially dilutive items do
    not. Warrants meeting this requirement were included in our
    diluted earnings per share calculation for the year ended
    December 31, 2004, based on the number of days they were
    outstanding at Spin-Off. We treated all other securities as if
    they were granted as of the Spin-Off.

Write-off
    of Long-term Investment

In 2005, we received information regarding the deteriorating
    financial condition of our long-term investment in a leisure
    travel company and we determined that it was not likely we would
    recover any of our investment because the decline in its value
    was determined to be

other-than-temporary.

As a result, we recorded a loss related to this impairment of
    $23.4 million in write-off of long-term investment in our
    consolidated statements of income. In 2006, we sold our
    investment for nil consideration.

Our purchase obligations represent the minimum obligations we
    have under agreements with certain of our vendors. These minimum
    obligations are less than our projected use for those periods.
    Payments may be more than the minimum obligations based on
    actual use. In addition, if certain obligations are met by our
    counterparties, our obligations will increase.

We have guarantees primarily related to a specific country
    aviation authority for the potential non-delivery, by us, of
    packaged travel sold in that country. The authority also
    requires that a portion of the total amount of packaged travel
    sold be bonded.

Our LOCs consist of stand-by LOCs, underwritten by a group of
    lenders, which we primarily issue to certain hotel properties to
    secure our payment for hotel room transactions. There were no
    claims made against any stand-by LOCs during the years ended
    December 31, 2006 and 2005.

Lease
    Commitments

We have contractual obligations in the form of operating leases
    for office space and related office equipment for which we
    record the related expense on a monthly basis. Certain leases
    contain periodic rent escalation adjustments and renewal
    options. Rent expense related to such leases is recorded on a
    straight-line basis. Operating lease obligations expire at
    various dates with the latest maturity in 2014. For the years
    ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, we recorded rental
    expense of $29.7 million, $26.0 million and
    $23.6 million.

Legal
    Proceedings

In the ordinary course of business, we are a party to various
    lawsuits. In the opinion of management, we do not expect these
    lawsuits to have a material impact on the liquidity, results of
    operations, or financial condition of Expedia. We also evaluate
    other potential contingent matters, including value-added tax,
    federal excise tax, transient occupancy or accommodation tax and
    similar matters. We do not believe that the aggregate amount of
    liability that could be reasonably possible with respect to
    these matters would have a material adverse affect on our
    financial results.

Securities Related Class Action
    Litigations.

While we are not a party to the
    securities litigation filed against IAC, under the terms of our
    Separation Agreement with IAC, we have generally agreed to bear
    a portion of the costs and liabilities, if any, associated with
    any securities law litigation relating to conduct prior to the
    Spin-Off of the businesses or entities that comprise Expedia
    following the Spin-Off. This case arises out of IAC’s
    August 4, 2004, announcement of its earnings for the second
    quarter of 2004.

Litigation relating to the IAC/Hotels.com merger agreement
    announced April 10, 2003, is pending in Delaware. The
    principal claim in these actions is that the defendants breached
    their fiduciary duty to the plaintiffs by entering into or
    approving the merger agreement.

Hotels.com is also a party to a securities class action and a
    shareholder derivative suit relating to Hotels.com’s
    guidance for the fourth quarter of 2002. The principal claim in
    these actions is that the defendants violated federal securities
    laws by making misstatements of material facts, failing to
    disclose material information, and trading in the company’s
    securities while in possession of material, non-public
    information. In 2004, the court dismissed virtually all of the
    plaintiffs’ claims with prejudice in the securities class
    action. In the shareholder derivative suit, on March 7,
    2005, the district court issued orders staying the case until
    further notice and directing that the case be administratively
    closed pending a decision in the appeal of the action discussed
    above. The case remains administratively closed.

Litigation Relating to Hotel Occupancy
    Taxes.

Expedia and certain of its businesses are
    parties to consumer and municipality litigation involving hotel
    occupancy taxes.

    Related Party Transactions

Expenses
    Allocated from IAC

Prior to Spin-Off, our operating expenses include allocations
    from IAC for accounting, treasury, legal, tax, corporate
    support, human resource functions and internal audit. Expenses
    allocated from IAC were $5.0 million for the period from
    January 1, 2005 to August 8, 2005, and
    $7.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. We
    recorded the expense allocation from IAC in general and
    administrative expense in our consolidated statements of income.

F-33


Expedia,
    Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

Additional allocations from IAC prior to the Spin-Off related to
    stock-based compensation expense attributable to our employees.
    Stock-based compensation expense allocated from IAC was
    $56.5 million for the period from January 1, 2005 to
    August 8, 2005, and $171.4 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2004.

Interest
    Income from IAC

The interest income from IAC/InterActiveCorp recorded in our
    consolidated statements of income for the years ended
    December 31, 2005 and 2004 arose from intercompany
    receivable balances from IAC. The interest income from IAC
    ceased upon Spin-Off on August 9, 2005.

Relationship
    Between IAC and Expedia, Inc. after the Spin-Off

In connection with the Spin-Off, we entered into various
    agreements with IAC, a related party due to common ownership, to
    provide for an orderly transition and to govern our ongoing
    relationships with IAC. These agreements include the following:

•

a Separation Agreement that sets forth the arrangements between
    IAC and Expedia with respect to the principal corporate
    transactions necessary to complete the Spin-Off, and a number of
    other principles governing the relationship between IAC and
    Expedia following the Spin-Off;

•

a Tax Sharing Agreement that governs the respective rights,
    responsibilities and obligations of IAC and Expedia after the
    Spin-Off with respect to tax liabilities and benefits, tax
    attributes, tax contests and other matters regarding income
    taxes, other taxes and related tax returns;

•

an Employee Matters Agreement that governs a wide range of
    compensation and benefit issues, including the allocation
    between IAC and Expedia of responsibility for the employment and
    benefit obligations and liabilities of each company’s
    current and former employees (and their dependents and
    beneficiaries); and

•

a Transition Services Agreement that governs the provision of
    transition services from IAC to Expedia.

In addition, in conjunction with the Spin-Off, we entered into a
    joint ownership and cost sharing agreement with IAC, under which
    IAC transferred to us 50% ownership in an airplane, which is
    available for use by both companies. We share equally in capital
    costs; operating costs are pro-rated based on actual usage. In
    May 2006, the airplane was placed in service and is being
    depreciated over 10 years. As of December 31, 2006,
    the net basis in our ownership interest was $19.7 million
    recorded in long-term investments and other assets on our
    consolidated balance sheets. In 2006, operating and maintenance
    costs for the airplane were $0.6 million. We had
    $0.3 million in related accounts payable as of
    December 31, 2006.

Commercial
    Agreements with IAC

Since the Spin-Off, we have continued to work with some of
    IAC’s businesses pursuant to a variety of commercial
    relationships. These commercial agreements generally include
    (i) distribution agreements, pursuant to which certain
    subsidiaries of IAC distribute their respective products and
    services via arrangements with Expedia, and vice versa,
    (ii) services agreements, pursuant to which certain
    subsidiaries of IAC provide Expedia with various services and
    vice versa and (iii) office space lease agreements. The
    distribution agreements typically involve the payment of fees,
    usually on a fixed

amount-per-transaction,

revenue share or commission basis, from the party seeking
    distribution of the product or service to the party that is
    providing the distribution.

In 2006, we received $1.9 million from IAC businesses, and
    paid $31.3 million to IAC businesses. From August 9,
    2005 to December 31, 2005, we received $0.8 million
    from IAC businesses and paid $10.7 million to IAC
    businesses. Amounts receivable from IAC businesses, which are
    included in accounts and notes receivable, totaled
    $0.6 million as of December 31, 2005. Amounts payable
    to IAC businesses, which are

F-34

    Statements — (Continued)

included in accounts payable, other, totaled $1.1 million
    as of December 31, 2006, and $3.6 million as of
    December 31, 2005.

Other
    Transactions with IAC

In the fourth quarter of 2006, eLong sold one of its businesses
    to a subsidiary of IAC for a sale price of $14.6 million of
    which we received $13.2 million in cash in 2006.

Agreements
    with Microsoft Corporation

We have various agreements with Microsoft, which is the
    beneficial owner of more than 5% of our outstanding common
    stock, including an agreement that maintains our presence as the
    provider of travel shopping services on MSN.com and several
    international MSN websites and, in 2004, a data center services
    agreement. Total fees we paid with respect to these agreements
    were $26.5 million, $20.0 million and
    $12.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2006,
    2005 and 2004.

Prior to November 1999, Microsoft owned 100% of our outstanding
    common stock. Concurrent with our separation from them, we
    entered into a tax allocation agreement whereby we must pay
    Microsoft for a portion of the tax savings resulting from the
    exercise of certain stock options when we realize the tax
    savings on our tax return. We recorded $36.3 million in
    other long-term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets
    as of December 31, 2005 related to this agreement. As of
    December 31, 2006, we realized $6.0 million of tax
    savings on our tax return, and remitted an equivalent amount to
    Microsoft during the fourth quarter of 2006. As of
    December 31, 2006, we reclassified the remaining
    $30.3 million to other current liabilities from other
    long-term liabilities, which we anticipate paying by the end of
    2007.

NOTE 16 —
    Segment Information

In the first quarter of 2006, we began reporting two segments:
    North America and Europe. The change from a single reportable
    segment is a result of the reorganization of our business. We
    determined our segments based on how our chief operating
    decision makers manage our business, make operating decisions
    and evaluate operating performance. Our primary operating metric
    for evaluating segment performance is “Operating Income
    Before Amortization” (defined below), which includes
    allocations of certain expenses, primarily cost of revenue and
    facilities, to the segments. We base the allocations primarily
    on transaction volumes and other usage metrics; this methodology
    is periodically evaluated and may change. We do not allocate
    certain expenses to reportable segments such as partner
    services, product development, accounting, human resources and
    legal. We include these expenses in Corporate and Other.

Our North America segment provides a full range of travel
    services to customers in the United States, Canada and Mexico.
    This segment operates through a variety of brands including
    Expedia, Hotels.com, Hotwire.com TripAdvisor and Classic
    Vacations. Our Europe segment provides travel services primarily
    through localized Expedia websites in the United Kingdom,
    Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway and
    Sweden, as well as localized versions of Hotels.com in various
    European countries.

Corporate and Other includes ECT, Expedia Asia Pacific and
    unallocated corporate functions and expenses. ECT provides
    travel products and services to corporate customers in North
    America and Europe. Expedia Asia Pacific provides online travel
    information and reservation services primarily in Australia, the
    People’s Republic of China and Japan, whose site launched
    in November 2006. In addition, we record amortization of
    intangible assets and any related impairment, as well as
    stock-based compensation expense in Corporate and Other.

Notes to Consolidated Financial

The following table presents our segment information for the
    year ended December 31, 2006. We have not reported segment
    information for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004,
    as it is not practicable to do so. In addition, as a significant
    portion of our property and equipment is not allocated to our
    operating segments, we do not report the assets or related
    depreciation expense as it would not be meaningful, nor do we
    regularly provide such information to our chief operating
    decision makers.

Definition
    of Operating Income Before Amortization
    (“OIBA”)

We provide OIBA as a supplemental measure to GAAP. We define
    OIBA as operating income plus: (1) amortization of non-cash
    distribution and marketing expense, (2) stock-based
    compensation expense, (3) amortization of intangible assets
    and goodwill and intangible asset impairment, if applicable and
    (4) certain one-time items, if applicable.

OIBA is the primary operating metric used by which management
    evaluates the performance of our business, on which internal
    budgets are based, and by which management is compensated.
    Management believes that investors should have access to the
    same set of tools that management uses to analyze our results.
    This non-GAAP measure should be considered in addition to
    results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be
    considered a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP. We endeavor
    to compensate for the limitation of the non-GAAP measure
    presented by also providing the comparable GAAP measures, GAAP
    financial statements, and descriptions of the reconciling items
    and adjustments, to derive the non-GAAP measure. We present a
    reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial measure to GAAP below.

OIBA represents the combined operating results of Expedia,
    Inc.’s businesses, taking into account depreciation, which
    we believe is an ongoing cost of doing business, but excluding
    the effects of other non-cash expenses that may not be
    indicative of our core business operations. We believe this
    measure is useful to investors for the following reasons:

•

it corresponds more closely to the cash operating income
    generated from our core operations by excluding significant
    non-cash operating expenses;

•

it aids in forecasting and analyzing future operating income as
    stock-based compensation, non-cash distribution and marketing
    expenses and intangible assets amortization, assuming no
    subsequent acquisitions, are likely to decline going
    forward; and

F-36


Expedia,
    Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

•

it provides greater insight into management decision making at
    Expedia, as OIBA is our primary internal metric for evaluating
    the performance of our business.

OIBA has certain limitations in that it does not take into
    account the impact of certain expenses to our consolidated
    statements of income, including stock-based compensation,
    non-cash payments to partners, acquisition-related accounting
    and certain one-time items, if applicable. Due to the high
    variability and difficulty in predicting certain items that
    affect net income, such as tax rates, stock price and interest
    rates, we are unable to provide a reconciliation to net income
    on a forward-looking basis without unreasonable efforts.

    of OIBA to Operating Income and Net Income
