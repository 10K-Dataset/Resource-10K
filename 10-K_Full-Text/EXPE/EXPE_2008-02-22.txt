Forward-Looking
    Statements

This Annual Report on

Form 10-K

contains “forward-looking statements” within the
    meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
    These forward-looking statements reflect the views of our
    management regarding current expectations and projections about
    future events and are based on currently available information.
    Actual results could differ materially from those contained in
    these forward-looking statements for a variety of reasons,
    including, but not limited to, those discussed in the section
    entitled “Risk Factors” as well as those discussed
    elsewhere in this report. Other unknown or unpredictable factors
    also could have a material adverse effect on our business,
    financial condition and results of operations. Accordingly,
    readers should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking
    statements. The use of words such as “anticipates,”
    “estimates,” “expects,” “intends,”
    “plans” and “believes,” among others,
    generally identify forward-looking statements; however, these
    words are not the exclusive means of identifying such
    statements. In addition, any statements that refer to
    expectations, projections or other characterizations of future
    events or circumstances are forward-looking statements. These
    forward-looking statements are inherently subject to
    uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are
    difficult to predict. We are not under any obligation and do not
    intend to publicly update or review any of these forward-looking
    statements, whether as a result of new information, future
    events or otherwise, even if experience or future events make it
    clear that any expected results expressed or implied by those
    forward-looking statements will not be realized. Please
    carefully review and consider the various disclosures made in
    this report and in our other reports filed with the Securities
    and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) that attempt to advise
    interested parties of the risks and factors that may affect our
    business, prospects and results of operations.

Management
    Overview

General
    Description of our Business

Expedia, Inc. is an online travel company, empowering business
    and leisure travelers with the tools and information they need
    to efficiently research, plan, book and experience travel. We
    have created a global travel marketplace used by a broad range
    of leisure and corporate travelers, offline retail travel agents
    and travel service providers. We make available, on a
    stand-alone and package basis, travel products and services
    provided by numerous airlines, lodging properties, car rental
    companies, destination service providers, cruise lines and other
    travel product and service companies. We also offer travel and
    non-travel advertisers access to a potential source of
    incremental traffic and transactions through our various media
    and advertising offerings on both the TripAdvisor Media Network
    and on our transaction-based websites.

Our portfolio of brands, which is described below, includes:
    Expedia.com

,
    Hotels.com

,
    Worldwide Travel Exchange (“WWTE”), Interactive

    In addition, many of these brands have corresponding

    subsidiaries collectively as “Expedia,” the
    “Company,” “us,” “we” and
    “our” in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Summary
    of the Spin-Off from IAC/InterActiveCorp

On December 21, 2004, IAC/InterActiveCorp (“IAC”)
    announced its plan to separate into two independent public
    companies to allow each company to focus on its individual
    strategic objectives. We refer to this transaction as the
    “Spin-Off.” A new company, Expedia, Inc., was
    incorporated under Delaware law in April 2005, to hold
    substantially all of IAC’s travel and travel-related
    businesses.

On August 9, 2005, the Spin-Off was completed and Expedia,
    Inc. shares began trading on The Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc.
    (“NASDAQ”) under the symbol “EXPE.” In
    conjunction with the Spin-Off, we completed



the following transactions: (1) transferred to IAC all cash
    in excess of $100 million, excluding the cash and cash
    equivalents held by eLong; (2) extinguished all
    intercompany receivable balances from IAC, which totaled
    $2.5 billion, by recording a non-cash distribution to IAC;
    (3) recorded a non-cash contribution from IAC of a joint
    ownership interest in an airplane, with a value of
    $17.4 million; (4) recorded a non-cash contribution of
    media time, with a value of $17.1 million;
    (5) recorded derivative liabilities for stock warrants and
    Ask Jeeves Convertible Subordinated Notes (“Ask Jeeves
    Notes”) with a fair value of $101.6 million;
    (6) recorded a modification of stock-based compensation
    awards of $5.4 million; and (7) recapitalized the
    invested equity balance with common stock, Class B common
    stock and preferred stock, whereby holders of IAC stock received
    shares of Expedia stock based on a formula.

Equity
    Ownership and Voting Control

As of December 31, 2007, there were approximately
    259,489,102 shares of Expedia common stock,
    25,599,998 shares of Expedia Class B common stock and
    751 shares of Expedia preferred stock outstanding. Liberty
    Media Corporation (“Liberty”), through companies owned
    by Liberty and companies owned jointly by Liberty and Barry
    Diller, Chairman and Senior Executive of Expedia, beneficially
    owned approximately 28% of Expedia’s outstanding common
    stock and 100% of Expedia’s outstanding Class B common
    stock. As of such date, Mr. Diller (through his own
    holdings and holdings of Liberty, over which Mr. Diller
    generally has voting control pursuant to an irrevocable proxy
    granted by Liberty under the Stockholders Agreement described
    below) controlled approximately 60% of the outstanding total
    voting power of Expedia.

Pursuant to the Stockholders Agreement, dated as of
    August 9, 2005, as amended between Liberty and
    Mr. Diller, Mr. Diller is effectively able to control
    the outcome of nearly all matters submitted to a vote or for the
    consent of Expedia’s stockholders (other than with respect
    to the election by the Expedia common stockholders of 25% of the
    members of Expedia’s Board of Directors and certain matters
    as to which a separate class vote of the holders of Expedia
    common stock or Expedia preferred stock is required under
    Delaware law). In addition, pursuant to the Governance
    Agreement, dated as of August 9, 2005, among Expedia,
    Liberty and Mr. Diller, each of Mr. Diller and Liberty
    generally has the right to consent to certain significant
    corporate actions in the event that Expedia or any of its
    subsidiaries incurs any new obligations for borrowed money
    within the definition of “total debt” set forth in the
    Governance Agreement for as long as Expedia’s ratio of
    total debt to EBITDA, as defined therein, equals or exceeds
    eight to one.

Portfolio
    of Brands

Expedia leverages its brand portfolio to target the broadest
    possible range of travelers, travel suppliers and advertisers.
    Our brands provide a wide selection of travel products and
    services, from simple, discounted travel to more complex, luxury
    travel. Our travel offerings primarily consist of airline
    flights, hotel stays, car rentals, destination services, cruises
    and package travel, which encompasses multiple travel products.
    We also offer travel and non-travel advertisers access to a
    potential source of incremental traffic and transactions through
    our various media and advertising offerings on both the
    TripAdvisor Media Network and on our transaction-based websites.

Expedia.com

®

.  Our
    Expedia-branded websites make a large variety of travel products
    and services available directly to travelers through our

U.S.-based

website, www.expedia.com, as well as through localized versions
    of the Expedia website in Australia, Austria, Canada, Denmark,
    France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, New
    Zealand, Norway, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom.
    Expedia-branded websites also serve as the travel channel on
    MSN.com, Microsoft Corporation’s (“Microsoft”)
    online services network in the United States, as well as certain
    international MSN sites. Expedia-branded websites target many
    different types of travelers, from families booking a summer
    vacation to individual travelers arranging a quick weekend
    getaway. Travelers can search for, compare information about
    (including pricing, availability and traveler reviews) and book
    travel products and services on Expedia-branded websites,
    including airline tickets, lodging, car rentals, cruises and
    many destination services — such as airport transfers,
    local attractions and tours — from a large number of
    suppliers, on both a stand-alone and package basis.



Hotels.com

®

.

Our
    Hotels.com website makes available nearly 80,000 hotel
    properties to travelers, who can plan, shop for and book lodging
    accommodations, from traditional hotels to vacation rentals.
    Hotels.com seeks to provide travelers with premium content and
    service through our

U.S.-based

website, www.hotels.com, as well as through localized versions
    in the Americas, Europe, Asia Pacific and South Africa. With
    Hotels.com, we differentiate our offering by positioning the
    brand as the hotel expert, with premium content about lodging
    properties.

Hotwire.com

tm

.  Our
    discount travel website, Hotwire.com, makes available airline
    tickets, hotel rooms, rental cars, cruises and vacation
    packages. Hotwire.com’s approach matches flexible,
    price-sensitive travelers with suppliers who have excess seats,
    rooms and cars they wish to fill without affecting the
    public’s perception of their brands. Hotwire.com travelers
    may enjoy significant discounts by electing to book travel
    services “opaquely”, without knowing certain itinerary
    details such as brand, time of departure and exact hotel
    location, while suppliers create value from excess inventory
    without diluting their core brand-loyal traveler base. Recent
    product innovation allows air travelers to discover available
    discounts by altering details of their air travel plans such as
    date of departure or destination airport. Hotwire.com works with
    many domestic and international airlines, including
    U.S. full-service major network airlines, top hotels in
    hundreds of cities and resort destinations in the United States,
    Europe, Canada, Mexico and the Caribbean and major car rental
    companies in the United States.

Worldwide Travel Exchange and Interactive Affiliate
    Network.

Our private label and co-brand programs
    make travel products and services available to travelers through
    third-party company-branded websites. The products and services
    made available through our websites, www.wwte.com and
    www.ian.com, are substantially similar to those made available
    on Expedia-branded and Hotels.com-branded websites,
    respectively. We generally compensate participants in the
    WWTE

®

and
    IAN

tm

private label programs on a revenue-share basis. We also
    leverage our WWTE and IAN platforms to make Expedia and
    Hotels.com branded sites available in various international
    points of sale.

Classic
    Vacations

®

.  Classic
    Vacations offers individually tailored vacations primarily
    through a national network of third-party retail travel agents.
    We deliver a full line of premium vacation packages —
    air, hotels, car rentals, activities and private
    transportation — to create customized luxury vacations
    in Hawaii, the Caribbean, Mexico, Costa Rica, Europe, Australia,
    New Zealand, Fiji and Tahiti. Travel agents and travelers can
    preview our product offering through our websites,
    www.classicforagents.com and www.classicvacations.com.

Expedia Local Expert.

Our network of travel
    desks located at hotels and resorts in Hawaii, Las Vegas,
    Mexico, Orlando and San Francisco enables travelers to
    enjoy local tours, attractions and dining, as well as purchase
    airport transfers and other travel-related services. Our network
    expanded through our acquisition of Activity World and Activity
    Hut, destination service providers in Hawaii in 2004 and 2006,
    and our 2005 acquisition of Premier Getaways in Florida.

Expedia

®

Corporate Travel.

Our full-service travel
    management company makes travel products and services available
    to corporate travelers in the United States, Canada, China and
    Europe. In 2004, we established ECT — Europe, which
    includes Egencia and World Travel Management, both of which were
    acquired in 2004. ECT provides, among other things, centralized
    booking tools for employees of our corporate travelers, support
    of negotiated supplier rates and consolidated reporting targeted
    to the “SME” (Small & Medium size
    Enterprise) business segment. ECT charges its corporate client
    companies account management fees, as well as transactional fees
    for making or changing bookings. In addition, ECT provides

on-site

agents to some corporate clients in order to more fully support
    the account.

eLong

tm

.  Our
    majority-owned online travel service company, based in Beijing,
    China, specializes in travel products and services in China.
    eLong uses web-based distribution technologies and a

24-hour

Business
    Strategy

We play a fundamental role in facilitating travel, whether for
    leisure or business. We are committed to providing our travelers
    with the best set of resources to serve their travel needs by
    taking advantage of our critical assets — our brand
    portfolio, our technology and commitment to continuous
    innovation, our global reach and our breadth of product
    offering. In addition, we take advantage of our growing base of
    knowledge about our destinations, suppliers and travelers based
    on our unique position in the travel value chain.

A discussion of the critical assets that we leverage in
    achieving our business strategy follows:

Portfolio of Travel Brands.

We seek to appeal
    to the broadest possible range of travelers and suppliers
    through our collection of industry-leading brands. We target
    several different demographics, from the value-conscious
    traveler through our Hotwire brand to luxury travelers seeking a
    high-touch, customized vacation package through our Classic
    Vacations brand. We believe our flagship Expedia brand appeals
    to the broadest range of travelers, with our extensive product
    offering ranging from single item bookings of discounted product
    to complex bundling of higher-end travel packages. Our
    Hotels.com site and its international versions target travelers
    with premium content about lodging properties, and generally
    appeal to travelers with shorter booking windows who prefer to
    drive to their destinations. Our brands also enable travelers to
    interact with us how and when they prefer with 24/7 1-800
    telesales service, which has become an increasingly important
    part of the Company’s growth strategy.

We believe our appeal to suppliers is enhanced by our breadth of
    brands and international points of sale, allowing suppliers to
    offer the industry’s broadest range of online travelers
    their product and service offerings. We intend to continue
    supporting and investing in our brand portfolio and expanding
    our geographic footprint for the benefit of our travelers,
    suppliers and advertisers.

Technology and Continuous Innovation.

Expedia
    has an established tradition of innovation, from
    Expedia.com’s inception as a division of Microsoft, to our
    introduction of more recent innovations such as
    Expedia.com’s TravelAds sponsored search product for hotel
    advertisers, Hotwire’s Airfare Savings Hub,
    Hotels.com’s slider tools for improving search results and
    the TripAdvisor Media Network’s offering of leading travel
    applications for download on Facebook.com.

We intend to continue to aggressively innovate on behalf of our
    travelers, suppliers and advertisers, including our current
    efforts to build a scaleable, service-oriented technology
    platform for our various websites across our portfolio of
    brands. We expect this to result in improved flexibility and
    faster innovation. This transition should allow us to improve
    our site merchandising, browse and search functionality, improve
    search engine indexing, and add significant personalization
    features. This transition is occurring in a phased approach,
    with a portion of our worldwide points of sale continuing to
    migrate to the new platform during 2008.

For our suppliers, we have developed proprietary technology that
    streamlines the interaction between some of our websites and
    hotel central reservation systems, making it easier for hotels
    to manage reservations made through our brands. Through this
    “direct connect” technology, hotels can upload
    information about available products and services and rates
    directly from their central reservation systems into our
    websites, as well as automatically confirm hotel reservations
    made by our travelers. In the absence of direct connect
    technology, both of these processes are generally completed
    manually via a proprietary extranet.



Our travelers can now book hotel stays with over 35,000
    worldwide merchant hotel properties, of which over 45% are now
    fully direct-connected. We began offering a more streamlined
    application programming interface for certain of our lodging
    partners in 2007 to enable faster and simpler integration of
    real-time hotel content. We intend to continue investing in
    tools to make supplier integration easier, seamless and cost
    effective, including efforts in Europe to add multi-lingual
    interfaces with easier price and inventory upload features.

We are also improving our data handling capabilities across
    Expedia with the installation of an enterprise data warehouse,
    which will allow enhanced segmentation and merchandising on our
    websites and in our

e-mail

communications with our travelers.

Global Reach.

We currently operate our points
    of sale both in the U.S. and internationally. Our Hotels.com and
    TripAdvisor brands also maintain both U.S. websites and
    international sites outside the United States. We also
    offer Chinese travelers an array of products and services
    through our majority ownership in eLong. In 2007, our European
    segment gross bookings and revenue accounted for approximately
    21% of worldwide gross bookings and 23% of worldwide revenue.

We intend to continue investing in and growing our existing
    international points of sale. We anticipate launching points of
    sale in additional countries where we find large travel markets
    and rapid growth of online commerce. Future launches may occur
    under our flagship Expedia brand, through one of our other
    brands, or through acquisition of third-party brands, as in the
    case of eLong.

Expedia Corporate Travel currently operates in the United
    States, Belgium, Canada, China, France, Germany, Italy, Spain
    and the United Kingdom. We believe the corporate travel sector
    represents a large opportunity for Expedia, and we believe we
    offer a compelling technology solution to businesses seeking to
    control travel costs and improve their employees’ travel
    experiences. We intend to continue investing in and expanding
    the geographic footprint of our ECT business.

In expanding our global reach, we leverage significant
    investments in technology, operations, brand building, supplier
    relationships and other initiatives that we have made since the
    launch of Expedia.com in 1996. We intend to continue leveraging
    this investment when launching additional points of sale in new
    countries, introducing website features, adding supplier
    products and services, or offering proprietary and
    user-generated content for travelers.

Expedia’s scale of operations enhances the value of
    technology innovations we introduce on behalf of our travelers
    and suppliers. As an example, our traveler review
    feature — whereby Expedia travelers have created
    nearly 300,000 qualified reviews of hotel properties —
    is able to accumulate a larger base of reviews due to the higher
    base of online traffic that frequents our various websites. In
    addition, our increasing scale enhances our websites’
    appeal to travel and non-travel advertisers.

Breadth of Product Offering.

We believe we
    offer a comprehensive array of innovative travel products and
    services to travelers. We plan to continue improving and growing
    these offerings, as well as expand them to our worldwide points
    of sale over time.

Most of our revenue comes from transactions involving the
    booking of hotel reservations and the sale of airline tickets,
    either as stand-alone products or as part of package
    transactions. We are working to grow our package business as it
    results in higher revenue per transaction, and we also seek to
    continue diversifying our revenue mix beyond core air and hotel
    products to car rental, destination services, cruise and other
    product offerings. We are also working to increase the mix of
    advertising and media revenue from both the expansion of our
    TripAdvisor Media Network, as well as increased advertising
    revenue from our worldwide websites which have historically been
    focused on transaction revenue, such as Expedia.com and
    Hotels.com.

Merchant
    and Agency Business Models

We make travel products and services available both on a
    stand-alone and package basis, primarily through two business
    models: the merchant model and the agency model. Under the
    merchant model, we facilitate the booking of hotel rooms,
    airline seats, car rentals and destination services from our
    travel suppliers



and for such bookings, we are the merchant of record. Under the
    agency model, we act as an agent in the transaction, passing
    reservations booked by our travelers to the relevant airline,
    hotel, car rental company or cruise line.

As merchant of record, we generally have certain latitude to
    establish prices charged to travelers (as compared to agency
    transactions). Also, we negotiate inventory allocation and
    pricing with our suppliers which enables us to achieve a higher
    level of net revenue per transaction as compared to those
    provided through the agency model.

Through our Expedia-branded websites, travelers can dynamically
    assemble multiple component travel packages in a single
    transaction at a lower price as compared to booking each
    component separately. Packages assembled by travelers through
    the packaging model on these websites include a merchant hotel
    component and an air or car component. Travelers select packages
    based on the total package price, without being provided
    component pricing. The use of the merchant travel components in
    packages enables us to make certain travel products available at
    prices lower than those charged on an individual component basis
    by travel suppliers without impacting their established pricing
    and position models. We are also expanding our use of
    third-party provided pre-assembled package offerings,
    particularly through our international points of sale, further
    broadening our scope of products and services to travelers.

Our agency business is comprised of the sale of airline tickets,
    hotel, cruise and car rental reservations. Airline ticket
    transactions make up the majority of this business. Although net
    revenue per transaction is lower compared to the merchant model,
    due to the high volume of airline tickets sold our agency gross
    bookings accounted for 58% of total gross bookings for the year
    ended December 31, 2007.

Relationships
    with Travel Suppliers, Distribution and Fulfillment
    Partners

Overview.

We make travel products and services
    available from a variety of large and small commercial and
    charter airlines, lodging properties, car rental companies,
    cruise lines and destination service providers. We seek to build
    and maintain long-term, strategic relationships with travel
    suppliers and global distribution system (“GDS”)
    partners. An important component of the success of our business
    depends on our ability to maintain our existing, as well as
    build new, relationships with travel suppliers and GDS partners.

Travel Suppliers.

We strive to deliver value
    to our travel suppliers through a wide range of innovative,
    targeted merchandising and promotional strategies designed to
    increase their revenue, while simultaneously reducing their
    marketing transaction and customer service costs. Our Partner
    Services Group consists mainly of strategic account managers and
    local market managers who work directly with travel suppliers to
    increase the marketing of their travel products and brands
    through our points of sale, including participation in our
    seasonal and event-driven promotions.

In addition, we have developed proprietary, supplier-oriented
    technology that streamlines the interaction between some of our
    websites and hotel central reservation systems, making it easier
    and more cost-effective for hotels to manage reservations made
    through our brands. Through this “direct connect”
    technology, hotels can upload information about available
    products and services and rates directly from their central
    reservation systems into our websites, as well as automatically
    confirm hotel reservations made by our travelers. In the absence
    of direct connect technology, both of these processes are
    generally completed manually via a proprietary extranet. Our
    travelers can now book reservations with over 35,000 merchant
    hotel properties worldwide, of which over 45% are now fully
    direct-connected.

Distribution Partners.

GDSs, also referred to
    as computer reservation services, provide a centralized,
    comprehensive repository of travel suppliers
    “content” — such as availability and pricing
    of seats on various airline point-to-point flights, or
    “segments.” The GDSs act as intermediaries between the
    travel suppliers and travel agencies, allowing agents to reserve
    and book flights, rooms or other travel products.

While we historically used Worldspan as our primary GDS, in
    light of the deregulated GDS environment and our desire to
    ensure the widest possible supply of air content for our
    travelers, we diversified our use of GDS providers in 2006 and
    2007 by adding distribution agreements with Sabre and Amadeus,
    who are now our primary segment providers.



Fulfillment Partners.

We outsource certain of
    our airline ticket fulfillment functions to third-party
    suppliers. Such functions include the issuance of airline
    tickets and related customer services.

Marketing
    and Promotions

Our marketing programs are intended to build and maintain the
    value of our various brands, drive traffic and conversion
    through our various brands and businesses, optimize ongoing
    traveler acquisition costs and strategically position our brands
    in relation to one another. Our long-term success and
    profitability depends on our continued ability to maintain and
    increase the overall number of traveler transactions in a
    cost-effective manner.

Our marketing channels primarily include offline advertising,
    online advertising including search engine marketing and
    optimization, direct

and/or

personalized traveler communications on our websites as well as
    through direct

e-mail

communication with our travelers. In addition, our
    Expedia-branded websites provide content and services to the
    travel channel on the MSN.com website in the United States and
    MSN websites in Canada, France, Germany, Italy, and the United
    Kingdom. Our marketing programs and initiatives include
    promotional offers such as coupons as well as seasonal or
    periodic special offers from our travel suppliers based on our
    supplier relationships. In addition, we introduced the ThankYou
    Rewards Network in 2006 and a co-branded credit card with
    Citigroup in 2007, whereby Expedia travelers can earn ThankYou
    reward points by purchasing select travel bookings on
    www.expedia.com, as well as for purchases with their co-branded
    card.

We also make use of affiliate marketing. The Expedia.com and
    Hotels.com-branded websites receive bookings from consumers who
    have clicked-through to the respective websites through links
    posted on affiliate partner websites. We have agreements with
    thousands of third-party affiliate partners, including a number
    of leading travel companies, pursuant to which we pay a
    commission for bookings originated from their websites.
    Affiliate partners can make travel products and services
    available through an Expedia-branded website, a

co-branded

website or their own private label website. We also provide our
    affiliates with technology and access to a wide range of
    products and services.

Operations
    and Technology

We provide

24-hour-a-day,

seven-day-a-week

traveler support by telephone or via

e-mail.

For
    purposes of operational flexibility, we provide this support
    infrastructure with a combination of outsourced and in-house
    call centers, which are located in various locations throughout
    the world, including extensive outsourced operations in the
    Philippines and El Salvador. We plan to make significant
    investments in our call center technologies in 2008 and beyond.

Our systems infrastructure and web and database servers are
    hosted by third-party web hosting suppliers in various
    locations, mainly in the United States, which provide
    communication links, as well as

24-hour

monitoring and engineering support. The web hosting facilities
    have their own generators and multiple

back-up

systems. Significant amounts of our owned computer hardware for
    operating the websites are also located at these facilities.

We have developed innovative technology to power our global
    travel marketplace. For example, our Best Fare Search technology
    essentially deconstructs segment feeds in the US from GDS
    partners for air flight searches and recommends the best way to
    re-assemble multi-leg itineraries so that they are less
    expensive and more flexible for the traveler. We are looking to
    expand this technology internationally. We are also investing in
    improving our fare discovery technologies and user interfaces to
    provide more comprehensive and easier discovery of competitive
    rates for our travelers.

We are investing in and building a scaleable, service-oriented
    technology platform for our travelers, which will extend across
    our portfolio of brands. We plan to significantly invest in this
    platform in 2008 and beyond. We expect this investment to result
    in long-term cost savings, improved flexibility and faster
    go-forward innovation. This transition should also allow us to
    improve our site merchandising, browse and search functionality,
    improve search engine indexing, add significant personalization
    features, and ultimately improve



our ability to drive higher

return-on-investment

in our online and offline advertising efforts. We are also
    adding a significant upgrade to our data aggregation, mining and
    segmentation capabilities across Expedia leveraging our
    enterprise data warehouse.

We are continuing to invest in our re-platforming and enterprise
    data warehouse initiatives, and we anticipate traveler-facing
    benefits beginning in late 2008 or early 2009.

Competition

Our brands compete in rapidly evolving and intensely competitive
    markets. We believe the relatively low percentage of total
    travel sales transacted online, particularly in international
    markets, indicates that these markets represent especially large
    opportunities for Expedia and those of its competitors that wish
    to expand their brands and businesses abroad.

Our competition, which is strong and increasing, includes online
    and offline travel companies that target leisure and corporate
    travelers including travel agencies, tour operators, travel
    supplier direct websites and their call centers, consolidators
    and wholesalers of travel products and services and other
    companies offering travel search engines including meta-search
    engines. We face these competitors in local, regional, national

and/or

international markets. In some cases competitors are offering
    favorable terms and improved interfaces to suppliers and
    travelers which make competition increasingly difficult.

We believe that maintaining and enhancing our brands is a
    critical component of our effort to compete. We differentiate
    our brands from our competitors primarily based on quality and
    breadth of travel products, channel features and usability,
    price or promotional offers, traveler service and quality of
    travel planning content and advice. The emphasis on one or more
    of these factors varies, depending on the brand or business and
    the related target demographic.

Our brands face increasing competition from travel supplier
    direct websites. In some cases, supplier direct channels offer
    advantages to travelers, such as long standing loyalty programs,
    lower transaction fees and better pricing. Our websites feature
    travel products and services from numerous travel suppliers (as
    opposed to a single supplier), and allow travelers to combine
    products and services from multiple providers in one
    transaction. We face competition from airlines, hotels, rental
    car companies, cruise operators and other travel service
    providers, whether working individually or collectively, some of
    which are suppliers to our websites. Our business is generally
    sensitive to changes in the competitive landscape, including the
    emergence of new competitors, supplier consolidation or business
    models.

Intellectual
    Property Rights

We regard our intellectual property rights, including our
    patents, service marks, trademarks, domain names, copyrights,
    trade secrets and other intellectual property, as critical to
    our success. For example, we rely heavily upon the software
    code, informational databases and other components that make up
    our travel planning service.

We rely on a combination of laws, business practices and
    contractual obligations with employees, suppliers, affiliates
    and others to establish and protect our trade secrets. Despite
    these precautions, it may be possible for a third-party to copy
    or otherwise obtain and use our trade secrets or our
    intellectual property without authorization which, if
    discovered, might require the uncertainty of legal action to
    correct. In addition, there can be no assurance that others will
    not independently and lawfully develop substantially similar
    properties.

We maintain our trademark portfolio by filing trademark
    applications with the appropriate international trademark
    offices, maintaining our current registrations, securing
    contractual trademark rights when appropriate, and relying on
    common law trademark rights when appropriate. We also register
    domain names as we deem appropriate. We protect our trademarks
    and domain names with an enforcement program and use of
    trademark licenses. While we seek to protect our trademarks and
    domain names, effective trademark and domain name protection may
    not be available or may not be sought by us for every trademark
    and domain name used in every country, and contractual disputes
    may affect the use of trademarks and domain names



governed by private contract. In addition, our infringement
    monitoring resources may not locate every trademark or domain
    name infringement that exists. Similarly, not every variation of
    a domain name may be available, or may be registered by us, even
    if available. The failure to protect our intellectual property
    in a meaningful manner, or challenges to our intellectual
    property rights, could materially adversely affect our business,
    result in erosion of our brand names

and/or

limit
    our ability to control marketing on or through the internet
    using our various domain names.

We have considered, and will continue to consider, the
    appropriateness of filing for patents to protect future
    inventions, as circumstances may warrant. However, many patents
    protect only specific inventions and there can be no assurance
    that others may not create new products or methods that achieve
    similar results without infringing upon patents owned by us.

From time to time, we may be subject to legal proceedings and
    claims in the ordinary course of our business, including claims
    of alleged infringement by us of the trademarks, copyrights,
    patents and other intellectual property rights of third-parties.
    In addition, litigation may be necessary in the future to
    enforce our intellectual property rights, protect our trade
    secrets or to determine the validity and scope of proprietary
    rights claimed by others. Any such litigation, regardless of
    outcome or merit, could result in substantial costs and
    diversion of management and technical resources, any of which
    could materially harm our business.

Regulation

We must comply with laws and regulations relating to the travel
    industry and the provision of travel services, including
    registration in various states as “sellers of travel”
    and compliance with certain disclosure requirements and
    participation in state restitution funds. In addition, our
    businesses are subject to regulation by the U.S. Department
    of Transportation and must comply with various rules and
    regulations governing the provision of air transportation,
    including those relating to advertising and accessibility.

As we continue to expand the reach of our brands into the
    European, Asia-Pacific and other international markets, we are
    increasingly subject to laws and regulations applicable to
    travel agents in those markets, including, in some countries,
    laws regulating the provision of travel packages and industry
    specific value-added tax regimes. For example, the European
    Economic Community Council Directive on Package Travel Package
    Holidays and Package Tours imposes various obligations upon
    marketers of travel packages, such as disclosure obligations to
    consumers and liability to consumers for improper performance of
    the package, including supplier failure.

Financial
    Information about Segments and Geographic Areas

We generate our revenue through a diverse customer base, and
    there is no reliance on a single customer or small group of
    customers; no customer represented 10% or more of our total
    revenue in the periods presented in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

In the first quarter of 2006, we began reporting two segments:
    North America and Europe. The change from a single reportable
    segment is a result of the reorganization of our business. We
    have not reported segment information for the year ended
    December 31, 2005, as it is not practicable to do so. The
    segment and geographic information required herein is contained
    in Note 16 — Segment Information

,

in the
    notes to our consolidated financial statements.

Additional
    Information

Company Website and Public Filings.

We
    maintain a corporate website at www.expediainc.com. Except as
    explicitly noted, the information on our website, as well as the
    websites of our various brands and businesses, is not
    incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K,

or in any other filings with, or in any information furnished or
    submitted to, the SEC.

We make available, free of charge through our website, our
    Annual Reports on

Form 10-K,

Quarterly Reports on

Form 10-Q

and Current Reports on

Form 8-K

filed or furnished pursuant to Sections 13(a) or



Section 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
    amended, as soon as reasonably practicable after they have been
    electronically filed with, or furnished to, the SEC.

Code of Ethics.

We post our code of business
    conduct and ethics, which applies to all employees, including
    all executive officers, senior financial officers and directors,
    on our corporate website at www.expediainc.com. Our code of
    business conduct and ethics complies with Item 406 of SEC

Regulation S-K

and the rules of the NASDAQ. We intend to disclose any changes
    to the code that affect the provisions required by Item 406
    of

Regulation S-K,

and any waivers of the code of ethics for our executive
    officers, senior financial officers or directors, on our
    corporate website.

Employees

As of December 31, 2007, we employed approximately
    7,150 full-time and part-time employees, including
    approximately 1,690 employees of eLong. We believe we have
    good relationships with our employees, including relationships
    with employees represented by works councils or other similar
    organizations.

Part I.
    Item 1A.

Risk
    Factors

You should carefully consider each of the following risks and
    uncertainties associated with our company and the ownership of
    our securities. Additional risks not presently known to us or
    that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business
    operations.

We operate in an increasingly competitive global
    environment.

The market for the services we offer is increasingly and
    intensely competitive. We compete with both established and
    emerging online and traditional sellers of travel services with
    respect to each of the services we offer. Some of our
    competitors, particularly travel suppliers such as airlines and
    hotels, may offer products and services on more favorable terms,
    including lower prices, no fees or unique access to proprietary
    loyalty programs, such as points and miles. Many of these
    competitors, such as airlines, hotel and rental car companies,
    have been steadily focusing on increasing online demand on their
    own websites in lieu of third-party distributors such as
    Expedia. For instance, some low cost airlines, which are having
    increasing success in the marketplace, distribute their online
    inventory exclusively through their own websites. Suppliers who
    sell on their own websites typically do not charge a processing
    fee, and, in some instances, offer advantages such as increased
    or exclusive product availability and their own bonus miles or
    loyalty points, which could make their offerings more attractive
    to consumers than offerings like ours. In addition, we face
    increasing competition from other travel agencies, which in some
    cases may have favorable offerings for both travelers and
    suppliers, including pricing, connectivity and supply breadth.
    We also compete with other travel agencies for both travelers
    and the acquisition and retention of supply. The introduction of
    new technologies and the expansion of existing technologies,
    such as metasearch and other search engine technologies, may
    increase competitive pressures or lead to changes in our
    business model. Increased competition has resulted in and may
    continue to result in reduced margins, as well as loss of
    travelers, transactions and brand recognition. We cannot assure
    you that we will be able to compete successfully against
    current, emerging and future competitors or provide
    differentiated products and services to our traveler base.

Our business depends on our relationships with travel
    suppliers.

An important component of our business success depends on our
    ability to maintain and expand relationships with travel
    suppliers and GDS partners. Adverse changes in existing
    relationships, or our inability to enter into new arrangements
    with these parties on favorable terms, if at all, could reduce
    the amount, quality and breadth of attractively priced travel
    products and services that we are able to offer, which could
    adversely affect our business and financial performance.

Travel suppliers are increasingly seeking to lower their travel
    distribution costs by promoting direct online bookings through
    their own websites. In some cases, supplier direct channels
    offer advantages to consumers, such as “best rate
    guarantees,” loyalty programs

and/or

lower
    transaction fees. In addition, travel suppliers may choose not
    to make their travel products and services available through our
    distribution channels. To the



extent that consumers continue to increase the percentage of
    their travel purchases through supplier direct websites

and/or

if
    travel suppliers choose not to make their products and services
    available to us, our business may suffer.

Declines or disruptions in the travel industry could
    adversely affect our business or financial performance.

Our business and financial performance are affected by the
    health of the worldwide travel industry. Accordingly, if there
    is a downturn or weakness in the travel industry it could have a
    material adverse effect on our business. Travel expenditures are
    sensitive to business and personal discretionary spending levels
    and tend to decline or grow more slowly during economic
    downturns, including downturns in any of our major markets.
    Events or weakness specific to the air travel industry that
    could negatively affect our business include continued fare
    increases, travel-related strikes or labor unrest,
    consolidations, bankruptcies or liquidations and further fuel
    price escalation. Additionally, our business is sensitive to
    safety concerns, and thus our business has in the past and may
    in the future decline after incidents of actual or threatened
    terrorism, during periods of political instability or
    geopolitical conflict in which travelers become concerned about
    safety issues, as a result of natural disasters such as
    hurricanes or earthquakes or when travel might involve
    health-related risks, such as avian flu. Such concerns could
    result in a protracted decrease in demand for our travel
    services. This decrease in demand, depending on its scope and
    duration, together with any future issues affecting travel
    safety, could significantly and adversely affect our business
    and financial performance over the short and long-term. In
    addition, the disruption of the existing travel plans of a
    significant number of travelers upon the occurrence of certain
    events, such as actual or threatened terrorist activity or war,
    could result in the incurrence of significant additional costs
    and constrained liquidity if we provide relief to affected
    travelers by not charging cancellation fees

and/or

by
    refunding the price of airline tickets, hotel reservations and
    other travel products and services.

We rely on the value of our brands, and the costs of
    maintaining and enhancing our brand awareness are increasing.

We believe continued investment in our brands, including
    Expedia.com, Hotels.com, Hotwire.com, Classic Vacation, Expedia
    Corporate Travel, eLong, the TripAdvisor Media Network and
    Expedia Local Expert, is critical to retain and expand our
    traveler, supplier and advertiser bases. We have and expect to
    continue having to spend more to maintain our brands’ value
    due to a variety of factors. These include increased spending
    from our competitors, expansion into geographies and products
    where our brands are less well known, inflation in media pricing
    including search engine keywords and the continued emergence and
    relative traffic share growth of search engines and meta search
    engines as destination sites for travelers. We have spent
    considerable money and resources to date on the establishment
    and maintenance of our brands, and we will continue to spend
    money on, and devote resources to, advertising and marketing, as
    well as other brand building efforts to preserve and enhance
    consumer awareness of our brands. We may not be able to
    successfully maintain or enhance consumer awareness of our
    brands, and, even if we are successful in our branding efforts,
    such efforts may not be cost-effective, or as cost-effective as
    they have been historically. If we are unable to maintain or
    enhance consumer awareness of our brands and generate demand in
    a cost-effective manner, it would have a material adverse effect
    on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Our business could be negatively affected by changes in
    search engine algorithms and dynamics.

We increasingly utilize internet search engines, principally
    through the purchase of travel-related keywords, to generate
    traffic to our websites. Search engines frequently update and
    change the logic that determines the placement and display of
    results of a user’s search, such that the purchased or
    algorithmic placement of links to our websites can be negatively
    affected. In addition, a significant amount of our business is
    directed to our own websites through our participation in

pay-per-click

and display advertising campaigns on internet media properties
    and search engines whose pricing and operating dynamics can
    experience rapid change, both technically and competitively. If
    a major search engine changes its algorithms in a manner that
    negatively affects the search engine ranking, paid or unpaid, of
    our websites or that of our third-party distribution partners,
    or if competitive dynamics further impact market pricing in a
    negative manner, our business and financial performance would be
    adversely affected.



We rely on information technology to operate our businesses
    and maintain our competitiveness, and any failure to adapt to
    technological developments or industry trends could harm our
    business.

We depend on the use of sophisticated information technologies
    and systems, including technology and systems used for
    reservations, communications, procurement and administration. As
    our operations grow in both size and scope, we must continuously
    improve and upgrade our systems and infrastructure to offer an
    increasing number of travelers enhanced products, services,
    features and functionality, while maintaining the reliability
    and integrity of our systems and infrastructure. Our future
    success also depends on our ability to adapt our services and
    infrastructure to meet rapidly evolving consumer trends and
    demands while continuing to improve the performance, features
    and reliability of our service in response to competitive
    service and product offerings.

In addition, we may not be able to maintain our existing systems
    or replace or introduce new technologies and systems as quickly
    as we would like or in a cost-effective manner. We are currently
    in the process of migrating portions of our site functionality
    to a new technology platform to enable us to introduce
    innovation more rapidly, achieve better search engine
    optimization and improve our site merchandising capability,
    among other anticipated benefits. We have experienced some
    delays with this migration. Delays or difficulties in
    implementing new or enhanced systems may keep us from achieving
    the desired results in a timely manner, to the extent
    anticipated, or at all. Also, we may be unable to devote
    financial resources to new technologies and systems in the
    future. If any of these events occur, our business could suffer.

We rely on third-parties for many systems and services.

We rely on third-party service providers for certain
    fulfillment, processing, development, technology and other
    services. If these third-parties experience difficulty meeting
    our requirements or standards, it could damage our reputation or
    make it difficult for us to provide certain services to our
    travelers and operate some aspects of our business. In addition,
    if such third-party service providers were to cease operations,
    temporarily or permanently, face financial distress or we were
    unable to successfully negotiate future contracts with such
    providers, we could suffer increased costs and delays in our
    ability to provide similar services until an equivalent service
    provider could be found or we could develop our technology or
    operations. In addition, we rely increasingly on outsourced
    providers of traveler care and information technology services.
    If we are unsuccessful in choosing high quality partners or we
    ineffectively manage these partnerships it could have an adverse
    impact on our operations and financial results.

Over the last several years, we have experienced downward
    pressure on remuneration from our suppliers.

A substantial portion of our revenue is derived from
    compensation negotiated with travel suppliers and GDS partners
    for bookings made through our websites. Over the last several
    years, air and hotel travel suppliers have generally reduced or
    in some cases eliminated payments to travel agents and other
    travel intermediaries. In addition, as our hotel remuneration
    varies with the room rates paid by travelers (Average Daily
    Rates, or “ADRs”), to the extent ADRs grow more slowly
    than anticipated or decline, our revenue for each room sold will
    generally be proportionately lower. Each year we typically
    negotiate or renegotiate numerous long-term airline and hotel
    contracts. No assurances can be given that GDS partners or
    travel suppliers will not further reduce of eliminate
    compensation, or attempt to charge travel agencies for content,
    any of which could reduce our revenue and margins thereby
    adversely affecting our business and financial performance.

We rely on the performance of highly skilled personnel and,
    if we are unable to retain or motivate key personnel or hire,
    retain and motivate qualified personnel, our business would be
    harmed.

Our performance is largely dependent on the talents and efforts
    of highly skilled individuals. Our future success depends on our
    continuing ability to identify, hire, develop, motivate and
    retain highly skilled personnel for all areas of our
    organization. In particular, the contributions of Barry Diller,
    our Chairman and Senior Executive, and Dara Khosrowshahi, our
    Chief Executive Officer, are critical to the overall management
    of the company.



In addition, we have experienced a high rate of executive
    turnover since 2005. Our future success will depend on the
    performance of our senior management and key employees, many of
    whom joined Expedia recently. Expedia cannot ensure that it will
    be able to retain the services of Mr. Diller,
    Mr. Khosrowshahi or any other member of our senior
    management or key employees, the loss of whom could seriously
    harm our business. In addition, competition for well-qualified
    employees in all aspects of our business, including software
    engineers and other technology professionals, is intense. Our
    continued ability to compete effectively depends on our ability
    to attract new employees and to retain and motivate our existing
    employees. If we do not succeed in attracting well-qualified
    employees or retaining or motivating existing employees, our
    business would be adversely affected. We do not maintain any key
    person life insurance policies.

Our stock price is highly volatile.

The market price of our common stock is highly volatile and
    could continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to
    factors such as the following, some of which are beyond our
    control:

•

Quarterly variations in our operating results;

•

Operating results that vary from the expectations of securities
    analysts and investors;

•

Changes in expectations as to our future financial performance,
    including financial estimates by securities analysts and
    investors;

•

Reaction to our earnings releases and conference calls, or
    presentations by executives at investor and industry conferences;

•

Changes in our capital structure;

•

Changes in market valuations of other internet or online service
    companies;

•

Announcements of technological innovations or new services by us
    or our competitors;

•

Announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts,
    acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital
    commitments;

•

Loss of a major supplier participant, such as an airline or
    hotel chain;

•

Changes in the status of our intellectual property rights;

•

Lack of success in the expansion of our business model
    geographically;

•

Announcements by third parties of significant claims or

Rumors or public speculation about any of the above
    factors; and

•

Market and volume fluctuations in the stock markets in general.

Our international operations involve additional risks and our
    exposure to these risks will increase as we expand our
    international operations.

We operate in a number of jurisdictions outside of the United
    States and intend to continue to expand our international
    presence. In order to achieve widespread acceptance in the
    countries and markets we enter, we must continue to tailor our
    services and business model to the unique circumstances of such
    countries and markets, including supplier relationships and
    traveler preferences. Learning the customs and cultures of
    various countries, particularly with respect to travel patterns
    and practices, can be difficult, costly and divert management
    and personnel resources. Our failure to adapt our practices and
    models effectively to the traveler and supplier preferences of
    each country into which we expand could slow our international
    growth.

We expect to continue to face additional risks in international
    operations. These risks include political instability;
    threatened or actual acts of terrorism; changes in regulatory
    requirements;, our ability to comply with additional
    U.S. laws applicable to U.S. companies operating
    internationally as well as local laws and



regulations; diminished ability to legally enforce our
    contractual rights; increased risk and limits on our ability to
    enforce intellectual property rights; possible preferences by
    local populations for local providers; restrictions on the
    withdrawal of

non-U.S. investment

and earnings; currency exchange restrictions; slower adoption of
    the internet as an advertising, broadcast and commerce medium in
    those markets as compared to the United States and difficulties
    in managing staffing and operations due to distance, time zones,
    language and cultural differences.

Changing laws, rules and regulations and legal uncertainties
    may adversely affect our business or financial performance.

Our business and financial performance could be adversely
    affected by unfavorable changes in or interpretations of
    existing, or the promulgation of new laws, rules and regulations
    applicable to us and our businesses, including those relating to
    the internet and online commerce, consumer protection and
    privacy. Such unfavorable changes could decrease demand for
    products and services, increase costs

and/or

subject us to additional liabilities. For example, there is, and
    will likely continue to be, an increasing number of laws and
    regulations pertaining to the internet and online commerce,
    which may relate to liability for information retrieved from or
    transmitted over the internet, user privacy, taxation and the
    quality of products and services. Furthermore, the growth and
    development of online commerce may prompt calls for more
    stringent consumer protection laws that may impose additional
    burdens on online businesses generally.

Adverse application of tax laws, rules or regulations could
    have an adverse effect on our businesses and financial
    performance.

The application of various domestic and international sales,
    use, occupancy, value-added and other tax laws, rules and
    regulations to our historical and new products and services is
    subject to interpretation by the applicable taxing authorities.
    Many of the fundamental statutes and regulations that impose
    these taxes were established before the growth of the internet
    and

e-commerce.

If the tax laws, rules and regulations were amended, if new
    adverse laws, rules or regulations were adopted, or if current
    laws are interpreted adversely to our interests, particularly
    with respect to occupancy or value-added taxes, the results
    could increase our tax payments (prospectively or
    retrospectively)

and/or

subject us to penalties and decrease the demand for our products
    and services if we pass on such costs to the consumer. As a
    result these changes could have an adverse affect on our
    businesses or financial performance. We continue to work with
    relevant tax authorities and legislators to clarify our
    obligations under existing, new and emerging laws and
    regulations. There have been, and will continue to be,
    substantial ongoing costs associated with complying with, and
    defending our position in, the various indirect tax requirements
    in the numerous markets in which we conduct or will conduct
    business.

System interruption and the lack of redundancy in our
    information systems may harm our businesses.

We rely on computer systems to facilitate and process
    transactions. We have experienced and may in the future
    experience system interruptions that make some or all of these
    systems unavailable or prevent us from efficiently fulfilling
    orders or providing services to third-parties. Any
    interruptions, outages or delays in our systems, or
    deterioration in their performance, could impair our ability to
    process transactions and decrease our quality of service that we
    can offer to our travelers. If we were to experience frequent or
    persistent system failures, our reputation and brands could be
    harmed.

In addition, we do not have backup systems or contingency plans
    for certain critical aspects of our operations or business
    processes, many other systems are not fully redundant and our
    disaster recovery or business continuity planning may not be
    sufficient. Fire, flood, power loss, telecommunications failure,
    break-ins, earthquakes, acts of war or terrorism, acts of God,
    computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins and similar
    events or disruptions may damage or impact or interrupt computer
    or communications systems or business processes at any time.
    Although we have put measures in place to protect certain
    portions of our facilities and assets, any of these events could
    cause system interruption, delays and loss of critical data, and
    could prevent us from providing services to our travelers

and/or

third
    parties for a significant period of time. Remediation may be
    costly and we may not have adequate insurance to cover such
    costs. Moreover, the costs



of enhancing infrastructure to attain improved stability and
    redundancy may be time consuming and expensive and may require
    resources and expertise that are difficult to obtain.

Intense competition for advertising revenue may adversely
    affect our ability to achieve or maintain market share and
    operate profitably.

Expedia, Inc. websites, including in particular the TripAdvisor
    Media Network, compete for advertising dollars with large
    internet portal sites, such as American Online, MSN and Yahoo!,
    that offer listing or other advertising opportunities for
    travel-related companies. These companies have significantly
    greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources and
    large client bases. We also compete with search engines like
    Google and Yahoo! Search that offer

pay-per-click

advertising services. In addition, we compete with newspapers,
    magazines and other traditional media companies that provide
    offline and online advertising opportunities. We expect to face
    additional competition as other established and emerging
    companies, including print media companies, enter the online
    advertising market. Competition could results in reduced margins
    on our advertising services, loss of market share or less use of
    our sites by travel companies and travelers. If we are not able
    to compete effectively with current or future competitors as a
    result of these and other factors, our business could be
    materially adversely affected. In addition, the TripAdvisor
    Media Network is increasingly reliant on natural and paid search
    traffic from major search engines, whose per unit costs have
    been increasing.

Mr. Diller currently controls Expedia.  If
    Mr. Diller ceases to control the company, Liberty Media
    Corporation may effectively control the company.

Subject to the terms of a Stockholders Agreement between
    Mr. Diller and Liberty Media Corporation, Mr. Diller
    holds an irrevocable proxy to vote shares of Expedia stock held
    by Liberty. Accordingly, Mr. Diller effectively controls
    the outcome of all matters submitted to a vote or for the
    consent of our stockholders (other than with respect to the
    election by the holders of common stock of 25% of the members of
    the Board of Directors and matters as to which Delaware law
    requires a separate class vote). Upon Mr. Diller’s
    permanent departure from Expedia, the irrevocable proxy would
    terminate and depending on the capitalization of Expedia at such
    time, Liberty could effectively control the voting power of our
    capital stock. Mr. Diller, through shares he owns
    beneficially as well as those subject to the irrevocable proxy,
    controlled approximately 60% of the combined voting power of the
    outstanding Expedia capital stock as of December 31, 2007.

In addition, under a Governance Agreement among Mr. Diller,
    Liberty Media Corporation and Expedia, Inc., as amended, each of
    Mr. Diller and Liberty generally has the right to consent
    to limited matters in the event that we incur debt such that our
    ratio of total debt to EBITDA, as defined in the Governance
    Agreement, equals or exceeds 8:1 over a continuous

12-month

period. We cannot assure you that Mr. Diller and Liberty
    will consent to any such matter at a time when we are highly
    leveraged, in which case we would not be able to engage in such
    transactions or take such actions.

As a result of Mr. Diller’s ownership interests and
    voting power, and Liberty’s ownership interests and voting
    power upon Mr. Diller’s permanent departure from us,
    Mr. Diller is currently, and in the future Liberty may be,
    in a position to control or influence significant corporate
    actions, including, corporate transactions such as mergers,
    business combinations or dispositions of assets and
    determinations with respect to our significant business
    direction and policies. This concentrated control could
    discourage others from initiating any potential merger, takeover
    or other change of control transaction that may otherwise be
    beneficial to us.

Actual or potential conflicts of interest may develop between
    Expedia management and directors, on the one hand, and the
    management and directors of IAC, on the other.

Mr. Diller serves as our Chairman of the Board of Directors
    and Senior Executive, while retaining his role as Chairman and
    Chief Executive Officer of IAC, and Mr. Kaufman serves as
    Vice Chairman of both Expedia and IAC. The fact that
    Messrs. Diller and Kaufman hold positions with both
    companies and own both IAC and Expedia stock could create, or
    appear to create, potential conflicts of interest for each of
    Messrs. Diller and Kaufman when facing decisions that may
    affect both IAC and Expedia. Both Messrs. Diller and
    Kaufman may also face conflicts of interest with regard to the
    allocation of their time between IAC and Expedia.



Our certificate of incorporation provides that no officer or
    director of Expedia who is also an officer or director of IAC
    will be liable to Expedia or its stockholders for breach of any
    fiduciary duty by reason of the fact that any such individual
    directs a corporate opportunity to IAC instead of Expedia, or
    does not communicate information regarding a corporate
    opportunity to Expedia because the officer or director has
    directed the corporate opportunity to IAC. This corporate
    opportunity provision may have the effect of exacerbating the
    risk of conflicts of interest between IAC and Expedia because
    the provision effectively shields an overlapping
    director/executive officer from liability for breach of
    fiduciary duty in the event that such director or officer
    chooses to direct a corporate opportunity to IAC instead of
    Expedia.

We may be unable to access capital when necessary or
    desirable.

The availability of funds depends in large measure on capital
    markets and liquidity factors over which we exert no control. We
    can provide no assurance that sufficient financing will be
    available on desirable terms to fund investments, acquisitions,
    stock repurchases or extraordinary actions. In addition, any
    downgrade of our debt ratings by Standard &
    Poor’s, Moody’s Investor Service or similar ratings
    agencies, increases in general interest rate levels or general
    weakening in the credit markets could increase our cost of
    capital.

We have foreign exchange risk.

As a result of our international websites and acquisitions, we
    conduct a significant and growing portion of our business
    outside the United States. Further, due to the nature of our
    operations and our corporate structure, we have subsidiaries
    that have significant transactions in foreign currencies other
    than their functional currency. As a result, we face exposure to
    movements in currency exchange rates, particularly those related
    to the British Pound Sterling, the Euro, Canadian dollar and
    Chinese Renminbi. Foreign exchange rate fluctuations may
    adversely impact our results of operations as exchange rate
    fluctuations on transactions denominated in currencies other
    than the functional currency results in gains and losses that
    are reflected in our consolidated statements of operations.
    Additionally, the results of operations of our foreign
    subsidiaries are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations
    as the financial results of our foreign subsidiaries are
    translated from local currency into U.S. dollars upon
    consolidation. The economic impact to us of foreign currency
    exchange rate movements is linked to variability in real growth,
    inflation, interest rates, governmental actions and other
    factors. If the U.S. dollar strengthens against the local
    currency of profitable, cash generating foreign operations and
    we choose not to hedge or fail to hedge effectively our
    exposure, it could cause us to adjust our financing and
    operating strategies and could have a material adverse effect on
    our financial statements and financial condition.

Our investment in eLong creates risks and uncertainties
    relating to the laws in China.

The success of our investment in eLong, a company organized
    under Cayman law, whose principal business is the operation of
    an internet-based travel business in China, is subject to risks
    and uncertainties regarding the interpretation of China’s
    laws and regulations. The Chinese legal system is a civil law
    system based on written statutes. Unlike common law systems, it
    is a system in which decided legal cases have limited value as
    precedent. The lack of precedent causes the interpretation and
    enforcement of Chinese law to involve uncertainties that could
    limit the available legal protections. In addition, we cannot
    predict the effect of future developments in China’s legal
    system, particularly with respect to the travel industry, the
    internet, foreign investment or licensing, including the
    introduction of new laws, changes to existing laws or the
    interpretation or enforcement of current or future laws and
    regulations, or the preemption of local regulations by national
    laws. In addition, the laws and regulations of China restrict
    certain direct foreign investment in the air-ticketing, travel
    agency, internet content provision and advertising businesses.
    Such laws and regulations require that we establish effective
    control through a series of agreements with eLong’s
    affiliated Chinese entities and could restrict our ability to
    engage in desirable strategic transactions. Finally, China does
    not have treaties with the United States or most other western
    countries providing for the reciprocal recognition and
    enforcement of judgment of courts. As a result, court judgments
    obtained in jurisdictions with which China does not have
    treaties on reciprocal recognition of judgment and in relation
    to any matter not subject to a binding arbitration provision may
    be difficult or impossible to be enforced in China.



Our processing, storage, use and disclosure of personal data
    could give rise to liabilities as a result of governmental
    regulation, conflicting legal requirements, differing views of
    personal privacy rights, or data security breaches.

In the processing of our traveler transactions, we receive and
    store a large volume of personally identifiable information.
    This information is increasingly subject to legislation and
    regulations in numerous jurisdictions around the world. This
    government action is typically intended to protect the privacy
    and security of personal information that is collected,
    processed and transmitted in or from the governing jurisdiction.
    We could be adversely affected if legislation or regulations are
    expanded to require changes in our business practices or if
    governing jurisdictions interpret or implement their legislation
    or regulations in ways that negatively affect our business,
    financial condition and results of operations. As privacy and
    data protection have become more sensitive issues, we may also
    become exposed to potential liabilities as a result of differing
    views on the privacy of travel

and/or

online data.

We cannot guarantee that our security measures will prevent data
    breaches. A substantial data breach could significantly harm our
    business, damage our reputation, expose us to a risk of loss or
    litigation and possible liability

and/or

cause
    customers and potential customers to lose confidence in our
    security, which would have a negative effect on the value of our
    brands.

These and other privacy and security developments that are
    difficult to anticipate could adversely affect our business,
    financial condition and results of operations.

Acquisitions could result in operating and financial
    difficulties.

Our future growth may depend, in part, on acquisitions. To the
    extent that we grow through acquisitions, we will face the
    operational and financial risks that commonly accompany that
    strategy. We would also face operational risks, such as failing
    to assimilate the operations and personnel of the acquired
    businesses, disrupting their ongoing businesses, increased
    complexity of our business, impairing management resources and
    their relationships with employees and travelers as a result of
    changes in their ownership and management. Further, the
    evaluation and negotiation of potential acquisitions, as well as
    the integration of an acquired business, may divert management
    time and other resources. Some acquisitions may not be
    successful and their performance may result in the impairment of
    their carrying value.

Certain financial and operational risks related to acquisitions
    that may have a material impact on our business are:

•

Use of cash resources and incurrence of debt and contingent
    liabilities in funding acquisitions;

•

Amortization expenses related to acquired intangible assets and
    other adverse accounting consequences;

•

Costs incurred in identifying and performing due diligence on
    potential acquisition targets that may or may not be successful;

•

Difficulties and expenses in assimilating the operations,
    products, technology, information systems or personnel of the
    acquired company;

•

Impairment of relationships with employees, suppliers and
    affiliates of our business and the acquired business;

•

The assumption of known and unknown debt and liabilities of the
    acquired company;

•

Failure to generate adequate returns on our acquisitions and
    investments;

•

Entrance into markets in which we have no direct prior
    experience; and

•

Impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets arising from
    our acquisitions (for example, in the quarter ended
    September 30, 2006, we recognized a $47.0 million
    impairment charge related to an indefinite lived intangible
    asset of Hotwire).



We cannot be sure that our intellectual property is protected
    from copying or use by others, including potential
    competitors.

Our websites rely on content and technology intellectual
    property, much of which we regard as proprietary. We protect our
    proprietary technology by relying on trademarks, copyrights,
    trade secret laws and confidentiality agreements. In connection
    with our license agreements with third-parties, we seek to
    control access to and distribution of our technology,
    documentation and other proprietary information. Even with all
    of these precautions, it is possible for someone else to copy or
    otherwise obtain and use our proprietary technology or content
    without our authorization or to develop similar technology
    independently. Effective trademark, copyright and trade secret
    protection may not be available in every country in which our
    services are made available through the internet, and policing
    unauthorized use of our proprietary information is difficult and
    expensive. We cannot be sure that the steps we have taken will
    prevent misappropriation of our proprietary information. This
    misappropriation could have a material adverse effect on our
    business. In the future, we may need to go to court to enforce
    our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets
    or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights
    of others. This litigation might result in substantial costs and
    diversion of resources and management attention.

We currently license from third-parties some of the technologies
    incorporated into our websites. As we continue to introduce new
    services that incorporate new technologies, we may be required
    to license additional technology. We cannot be sure that such
    technology licenses will be available on commercially reasonable
    terms, if at all.

Properties

We lease approximately 1.6 million square feet of office
    space worldwide, pursuant to leases with expiration dates
    through October 2018.

We lease approximately 340,000 square feet for our current
    headquarters in Bellevue, Washington, pursuant to leases with
    expiration dates primarily through September 2009. We also lease
    approximately 550,000 square feet of office space for our
    domestic operations in various cities and locations in Arizona,

Legal
    Proceedings

In the ordinary course of business, Expedia and its subsidiaries
    are parties to legal proceedings and claims involving property,
    personal injury, contract, alleged infringement of third-party
    intellectual property rights and other claims. The amounts that
    may be recovered in such matters may be subject to insurance
    coverage.

Rules of the SEC require the description of material pending
    legal proceedings, other than ordinary, routine litigation
    incident to the registrant’s business, and advise that
    proceedings ordinarily need not be described if they primarily
    involve damages claims for amounts (exclusive of interest and
    costs) not individually exceeding 10% of the current assets of
    the registrant and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. In
    the judgment of management, none of the pending litigation
    matters which the Company and its subsidiaries are defending,
    including those described below, involves or is likely to
    involve amounts of that magnitude. The litigation matters
    described below are as of December 31, 2007, and involve
    issues or claims that may be



of particular interest to our stockholders, regardless of
    whether any of these matters may be material to our financial
    position or results of operations based upon the standard set
    forth in the SEC’s rules.

Securities
    Class Action Litigation against IAC.

Beginning on September 20, 2004, twelve purported
    shareholder class actions were commenced in the United States
    District Court for the Southern District of New York against IAC
    and certain of its officers and directors, alleging violations
    of the federal securities laws. These cases arose out of
    IAC’s August 4, 2004 announcement of its earnings for
    the second quarter of 2004 and generally alleged that the value
    of the Company’s stock was artificially inflated by
    pre-announcement statements about its financial results and
    forecasts that were false and misleading due to the
    defendants’ alleged failure to disclose various problems
    faced by IAC’s travel businesses. On December 20,
    2004, the district court consolidated the twelve lawsuits,
    appointed co-lead plaintiffs, and designated co-lead
    plaintiffs’ counsel. See

In re IAC/InterActiveCorp
    Securities Litigation,

No. 04-CV-7447

(S.D.N.Y.). Expedia is not a party to this litigation, however,
    under the terms of its Separation Agreement with IAC, Expedia
    has generally agreed to bear a portion of the costs and
    liabilities, if any, associated with any securities law
    litigation relating to conduct prior to the Spin-Off of the
    businesses or entities that comprise Expedia following the
    Spin-Off.

On October 18, 2004, a related shareholder derivative
    action,

Stuart Garber, Derivatively on Behalf of
    IAC/InterActiveCorp v. Barry Diller et al.

,

No. 04-603416,

was commenced in the Supreme Court of the State of New York (New
    York County) against certain of IAC’s officers and
    directors. On November 15, 2004, another related
    shareholder derivative action,

Lisa Butler, Derivatively on
    Behalf of IAC/InterActiveCorp v. Barry Diller et al.

,

No. 04-CV-9067,

was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern
    District of New York against certain of IAC’s current and
    former directors. On January 24, 2005, the federal district
    court consolidated the

Butler

case with the securities
    class action for pre-trial purposes only. On April 11,
    2005, the district court issued a similar consolidation order in
    respect of the

Garber

case.

On July 5, 2005, the plaintiffs in the related shareholder
    suits filed a consolidated shareholder derivative complaint
    against IAC (as a nominal defendant) and sixteen current or
    former officers or directors of IAC or its former travel
    business. The complaint, which is based upon factual allegations
    similar to those in the securities class action, purports to
    assert claims for breach of fiduciary duty, abuse of control,
    gross mismanagement, waste of corporate assets, unjust
    enrichment, violation of Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act,
    and contribution and indemnification. The complaint seeks an
    order voiding the election of IAC’s current Board of
    Directors, as well as damages in an unspecified amount, various
    forms of equitable relief, restitution, and disgorgement of
    remuneration received by the individual defendants from IAC.

On September 15, 2005, IAC and the other defendants filed
    motions to dismiss both the securities class action and the
    shareholder derivative suits. On November 30, 2005, the
    plaintiffs filed their opposition to the motions. On
    January 6, 2006, the defendants filed reply papers in
    further support of the motions. The court issued an opinion and
    order (i) granting the defendants’ motion to dismiss
    the complaint in the securities class action, with leave to
    replead, and (ii) granting the defendants’ motion to
    dismiss the complaint in the shareholder derivative suits, with
    prejudice.

On April 23, 2007, the plaintiffs in the shareholder
    derivative suits filed a notice of appeal to the
    United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit from
    the District Court’s order of dismissal. On June 14,
    on consent of the parties, the appeal was withdrawn from active
    consideration by the Court of Appeals, subject to reinstatement
    by no later than March 31, 2008.

On May 15, 2007, the plaintiffs in the securities class
    action filed a second amended complaint. The new pleading
    continues to allege that the defendants failed to disclose
    material information concerning problems at the Company’s
    then-travel businesses and to assert the same legal claims as
    its predecessor. On August 15, 2007, the defendants filed a
    motion to dismiss the second amended complaint. On
    October 19, 2007, the plaintiffs opposed the motion. On
    November 9, 2007, the defendants filed their reply brief in
    support of the motion. A hearing on the motion has not been
    scheduled.



Expedia believes that the claims in the class action and
    derivative suits lack merit and will continue to vigorously
    defend against them.

Litigation
    Relating to Hotel Occupancy Taxes

Hotels.com.

On June 20, 2003, a purported
    class action was filed in Texas state court against certain
    Hotels.com-affiliated entities (“Hotels.com”).

See
    Nora J. Olvera, Individually and on Behalf of All Others
    Similarly Situated v. Hotels.com, Inc.

,

No. DC-03-259

(District Court, 229th Judicial District, Duval County).
    The complaint and subsequent amended complaints filed
    August 12, 2003 and May 6, 2004, allege that
    Hotels.com collects “excess” hotel occupancy taxes
    from consumers (i.e., allegedly charges consumers more for
    occupancy taxes than it pays to the hotels for the hotels’
    use in satisfying their obligations to the taxing authorities).
    The complaint sought certification of a nationwide class of all
    persons who have purchased hotel accommodations from Hotels.com
    since June 20, 1999, as well as restitution of,
    disgorgement of, and the imposition of a constructive trust upon
    all “excess” occupancy taxes allegedly collected by
    Hotels.com. On September 25, 2003, the plaintiff filed a

    charges customers “fees” that do not correspond to any
    specific services provided. The complaint seeks restitution of,
    disgorgement of, and the imposition of a constructive trust upon
    all “excess” occupancy taxes allegedly collected by
    Hotels.com. On April 29, 2005, the court issued an order
    granting the plaintiff’s motion for class certification. On
    February 1, 2006, the court of appeals reversed the holding
    certifying the class and remanded the case to the trial court.
    On April 20, 2006, Canales filed a fourth amended petition
    and a new motion for class certification. Certification briefing
    has been deferred indefinitely. On April 11, 2007, the
    parties submitted a joint status report to the court asking that
    the next status conference be reset to October 2007. On
    November 13, 2007, the parties filed a joint report
    requesting postponement of the status hearing for six months.

    prospectively commenced reporting revenue for Hotels.com on a
    net basis. In our selected financial data below, the revenue
    amounts prior to January 1, 2004 report Hotels.com merchant
    hotel business revenue on a gross basis. The change in reporting
    did not affect operating income or net income.

Part II. Item 7.

Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations

Overview

Expedia, Inc. is an online travel company, empowering business
    and leisure travelers with the tools and information they need
    to efficiently research, plan, book and experience travel. We
    have created a global travel marketplace used by a broad range
    of leisure and corporate travelers, offline retail travel agents
    and travel service providers. We make available, on a
    stand-alone and package basis, travel products and services
    provided by numerous airlines, lodging properties, car rental
    companies, destination service providers, cruise lines and other
    travel product and service companies. We also offer travel and
    non-travel advertisers access to a potential source of
    incremental traffic and transactions through our various media
    and advertising offerings on both the TripAdvisor Media Network
    and on our transaction-based websites. For additional
    information about our portfolio of brands, see the disclosure
    set forth in Part I, Item 1, Business, under the
    caption “Management Overview.”

Trends

The travel industry, including offline and online travel
    agencies, as well as suppliers of travel products and services,
    has been characterized by rapid and significant change.

The U.S. airline sector in particular has experienced
    significant turmoil, with oil prices hitting all-time highs, the
    shift of capacity to low-cost carriers (“LCCs”)
    offering “no frills” flights at discounted prices and



the entry and subsequent emergence of several of the largest
    traditional carriers from the protection of Chapter 11
    bankruptcy proceedings.

The traditional carriers’ need to rationalize their high
    fixed cost structures to better compete in this environment has
    caused them to curtail their domestic capacities, thereby
    increasing their load factors and enabling them to more easily
    pass along fare increases. Competitive pressures have also
    caused them to consider consolidation opportunities to better
    share fixed costs and reduce redundant flight routes. While
    these attempts have historically been unsuccessful either due to
    antitrust concerns or reluctance among target companies to
    consummate mergers, more recent discussions have apparently
    progressed to very advanced stages for a number of carriers.
    Should one or more of these combinations prove successful, it
    could result in further capacity reductions and airfare
    increases.

Higher load factors are positive for Expedia from a demand
    standpoint, but negative if they lead to reduced availability of
    merchant air capacity and fare increases. Fare increases are
    generally negative for Expedia’s business, as they may
    negatively impact traveler demand, and our remuneration is tied
    principally to ticket volumes, not ticket prices. Fare increases
    were especially pronounced in late 2007, and have continued into
    early 2008.

Carriers have aggressively pursued cost reductions in every
    aspect of their operations, including distribution costs.
    Airlines have successfully negotiated lower (and in some cases,
    eliminated) travel agent commissions and overrides, and focused
    on increasing direct distribution through their lower cost,
    proprietary websites. In addition, in 2006 carriers succeeded in
    reducing payments to global distribution system
    (“GDS”) intermediaries as those contracts expired. The
    GDSs in turn have passed on these reductions to large travel
    agents, including Expedia, which historically received a
    meaningful portion of their air remuneration from GDS providers.

As a result of these decreased costs of distribution and high
    load factors, Expedia’s revenue per air ticket has
    decreased more than 10% in each of 2005, 2006 and 2007, and air
    revenue now constitutes less than 15% of the Company’s
    overall revenue base. However, Expedia anticipates greater
    stability in the non-booking fee portion of its air remuneration
    beginning in 2008 as it has signed long-term agreements with
    nine of the top ten domestic carriers and has anniversaried the
    GDS reductions which took place in 2006.

In addition to the challenges presented by higher load factors,
    increased fares and lower remuneration per air ticket, most
    larger carriers participating in the Expedia marketplace have
    reduced their share of total air seat capacity. At the same time
    larger LCCs such as Southwest in the U.S. and RyanAir and
    EasyJet in Europe have increased their relative capacity, but
    have not generally participated in the Expedia marketplace.
    These trends have impacted our ability to obtain supply in our
    agency and merchant air businesses.

The hotel sector has until recently been characterized by robust
    demand and constrained supply, resulting in increasing occupancy
    rates and average daily rates (“ADRs”). More recently,
    supply has begun to outstrip demand, and industry experts
    anticipate this trend will accelerate in 2008. In addition,
    hotels have begun to see their occupancy rates leveling off, and
    in some cases decreasing, with ADRs growing at a slower rate,
    or, in some markets, decreasing. While lower occupancies have
    historically increased Expedia’s supply of merchant hotel
    rooms, and a lower rate of ADR growth can positively impact
    underlying demand, lower ADRs also decrease our revenue per room
    night as our remuneration varies proportionally with the room
    price.

Increased usage and familiarity with the internet has driven
    rapid growth in online penetration of travel expenditures.
    According to PhoCusWright, an independent travel, tourism and
    hospitality research firm, in 2007 35% of worldwide leisure,
    unmanaged and corporate travel expenditures occurred online,
    with 51% in the United States, compared with 32% of European
    travel and 15% in the Asia Pacific region. These penetration
    rates have increased considerably over the past few years, and
    are expected to continue growing. This significant growth has
    attracted many competitors to online travel. This competition
    has intensified in recent years, and the industry is expected to
    remain highly competitive for the foreseeable future.

In addition to the growth of online travel agencies, airlines
    and lodging companies have aggressively pursued direct online
    distribution of their products and services over the last
    several years, with supplier growth outpacing online growth
    since 2002, and now accounting for more than 60% of all online
    travel expenditures in the United States according to
    PhoCusWright.



Differentiation among the various website offerings has narrowed
    dramatically in the past several years, and the travel landscape
    has grown extremely competitive, with the need for competitors
    to generally differentiate their offerings on features other
    than price. It has also led to the development of alternative
    business models and methods of payment for travelers and
    suppliers. Overall competition has led to aggressive marketing
    spend by the travel suppliers and intermediaries, and a
    meaningful reduction in Expedia’s overall marketing
    efficiencies.

Strategy

Expedia plays a fundamental role in facilitating travel, whether
    for leisure or business, by seeking to build the world’s
    largest and most intelligent travel marketplace. We accomplish
    this by securing superior supply quality and price
    competitiveness; matching supply and demand as intelligently as
    possible; inspiring and empowering our travelers to find and
    build the right trip; expanding our global demand footprint
    aggressively; and achieving excellence in our people,
    technology, and processes to make quality, consistency, and
    efficiency the foundation of our marketplace.

A discussion of the critical assets that we leverage in
    achieving our business strategy follows:

Portfolio of Travel Brands.

We seek to appeal
    to the broadest possible range of travelers and suppliers
    through our collection of industry-leading brands. We target
    several different demographics, from the value-conscious
    traveler through our Hotwire brand to luxury travelers seeking a
    high-touch, customized vacation package through our Classic
    Vacations brand. We believe our flagship Expedia brand appeals
    to the broadest range of travelers, with our extensive product
    offering ranging from single item bookings of discounted product
    to complex bundling of higher-end travel packages. Our
    Hotels.com site and its international versions target travelers
    with premium content about lodging properties, and generally
    appeal to travelers with shorter booking windows who prefer to
    drive to their destinations.

Technology and Continuous Innovation.

Expedia
    has an established tradition of innovation, from
    Expedia.com’s inception as a division of Microsoft to our
    introduction of more recent innovations such as
    Expedia.com’s TravelAds sponsored search product for hotel
    advertisers, Hotwires’s Airfare Savings Hub,
    Hotels.com’s slider tools for improving search results and
    the TripAdvisor Media Network’s offering of leading travel
    applications for download on Facebook.com.

We intend to continue to aggressively innovate on behalf of our
    travelers and suppliers, including our current efforts to build
    a scaleable, service-oriented technology platform for our
    travelers, which will extend across our portfolio of brands. We
    expect this to result in improved flexibility and allow faster
    innovation. This transition should allow us to improve site
    merchandising, browse and search functionalities, improve search
    index optimization and add significant personalization features.
    This transition is occurring in a phased approach, with a
    portion of our worldwide points of sale continuing to migrate to
    the new platform in 2008.

For our suppliers, we have developed proprietary technology that
    streamlines the interaction between some of our websites and
    hotel central reservation systems, making it easier for hotels
    to manage reservations made through our brands. We began
    offering more streamlined application programming interfaces for
    certain of our lodging partners in 2007 to enable faster and
    simpler integration of real-time hotel content and intend to
    continue investing in tools to make supplier integration easier,
    more seamless and cost effective.

Global Reach.

We currently operate our points
    of sale in both the U.S. and internationally, including
    Expedia-branded sites in the United States, Australia, Austria,
    Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, the
    Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Spain, Sweden and the United
    Kingdom. Our Hotels.com and TripAdvisor brands also maintain
    both U.S. points of sale and additional points of sale
    outside the United States. We also offer Chinese travelers an
    array of products and services through our majority ownership in
    eLong. In 2007, our European segment gross bookings and revenue
    accounted for approximately 21% of worldwide gross bookings and
    23% of worldwide revenue.

We intend to continue investing in and growing our existing
    international points of sale. We anticipate launching points of
    sale in additional countries where we find large travel markets
    and rapid growth of online commerce, such as India.



ECT currently supports operations in the United States, Belgium,
    Canada, China, France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United
    Kingdom. We believe the corporate travel sector represents a
    large opportunity for Expedia, and we believe we offer a
    compelling technology solution to businesses seeking to control
    travel costs and improve their employees’ travel
    experiences. We intend to continue investing in and expanding
    the geographic footprint of our ECT business.

In expanding our global reach, we leverage significant
    investments in technology, operations, brand building, supplier
    relationships and other initiatives that we have made since the
    launch of Expedia.com in 1996. We intend to continue leveraging
    this investment when launching additional points of sale in new
    countries, introducing website features, adding supplier
    products and services, or offering proprietary and
    user-generated content for travelers.

Breadth of Product & Content
    Offerings.

We believe we offer a comprehensive
    array of innovative travel products, services and content
    resources to travelers. We plan to continue improving and
    growing these offerings, as well as expand them to our worldwide
    points of sale over time.

Most of our revenue comes from transactions involving the
    booking of hotel reservations and the sale of airline tickets,
    either as stand-alone products or as part of package
    transactions. We are working to grow our package business as it
    results in higher revenue per transaction, and we also seek to
    continue diversifying our revenue mix beyond core air and hotel
    products to car rental, destination services, cruise and other
    product offerings. We are also working to increase the mix of
    advertising and media revenue from both the expansion of our
    TripAdvisor Media Network, as well as increased advertising
    revenue from our worldwide websites which have historically been
    focused on transaction revenue, such as Expedia.com and
    Hotels.com.

Seasonality

We generally experience seasonal fluctuations in the demand for
    our travel products and services. For example, traditional
    leisure travel bookings are generally the highest in the first
    three quarters as travelers plan and book their spring, summer
    and holiday travel. The number of bookings typically decreases
    in the fourth quarter. Because revenue in the merchant business
    is generally recognized when the travel takes place rather than
    when it is booked, revenue typically lags bookings by several
    weeks or longer. As a result, revenue is typically the lowest in
    the first quarter and highest in the third quarter. The
    continued growth of our international operations or a change in
    our product mix may influence the typical trend of our
    seasonality in the future.

Critical
    Accounting Policies and Estimates

Critical accounting policies and estimates are those that we
    believe are important in the preparation of our consolidated
    financial statements because they require that we use judgment
    and estimates in applying those policies. We prepare our
    consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in
    accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the
    United States (“GAAP”). Preparation of the
    consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes
    requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the
    reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of
    contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the
    consolidated financial statements as well as revenue and
    expenses during the periods reported. We base our estimates on
    historical experience, where applicable, and other assumption
    that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Actual
    results may differ from our estimates under different
    assumptions or conditions.

There are certain critical estimates that we believe require
    significant judgment in the preparation of our consolidated
    financial statements. We consider an accounting estimate to be
    critical if:

•

It requires us to make an assumption because information was not
    available at the time or it included matters that were highly
    uncertain at the time we were making the estimate; and

•

Changes in the estimate or different estimates that we could
    have selected may have had a material impact on our financial
    condition or results of operations.



For more information on each of these policies, see
    Note 2 — Significant Accounting Policies, in the
    notes to consolidated financial statements. We discuss
    information about the nature and rationale for our critical
    accounting estimates below.

Accounting
    for Certain Merchant Revenue

We accrue the cost of certain merchant revenue based on the
    amount we expect to be billed by suppliers. In certain instances
    when a supplier invoices us for less than the cost we accrued,
    we generally recognize those amounts as revenue six months in
    arrears, net of an allowance, when we determine it is not
    probable that we will be required to pay the supplier, based on
    historical experience and contract terms. Actual revenue could
    be greater or less than the amounts estimated due to changes in
    hotel billing practices or changes in traveler behavior.

Marketing
    Promotions

We periodically provide incentive offers to our customers to
    encourage booking of travel products and services, which include
    inducement offers. Inducement offers include discounts granted
    at the time of a current purchase to be applied against a future
    qualifying purchase. We treat inducement offers as a reduction
    to revenue based on estimated future redemption rates. We
    allocate the discount amount between the current purchase and
    the potential future purchase based on our expected relative
    value of the transactions. We estimate our redemption rates
    using our historical experience for similar inducement offers,
    and the amounts we record as a reduction to revenue on current
    purchases could vary significantly based on the redemption
    estimates used.

Recoverability
    of Goodwill and Indefinite and Definite-Lived Intangible
    Assets

Goodwill.

We assess goodwill for impairment
    annually as of October 1, or more frequently, if events and
    circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred. The
    impairment test requires us to estimate the fair value of our
    reporting units. If the carrying value of the reporting unit
    exceeds the fair value, the goodwill of the reporting unit is
    potentially impaired and we proceed to step two of the
    impairment analysis. In step two of the analysis, we will record
    an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying value of
    the reporting unit’s goodwill over its implied fair value
    should such a circumstance arise.

We generally base our measurement of fair value of reporting
    units on a blended analysis of the present value of future
    discounted cash flows and market valuation approach. The
    discounted cash flows model indicates the fair value of the
    reporting units based on the present value of the cash flows
    that we expect the reporting units to generate in the future.
    Our significant estimates in the discounted cash flows model
    include: our weighted average cost of capital; long-term rate of
    growth and profitability of our business; working capital
    effects; and effective income tax rate. The market valuation
    approach indicates the fair value of the business based on a
    comparison of the company to comparable firms in similar lines
    of business that are publicly traded. Our significant estimates
    in the market approach model include identifying similar
    companies with comparable business factors such as size, growth,
    profitability, risk and return on investment and assessing
    comparable revenue and operating income multiples in estimating
    the fair value of the reporting units.

We believe the weighted use of discounted cash flows and market
    approach is the best method for determining the fair value of
    our reporting units because:

•

It excludes the impact of short-term volatility;

•

It includes all information available to management, which is
    generally more than that is available to the external capital
    markets;

•

Both models are the most common valuation methodologies used
    within the travel and internet industries; and

•

The blended use of both models compensates for the inherent
    risks associated with each model if used on a stand-alone basis.



The use of different estimates or assumptions in determining the
    fair value of our goodwill may result in different values for
    these assets, which could result in an impairment.

Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets.

We base
    our measurement of fair value of indefinite-lived intangible
    assets, which primarily consist of trade name and trademarks,
    using the relief-from-royalty method. This method assumes that
    the trade name and trademarks have value to the extent that
    their owner is relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for
    the benefits received from them. This method requires us to
    estimate the future revenue for the related brands, the
    appropriate royalty rate and the weighted average cost of
    capital.

The use of different estimates or assumptions in determining the
    fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets may result
    in different values for these assets, which could result in an
    impairment.

Definite-Lived Intangible Assets.

We review
    the carrying value of long-lived assets to be used in operations
    whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
    carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable. Factors
    that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a
    significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an
    asset is used, a significant adverse change in legal factors or
    the business climate that could affect the value of the asset,
    or a significant decline in the observable market value of an
    asset, among others. If such facts indicate a potential
    impairment, an impairment loss would only be recorded if the
    asset’s carrying amount is not recoverable through its
    undiscounted cash flows. Any impairment would be measured as the
    difference between the asset’s carrying amount and
    estimated fair value, determined using appropriate valuation
    methodologies which would typically include an estimate of
    discounted cash flows. Our impairment analysis is based on
    available information and on assumptions and projections that we
    consider to be reasonable and supportable. This analysis
    requires us to estimate current and future cash flows
    attributable to the group of assets, the time period for which
    they will be held and used as well as a discount rate to
    incorporate the time value of money and the risks inherent in
    future cash flows.

The use of different estimates or assumptions in determining the
    fair value of our definite-lived intangible assets may result in
    different values for these assets, which could result in an
    impairment.

Income
    Taxes

In accordance with SFAS No. 109,

Accounting for
    Income Taxes

, we record income taxes under the liability
    method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect our
    estimation of the future tax consequences of temporary
    differences between the carrying amounts of assets and
    liabilities for book and tax purposes. We determine deferred
    income taxes based on the differences in accounting methods and
    timing between financial statement and income tax reporting.
    Accordingly, we determine the deferred tax asset or liability
    for each temporary difference based on the enacted tax rates
    expected to be in effect when we realize the underlying items of
    income and expense. We consider many factors when assessing the
    likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets,
    including our recent earnings experience by jurisdiction,
    expectations of future taxable income, and the carryforward
    periods available to us for tax reporting purposes, as well as
    other relevant factors. We may establish a valuation allowance
    to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount we believe is more
    likely than not to be realized. Due to inherent complexities
    arising from the nature of our businesses, future changes in
    income tax law, tax sharing agreements or variances between our
    actual and anticipated operating results, we make certain
    judgments and estimates. Therefore, actual income taxes could
    materially vary from these estimates.

We record liabilities to address uncertain tax positions we have
    taken in previously filed tax returns or that we expect to take
    in a future tax return. The determination for required
    liabilities is based upon an analysis of each individual tax
    position, taking into consideration whether it is more likely
    than not that our tax position, based on technical merits, will
    be sustained upon examination. For those positions for which we
    conclude it is more likely than not it will be sustained, we
    recognize the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than
    50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate
    settlement with the taxing authority. The difference between the
    amount recognized and the total tax position is recorded as a
    liability. The ultimate resolution of these tax positions may be
    greater or less than the liabilities recorded. We adopted
    Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes — an
    interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109

, in the first
    quarter of 2007.



Other
    Long-Term Liabilities

Various Legal and Tax Contingencies.

We record
    liabilities to address potential exposures related to business
    and tax positions we have taken that have been or could be
    challenged by taxing authorities. In addition, we record
    liabilities associated with legal proceedings and lawsuits.
    These liabilities are recorded when the likelihood of payment is
    probable and the amounts can be reasonably estimated. The
    determination for required liabilities is based upon analysis of
    each individual tax issue, or legal proceeding, taking into
    consideration the likelihood of adverse judgments and the range
    of possible loss. In addition, our analysis may be based on
    discussions with outside legal counsel. The ultimate resolution
    of these potential tax exposures and legal proceedings may be
    greater or less than the liabilities recorded.

Occupancy Tax.

Some states and localities
    impose a transient occupancy or accommodation tax, or a form of
    sales tax, on the use or occupancy of hotel accommodations.
    Generally, hotels charge taxes based on the room rate paid to
    the hotel and remit these taxes to the various tax authorities.
    When a customer books a room through one of our travel services,
    we collect a tax recovery charge from the customer which we pay
    to the hotel. We do not collect or remit occupancy taxes, nor do
    we pay occupancy taxes to the hotel operator on the portion of
    the customer payment we retain. Some jurisdictions have
    questioned our practice in this regard. While the applicable tax
    provisions vary among the jurisdictions, we generally believe
    that we are not required to collect and remit such occupancy
    taxes. We are engaged in discussions with tax authorities in
    various jurisdictions to resolve this issue. Some tax
    authorities have brought lawsuits or have levied assessments
    asserting that we are required to collect and remit occupancy
    tax. The ultimate resolution in all jurisdictions cannot be
    determined at this time.

We have established a reserve for the potential settlement of
    issues related to hotel occupancy taxes for prior and current
    periods, consistent with applicable accounting principles and in
    light of all current facts and circumstances. A variety of
    factors could affect the amount of the liability (both past and
    future), which factors include, but are not limited to, the
    number of, and amount of revenue represented by, jurisdictions
    that ultimately assert a claim and prevail in assessing such
    additional tax or negotiate a settlement and changes in relevant
    statutes.

We note that there are more than 7,000 taxing jurisdictions in
    the United States, and it is not feasible to analyze the
    statutes, regulations and judicial and administrative rulings in
    every jurisdiction. Rather, we have obtained the advice of state
    and local tax experts with respect to tax laws of certain states
    and local jurisdictions that represent a large portion of our
    hotel revenue. Many of the fundamental statutes and regulations
    that impose these taxes were established before the growth of
    the internet and

e-commerce.

It is possible that some jurisdictions may introduce new
    legislation regarding the imposition of occupancy taxes on
    businesses that arrange the booking of hotel accommodations. We
    continue to work with the relevant tax authorities and
    legislators to clarify our obligations under new and emerging
    laws and regulations. We will continue to monitor the issue
    closely and provide additional disclosure, as well as adjust the
    level of reserves, as developments warrant. Additionally,
    certain of our businesses are involved in occupancy tax related
    litigation which is discussed in Part I, Item 3, Legal
    Proceedings.

Stock-Based
    Compensation

We record stock-based compensation expense net of estimated
    forfeitures. In determining the estimated forfeiture rates for
    stock-based awards, we periodically conduct an assessment of the
    actual number of equity awards that have been forfeited to date
    as well as those expected to be forfeited in the future. We
    consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures,
    including the type of award, the employee class and historical
    experience. The estimate of stock awards that will ultimately be
    forfeited requires significant judgment and to the extent that
    actual results or updated estimates differ from our current
    estimates, such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative
    adjustment in the period such estimates are revised. In 2005, we
    recognized significant changes in estimates related to our
    forfeiture rate. See Note 9 — Stock-Based Awards
    and Other Equity Instruments in the notes to the consolidated
    financial statements for further discussion.

Segments

We have two reportable segments: North America and Europe. We
    determined our segments based on how our chief operating
    decision makers manage our business, make operating decisions
    and evaluate operating performance.

Our North America segment provides a full range of travel

and/or

advertising services to customers primarily located in the
    United States, Canada and Mexico. This segment operates through
    a variety of brands including Expedia.com, Hotels.com,
    Hotwire.com and TripAdvisor.

Our Europe segment provides travel services primarily through
    localized Expedia websites in Austria, Denmark, France, Germany,
    Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden and the
    United Kingdom, as well as localized versions of Hotels.com in
    various European countries.

Corporate and Other includes ECT, Expedia Asia Pacific and
    unallocated corporate functions and expenses. ECT provides
    travel products and services to corporate customers in North
    America and Europe. Expedia Asia Pacific provides online travel
    information and reservation services primarily through eLong in
    China, localized Expedia websites in Australia, Japan and New
    Zealand, as well as localized versions of Hotels.com in various
    Asian countries.

Operating
    Metrics

Our operating results are affected by certain metrics that
    represent the selling activities generated by our travel
    products and services. As travelers have increased their use of
    the internet to book their travel arrangements, we have seen our
    gross bookings increase, reflecting the growth in the online
    travel industry and our business acquisitions. Gross bookings
    represent the total retail value of transactions booked for both
    agency and merchant transactions, recorded at the time of
    booking reflecting the total price due for travel by travelers,
    including taxes, fees and other charges, and are generally
    reduced for cancellations and refunds.

Gross bookings increased $2.8 billion, or 16%, in 2007
    compared to 2006, and $1.6 billion, or 10%, in 2006
    compared to 2005. In 2007, North America gross bookings
    increased 9% and Europe gross bookings increased 41% compared to
    2006. In 2006, domestic gross bookings increased 6% and
    international gross bookings increased 26% compared to 2005. The
    increases in 2007 and 2006 were primarily due to increases in
    transaction volumes and travel product prices.



Revenue margin, which is defined as revenue as a percentage of
    gross bookings, increased 30 basis points in 2007 compared
    to 2006. In 2007, revenue margin increased 53 basis points
    in our North America segment. The increase in worldwide and
    North America revenue margin in 2007 was primarily due to an
    increased mix of advertising and media revenue partially offset
    by a decline in revenue per air ticket. Revenue margin decreased
    69 basis points in our Europe segment in 2007 as compared
    to 2006 primarily due to lower air commissions and booking fees
    as well as lower revenue resulting from more competitive hotel
    pricing. Revenue margin decreased 59 basis points in 2006
    compared to 2005. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease
    in air revenue per ticket, coupled with an increase in average
    worldwide airfares of 9% for 2006 compared to 2005, as our
    remuneration generally does not vary with the price of the
    ticket.

In 2007, the increase in revenue was primarily due to increases
    in worldwide merchant hotel revenue and, to a lesser extent,
    advertising and media revenue.

Worldwide merchant hotel revenue increased 19% in 2007 compared
    to 2006. The increase was primarily due to a 12% increase in
    room nights stayed, including rooms delivered as a component of
    vacation packages as well as a 6% increase in revenue per room
    night. Revenue per room night increased due to a 6% increase in
    worldwide ADRs partially offset by a 13 basis point decline
    in hotel raw margin (defined as hotel net revenue as a
    percentage of hotel gross revenue).

Worldwide air revenue decreased 2% in 2007 compared to 2006 due
    to a 12% decrease in revenue per air ticket partially offset by
    an increase of 12% in air tickets sold. The decrease in revenue
    per air ticket primarily reflects decreased compensation from
    air carriers and GDS providers, and to a lesser extent, reduced
    air service fees versus the prior year period.

Package revenue grew 7% in 2007 compared to the prior year
    primarily due to higher European package bookings.

The remaining worldwide revenue other than merchant hotel and
    air discussed above, which includes advertising and media,
    agency hotel, car rental, destination services, and cruises,
    increased by 38% in 2007 compared to 2006 primarily due to an
    increase in advertising and media revenue as well as car rental
    revenues.

In 2006, the increase in revenue was primarily driven by
    increased worldwide merchant hotel revenue, partially offset by
    a decline in our domestic air revenue. In 2006, domestic revenue
    growth remained flat and international revenue increased by 24%
    compared to 2005.

Worldwide merchant hotel revenue increased 13% in 2006 compared
    to 2005 primarily due to a 10% increase in room nights stayed,
    including rooms delivered as a component of vacation packages,
    as well as a 2% increase in revenue per room night. Revenue per
    room night increased due to a 6% increase in worldwide ADRs,
    partially offset by a 100 basis point decrease in hotel raw
    margins (defined as hotel net revenue as a percentage of hotel
    gross revenue). Our merchant hotel raw margins decreased in 2006
    and 2005 as hotel room suppliers have taken advantage of higher
    occupancies and the efficacy of their own online distribution to
    negotiate more favorable terms.



Worldwide air revenue decreased 14% in 2006 compared to 2005 due
    to a 13% decrease in revenue per air ticket and a 2% decrease in
    air tickets sold. The decrease in revenue per air ticket
    reflects decreased compensation from air carriers and GDS
    providers. The decrease in air tickets sold reflects the
    reduction in relative capacity of carriers participating in our
    marketplace and continued challenges in obtaining merchant air
    inventory in light of record industry load factors. Lesser
    availability of merchant air inventory also impacted our
    packages revenue, which grew only 1% in 2006 compared to 2005.

Other revenue which includes advertising and media, agency
    hotel, car rental, destination services, and cruises, increased
    by 7% in 2006 compared to 2005 primarily due to an increase in
    advertising and media revenue.

Cost of revenue primarily consists of (1) costs of our data
    and call centers, including telesales, (2) credit card
    merchant fees, (3) fees paid to fulfillment vendors for
    processing airline tickets and related customer services,
    (4) costs paid to suppliers for certain destination
    inventory, (5) reserves and related payments to airlines
    for tickets purchased with fraudulent credit cards and
    (6) stock-based compensation.

The cost of revenue increase in 2007 compared to 2006 and in
    2006 compared to 2005 was primarily due to higher costs
    associated with the increase in transaction volumes.

The year-over-year increases in gross profit are primarily due
    to increased revenue and, to a lesser extent, an increase in
    gross margin. Gross margin increased 136 basis points in
    2007 as compared to 2006 primarily due to an increased mix of
    advertising and media revenue as well as cost savings from our
    various efficiency initiatives. Gross margin increased in 2006
    as compared to 2005 primarily due to the increased mix of
    merchant hotel revenue.

Selling and marketing expense relates to direct advertising
    expense, including television, radio and print spending, as well
    as traffic generation from internet portals, search engines, and
    our private label and affiliate programs. The remainder of the
    expense relates to indirect costs, including stock-based
    compensation costs and market manager staffing in our Partner
    Services Group (“PSG”), Expedia Corporate Travel,
    Expedia Local Expert and TripAdvisor Media Network.

In 2007, the increase in selling and marketing was primarily due
    to increased direct online search and brand spend across our
    worldwide points of sale, as well as higher personnel costs.

In 2006, the increase in selling and marketing expenses was
    primarily due to growth in indirect PSG and destination services
    staffing costs. Direct selling and marketing expense grew 7% in
    2006.

We expect selling and marketing expense to be higher as a
    percentage of revenue in 2008 as we continue to support our
    established brands and geographies, grow our earlier stage
    international markets, increase our use of brand spend as
    markets reach scale, anticipate continued keyword inflation,
    invest in our global



advertising and media businesses and expand our corporate travel
    sales, destination services and market management teams.

General and administrative expense consists primarily of
    (1) personnel-related costs for support functions that
    include our executive leadership, finance, legal, tax,
    technology and human resource functions, (2) stock-based
    compensation costs and (3) fees for external professional
    services including legal, tax and accounting.

In 2007, the increase in general and administrative expense was
    primarily due to higher personnel costs related to expansion of
    our corporate information technology functions, our European
    businesses and TripAdvisor Media Network as well as higher
    incentive compensation expense, higher legal expenses and higher
    payroll taxes related to stock option exercises. We expect
    general and administrative expense as a percentage of revenue in
    2008 to remain relatively similar to 2007.

In 2006, the increase in general and administrative expense was
    primarily due to an increase in our headcount and accompanying
    compensation resulting from our being a stand-alone public
    company for the full year as well as increased legal expenses,
    partially offset by a decrease in stock-based compensation
    expense. Stock-based compensation expense decreased in 2006
    compared to 2005 primarily due to stock options that completed
    their vesting cycles.

Technology and content expense consists of expenses for
    customizing our websites, amortization of website and internal
    software development costs, localization of our websites, and
    product development expenses such as personnel-related costs,
    including stock-based compensation.

The

year-over-year

expense increases in 2007 and 2006 were primarily due to growth
    in personnel-related expenses in our software development and
    engineering teams as we continued to increase our level of
    website innovation. The increase in 2007 was also due to
    increased amortization of capitalized software development
    costs, a significant amount of which relates to projects that
    were placed into service beginning in the fourth quarter of
    2006. For additional information about our policy related to
    capitalized software costs, see Note 2 —
    Significant Accounting Policies.

Given our historical and ongoing investments in our enterprise
    data warehouse, new platform, geographic expansion, data
    centers, redundancy, call center technology, site merchandising,
    content management, site monitoring, networking, corporate
    travel, supplier integration and other initiatives, we expect
    technology and content expense to increase in absolute dollars

In 2007 and 2006, amortization of intangible assets expense
    decreased compared to 2006 and 2005 primarily due to the

    related to new business acquisitions.

Impairment
    of Intangible Asset

In 2006, we recognized an impairment charge of

In 2007, the increase in operating income was primarily due to
    an increase in gross profit, the impairment charge of
    $47.0 million in 2006 and a decrease in amortization of
    intangibles and amortization of non-cash distribution and
    marketing, partially offset by growth in sales and marketing
    expense and technology and content expense.

In 2006, the decrease in operating income was primarily due to
    the impairment charge of $47.0 million and higher selling
    and marketing and general and administrative expenses. These
    increases were partially offset by an increase in gross profit,
    lower amortization expense related to intangible assets and
    lower stock-based compensation.

In 2005, we recorded stock-based compensation expense of
    $91.7 million primarily related to stock options and RSUs.
    Our 2005 stock-based compensation expense includes a benefit of
    $44.7 million related to changes in estimated forfeiture
    rates for stock options and RSUs and capitalization of software
    development costs, partially offset by a modification charge on
    stock option awards related to the Spin-Off. In 2005, we
    completed assessments of the estimated forfeiture rates
    including analyses of the actual number of instruments that had
    forfeited to date compared to prior estimates and an evaluation
    of future estimated forfeitures. For additional information, see

In 2007, the increase in OIBA was primarily due to an increase

    a percentage of revenue decreased primarily due to growth in
    sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue,
    partially offset by an increase in gross margin.

In 2006, the decrease in OIBA was primarily due to higher
    operating expenses, partially offset by higher revenue and the
    improvement in gross margin.

Definition
    of OIBA

We provide OIBA as a supplemental measure to GAAP. We define
    OIBA as operating income plus: (1) amortization of non-cash
    distribution and marketing expense, (2) stock-based
    compensation expense, (3) amortization of intangible assets
    and goodwill and intangible asset impairment, if applicable and
    (4) certain one-time items, if applicable.

OIBA is the primary operating metric used by which management
    evaluates the performance of our business, on which internal
    budgets are based, and by which management is compensated.
    Management believes that investors should have access to the
    same set of tools that management uses to analyze our results.
    This non-GAAP measure should be considered in addition to
    results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be
    considered a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP. We endeavor
    to compensate for the limitation of the non-GAAP measure
    presented by also providing the comparable GAAP measures, GAAP
    financial statements, and descriptions of the reconciling items
    and adjustments, to derive the non-GAAP measure. We present a
    reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial measure to GAAP below.

OIBA represents the combined operating results of Expedia,
    Inc.’s businesses, taking into account depreciation, which
    we believe is an ongoing cost of doing business, but excluding
    the effects of other non-cash expenses that may not be
    indicative of our core business operations. We believe this
    measure is useful to investors for the following reasons:

•

It corresponds more closely to the cash operating income
    generated from our core operations by excluding significant
    non-cash operating expenses, such as stock-based
    compensation; and

•

It provides greater insight into management decision making at
    Expedia, as OIBA is our primary internal metric for evaluating
    the performance of our business.

OIBA has certain limitations in that it does not take into
    account the impact of certain expenses to our consolidated
    statements of income, including stock-based compensation,
    non-cash payments to partners, acquisition-related accounting
    and certain one-time items, if applicable. Due to the high
    variability and difficulty in predicting certain items that
    affect net income, such as tax rates, stock price and interest
    rates, we are unable to provide a reconciliation to net income
    on a forward-looking basis without unreasonable efforts.

Prior to the Spin-Off, the intercompany receivable balances were

    Spin-Off with a non-cash distribution to IAC, we no longer

The year-over-year increases in other interest income were

Interest expense increased in 2007 as compared to 2006 primarily
    due to higher average debt balances resulting from the
    $500.0 million senior unsecured notes (the
    “Notes”) issuance in August 2006 and a
    $500.0 million draw on our revolving credit facility in
    August 2007 to fund a portion of the tender offer completed in
    the third quarter of 2007. At December 31, 2007 and 2006
    our long-term indebtedness totaled $1.085 billion and
    $500.0 million.

In 2006, interest expense increased compared to 2005 due to
    interest expense related to the Notes.



Write-off
    of Long-Term Investment

In 2005, we received information regarding the deteriorating
    financial condition of our long-term investment in a leisure
    travel company and we determined that it was not likely we would
    recover any of our investment because the decline in its value
    was determined to be

other-than-temporary.

As a result, we recorded a loss related to this impairment of
    $23.4 million. In 2006, we sold our investment for de
    minimis consideration.

In 2007, our effective tax rate was higher than the 35%
    statutory rate primarily due to state income taxes, taxes
    related to our foreign operations and non-deductible losses
    related to our derivative liabilities. The 2007 effective rate
    increased in 2007 as compared to 2006 primarily due to higher
    state taxes, including increases to state tax rates, and
    non-deductible losses related to our derivative liabilities
    compared with a gain in 2006.

In 2006, our effective tax rate was higher than the 35%
    statutory rate primarily due to state income taxes and valuation
    allowance on certain foreign losses, partially offset by
    non-taxable gains related to our derivative liabilities. The
    2006 effective rate decreased as compared to 2005 due to higher
    non-deductible stock-based compensation, non-deductible losses
    related to our derivative liabilities in 2005 compared with a
    gain in 2006 and higher state income taxes in 2005.

In 2005, our effective tax rate was higher than the 35%
    statutory rate primarily due to state taxes and an increase in
    the valuation allowance related to foreign operating losses. In
    addition, our effective tax rate was affected by non-deductible
    stock-based compensation expense, unrealized losses related to
    our derivative liabilities and a loss from the write-off of our
    long-term investment.

Segment
    Operating Results

In the first quarter of 2006, we began reporting two segments;
    North America and Europe. The change from a single reportable
    segment was a result of the reorganization of our business. We
    determined our



segments based on how our chief operating decision makers manage
    our business, make operating decisions and evaluate operating
    performance. Our primary operating metric for evaluating segment
    performance is OIBA (defined above). We have not reported
    segment information for the year ended December 31, 2005,
    as it is not practicable to do so. For additional information
    about our segment results, see Note 16 — Segment
    Information, in the notes to consolidated financial statements.

Financial
    Position, Liquidity and Capital Resources

Our principal sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from
    operations, our cash and cash equivalents balances which were
    $617.4 million and $853.3 million at December 31,
    2007 and 2006, which included $158.2 million and
    $153.3 million of cash at eLong, whose results are
    consolidated into our financial statements due to our
    controlling voting and economic ownership position; and our
    $1.0 billion revolving credit facility, of which
    $362.7 million was available as of December 31, 2007.
    This represents the total $1.0 billion facility less
    $585.0 million of outstanding borrowings and
    $52.3 million of outstanding stand-by letters of credit
    (“LOC”). Outstanding credit facility borrowings bear
    interest based on our financial leverage; based on our
    December 31, 2007 financial statements, the interest rate
    would equate to a base rate plus 75 basis points. We may
    choose (1) the greater of the Prime rate or the Federal
    Funds Rate plus 50 basis points or (2) various
    durations of LIBOR as our base rate. As of February 15,
    2008, the base rate was one-month LIBOR of 3.125%, and is due to
    reprice on March 17, 2008. As of February 15, 2008,
    $85.0 million of the borrowings outstanding at
    December 31, 2007 under the credit facility had been repaid.

Under the merchant model, we receive cash from travelers at the
    time of booking and we record these amounts on our consolidated
    balance sheets as deferred merchant bookings. We pay our
    suppliers related to these bookings generally within two weeks
    after completing the transaction for air travel and, for all
    other merchant bookings, which is primarily our merchant hotel
    business, after the travelers’ use and subsequent billing
    from the supplier. Therefore, generally we receive cash from the
    traveler prior to paying our supplier, and this operating cycle
    represents a working capital source of cash to us. As long as
    the merchant hotel business continues to grow and our business
    model does not significantly change, we expect that changes in
    working capital will positively impact operating cash flows. If
    this business declines relative to our other businesses, or if
    there are changes to the model or booking patterns which
    compress the time between receipts of cash from travelers to
    payments to suppliers, our working capital benefits could be
    reduced, as was the case to a certain degree in 2006 as we
    increased the efficiency of our supplier payment process.

Seasonal fluctuations in our merchant hotel bookings affect the
    timing of our annual cash flows. During the first half of the
    year, hotel bookings have traditionally exceeded stays,
    resulting in much higher cash flow related to working capital.
    During the second half of the year, this pattern reverses. While
    we expect the impact of seasonal fluctuations to continue,
    merchant hotel growth rates or changes to the model or booking
    patterns as discussed above may affect working capital, which
    might counteract or intensify the anticipated seasonal
    fluctuations.

As of December 31, 2007, we had a deficit in our working
    capital of $728.7 million, compared to a deficit of
    $224.8 million as of December 31, 2006. The increase
    in deficit is primarily a result of the completion of two tender
    offers during 2007, partially offset by the generation of
    working capital from operations.

We anticipate continued investment in the development and
    expansion of our operations. These investments include but are
    not limited to improvements to infrastructure, which include our
    enterprise data warehouse, servers, networking equipment and
    software, release improvements to our software code and
    continuing efforts to build a scaleable, service-oriented
    technology platform that will extend across our portfolio of
    brands. We migrated a portion of Expedia.com to the new platform
    during 2007 and we expect additional points of sale to migrate
    to the new platform during 2008. We will also relocate many of
    our global offices, including our corporate headquarters, to
    larger facilities in 2008 to accomodate the growth of our
    business. These moves will result in significant investments to
    improve the new facilities. Total capital expenditures are
    expected to be $140 million to $150 million. Our
    future capital requirements may include capital needs for
    acquisitions or expenditures in support of our business
    strategy. In the event we have



acquisitions, this may reduce our cash balance

and/or

increase our debt. Legal risks and challenges to our business
    strategy may also negatively affect our cash balance.

Our cash flows are as follows:

In 2007, net cash provided by operating activities increased by
    $94.6 million primarily due to an increase in changes in
    operating assets and liabilities and an increase in cash flows
    from operating income, partially offset by an increase in
    interest payments in the current period. In 2006, net cash
    provided by operating activities decreased by
    $241.7 million primarily due to an increase in tax payments
    and a decrease in cash flows from operating income as well as a
    reduced benefit from working capital. We made tax payments of
    $126.1 million, an increase of $115.7 million over
    2005, reducing cash provided by operations due primarily to
    IAC’s payment of taxes on behalf of Expedia prior to our
    becoming an independent public company after which point we
    became responsible for our tax obligations.

In 2007, cash used in investing activities increased by
    $66.0 million primarily due to a $27.1 million
    increase in cash paid for acquisitions and a $31.7 million
    increase in long-term investments and deposits mainly related to
    our 50% investment in a travel company. These increases were
    offset by a decrease of $6.0 million in capital
    expenditures. Excluded from 2007 capital expenditures is
    approximately $13.1 million in capital equipment that we
    received but for which we had not yet paid as of
    December 31, 2007. Cash used in investing activities
    decreased by $687.8 million in 2006 primarily due to the
    absence of transfers to IAC of $757.2 million, partially
    offset by net cash paid for acquisitions of $32.5 million
    and a $40.3 million increase in capital expenditures in
    part due to capitalized software costs incurred for the
    development of our enterprise data warehouse and other
    improvements to our technology infrastructure.

Cash used in financing activities in 2007 primarily included
    cash paid to acquire shares in the first and third quarter
    tender offers pursuant to which we acquired 30 million
    tendered shares of our common stock at a purchase price of
    $22.00 per share and 25 million tendered shares of our
    common stock at $29.00 per share, for a total cost of
    $1.385 billion plus fees and expenses relating to the
    tender offers. In addition, we paid withholding taxes for stock
    option exercises of $121.2 million on behalf of our
    Chairman and Senior Executive in exchange for surrendering a
    portion of his vested shares which were concurrently cancelled.
    These were offset in part by $585.0 million in net
    borrowings on the revolving credit facility used primarily to
    fund a portion of the third quarter tender offer,
    $55.0 million in proceeds from stock option exercises and
    $95.7 million in excess tax benefits on equity awards, of
    which approximately $92.3 million related to the excess tax
    benefit associated with the stock options exercised by our
    Chairman and Senior Executive.

Cash provided by financing activities in 2006 was primarily due
    to the net proceeds of $495.3 million from the Notes
    issuance in 2006 and $35.3 million in proceeds from stock
    option exercises, partially offset by $295.7 million of
    treasury stock activity primarily related to cash paid to
    acquire shares in the second and third quarters pursuant to
    which we acquired in open market trades 20 million shares
    of our common stock at an average per share price of $14.42 for
    a total cost of $288.0 million and the $230.0 million
    repayment of our revolving credit facility, which was initially
    borrowed in 2005.

Cash provided by financing activities in 2005 was primarily due
    to net credit facility borrowings of $230.0 million and
    proceeds from the exercise of stock options of
    $29.1 million, partially offset by withholding taxes for
    stock option exercises of $86.6 million that we paid on
    behalf of our Chairman and



Senior Executive in exchange for surrendering a portion of his
    vested shares to treasury or to be cancelled and distributions
    to IAC of $52.8 million.

During the third quarter of 2006, we issued $500.0 million
    Notes for net proceeds of $495.3 million. The Notes are due
    August 2018 and bear a fixed interest rate of 7.456% with
    interest payable semi-annually in February and August of each
    year, which began in February 2007. The Notes are repayable in
    whole or in part on August 15, 2013, at the option of the
    Note holders, and are redeemable in whole or in part at any time
    at our option. As of December 31, 2007, we were in
    compliance with all related covenants.

The effect of foreign exchange on our cash balances denominated
    in foreign currency in 2007 showed a net decrease of
    $20.6 million. Our foreign currency cash balances continued
    to benefit from foreign currency appreciation, but to a lesser
    extent than 2006 due to a different mix of currencies held and
    relatively less appreciation in certain of the primary foreign
    currencies in which we transact. The effect of foreign exchange
    on our cash balances denominated in foreign currency in 2006
    showed a net increase of $50.7 million from 2005 due to the
    benefit of foreign currency appreciation during that time period
    versus our reporting currency, as well as the increase in our
    foreign denominated cash balances.

We currently have authorization, for which there is no fixed
    termination date, from our Board of Directors to repurchase up
    to 20 million outstanding shares of our common stock; no
    such repurchases have been made under this authorization.

We also have a shelf registration statement filed with the SEC
    under which Expedia, Inc. may offer from time to time debt
    securities, guarantees of debt securities, preferred stock,
    common stock or warrants. The shelf registration statement
    expires on October 15, 2010.

In our opinion, available cash, funds from operations and
    available borrowings will provide sufficient capital resources
    to meet our foreseeable liquidity needs.

Contractual
    Obligations and Commercial Commitments

Our contractual obligations and commercial commitments are as
    follows:

•

Our Notes include interest payments through maturity in 2018
    based on the stated fixed rate of 7.456%.

•

As we expect borrowings under our credit facility to vary, only
    repayment of principal outstanding at December 31, 2007 is
    included. Interest expense and fees related to our credit
    facility were $13.8 million in 2007.

•

We have obligations related to the Ask Jeeves Notes. As a result
    of the Spin-Off, when holders of IAC’s Ask Jeeves Notes
    convert their notes, they will receive shares of both IAC and
    Expedia common stock. Under the terms of the Spin-Off, we are
    obligated to issue shares of our common stock to IAC for
    delivery to the holders of the Ask Jeeves Notes, or pay cash in
    equal value, in lieu of issuing such shares, at our option. The
    Ask Jeeves Notes are due June 1, 2008; upon maturity of
    these notes, our obligation to satisfy demands for conversion
    ceases.

•

The operating leases are for office space and related office
    equipment. We account for these leases on a monthly basis.
    Certain leases contain periodic rent escalation adjustments and
    renewal options. Operating lease obligations expire at various
    dates with the latest maturity in 2018.

•

Our purchase obligations represent the minimum obligations we
    have under agreements with certain of our vendors and marketing
    partners. These minimum obligations are less than our projected
    use for those periods. Payments may be more than the minimum
    obligations based on actual use. In addition, if certain
    obligations are met by our counterparties, our obligations will
    increase.

•

Guarantees and LOCs are commitments that represent funding
    responsibilities that may require our performance in the event
    of third-party demands or contingent events. These commitments
    consist of stand-by LOCs and guarantees. We use our stand-by
    LOCs to secure payment for hotel room transactions to particular
    hotel properties. The outstanding balance of our stand-by LOCs
    directly reduces the amount available to us from our revolving
    credit facility. In addition, we provide a



guarantee to the aviation authority of one country to protect
    against potential non-delivery of our packaged travel services
    sold within that country. This country holds all travel agents
    and tour companies to the same standard. The letter of credit
    amounts in the following table represent the amount of
    commitment expiration per period.

Part II. Item 7A.

Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Market
    Risk Management

Market risk is the potential loss from adverse changes in
    interest rates, foreign exchange rates and market prices. Our
    exposure to market risk includes our Notes, our revolving credit
    facility, derivative instruments, cash and cash equivalents,
    accounts receivable, intercompany receivables, merchant accounts
    payable and deferred merchant bookings denominated in foreign
    currencies. We manage our exposure to these risks through
    established policies and procedures. Our objective is to
    mitigate potential income statement, cash flow and market
    exposures from changes in interest and foreign exchange rates.

Interest
    Rate Risk

In August 2006, we issued $500.0 million Notes with a fixed
    rate of 7.456%. As a result, if market interest rates decline,
    our required payments will exceed those based on market rates.
    The fair value of our Notes was approximately $517 million
    as of December 31, 2007 based on the quoted market price. A
    50 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would
    decrease or increase the fair value of our Notes by
    approximately $19 million.

In July 2005, we entered into a $1.0 billion revolving
    credit facility. The revolving credit facility bears interest
    based on market interest rates plus a spread, which is
    determined based on our financial leverage. The weighted average
    interest rate was 5.70% as of December 31, 2007. As a
    result, we will be susceptible to



fluctuations in interest rates if, consistent with our practice
    to date, we do not hedge the interest rate exposure arising from
    any borrowings under our revolving credit facility. As of
    December 31, 2007, our outstanding borrowing under the
    revolving credit facility was $585.0 million. No borrowings
    were outstanding under the revolving credit facility as of
    December 31, 2006. A hypothetical 10% increase in market
    rates would increase our interest expense by $3.3 million.

We did not experience any significant impact from changes in
    interest rates for the years ended December 31, 2007 or
    2006.

Foreign
    Exchange Risk

We conduct business in certain international markets, primarily
    in Australia, Canada, China and the European Union. Because we
    operate in international markets, we have exposure to different
    economic climates, political arenas, tax systems and regulations
    that could affect foreign exchange rates. Our primary exposure
    to foreign currency risk relates to transacting in foreign
    currency and recording the activity in U.S. dollars.
    Changes in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and these
    other currencies will result in transaction gains or losses,
    which we recognize in our consolidated statements of income. To
    the extent practicable, we minimize this exposure by maintaining
    natural hedges between our current assets and current
    liabilities in similarly denominated foreign currencies.

Future net transaction gains and losses are inherently difficult
    to predict as they are reliant on how the multiple currencies in
    which we transact fluctuate in relation to the U.S. dollar,
    the relative composition and denomination of current assets and
    liabilities each period, and our ability to maintain natural
    hedges against such exposures. As an example, if the foreign
    currencies in which we hold net asset balances were to all
    weaken 10% against the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies
    in which we hold net liability balances were to all strengthen
    10% against the U.S. dollar, we would recognize foreign
    exchange losses of approximately $6.3 million based on the
    net asset or liability balances of our foreign denominated cash
    and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, deferred merchant
    bookings and merchant payable balances as of December 31,
    2007. As the net composition of these balances fluctuate
    frequently, even daily, as do foreign exchange rates, the
    example loss could be compounded or reduced significantly within
    a given period.

During 2007, 2006 and 2005 we recorded net foreign exchange rate
    losses of $22.0 million, net foreign exchange rate gains of
    $10.4 million and net foreign exchange rate losses of
    $0.6 million. As we increase our operations in
    international markets, our exposure to fluctuations in foreign
    currency exchange rates increases. The economic impact to us of
    foreign currency exchange rate movements is linked to
    variability in real growth, inflation, interest rates,
    governmental actions and other factors. These changes, if
    material, could cause us to adjust our financing and operating
    strategies.

As foreign currency exchange rates fluctuate, translation of the
    income statements of our international businesses into
    U.S. dollars affects

year-over-year

comparability of operating results. Historically, we have not
    hedged foreign exchange risks; we periodically review our
    strategy for hedging foreign exchange risks. Our goal in
    managing our foreign exchange risk is to reduce to the extent
    practicable our potential exposure to the changes that exchange
    rates might have on our earnings, cash flows and financial
    position.

We use cross-currency swaps to hedge against the change in value
    of certain intercompany loans denominated in currencies other
    than the lending subsidiaries’ functional currency. For
    additional information about our cross-currency swaps, see
    Note 7 — Derivative Instruments, in the notes to
    consolidated financial statements.

Equity
    Price Risk

We do not maintain any minority investments in equity securities
    as part of our marketable securities investment strategy. Thus,
    our equity price risk primarily relates to fluctuations in our
    stock price, which affects our derivative liabilities related to
    outstanding Ask Jeeves Notes. We base the fair value of these
    derivative instruments primarily on the changes in the market
    price of our common stock.



In 2007, certain of these notes were converted at fair value for
    $6.6 million of common stock, or 0.3 million shares.
    As additional notes are converted, the value of the derivative
    liability will be reduced and our equity price risk will
    decrease accordingly. The conversion of the Ask Jeeves Notes
    during 2007 reduced our obligation to issue our common stock
    from 0.8 million shares as of December 31, 2006, to
    0.5 million shares as of December 31, 2007.

As of December 31, 2007, each $1.00 fluctuation in our
    common stock will result in approximately $0.5 million of
    change in the aggregate fair value of our Ask Jeeves Notes
    derivative liability. An increase in our common stock price will
    result in a charge to our consolidated statements of income and
    a decrease in our common stock price will result in a credit.
    The Ask Jeeves Notes are due June 1, 2008; upon maturity of
    these notes, our obligation to satisfy demands for conversion
    ceases.

    Note 7 — Derivative Instruments, in the notes to

Rule 13a-15(e)

under the Exchange Act). Based upon that evaluation, our
    Chairman and Senior Executive, Chief Executive Officer and Chief
    Financial Officer concluded that, as of the end of the period
    covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures
    were effective.

Management’s
    Report on Internal Control over Financial
    Reporting.

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
    adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined
    in

Rule 13a-15(f)

of the Exchange Act. Internal control over financial reporting
    is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of our financial reporting for external purposes in
    accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
    United States of America. Management conducted an evaluation of
    the effectiveness of our internal control over financial
    reporting based on the criteria for effective control over
    financial reporting described in

Internal Control —
    Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this
    evaluation, management has concluded that, as of
    December 31, 2007, the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting was effective. Management has reviewed its
    assessment with the Audit Committee. Ernst & Young,
    LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has
    audited the effectiveness of our internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2007, as stated in their
    report which is included below.



Limitations
    on Controls.

Management does not expect that our disclosure controls and
    procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will
    prevent or detect all error and fraud. Any control system, no
    matter how well designed and operated, is based upon certain
    assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute,
    assurance that its objectives will be met. Further, no
    evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that
    misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all
    control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the
    Company have been detected.

Report
    of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Internal
    Control Over Financial Reporting

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Expedia, Inc.

We have audited Expedia, Inc.’s internal control over
    financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on
    criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated
    Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
    the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Expedia,
    Inc.’s management is responsible for maintaining effective
    internal control over financial reporting, and for its
    assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
    financial reporting included in the accompanying
    Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial
    Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting based
    on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
    that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the
    design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
    the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we
    considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
    audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Expedia, Inc. maintained, in all material
    respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as
    of December 31, 2007, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    2007 consolidated financial statements of Expedia, Inc. and our
    report dated February 20, 2008 expressed an unqualified
    opinion thereon.

Report of
    Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Expedia, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    Expedia, Inc. as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the
    related consolidated statements of income, changes in
    stockholders’ equity and comprehensive income, and cash
    flows for each of the three years in the period ended
    December 31, 2007. These financial statements are the
    responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
    responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
    statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
    present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
    financial position of Expedia, Inc. at December 31, 2007
    and 2006, and the consolidated results of its operations and its
    cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
    December 31, 2007, in conformity with U.S. generally
    accepted accounting principles.

As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial
    statements, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards
    Board (“FASB”) Interpretation No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes — an
    interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109

, effective
    January 1, 2007; and the Company adopted Statement of
    Financial Accounting Standard No. 123 (revised 2004),

Share-Based Payment

, effective January 1, 2006.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States),
    Expedia, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting
    as of December 31, 2007, based on criteria established in
    Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
    and our report dated February 20, 2008 expressed an
    unqualified opinion thereon.

NOTE 1 —

Organization
    and Basis of Presentation

Description
    of Business

Expedia, Inc. and its subsidiaries provide travel products and
    services to leisure and corporate travelers in the United States
    and abroad. These travel products and services are offered
    through a diversified portfolio of brands including:
    Expedia.com

®

,
    Hotels.com

®

,
    Hotwire.com

tm

,
    our private label programs (Worldwide Travel Exchange and
    Interactive Affiliate Network), Classic Vacations,
    Expedia

®

Corporate Travel (“ECT”),
    eLong

tm

,
    Inc. (“eLong”) and
    TripAdvisor

®

.
    In addition, many of these brands have related international
    points of sale. We refer to Expedia, Inc. and its subsidiaries
    collectively as “Expedia,” the “Company,”
    “us,” “we” and “our” in these
    consolidated financial statements.

Spin-Off
    from IAC/InterActiveCorp

On December 21, 2004, IAC/InterActiveCorp (“IAC”)
    announced its plan to separate into two independent public
    companies to allow each company to focus on its individual
    strategic objectives. We refer to this transaction as the
    “Spin-Off.” A new company, Expedia, Inc., was
    incorporated under Delaware law in April 2005, to hold
    substantially all of IAC’s travel and travel-related
    businesses (“Expedia Businesses”).

On August 9, 2005, the Spin-Off of the Expedia Businesses
    from IAC was completed. Shares of Expedia, Inc. began trading on
    The Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc. (“NASDAQ”) under the
    symbol “EXPE.” In conjunction with the Spin-Off, we
    completed the following transactions: (1) transferred to
    IAC all cash in excess of $100 million, excluding the cash
    and cash equivalents held by eLong; (2) extinguished all
    intercompany receivable balances from IAC, which totaled
    $2.5 billion by recording a non-cash distribution to IAC;
    (3) recorded a non-cash contribution from IAC of a joint
    ownership interest in an airplane, with a value of
    $17.4 million; (4) recorded a non-cash contribution of
    media time, with a value of $17.1 million;
    (5) recorded derivative liabilities for the stock warrants
    and Ask Jeeves Convertible Subordinated Notes (“Ask Jeeves
    Notes”) with a fair value of $101.6 million;
    (6) recorded a modification of stock-based compensation
    awards of $5.4 million; and (7) recapitalized the
    invested equity balance with common stock, Class B common
    stock and preferred stock, whereby holders of IAC stock received
    shares of Expedia stock based on a formula or cash ($50 per
    share plus accrued and unpaid dividends).

Basis
    of Presentation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include
    Expedia, Inc., our wholly-owned subsidiaries, and entities we
    control, or in which we have a variable interest and are the
    primary beneficiary of expected cash profits or losses. We
    record our investments in entities that we do not control, but
    over which we have the ability to exercise significant
    influence, using the equity method. We record our investments in
    entities over which we do not have the ability to exercise
    significant influence using the cost method. We have eliminated
    significant intercompany transactions and accounts.

These consolidated financial statements present our results of
    operations, financial position, changes in stockholders’
    equity and comprehensive income, and cash flows on a combined
    basis through the Spin-Off on August 9, 2005, and on a
    consolidated basis thereafter. We have prepared the combined
    financial statements from the historical results of operations
    and historical bases of the assets and liabilities with the
    exception of income taxes. We have computed income taxes using
    our stand-alone tax rate.

We believe that the assumptions underlying our consolidated
    financial statements are reasonable. However, these consolidated
    financial statements do not present our future financial
    position, the results of our future operations and cash flows,
    nor do they present what our historical financial position,
    results of operations and cash flows would have been prior to
    Spin-Off had we been a stand-alone company.

Expedia,
    Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

Seasonality

We generally experience seasonal fluctuations in the demand for
    our travel products and services. For example, traditional
    leisure travel bookings are generally the highest in the first
    three quarters as travelers plan and book their spring, summer
    and holiday travel. The number of bookings decreases in the
    fourth quarter. Because revenue in the merchant business is
    generally recognized when the travel takes place rather than
    when it is booked, revenue typically lags bookings by several
    weeks or longer. As a result, revenue is typically the lowest in
    the first quarter and highest in the third quarter.

NOTE 2 —

Significant
    Accounting Policies

Consolidation

Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
    Expedia, Inc., our wholly-owned subsidiaries, and entities for
    which we control a majority of the entity’s outstanding
    common stock. We record minority interest in our consolidated
    financial statements to recognize the minority ownership
    interest in our consolidated subsidiaries. Minority interests in
    the earnings and losses of consolidated subsidiaries represent
    the share of net income or loss allocated to members or partners
    in our consolidated entities, which includes the minority
    interest share of net income or loss from eLong.

In addition, we hold variable interests in certain affiliated
    entities of eLong in order to meet the laws and regulations of
    China, which restricts foreign investment in the air-ticketing,
    travel agency, internet content provision and advertising
    businesses. Through a series of agreements with affiliated
    Chinese entities, eLong is the primary beneficiary of expected
    cash losses or profits by contractual right. As such, although
    we do not own capital stock of the Chinese affiliates, we
    consolidate their results.

We have eliminated significant intercompany transactions and
    accounts in our consolidated financial statements.

Accounting
    Estimates

We use estimates and assumptions in the preparation of our
    consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting
    principles generally accepted in the United States
    (“GAAP”). Our estimates and assumptions affect the
    reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
    contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of our
    consolidated financial statements. These estimates and
    assumptions also affect the reported amount of net income during
    any period. Our actual financial results could differ
    significantly from these estimates. The significant estimates
    underlying our consolidated financial statements include revenue
    recognition, recoverability of long-lived and intangible assets
    and goodwill, income taxes, potential settlements related to
    occupancy taxes, stock-based compensation and accounting for
    derivative instruments.

Reclassifications

We have reclassified prior period financial statements to
    conform to the current period presentation.

Revenue
    Recognition

We recognize revenue when it is earned and realizable based on
    the following criteria: persuasive evidence that an arrangement
    exists, services have been rendered, the price is fixed or
    determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured.

We also evaluate the presentation of revenue on a gross versus a
    net basis through application of Emerging Issues Task Force No.
    (“EITF”)

99-19,

Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an
    Agent

. The consensus of this literature is that the
    presentation of revenue as “the gross amount billed to a
    customer because it has earned revenue from the sale of goods or
    services or the net amount retained (that is,

F-8


Expedia,
    Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

the amount billed to a customer less the amount paid to a
    supplier) because it has earned a commission or fee” is a
    matter of judgment that depends on the relevant facts and
    circumstances. In making an evaluation of this issue, some of
    the factors that should be considered are: whether we are the
    primary obligor in the arrangement (strong indicator); whether
    we have general inventory risk (before customer order is placed
    or upon customer return) (strong indicator); and whether we have
    latitude in establishing price. The guidance clearly indicates
    that the evaluations of these factors, which at times can be
    contradictory, are subject to significant judgment and
    subjectivity. If the conclusion drawn is that we perform as an
    agent or a broker without assuming the risks and rewards of
    ownership of goods, revenue should be reported on a net basis.
    For our primary revenue models, discussed below, we have
    determined net presentation is appropriate for the majority of
    revenue transactions.

We offer travel products and services on a stand-alone and
    package basis primarily through two business models: the
    merchant model and the agency model.

Under the merchant model, we facilitate the booking of hotel
    rooms, airline seats, car rentals and destination services from
    our travel suppliers and we are the merchant of record for such
    bookings.

Under the agency model, we act as the agent in the transaction,
    passing reservations booked by the traveler to the relevant
    travel provider. We receive commissions or ticketing fees from
    the travel supplier

and/or

traveler. For agency airline, hotel and car transactions, we
    also receive fees from global distribution systems partners that
    control the computer systems through which these reservations
    are booked.

Merchant Hotel.

Our travelers pay us for
    merchant hotel transactions prior to departing on their trip,
    generally when they book the reservation. We record the payment
    in deferred merchant bookings until the stay occurs, at which
    point we record the revenue. In certain nonrefundable,
    nonchangeable transactions where we have no significant
    post-delivery obligations, we record revenue when the traveler
    completes the transaction on our website, less a reserve for
    chargebacks and cancellations based on historical experience.
    Amounts received from customers are presented net of amounts
    paid to suppliers. In certain instances when a supplier invoices
    us for less than the cost we accrued, we generally recognize
    those amounts as revenue six months in arrears, net of an
    allowance, when we determine it is not probable that we will be
    required to pay the supplier, based on historical experience and
    contract terms.

We generally contract in advance with lodging providers to
    obtain access to room allotments at wholesale rates. Certain
    contracts specifically identify the number of potential rooms
    and the negotiated rate of the rooms to which we may have access
    over the terms of the contracts, which generally range from one
    to three years. Other contracts are not specific with respect to
    the number of rooms and the rates of the rooms to which we may
    have access over the terms of the contracts. In either case we
    may return unbooked hotel room allotments with no obligation to
    the lodging providers within a period specified in each
    contract. For hotel rooms that are cancelled by the traveler
    after the specified period of time, we charge the traveler a
    cancellation fee or penalty that is at least equal to the amount
    a hotel may invoice us for the cancellation.

Merchant Air.

Generally, we determine the
    ticket price for merchant air transactions. We pay the cost of
    the airline ticket generally within two weeks after booking. We
    record cash paid by the traveler as deferred merchant bookings
    and the cost of the airline ticket as prepaid merchant bookings.
    When the flight occurs, we record the difference between the
    deferred merchant bookings and the prepaid merchant bookings as
    revenue on a net basis.

When we have nonrefundable and generally noncancelable merchant
    air transactions, with no significant post-delivery obligations,
    we record revenue upon booking. We record a reserve for
    chargebacks and cancellations at the time of the transaction
    based on historical experience.

Agency Air, Hotel, Car and Cruise.

Our agency
    revenue comes from airline ticket transactions, certain hotel
    transactions as well as cruise and car rental reservations. We
    record agency revenue on air transactions when the traveler
    books the transaction, as we have no significant post-delivery
    obligations. We record agency

Expedia,
    Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

revenue on hotel reservations, cruise and car rental
    reservations either on an accrual basis for payments from a
    commission clearinghouse, or on receipt of commissions from an
    individual supplier. We record an allowance for cancellations
    and chargebacks on this revenue based on historical experience.

Click-Through Fees.

We record revenue from
    click-through fees charged to our travel partners for traveler
    leads sent to the travel partners’ websites. We record
    revenue from click-through fees after the traveler makes the
    click-through to the related travel partners’ websites.

Advertising.

We record advertising revenue
    ratably over the advertising period or upon delivery of
    advertising impressions, depending on the terms of the
    advertising contract.

Other.

We record revenue from all other
    sources either upon delivery or when we provide the service.

Cash
    and Cash Equivalents

Our cash and cash equivalents include cash and liquid financial
    instruments with maturities of 90 days or less when
    purchased.

Accounts
    Receivable

Accounts receivable are generally due within thirty days and are
    recorded net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. We consider
    accounts outstanding longer than the contractual payment terms
    as past due. We determine our allowance by considering a number
    of factors, including the length of time trade accounts
    receivable are past due, previous loss history, a specific
    customer’s ability to pay its obligations to us, and the
    condition of the general economy and industry as a whole.

Property
    and Equipment

We record property and equipment at cost, net of accumulated
    depreciation and amortization. We also capitalize certain costs
    incurred related to the development of internal use software in
    accordance with Statement of Position

98-1,

Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or
    Obtained for Internal Use

, and EITF

No. 00-02,

Accounting for Website Development Costs

. We capitalize
    costs incurred during the application development stage related
    to the development of internal use software. We expense costs
    incurred related to the planning and post-implementation phases
    of development as incurred.

We compute depreciation using the straight-line method over the
    estimated useful lives of the assets, which is three to five
    years for computer equipment, capitalized software development
    and furniture and other equipment. We amortize leasehold
    improvement using the straight-line method, over the shorter of
    the estimated useful life of the improvement or the remaining
    term of the lease.

In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    (“SFAS”) No. 143,

Accounting for Asset
    Retirement Obligations,

we establish assets and liabilities
    for the present value of estimated future costs to return
    certain of our leased facilities to their original condition.
    Such assets are depreciated over the lease period into operating
    expense, and the recorded liabilities are accreted to the future
    value of the estimated restoration costs.

Goodwill
    and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets

Goodwill is assigned to reporting units that are expected to
    benefit from the synergies of the business combination as of the
    acquisition date. We assess goodwill and indefinite-lived
    intangible assets, neither of which is amortized, for impairment
    annually as of October 1 or more frequently if events and
    circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred.

In the evaluation of goodwill for impairment, we first compare
    the fair value of the reporting unit to the carrying value. If
    the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value,
    the goodwill of the reporting

F-10


Expedia,
    Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

unit is potentially impaired and we proceed to step two of the
    impairment analysis. In step two of the analysis, we will record
    an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying value of
    the reporting unit’s goodwill over its implied fair value
    should such a circumstance arise.

In the evaluation of indefinite-lived intangible assets, an
    impairment charge is recorded for the excess of the carrying
    value of indefinite-lived intangible assets over their fair
    value.

We generally base our measurement of fair value of reporting
    units on a blended analysis of the present value of estimated
    future discounted cash flows and market valuation approach,
    which compares revenue and operating income multiples for
    companies of similar industry

and/or

size.
    Our analysis is based on available information and on
    assumptions and projections that we consider to be reasonable
    and supportable. The discounted cash flow analysis considers the
    likelihood of possible outcomes and is based on our best
    estimates of projected future cash flows. We base our
    measurement of fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets,
    which primarily consist of trade name and trademarks, using the
    relief-from-royalty method. This method assumes that the trade
    name and trademarks have value to the extent that their owner is
    relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits
    received from them.

Intangible
    Assets with Definite Lives and Other Long-Lived
    Assets

Intangible assets with definite lives and other long-lived
    assets are carried at cost and are amortized on a straight-line
    basis over their estimated useful lives of two to ten years. We
    review the carrying value of long-lived assets to be used in
    operations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
    that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable.
    Factors that would necessitate an impairment assessment include
    a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an
    asset is used, a significant adverse change in legal factors or
    the business climate that could affect the value of the asset,
    or a significant decline in the observable market value of an
    asset, among others. If such facts indicate a potential
    impairment, an impairment loss would only be recorded if the
    asset’s carrying amount is not recoverable through its
    undiscounted cash flows. Any impairment would be measured as the
    difference between the asset’s carrying amount and
    estimated fair value, determined using appropriate valuation
    methodologies which would typically include an estimate of
    discounted cash flows.

Assets held for sale, to the extent we have any, are reported at
    the lower of cost or fair value less costs to sell.

Investments

We record investments, which are non-marketable, using the cost
    basis when we do not have the ability to exercise significant
    influence over the investee and generally when our ownership in
    the investee is less than 20%. We record investments using the
    equity method when we have the ability to exercise significant
    influence over the investee.

We periodically evaluate the recoverability of investments and
    record a write-down if a decline in value is determined to be
    other-than-temporary. Such an evaluation resulted in the
    write-off of an investment in 2005. See Note 13
    — Other Income (Expense).

Income
    Taxes

In accordance with SFAS No. 109,

Accounting for
    Income Taxes

, we record income taxes under the liability
    method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect our
    estimation of the future tax consequences of temporary
    differences between the carrying amounts of assets and
    liabilities for book and tax purposes. We determine deferred
    income taxes based on the differences in accounting methods and
    timing between financial statement and income tax reporting.
    Accordingly, we determine the deferred tax asset or liability
    for each temporary difference based on the enacted tax rates
    expected to be in effect when we realize the underlying

F-11


Expedia,
    Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

items of income and expense. We consider many factors when
    assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred
    tax assets, including our recent earnings experience by
    jurisdiction, expectations of future taxable income, and the
    carryforward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes,
    as well as other relevant factors. We may establish a valuation
    allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount we believe
    is more likely than not to be realized. Due to inherent
    complexities arising from the nature of our businesses, future
    changes in income tax law, tax sharing agreements or variances
    between our actual and anticipated operating results, we make
    certain judgments and estimates. Therefore, actual income taxes
    could materially vary from these estimates.

On January 1, 2007, we adopted Financial Accounting
    Standards Board (“FASB”) Interpretation No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes — an
    interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109

(“FIN 48”). FIN 48 gives guidance
    related to the financial statement recognition and measurement
    of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return,
    and requires that we recognize in our financial statements the
    impact of a tax position, if that position is more likely than
    not to be sustained upon an examination, based on the technical
    merits of the position.

Occupancy
    Tax

Some states and localities impose a transient occupancy or
    accommodation tax, or a form of sales tax, on the use or
    occupancy of hotel accommodations. Generally, hotels charge
    taxes based on the room rate paid to the hotel and remit these
    taxes to the various tax authorities. When a customer books a
    room through one of our travel services, we collect a tax
    recovery charge from the customer which we pay to the hotel. We
    do not collect or remit occupancy taxes, nor do we pay occupancy
    taxes to the hotel operator on the portion of the customer
    payment we retain. Some jurisdictions have questioned our
    practice in this regard. While the applicable tax provisions
    vary among the jurisdictions, we generally believe that we are
    not required to collect and remit such occupancy taxes. We are
    engaged in discussions with tax authorities in various
    jurisdictions to resolve this issue. Some tax authorities have
    brought lawsuits or have levied assessments asserting that we
    are required to collect and remit occupancy tax. The ultimate
    resolution in all jurisdictions cannot be determined at this
    time. We have established a reserve for the potential settlement
    of issues related to hotel occupancy taxes.

Presentation
    of Taxes in the Income Statement

We present taxes that we collect from customers and remit to
    government authorities on a net basis in our consolidated
    statements of income.

Derivative
    Instruments

Derivative instruments are carried at fair value on our
    consolidated balance sheets.

We have designated cross currency swap agreements as cash flow
    hedges of certain inter-company loan agreements denominated in
    currencies other than the lending subsidiaries’ functional
    currency (the “hedged items”). The hedges have been
    determined to be highly effective, at designation and on an
    ongoing basis. As such, we record the total change in the fair
    value of the hedges in other comprehensive income
    (“OCI”) each period, and concurrently reclassify a
    portion of the gain or loss to other, net to perfectly offset
    gains or losses related to transactional remeasurement of the
    hedged items.

We report the change in the fair value of derivative instruments
    that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment in other, net
    in our consolidated statements of income. We do not hold or
    issue financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes.
    For additional information about derivative instruments, see
    Note 7 — Derivative Instruments.

Foreign
    Currency Translation and Transaction Gains and
    Losses

Our operations outside of the United States use the related
    local currency as their functional currency. We translate
    revenue and expense at average rates of exchange during the
    period. We translate assets and liabilities at the rates of
    exchange as of the consolidated balance sheet dates and include
    foreign currency translation gains and losses as a component of
    accumulated OCI. Due to the nature of our operations and our
    corporate structure, we also have subsidiaries that have
    significant transactions in foreign currencies other than their
    functional currency. We record transaction gains and losses in
    our consolidated statements of income related to the recurring
    remeasurement and settlement of such transactions. To the extent
    practicable, we attempt to minimize this exposure by maintaining
    natural hedges between our current assets and current
    liabilities of similarly denominated foreign currencies.

Debt
    Issuance Costs

We defer costs we incur to issue debt and amortize these costs
    to interest expense over the term of the debt or, when the debt
    can be redeemed at the option of the holders, over the term of
    the redemption option.

Marketing
    Promotions

We periodically provide incentive offers to our customers to
    encourage booking of travel products and services. Generally,
    our incentive offers are as follows:

Current Discount Offers.

These promotions
    include dollar off discounts to be applied against current
    purchases. We record the discounts as reduction in revenue at
    the date we record the corresponding revenue transaction.

Inducement Offers.

These promotions include
    discounts granted at the time of a current purchase to be
    applied against a future qualifying purchase. We treat
    inducement offers as a reduction to revenue based on estimated
    future redemption rates. We allocate the discount amount between
    the current purchase and the potential future purchase based on
    our expected relative value of the transactions. We estimate our
    redemption rates using our historical experience for similar
    inducement offers.

Concession Offers.

These promotions include
    discounts to be applied against a future purchase to maintain
    customer satisfaction. Upon issuance, we record these concession
    offers as a reduction to revenue based on estimated future
    redemption rates. We estimate our redemption rates using our
    historical experience for concession offers.

Advertising
    Expense

We incur advertising expense consisting of offline costs,
    including television and radio advertising, and online
    advertising expense to promote our brands. We expense the
    production costs associated with advertisements in the period in
    which the advertisement first takes place. We expense the costs
    of communicating the advertisement (e.g., television airtime) as
    incurred each time the advertisement is shown. For the years
    ended December 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005, our advertising
    expense was $538.9 million, $427.2 million and
    $425.2 million. As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, we
    had $7.7 million and $12.6 million of prepaid
    marketing expenses included in prepaid expenses and other
    current assets on our consolidated balance sheets.

Stock-Based
    Compensation

Effective January 1, 2006, we began accounting for
    stock-based compensation under the modified prospective method
    provisions of SFAS No. 123(R),

Share-Based
    Payment

, and related guidance. Under SFAS 123(R), we
    continue to measure and amortize the fair value for all
    share-based payments consistent with our past practice under
    SFAS 123,

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,

and SFAS No. 148,

Accounting

F-13


Expedia,
    Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

for Stock-Based Compensation — Transition and
    Disclosure

. As a result, the adoption of SFAS 123(R)
    did not have a material impact on our financial position.

We measure and amortize the fair value of restricted stock
    units, stock options and warrants as follows:

Restricted Stock Units.

Restricted stock units
    (“RSU”) are stock awards that are granted to employees
    entitling the holder to shares of common stock as the award
    vests, typically over a five-year period. We measure the value
    of RSUs at fair value based on the number of shares granted and
    the quoted price of our common stock at the date of grant. We
    amortize the fair value, net of estimated forfeitures, as
    stock-based compensation expense over the vesting term on a
    straight-line basis. We record RSUs that may be settled by the
    holder in cash, rather than shares, as a liability and we
    remeasure these instruments at fair value at the end of each
    reporting period. Upon settlement of these awards, our total
    compensation expense recorded over the vesting period of the
    awards will equal the settlement amount, which is based on our
    stock price on the settlement date.

Performance-based RSUs vest upon achievement of certain
    company-based performance conditions. On the date of grant, we
    assess whether it is probable that the performance targets will
    be achieved, and if assessed as probable, we determine the fair
    value of the performance-based award based on the fair value of
    our common stock at that time. We record compensation expense
    for these awards over the estimated performance period using the
    accelerated method under Financial Accounting Standards Board
    (“FASB”) Interpretation No. (“FIN”) 28,

Accounting for Stock Appreciation Rights and Other Variable
    Stock Option or Award Plans — an interpretation of
    Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 15 and 25

. At
    each reporting period, we reassess the probability of achieving
    the performance targets and the performance period required to
    meet those targets. The estimation of whether the performance
    targets will be achieved and of the performance period required
    to achieve the targets requires judgment, and to the extent
    actual results or updated estimates differ from our current
    estimates, the cumulative effect on current and prior periods of
    those changes will be recorded in the period estimates are
    revised, or the change in estimate will be applied prospectively
    depending on whether the change affects the estimate of total
    compensation cost to be recognized or merely affects the period
    over which compensation cost is to be recognized. The ultimate
    number of shares issued and the related compensation expense
    recognized will be based on a comparison of the final
    performance metrics to the specified targets.

Stock Options and Warrants.

We measure the
    value of stock options and warrants issued or modified,
    including unvested options assumed in acquisitions, on the grant
    date (or modification or acquisition dates, if applicable) at
    fair value, using the Black-Scholes option valuation model. We
    amortize the fair value, net of estimated forfeitures, over the
    remaining vesting term on a straight-line basis.

Estimates of fair value are not intended to predict actual
    future events or the value ultimately realized by employees who
    receive these awards, and subsequent events are not indicative
    of the reasonableness of our original estimates of fair value.
    In determining the estimated forfeiture rates for stock-based
    awards, we periodically conduct an assessment of the actual
    number of equity awards that have been forfeited to date as well
    as those expected to be forfeited in the future. We consider
    many factors when estimating expected forfeitures, including the
    type of award, the employee class and historical experience. The
    estimate of stock awards that will ultimately be forfeited
    requires significant judgment and to the extent that actual
    results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates,
    such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the
    period such estimates are revised. For additional information
    about the changes in estimated forfeiture rates, see
    Note 9 — Stock-Based Awards and Other Equity
    Instruments.

We have calculated an additional paid-in capital
    (“APIC”) pool pursuant to the provisions of
    SFAS 123(R). The APIC pool represents the excess tax
    benefits related to stock-based compensation that are available
    to absorb future tax deficiencies. We include only those excess
    tax benefits that have been realized in accordance with
    SFAS No. 109,

Accounting for Income Taxes

. If
    the amount of future tax deficiencies is greater than the
    available APIC pool, we will record the excess as income tax
    expense in our consolidated statements of

F-14


Expedia,
    Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

income. In 2007 and 2006, we recorded tax deficiencies of
    $3.9 million and $11.6 million against the APIC pool;
    as a result, such deficiencies did not affect our results of
    operations. Excess tax benefits or tax deficiencies are a factor
    in the calculation of diluted shares used in computing dilutive
    earnings per share. The adoption of SFAS 123(R) did not
    have a material impact on our dilutive shares.

Prior to our adoption of SFAS 123(R), we recorded cash
    retained as a result of tax benefit deductions relating to
    stock-based compensation in operating activities in our
    consolidated statements of cash flows, along with other tax cash
    flows, in accordance with the provisions of the EITF

No. 00-15,

Classification in the Statement of Cash Flows of the Income
    Tax Benefit Received by a Company upon Exercise of a
    Nonqualified Employee Stock Option

. SFAS 123(R)
    supersedes

EITF 00-15,

amends SFAS No. 95,

Statement of Cash Flows

,
    and requires that, upon adoption, we present the tax benefit
    deductions relating to excess stock-based compensation
    deductions as a financing activity in our consolidated
    statements of cash flows. In 2007 and 2006, we reported
    $95.7 million and $1.3 million of tax benefit
    deductions as a financing activity that previously would have
    been reported as an operating activity.

Earnings
    Per Share

We compute basic earnings per share by taking net income
    available to common shareholders divided by the weighted average
    number of common and Class B common shares outstanding
    during the period excluding restricted stock and stock held in
    escrow. Diluted earnings per share include the potential
    dilution that could occur from stock-based awards and other
    stock-based commitments using the treasury stock or the as if
    converted methods, as applicable. For additional information on
    how we compute earnings per share, see Note 12 —
    Earnings Per Share.

Fair
    Value of Financial Instruments

The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents and restricted
    cash and cash equivalents reported on our consolidated balance
    sheets approximate fair value as we maintain them with various
    high-quality financial institutions. The accounts receivable are
    short-term in nature and are generally settled shortly after the
    sale. We maintain the carrying amounts of the derivative
    liabilities created in the Spin-Off at fair value, which
    fluctuates primarily based on changes in the price of our common
    stock. The fair values of our cross-currency swaps are
    determined based on the present value of net future cash
    payments and receipts, and fluctuate based on changes in market
    interest rates and the Euro/U.S. dollar exchange rate.

Certain
    Risks and Concentrations

Our business is subject to certain risks and concentrations
    including dependence on relationships with travel suppliers,
    primarily airlines and hotels, dependence on third-party
    technology providers, exposure to risks associated with online
    commerce security and credit card fraud. We also rely on global
    distribution system partners and third-party service providers
    for certain fulfillment services, including one third-party
    service provider for which we accounted for approximately 47% of
    its total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2006 and
    approximately 40% of its total revenue for the nine months ended
    September 30, 2007.

Financial instruments, which potentially subject us to
    concentration of credit risk, consist primarily of cash and cash
    equivalents. We maintain some cash and cash equivalents balances
    with financial institutions that are in excess of Federal
    Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance limits. Our cash and
    cash equivalents are primarily composed of interest bearing bank
    account balances and AAA/Aaa-rated money market funds
    denominated in U.S. dollars, Euros and British Pound
    Sterling.

Contingent
    Liabilities

We have a number of regulatory and legal matters outstanding, as
    discussed further in Note 14 — Commitments and
    Contingencies. Periodically, we review the status of all
    significant outstanding matters to assess the potential
    financial exposure. When (i) it is probable that an asset
    has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and
    (ii) the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated, we
    record the estimated loss in our consolidated statements of
    income. We provide disclosure in the notes to the consolidated
    financial statements for loss contingencies that do not meet
    both these conditions if there is a reasonable possibility that
    a loss may have been incurred that would be material to the
    financial statements. Significant judgment is required to
    determine the probability that a liability has been incurred and
    whether such liability is reasonably estimable. We base accruals
    made on the best information available at the time which can be
    highly subjective. The final outcome of these matters could vary
    significantly from the amounts included in the accompanying
    consolidated financial statements.

New
    Accounting Pronouncements

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157,

Fair Value Measurements

(“SFAS 157”).
    SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for
    measuring fair value in GAAP, and expands disclosures about fair
    value measurements. SFAS 157 applies when another standard
    requires or permits assets or liabilities to be measured at fair
    value. Accordingly, SFAS 157 does not require any new fair
    value measurements. SFAS 157 is effective for fiscal years
    beginning after November 15, 2007, except as it relates to
    nonfinancial assets and liabilities, for which the effective
    date may be delayed. We do not expect the adoption of
    SFAS 157 to have a material impact on our consolidated
    financial statements.

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159,

The
    Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
    Liabilities — Including an Amendment of
    SFAS Statement No. 115

(“SFAS 159”), which is effective for fiscal
    years beginning after November 15, 2007. SFAS 159
    permits an entity to choose to measure many financial
    instruments and certain other items at fair value at specified
    election dates as defined in the standard. Subsequent unrealized
    gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has
    been elected will be reported in earnings. As we do not intend
    to elect fair value treatment for qualifying instruments that
    exist as of the effective date, we do not expect the adoption of
    this Statement to have a material impact on our consolidated
    financial statements. We may elect to measure qualifying
    instruments at fair value in the future.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141R,

Business Combinations

(“SFAS 141R”), which
    replaces SFAS 141. SFAS 141R applies to all
    transactions or other events in which an entity obtains control
    of one or more businesses and requires that all assets and
    liabilities of an acquired business as well as any
    noncontrolling interest in the acquiree be recorded at their
    fair values at the acquisition date. Contingent consideration
    arrangements will be recognized at their acquisition date fair
    values, with subsequent changes in fair value generally
    reflected in earnings. Pre-acquisition contingencies will also
    typically be recognized at their acquisition date fair values.
    In subsequent periods, contingent liabilities will be measured
    at the higher of their acquisition date fair values or the
    estimated amounts to be realized. The Statement is effective for
    business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or
    after the beginning of the first annual reporting period
    beginning on or after December 15, 2008. We are in the
    process of evaluating the impact of the adoption of
    SFAS 141R on our consolidated financial statements.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160,

Accounting and Reporting on Non-controlling Interest in
    Consolidated Financial Statements, an amendment of ARB 51

(“SFAS 160”), which is effective for fiscal
    years beginning after December 15, 2008.
    SFAS 160 states that accounting and reporting for
    minority interests will be recharacterized as noncontrolling
    interests and classified as a component of equity. The
    calculation of earnings per share will continue to be based on
    income amounts attributable to the parent. FAS 160 applies
    to all entities that prepare consolidated financial statements,

    Acquisitions and Other Investments

In 2007, we acquired three travel-related companies. The
    purchase price of these and other acquisition related costs
    totaled $151.8 million, $59.6 million of which we paid
    in cash and $92.2 million of which was accrued at
    December 31, 2007 as a result of the financial performance
    of one of the acquired companies during 2007. The accrued
    purchase consideration represents $92.2 million of
    $100 million total additional purchase price that can be
    achieved based on the annual results of 2007 or 2008, or the two
    periods combined, and is expected to be paid in the first half
    of 2008. As a result of these acquisitions, we recorded
    $126.4 million in goodwill and $17.6 million of
    intangible assets with definite lives. The results of operations
    of each of the acquired businesses have been included in our
    consolidated results from each transaction closing date forward;
    their effect on consolidated net revenue and operating income
    during 2007 was not significant.

During 2007 we also acquired a 50% ownership interest in a
    travel company for $26.0 million in cash. We include this
    investment in Long-term investments and other assets and account
    for it under the equity-method. The investment agreement
    contains certain rights, whereby we may acquire and the investee
    may sell to us the additional shares of the company, at fair
    value or at established multiples of future earnings at our
    discretion, at various times through 2013. We have also entered
    into a commitment to provide the investee a $10 million
    revolving operating line of credit and a credit facility for up
    to $20 million. As of the end of 2008, any amounts due
    under the credit facility are convertible, at our option, into
    shares of the company at a premium to the then fair market
    value. Less than $1 million was drawn against the revolving
    operating line of credit and no amounts were drawn against the
    credit facility as of December 31, 2007.

eLong.

In August 2004, we purchased a 30%
    ownership interest in eLong, a Cayman Island company traded on
    the NASDAQ under the symbol “LONG”, whose principal
    business is the operation of an internet-based travel business
    in China, for approximately $59.0 million in cash, and were
    concurrently issued a warrant to allow us to acquire additional
    shares, with an exercise price of approximately $6.21 per share
    of common stock, or $108.0 million.

In January 2005, we exercised the warrant resulting in an
    aggregate purchase price of $170.6 million including our
    initial investment and the exercise of the warrant and related
    transaction costs, resulting in a total ownership position of
    59% and voting rights of approximately 96%. From August 2004 to
    the warrant exercise date the investment was accounted for under
    the equity method, and from the warrant exercise date forward we
    have consolidated the operating results of eLong. As of
    December 31, 2007, our ownership interest in eLong was 56%.

TripAdvisor.

In April 2004 and July 2005, we
    acquired 94.1% and an additional 1%, respectively, of
    TripAdvisor, a travel search engine and directory that enables
    consumers to research their travel and destination place through
    the internet. The aggregate purchase price for our acquisition
    in April 2004 was $219.3 million. In 2006, we purchased the
    remaining 4.9% minority ownership in TripAdvisor for
    $18.3 million in cash.

We perform our annual assessment of possible impairment of
    goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets as of
    October 1, or more frequently if events and circumstances
    indicate that impairment may have occurred. We performed our
    annual impairment assessment for goodwill and intangible assets
    as of October 1, 2007 and had no impairments.

Our indefinite-lived intangible assets relate principally to
    trade names and trademarks acquired in various acquisitions.
    Based on lower than expected year-to-date revenue growth, we
    determined that our indefinite-lived trade name intangible asset
    related to Hotwire might be impaired during the third quarter of
    2006. Accordingly, we performed a valuation of that asset and
    determined that its carrying amount exceeded its fair value and
    recognized an impairment charge of $47.0 million in
    Impairment of intangible asset in our consolidated statements of
    income. We based our measurement of fair value of the trade name
    intangible asset using the relief-from-royalty method. This
    method assumes that a trade name has value to the extent that
    its owner is relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the
    benefits received therefrom.

    date.

In 2007, the additions to goodwill relate primarily to our
    acquisitions as described in Note 3 —
    Acquisitions and Other Investments as well as the basis
    adjustments resulting from the implementation of FIN 48. In
    2006, the additions to goodwill relate primarily to the
    remaining purchase of TripAdvisor shares and other miscellaneous
    business acquisitions. The deductions from goodwill for both
    2007 and 2006 primarily relate to the income tax benefit
    realized pursuant to the exercise of stock options assumed in
    business acquisitions that were vested at the transaction date
    and are treated as a reduction in purchase price when the
    deductions are realized.

Debt

Credit
    Facility

In July 2005, we entered into a $1.0 billion five-year
    unsecured revolving credit facility with a group of lenders,
    which is unconditionally guaranteed by certain Expedia
    subsidiaries and expires in August 2010. The $585.0 million
    carrying amount of the borrowing approximates its fair value as
    of December 31, 2007. The facility bears interest based on
    market interest rates plus a spread, which is determined based
    on our financial leverage. The interest rate was 5.70% as of
    December 31, 2007. The annual fee to maintain the facility
    is 0.1% on the unused portion of the facility, or approximately
    $1.0 million if all of the facility is unused. The facility
    also contains financial covenants consisting of a leverage ratio
    and a minimum net worth requirement.  As of February 15,
    2008, $85.0 million of the borrowings outstanding at
    December 31, 2007 under the credit facility had been repaid.

The amount of stand-by letters of credit (“LOC”)
    issued under the facility reduces the amount available to us. As
    of December 31, 2007, and December 31, 2006, there was
    $52.3 million of outstanding stand-by LOCs issued under the
    facility.

Long-term
    Debt

In August 2006, we privately placed $500.0 million of
    senior unsecured notes due 2018. In March 2007, we completed an
    offer to exchange these notes for registered notes having
    substantially the same financial terms and covenants as the
    original notes (the unregistered and registered notes
    collectively, the “Notes”).The Notes bear a fixed rate
    interest of 7.456% with interest payable semi-annually in
    February and August of each year. The amount of accrued interest
    related to the Notes was $14.0 million and
    $13.4 million as of December 31, 2007 and 2006. The
    Notes are repayable in whole or in part on August 15, 2013,
    at the option of the holders of such Notes, at 100% of the
    principal amount plus accrued interest. We may redeem the Notes
    in accordance with the terms of the agreement, in whole or in
    part at any time at our option.

The fair value of our Notes was approximately
    $517.0 million and $520.0 million as of
    December 31, 2007 and 2006 based on the quoted market price.

The Notes are senior unsecured obligations guaranteed by certain
    domestic Expedia subsidiaries and rank equally in right of
    payment with all of our existing and future unsecured and
    unsubordinated obligations. For further information, see
    Note 19 — Guarantor and Non-Guarantor
    Supplemental Financial Information.

The Notes include covenants that limit our ability to
    (i) incur liens, (ii) enter into sale and leaseback
    transactions and (iii) merge, consolidate or sell
    substantially all of our assets.

Ask
    Jeeves Notes

As a result of the Spin-Off, we assumed certain obligations to
    IAC related to IAC’s Ask Jeeves Notes. When holders of the
    Ask Jeeves Notes convert their notes, they will receive shares
    of both IAC and Expedia common stock. Under the terms of the
    Spin-Off, we are obligated to issue shares of our common stock
    to IAC for delivery to the holders of the Ask Jeeves Notes, or
    pay cash in equal value, in lieu of issuing such shares, at our
    option. This obligation represents a derivative liability on our
    consolidated balance sheet because it is not indexed solely to
    shares of our common stock. We record the fair value of this
    derivative obligation on our consolidated balance sheets with
    any changes in fair value recorded in our consolidated
    statements of income in Other, net. The estimated fair value of
    this liability fluctuates primarily based on changes in the
    price of our common stock.

In 2007, 2006 and 2005, certain of these notes were converted
    and we released approximately 0.3 million, 3.5 million
    and 37,000 shares of our common stock from escrow with a
    fair value of $6.6 million, $80.8 million and
    $0.9 million to satisfy the conversion requirements. In
    2007, 2006 and 2005, we recognized a net unrealized gain (loss)
    of $(5.3) million, $8.1 million and
    $(6.0) million related to these Ask Jeeves Notes. As of
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, the related derivative
    liability balance was $14.6 million included in accrued
    expenses and $15.9 million included in other long-term
    liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets.

As of December 31, 2007, we estimate that we could be
    required to release from escrow up to 0.5 million shares of
    our common stock (or pay cash in equal value, in lieu of issuing
    such shares, at our option). The Ask Jeeves Notes are due
    June 1, 2008; upon maturity of these notes, our obligation
    to satisfy demands for conversion ceases.

Cross-Currency
    Swaps

We entered into cross-currency swaps to hedge against the change
    in value of certain intercompany loans denominated in currencies
    other than the lending subsidiaries’ functional currency.

In November 2003, we entered into a swap with a notional amount
    of Euro 39.0 million that matures in October 2013.
    Under the terms of this swap, we pay Euro at a rate of the
    three-month EURIBOR plus 0.50% on Euro 39.0 million
    and we receive 4.90% interest on $46.4 million in
    U.S. dollars.

In April 2004, we entered into a swap with a notional amount of
    Euro 38.2 million that matures in April 2014. Under
    the terms of this swap, we pay Euro at a rate of the six-month
    EURIBOR plus 0.90% on Euro 38.2 million and we receive
    5.47% interest on $45.9 million in U.S. dollars.

Upon maturity, these cross-currency swap agreements call for the
    exchange of notional amounts. These swaps have been designated
    as cash flow hedges and are re-measured at fair value each
    reporting period. The fair values of our cross-currency swaps
    are determined based on the present value of net future cash
    payments and receipts, and fluctuate based on changes in market
    interest rates and the Euro/U.S. dollar exchange rate. The
    hedges have been determined to be perfectly effective, at
    designation and on an ongoing basis. As such, we record the
    total change in the fair value of the hedges in OCI each period,
    and concurrently reclassify a portion of the gain or loss to
    other income (expense), net to perfectly offset gains or losses
    related to transactional remeasurement of the hedged items. We
    are not able to predict future gains or losses due to
    remeasurement of the hedged items, or the equivalent
    reclassifications of the gains or losses on the hedges from
    accumulated OCI to earnings. There was no ineffectiveness
    related to these cash flow hedges for the years ended
    December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005. As of December 31,
    2007 and 2006, the related derivative liability balances were
    $20.7 million and $13.1 million and were included in
    other long-term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets.

Expedia,

Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

In addition, as of December 31, 2007, we had
    $21.1 million of cash held by counterparties as collateral
    for our cross-currency swaps, which is classified in long-term
    investments and other assets on our consolidated balance sheet.

Stock
    Warrants

In connection with prior transactions, IAC assumed a number of
    stock warrants that were adjusted to become exercisable into IAC
    common stock and subsequent to the Spin-Off, also in our common
    stock. As of December 31, 2007, there are approximately
    42,700 of these stock warrants outstanding with expiration dates
    through May 2010. Each stock warrant represents the right to
    receive the number of shares of IAC common stock and Expedia
    common stock that the stock warrant holder would have received
    had the holder exercised the stock warrant immediately prior to
    the Spin-Off. Under the terms of the Spin-Off between IAC and
    Expedia, we assumed the obligation to deliver our common stock
    to the stock warrant holders upon exercise and will receive a
    portion of the proceeds from exercise. This obligation
    represents a derivative instrument that we record at fair value
    on our consolidated balance sheets with any changes in value
    recorded in our consolidated statements of income in Other, net.
    The estimated fair value of this liability fluctuates based on
    changes in the price of our common stock.

NOTE 8 —

Employee
    Benefit Plans

Our U.S. employees are generally eligible to participate in
    a retirement and savings plan that qualifies under
    Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Participating
    employees may contribute up to 16% of their pretax salary, but
    not more than statutory limits. We contribute fifty cents for
    each dollar a participant contributes in this plan, with a
    maximum contribution of 3% of a participant’s earnings. Our
    contribution vests with the employee after the employee
    completes two years of service. Participating employees have the
    option to invest in our common stock, but there is no
    requirement for participating employees to invest their
    contribution or our matching contribution in our common stock.
    We also have various defined contribution plans for our
    international employees. Our contributions to these benefit
    plans were $9.2 million, $8.0 million and
    $6.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2007,
    2006 and 2005.

NOTE 9 —

Stock-Based
    Awards and Other Equity Instruments

Pursuant to the 2005 Expedia, Inc. Stock and Annual Incentive
    Plan, we may grant restricted stock, restricted stock awards
    (“RSA”), RSUs, stock options and other stock-based
    awards to directors, officers, employees and consultants. As of
    December 31, 2007, we had approximately 4.3 million
    shares of common stock reserved for new stock-based awards under
    the 2005 Stock and Annual Incentive Plan. We issue new shares to
    satisfy the exercise or release of stock-based awards.

As described below in “Modification of Stock-Based
    Compensation Awards,” certain stock options, restricted
    stock, RSUs and other equity based awards granted to our
    employees, officers, directors and consultants by IAC prior to
    the Spin-Off were converted into awards based on our common
    stock in connection with the Spin-Off. For the period from
    January 1, 2005 to August 8, 2005, IAC allocated to us
    stock-based compensation expense that was attributable to our
    employees.

RSUs, which are stock awards that are granted to employees
    entitling the holder to shares of our common stock as the award
    vests, are our primary form of stock-based award. We record RSUs
    that will settle in cash as a liability and we remeasure them to
    fair value at the end of each reporting period. These awards
    that settle in cash and the resulting liability are
    insignificant. Our RSUs generally vest over five years, but may
    accelerate in certain circumstances, including certain changes
    in control.

In 2007, 2006 and 2005, we recognized stock-based compensation
    expense of $62.8 million, $80.3 million and
    $91.7 million. In 2005, we recorded a cumulative benefit
    from the change in estimated forfeiture rates of approximately
    $43.4 million, which reduced the stock-based compensation
    expense. The total income tax

benefit related to stock-based compensation expense was
    $21.7 million, $27.0 million and $31.3 million
    for 2007, 2006 and 2005.

In 2005, due to the Spin-off from IAC and the then actual and
    expected turnover of our employees, we performed assessments of
    forfeiture rates used in the determination of our stock-based
    compensation expense (the “2005 assessments”). Prior
    to the 2005 assessments, which were specific to the Expedia
    spin-off group, forfeiture estimates had been determined at the
    IAC consolidated level. The 2005 assessments included analyses
    of the actual number of awards that were vested or forfeited
    through December 31, 2005 and an estimate of forfeitures to
    be incurred in the future, using historical rates, as well as
    reviews of the forfeiture characteristics by award type. As part
    of the assessments we stratified award forfeitures by
    semi-annual increments to determine the impact time remaining to
    vest had on forfeiture activity. These analyses resulted in
    forfeiture rate ranges from 4% to 34% depending on each
    respective award’s time remaining to vest, and award type,
    versus an estimated flat rate of 7% prior to the 2005
    assessments. The change in forfeiture rate estimate resulted in
    a cumulative benefit of approximately $43.4 million and
    corresponding reduction of stock-based compensation expense
    during 2005. We evaluate our forfeiture rates, on a periodical
    and at least semi-annual basis, and update the rates we use in
    the determination of our stock-based compensation expense.

Cash received from stock-based award exercises for the years
    ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 was $55.0 million and
    $35.3 million. Our employees that held vested stock options
    prior to the Spin-Off received vested stock options in both
    Expedia and IAC. As these stock options are exercised, we
    receive a tax deduction. Total current income tax benefits
    during the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006
    associated with the exercise of IAC and Expedia stock-based
    awards held by our employees were $120.8 million and
    $34.3 million, of which we recorded approximately
    $9.4 million and $16.9 million as a reduction of
    goodwill.

In October 2007, our Chairman and Senior Executive exercised
    options to purchase 9.5 million shares. 2.3 million
    shares were withheld and concurrently cancelled by the Company
    to cover the exercise price of $8.59 per share and
    3.5 million shares were withheld and concurrently cancelled
    to cover tax obligations, with a net delivery of
    3.7 million shares.

As of December 31, 2007, there was approximately
    $166.4 million of unrecognized stock-based compensation
    expense, net of estimated forfeitures, related to unvested
    stock-based awards, which is expected to be recognized in
    expense over a weighted-average period of 3.34 years.

Modification
    of Stock-Based Awards

In connection with the Spin-Off, all existing IAC stock-based
    awards, which included RSUs, stock options and warrants, were
    converted as follows:

•

each vested stock option to purchase shares of IAC common stock
    converted into an option to purchase shares of IAC common stock
    and an option to purchase shares of Expedia common stock;

•

each unvested stock option to purchase shares of IAC common
    stock converted into a stock option to purchase shares of common
    stock of the applicable company for which the employee worked
    following the Spin-Off;

•

all RSUs converted into RSUs of the applicable company for which
    the employee worked following the Spin-Off; and

•

each vested and unvested warrant converted into a warrant to
    purchase shares of IAC common stock and a warrant to purchase
    shares of Expedia common stock.

The adjustments to the number of shares subject to each option
    and the option exercise prices were based on the relative market
    capitalization of IAC and Expedia immediately following the
    Spin-Off. These modifications resulted in a one-time expense of
    $5.4 million due to the increase in the estimated fair
    value of

vested stock options. Expenses related to incremental value due
    to modification of warrants, RSUs and unvested stock options
    were not material.

For all periods presented, we have computed current and deferred
    tax expense using our stand-alone effective tax rate. As of
    December 31, 2007, our current income tax receivable
    represents amounts that we expect to be refundable from the
    Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities.

For the period January 1, 2005 through the Spin-Off date,
    we were a member of the IAC consolidated tax group. Accordingly,
    IAC filed a federal income tax return and certain state income
    tax returns on a combined basis with us for that period. IAC
    paid the entire combined income tax liability related to these
    filings. As such, our estimated income tax liability for this
    period was transferred to IAC upon Spin-Off. Under the terms of
    the Tax Sharing Agreement, IAC could make certain elections in
    preparation of these tax returns, which changed the amount of
    income taxes owed for the period before the Spin-Off. We
    recorded those changes as adjustments to stockholders’
    equity in accordance with EITF

No. 94-10,

Accounting by a Company for the Income Tax Effects of
    Transactions Among or With its Shareholders under FASB Statement
    109.

We reduced our current income tax payable by
    $120.8 million, $34.3 million and $50.6 million
    for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, for
    tax deductions attributable to stock-based compensation. For
    2007, 2006 and 2005, we recorded $9.4 million,
    $16.9 million and $25.3 million of the related income
    tax benefits of this stock-based compensation as a reduction of
    goodwill.

At December 31, 2007, we had state and foreign net
    operating loss carryforwards (“NOLs”) of approximately
    $41.6 million and $54.0 million. If not utilized, the
    state NOLs will expire at various times between 2008 and 2027,
    $52.8 million foreign NOLs can be carried forward
    indefinitely, and $1.2 million foreign NOLs will expire at
    various times between 2008 and 2012.

At December 31, 2007, we had a valuation allowance of
    approximately $27.9 million related to the portion of net
    operating loss carryforwards and other items for which it is
    more likely than not that the tax benefit will not be realized.
    This amount represented an increase of approximately
    $3.7 million over the amount recorded as of
    December 31, 2006 and was primarily attributable to an
    increase in foreign operating losses. The tax benefit for
    approximately $2.1 million of the valuation allowance
    recorded at December 31, 2007 will be recorded as a
    reduction of goodwill if recognized in future years.

By virtue of the previously filed separate company and
    consolidated income tax returns filed with IAC, we are routinely
    under audit by federal, state, local and foreign authorities.
    These audits include questioning the timing and the amount of
    deductions and the allocation of income among various tax
    jurisdictions. Annual tax provisions include amounts considered
    sufficient to pay assessments that may result from the
    examination of prior year returns. We are no longer subject to
    tax examinations by tax authorities for years prior to 1998.

In addition, we have a tax allocation agreement with Microsoft
    Corporation (“Microsoft”) as well as the Tax Sharing
    Agreement with IAC. For additional information about these
    agreements, see Note 15 — Related Party
    Transactions.

On January 1, 2007, we adopted FIN 48

Accounting
    for Uncertainty in Income Taxes — an interpretation of
    FASB Statement No. 109.

As a result of the adoption of
    FIN 48, we recognized an approximately $18.6 million
    increase in the liability for uncertain tax positions, of which
    $14.4 million of the increase was accounted for as an
    increase to the January 1, 2007 balance of goodwill as the
    underlying tax positions related to business combinations and
    $4.2 million as a reduction to the January 1, 2007
    balance of retained earnings. These amounts do not include the
    federal tax benefits associated with these positions, which are
    immaterial. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount
    of gross unrecognized tax benefits is as follows, in thousands:

As of January 1, 2007, we had $63.7 million of
    unrecognized tax benefits, of which $45.1 million existed
    prior to the adoption of FIN 48 and were classified as
    taxes payable in current liabilities, net of a $2.0 million
    federal benefit.

(2)

As of December 31, 2007, we had $173.6 million of
    unrecognized tax benefits, of which $172.1 million is
    classified as long-term and included in Other long-term
    liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet.

Included in the balance at December 31, 2007 were
    $17.0 million of liabilities for uncertain tax positions
    that, if recognized, would decrease our provision for income
    taxes. Also included in the balance at December 31, 2007 were
    $118.9 million, of which $94.6 million was added in 2007, of
    excess tax benefits that resulted from our Chairman and Senior
    Executive’s exercises of stock options during 2007 and
    2005. If the IRS were to make a final determination that IAC and
    not Expedia were entitled to such deductions, then under the
    terms of our Tax Sharing Agreement, IAC would pay to Expedia an
    amount equal to any such tax benefit at such

F-28

    Statements — (Continued)

time as it were actually realized by IAC. Therefore an
    unfavorable outcome related to this position would not
    materially impact our effective tax rate or our cash flows.

We recognize interest and penalties related to our liabilities
    for uncertain tax positions in income tax expense. As of
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, we had approximately
    $10.6 million and $5.0 million accrued for the
    potential payment of estimated interest. During the years ended
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, we recognized approximately
    $3.5 million and $2.2 million of interest, net of
    federal benefit, related to our liabilities for uncertain tax
    positions. No interest was recognized during 2005.

Stockholders’
    Equity

Common
    Stock and Class B Common Stock

Our authorized common stock consists of 1.6 billion shares
    of common stock with par value of $0.001 per share,
    and 400 million shares of Class B common stock with
    par value of $0.001 per share. Both classes of common stock
    qualify for and would share equally in dividends, if declared by
    our Board of Directors, and generally vote together on all
    matters. Common stock is entitled to one vote per share and
    Class B common stock is entitled to 10 votes per share.
    Holders of common stock, voting as a single, separate class are
    entitled to elect 25% of the total number of directors.
    Class B common stockholders may, at any time, convert their
    shares into common stock, on a one for one share basis. Upon
    conversion, the Class B common stock is retired and is not
    available for reissue. In the event of liquidation, dissolution,
    distribution of assets or

winding-up

of Expedia, Inc., the holders of both classes of common stock
    have equal rights to receive all the assets of Expedia, Inc.
    after the rights of the holders of the preferred stock have been
    satisfied.

Preferred
    Stock

Our preferred stock has a face value of $22.23 per share; each
    share is entitled to an annual dividend of 1.99%. Each preferred
    stockholder is entitled to two votes per share. Preferred
    stockholders may, at certain times through 2017, elect to have
    their shares redeemed or elect to convert their shares into
    common stock based upon formulas described in the related
    Certificate of Designations of Series A Cumulative
    Convertible Preferred Stock of Expedia, Inc. Beginning
    February 4, 2012, we may redeem the preferred stock for
    cash or common stock. On February 4, 2022, all outstanding
    shares of preferred stock automatically convert into common
    stock.

Share
    Repurchases

On August 15, 2007, we completed a tender offer pursuant to
    which we acquired 25 million tendered shares of our common
    stock at a purchase price of $29.00 per share, for a total cost
    of $725.0 million plus fees and expenses relating to the
    tender offer. We borrowed $500.0 million under our existing
    credit facility to fund a portion of the purchase price for the
    shares and used cash on-hand for the remainder of the purchase
    price and to pay related fees and expenses.

On January 19, 2007, we completed a tender offer pursuant
    to which we acquired 30 million tendered shares of our
    common stock at a purchase price of $22.00 per share, for a
    total cost of $660.0 million plus fees and expenses
    relating to the tender offer. We funded the purchase price for
    the shares using cash on-hand.

During 2006, we completed the repurchase of 20 million
    shares of our common stock for a total cost of
    $288.0 million, representing an average price of $14.42 per
    share including transaction costs. All shares were repurchased
    in the open market at prevailing market prices.

In addition, during 2006 our Board of Directors authorized share
    repurchases of up to 20 million outstanding shares of our
    common stock. As of February 15, 2008, we had not made any
    share repurchases under this authorization. There is no fixed
    termination date for the repurchase.

    following the Spin-Off.

Diluted
    Earnings Per Share

For the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, we
    computed diluted earnings per share using (i) the number of
    shares of common stock and Class B common stock used in the
    basic earnings per share calculation as indicated above
    (ii) if dilutive, the incremental common stock that we
    would issue upon the assumed exercise of stock options and stock
    warrants and the vesting of restricted stock units using the
    treasury stock method, and (iii) the shares we are
    contractually obligated to issue associated with the Ask Jeeves
    Notes, if converted, and other stock-based commitments.

collected from customers for airline ticket sales by one of our
    subsidiaries in the third quarter of 2001 through the third
    quarter of 2004, plus accrued interest thereon. We recorded
    $2.6 million to revenue as that amount relates to taxes
    remitted on airline ticket sales subsequent to our acquisition
    of the subsidiary. We recorded $12.1 million to other, net
    for taxes remitted on airline ticket sales prior to the
    acquisition and total interest earned on all underlying tax
    remittances.

Write-off
    of Long-term Investment

In 2005, we received information regarding the deteriorating
    financial condition of our long-term investment in a leisure
    travel company and we determined that it was not likely we would
    recover any of our investment because the decline in its value
    was determined to be

other-than-temporary.

As a result, we recorded a loss related to this impairment of
    $23.4 million in write-off of long-term investment in our
    consolidated statements of income. In 2006, we sold our
    investment for de minimis consideration.

Our purchase obligations represent the minimum obligations we
    have under agreements with certain of our vendors. These minimum
    obligations are less than our projected use for those periods.
    Payments may be more than the minimum obligations based on
    actual use. In addition, if certain obligations are met by our
    counterparties, our obligations will increase.

We have guarantees primarily related to a specific country
    aviation authority for the potential non-delivery, by us, of
    packaged travel sold in that country. The authority also
    requires that a portion of the total amount of packaged travel
    sold be bonded.

Our LOCs consist of stand-by LOCs, underwritten by a group of
    lenders, which we primarily issue to certain hotel properties to
    secure our payment for hotel room transactions. The contractual
    expiration dates of these LOCs are shown in the table above.
    There were no claims made against any stand-by LOCs during the
    years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005.

Lease
    Commitments

We have contractual obligations in the form of operating leases
    for office space and related office equipment for which we
    record the related expense on a monthly basis. Certain leases
    contain periodic rent escalation adjustments and renewal
    options. Rent expense related to such leases is recorded on a
    straight-line basis. Operating lease obligations expire at
    various dates with the latest maturity in 2018. In June 2007, we
    entered into a ten-year lease for approximately
    348,000 square feet of office space for our new
    headquarters located in Bellevue, Washington. We expect the term
    and cash payments related to this lease to begin in

Legal
    Proceedings

In the ordinary course of business, we are a party to various
    lawsuits. In the opinion of management, we do not expect these
    lawsuits to have a material impact on the liquidity, results of
    operations, or financial condition of Expedia. We also evaluate
    other potential contingent matters, including value-added tax,
    federal excise tax, transient occupancy or accommodation tax and
    similar matters. We do not believe that the aggregate amount of
    liability that could be reasonably possible with respect to
    these matters would have a material adverse effect on our
    financial results.

Securities Related Class Action
    Litigations.

While we are not a party to the
    securities litigation filed against IAC, under the terms of our
    Separation Agreement with IAC, we have generally agreed to bear
    a portion of the costs and liabilities, if any, associated with
    any securities law litigation relating to conduct prior to the
    Spin-Off of the businesses or entities that comprise Expedia
    following the Spin-Off. This case arises out of IAC’s
    August 4, 2004, announcement of its earnings for the second
    quarter of 2004.

Litigation relating to the IAC/Hotels.com merger agreement
    announced April 10, 2003, is pending in Delaware. The
    principal claim in these actions is that the defendants breached
    their fiduciary duty to the plaintiffs by entering into or
    approving the merger agreement.

Litigation Relating to Hotel Occupancy
    Taxes.

Lawsuits have been filed by thirty-nine
    cities and counties involving hotel occupancy taxes. In
    addition, there have been five consumer lawsuits filed relating
    to taxes and fees. The municipality and consumer lawsuits are in
    various stages ranging from responding to the complaint to
    discovery. We continue to defend these lawsuits vigorously. To
    date, thirteen of the municipality lawsuits have been dismissed.
    Most of these dismissals have been without prejudice and,
    generally, allow the municipality to seek administrative
    remedies prior to pursuing further litigation. Four dismissals
    (Pitt County, North Carolina, Findlay, Ohio, Columbus and
    Dayton, Ohio and City of Orange, Texas) were based on a finding
    that the defendants were not subject to the local hotel
    occupancy tax ordinance. As a result of this litigation and
    other attempts by certain jurisdictions to levy such taxes, we
    have established a reserve for the potential settlement of
    issues related to hotel occupancy taxes in the amount of
    $19.0 million and $17.5 million at December 31,
    2007 and 2006, respectively. Our reserve is based on our best
    estimate and the ultimate resolution of these issues may be
    greater or less than the liabilities recorded.

Related
    Party Transactions

Expenses
    Allocated from IAC

Prior to Spin-Off, our operating expenses include allocations
    from IAC for accounting, treasury, legal, tax, corporate
    support, human resource functions and internal audit. Expenses
    allocated from IAC were $5.0 million for the period from
    January 1, 2005 to August 8, 2005. We recorded the
    expense allocation from IAC in general and administrative
    expense in our consolidated statements of income.

Additional allocations from IAC prior to the Spin-Off related to
    stock-based compensation expense attributable to our employees.
    Stock-based compensation expense allocated from IAC was
    $56.5 million for the period from January 1, 2005 to
    August 8, 2005.

Interest
    Income from IAC

The interest income from IAC recorded in our consolidated
    statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2005
    arose from intercompany receivable balances from IAC. The
    interest income from IAC ceased upon Spin-Off on August 9,
    2005.

Relationship
    Between IAC and Expedia, Inc. after the Spin-Off

In connection with the Spin-Off, we entered into various
    agreements with IAC, a related party due to common ownership, to
    provide for an orderly transition and to govern our ongoing
    relationships with IAC. These agreements include the following:

•

a Separation Agreement that sets forth the arrangements between
    IAC and Expedia with respect to the principal corporate
    transactions necessary to complete the Spin-Off, and a number of
    other principles governing the relationship between IAC and
    Expedia following the Spin-Off;

•

a Tax Sharing Agreement that governs the respective rights,
    responsibilities and obligations of IAC and Expedia after the
    Spin-Off with respect to tax liabilities and benefits, tax
    attributes, tax contests and other matters regarding income
    taxes, other taxes and related tax returns;

•

an Employee Matters Agreement that governs a wide range of
    compensation and benefit issues, including the allocation
    between IAC and Expedia of responsibility for the employment and
    benefit obligations and liabilities of each company’s
    current and former employees (and their dependents and
    beneficiaries); and

•

a Transition Services Agreement that governs the provision of
    transition services from IAC to Expedia.

In addition, in conjunction with the Spin-Off, we entered into a
    joint ownership and cost sharing agreement with IAC, under which
    IAC transferred to us 50% ownership in an airplane, which is
    available for use by both companies. We share equally in capital
    costs; operating costs are pro-rated based on actual usage. In
    May 2006, the airplane was placed in service and is being
    depreciated over 10 years. As of December 31, 2007 and
    2006, the net basis in our ownership interest was
    $18.9 million and $19.7 million recorded in long-term
    investments and other assets on our consolidated balance sheets.
    In 2007 and 2006, operating and maintenance costs paid directly
    to IAC for the airplane were $0.4 million and
    $0.6 million. We had $0.3 million in related accounts
    payable as of December 31, 2006. There was no such payable
    as of December 31, 2007.

Commercial
    Agreements with IAC

Since the Spin-Off, we have continued to work with some of
    IAC’s businesses pursuant to a variety of commercial
    relationships. These commercial agreements generally include
    (i) distribution agreements, pursuant to which certain
    subsidiaries of IAC distribute their respective products and
    services via arrangements with

F-34


Expedia,
    Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

Expedia, and vice versa, (ii) services agreements, pursuant
    to which certain subsidiaries of IAC provide Expedia with
    various services and vice versa and (iii) office space
    lease agreements. The distribution agreements typically involve
    the payment of fees, usually on a fixed

amount-per-transaction,

revenue share or commission basis, from the party seeking
    distribution of the product or service to the party that is
    providing the distribution.

In 2007, we received $0.1 million from IAC businesses, and
    paid $8.2 million to IAC businesses. In 2006, we received
    $1.9 million from IAC businesses, and paid
    $31.3 million to IAC businesses. From August 9, 2005
    to December 31, 2005, we received $0.8 million from
    IAC businesses and paid $10.7 million to IAC businesses.
    Amounts payable to IAC businesses, which are included in
    accounts payable, other, totaled $1.0 million and
    $1.1 million as of December 31, 2007 and 2006.

Other
    Transactions with IAC

In the fourth quarter of 2006, eLong sold one of its businesses
    to a subsidiary of IAC for $14.6 million.

Agreements
    with Microsoft Corporation

We have various agreements with Microsoft, which was the
    beneficial owner of more than 5% of our outstanding common stock
    prior to 2007. One of these agreements maintains our presence as
    the provider of travel shopping services on MSN.com and several
    international MSN websites. Total fees we paid with respect to
    these agreements were $26.5 million and $20.0 million
    for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005.

Prior to November 1999, Microsoft owned 100% of our outstanding
    common stock. Concurrent with our separation from them, we
    entered into a tax allocation agreement whereby we were required
    to pay Microsoft for a portion of the tax savings resulting from
    the exercise of certain stock options when realized on our tax
    return. As of December 31, 2006 our obligation related to
    this agreement was $30.3 million, classified as
    “accrued expenses” on our consolidated balance sheets.
    During 2007 and 2006 we realized $30.3 million and
    $6.0 million of tax savings on our tax returns, and
    remitted an equivalent amount to Microsoft during these periods.
    We have no remaining obligation to Microsoft under this
    agreement as of December 31, 2007.

NOTE 16 —

Segment
    Information

In the first quarter of 2006, we began reporting two segments:
    North America and Europe. The change from a single reportable
    segment is a result of the reorganization of our business. We
    determined our segments based on how our chief operating
    decision makers manage our business, make operating decisions
    and evaluate operating performance. Our primary operating metric
    for evaluating segment performance is “Operating Income
    Before Amortization” (defined below), which includes
    allocations of certain expenses, primarily cost of revenue and
    facilities, to the segments. We base the allocations primarily
    on transaction volumes and other usage metrics; this methodology
    is periodically evaluated and may change. We do not allocate
    certain shared expenses to reportable segments such as partner
    services, product development, accounting, human resources and
    legal. We include these expenses in Corporate and Other.

Our North America segment provides a full range of travel

and/or

advertising services to customers primarily located in the
    United States, Canada and Mexico. This segment operates through
    a variety of brands including Classic Vacations, Expedia.com,
    Hotels.com, Hotwire.com and TripAdvisor. Our Europe segment
    provides travel services primarily through localized Expedia
    websites in Austria, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy,
    the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom,
    as well as localized versions of Hotels.com in various European
    countries.

Corporate and Other includes ECT, Expedia Asia Pacific and
    unallocated corporate functions and expenses. ECT provides
    travel products and services to corporate customers in North
    America and Europe. Expedia Asia Pacific provides online travel
    information and reservation services primarily through eLong in

F-35


Expedia,
    Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

China, localized Expedia websites in Australia, Japan and New
    Zealand, as well as localized versions of Hotels.com in various
    Asian countries. In addition, we record amortization of
    intangible assets and any related impairment, as well as
    stock-based compensation expense in Corporate and Other.

The following table presents our segment information for the
    years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006. We have not
    reported segment information for the year ended
    December 31, 2005, as it is not practicable to do so. In
    addition, as a significant portion of our property and equipment
    is not allocated to our operating segments, we do not report the
    assets or related depreciation expense as it would not be
    meaningful, nor do we regularly provide such information to our
    chief operating decision makers.

We have revised certain 2006 revenue and expense allocations
    between our segments to reflect current allocations for certain
    points of sale. There was no impact on total consolidated
    revenue or operating income before amortization as a result of
    these changes.

Definition
    of Operating Income Before Amortization
    (“OIBA”)

We provide OIBA as a supplemental measure to GAAP. We define
    OIBA as operating income plus: (1) amortization of non-cash
    distribution and marketing expense, (2) stock-based
    compensation expense, (3) amortization of intangible assets
    and goodwill and intangible asset impairment, if applicable and
    (4) certain one-time items, if applicable.

OIBA is the primary operating metric used by which management
    evaluates the performance of our business, on which internal
    budgets are based, and by which management is compensated.
    Management

F-36


Expedia,
    Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

believes that investors should have access to the same set of
    tools that management uses to analyze our results. This non-GAAP
    measure should be considered in addition to results prepared in
    accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute
    for, or superior to, GAAP. We endeavor to compensate for the
    limitation of the non-GAAP measure presented by also providing
    the comparable GAAP measures, GAAP financial statements, and
    descriptions of the reconciling items and adjustments, to derive
    the non-GAAP measure. We present a reconciliation of this
    non-GAAP financial measure to GAAP below.

OIBA represents the combined operating results of Expedia,
    Inc.’s businesses, taking into account depreciation, which
    we believe is an ongoing cost of doing business, but excluding
    the effects of other non-cash expenses that may not be
    indicative of our core business operations. We believe this
    measure is useful to investors for the following reasons:

•

It corresponds more closely to the cash operating income
    generated from our core operations by excluding significant
    non-cash operating expenses; and

•

It provides greater insight into management decision making at
    Expedia, as OIBA is our primary internal metric for evaluating
    the performance of our business.

OIBA has certain limitations in that it does not take into
    account the impact of certain expenses to our consolidated
    statements of income, including stock-based compensation,
    non-cash payments to partners, acquisition-related accounting
    and certain one-time items, if applicable. Due to the high
    variability and difficulty in predicting certain items that
    affect net income, such as tax rates, stock price and interest
    rates, we are unable to provide a reconciliation to net income
    on a forward-looking basis without unreasonable efforts.

Reconciliation
    of OIBA to Operating Income and Net Income

    operating income and net income for the years ended
