Forward-Looking
    Statements

This Annual Report on

Form 10-K

contains “forward-looking statements” within the
    meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
    These forward-looking statements reflect the views of our
    management regarding current expectations and projections about
    future events and are based on currently available information.
    Actual results could differ materially from those contained in
    these forward-looking statements for a variety of reasons,
    including, but not limited to, those discussed in the section
    entitled “Risk Factors” as well as those discussed
    elsewhere in this report. Other unknown or unpredictable factors
    also could have a material adverse effect on our business,
    financial condition and results of operations. Accordingly,
    readers should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking
    statements. The use of words such as “anticipates,”
    “estimates,” “expects,” “intends,”
    “plans” and “believes,” among others,
    generally identify forward-looking statements; however, these
    words are not the exclusive means of identifying such
    statements. In addition, any statements that refer to
    expectations, projections or other characterizations of future
    events or circumstances are forward-looking statements. These
    forward-looking statements are inherently subject to
    uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are
    difficult to predict. We are not under any obligation and do not
    intend to publicly update or review any of these forward-looking
    statements, whether as a result of new information, future
    events or otherwise, even if experience or future events make it
    clear that any expected results expressed or implied by those
    forward-looking statements will not be realized. Please
    carefully review and consider the various disclosures made in
    this report and in our other reports filed with the Securities
    and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) that attempt to advise
    interested parties of the risks and factors that may affect our
    business, prospects and results of operations.

Management
    Overview

General
    Description of our Business

Expedia, Inc. is an online travel company, empowering business
    and leisure travelers with the tools and information they need
    to efficiently research, plan, book and experience travel. We
    have created a global travel marketplace used by a broad range
    of leisure and corporate travelers, offline retail travel agents
    and travel service providers. We make available, on a
    stand-alone and package basis, travel products and services
    provided by numerous airlines, lodging properties, car rental
    companies, destination service providers, cruise lines and other
    travel product and service companies. We also offer travel and
    non-travel advertisers access to a potential source of
    incremental traffic and transactions through our various media
    and advertising offerings on both the
    TripAdvisor

®

Media Network and on our transaction-based websites.

Our portfolio of brands, which is described below, includes:
    Expedia.com

    have related international points of sale. We refer to Expedia,
    Inc. and its subsidiaries collectively as “Expedia,”
    the “Company,” “us,” “we” and
    “our” in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Summary
    of the Spin-Off from IAC/InterActiveCorp

On December 21, 2004, IAC/InterActiveCorp (“IAC”)
    announced its plan to separate into two independent public
    companies. We refer to this transaction as the
    “Spin-Off.” A new company, Expedia, Inc., was
    incorporated under Delaware law in April 2005, to hold
    substantially all of IAC’s travel and travel-related
    businesses. On August 9, 2005, the Spin-Off was completed
    and Expedia, Inc. shares began trading on The Nasdaq Global
    Select Market (“NASDAQ”) under the symbol
    “EXPE.”



Equity
    Ownership and Voting Control

As of December 31, 2008, there were approximately
    261,374,295 shares of Expedia common stock,
    25,599,998 shares of Expedia Class B common stock and
    751 shares of Expedia preferred stock outstanding. Also as
    of December 31, 2008, Liberty Media Corporation
    (“Liberty”), through a wholly-owned subsidiary,
    beneficially owned approximately 27% of Expedia’s
    outstanding common stock and 100% of Expedia’s outstanding
    Class B common stock. As of such date, Barry Diller,
    Chairman and Senior Executive of Expedia (through his own
    holdings and holdings of Liberty, over which Mr. Diller
    generally has voting control pursuant to an irrevocable proxy
    granted by Liberty under the Stockholders Agreement described
    below) controlled approximately 60% of the outstanding total
    voting power of Expedia.

Pursuant to the Stockholders Agreement, dated as of
    August 9, 2005, as amended, between Liberty and
    Mr. Diller, Mr. Diller is effectively able to control
    the outcome of nearly all matters submitted to a vote or for the
    consent of Expedia’s stockholders (other than with respect
    to the election by the Expedia common stockholders of 25% of the
    members of Expedia’s Board of Directors and certain matters
    as to which a separate class vote of the holders of Expedia
    common stock or Expedia preferred stock is required under
    Delaware law). In addition, pursuant to the Governance
    Agreement, dated as of August 9, 2005, among Expedia,
    Liberty and Mr. Diller, each of Mr. Diller and Liberty
    generally has the right to consent to certain significant
    corporate actions in the event that Expedia or any of its
    subsidiaries incurs any new obligations for borrowed money
    within the definition of “total debt” set forth in the
    Governance Agreement for as long as Expedia’s ratio of
    total debt to EBITDA, as defined therein, equals or exceeds
    eight to one.

Portfolio
    of Brands

Expedia leverages its brand portfolio to target the broadest
    possible range of travelers, travel suppliers and advertisers.
    Our brands provide a wide selection of travel products and
    services, from simple, discounted travel to more complex, luxury
    travel. Our travel offerings primarily consist of airline
    flights, hotel stays, car rentals, destination services, cruises
    and package travel, which encompasses multiple travel products.
    We also offer travel and non-travel advertisers access to a
    potential source of incremental traffic and transactions through
    our various media and advertising offerings on both the
    TripAdvisor Media Network and on our transaction-based websites.

Expedia.com.

Our Expedia-branded websites make
    a large variety of travel products and services available
    directly to travelers through our

U.S.-based

website, www.expedia.com, as well as through localized versions
    of the Expedia website in Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada,
    Denmark, France, Germany, India, Ireland, Italy, Japan, the
    Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Spain, Sweden and the United
    Kingdom. Expedia-branded websites target many different types of
    travelers, from families booking a summer vacation to individual
    travelers arranging a quick weekend getaway. Travelers can
    search for, compare information about (including pricing,
    availability and traveler reviews) and book travel products and
    services on Expedia-branded websites, including airline tickets,
    lodging, car rentals, cruises and many destination
    services — such as airport transfers, local
    attractions and tours — from a large number of
    suppliers, on both a stand-alone and package basis.

Hotels.com.

Our hotels.com website provides a
    broad selection of hotel properties to travelers, who can plan,
    shop for and book lodging accommodations, from traditional
    hotels to vacation rentals. Hotels.com seeks to provide
    travelers with premium content and service through our

U.S.-based

website, www.hotels.com, as well as through localized versions
    in the Americas, Europe, Asia Pacific and South Africa. With
    hotels.com, we differentiate our offering by positioning the
    brand as the hotel expert, with premium content about lodging
    properties.

Hotwire.com.

Our discount travel website,
    Hotwire.com, makes available airline tickets, hotel rooms,
    rental cars, cruises and vacation packages. Hotwire.com’s
    approach matches flexible, price-sensitive travelers with
    suppliers who have excess seats, rooms and cars they wish to
    fill without affecting the public’s perception of their
    brands. Hotwire.com travelers may enjoy significant discounts by
    electing to book travel services “opaquely,” without
    knowing certain itinerary details such as brand, time of
    departure and exact hotel location, while suppliers create value
    from excess availability without diluting their core brand-loyal
    traveler base.



Recent product innovation allows air travelers to discover
    available discounts by altering details of their air travel
    plans such as date of departure or destination airport.
    Hotwire.com works with many domestic and international airlines,
    including U.S. full-service major network airlines, top
    hotels in hundreds of cities and resort destinations in the
    United States, Europe, Canada, Mexico and the Caribbean and
    major car rental companies in the United States.

Venere.

Our Venere branded websites make over
    30,000 hotel properties available to European consumers, through
    the website www.venere.com, and provide hoteliers with
    geographically diverse sources of demand. Venere has direct
    agency-based relationships with hotels around the world. In
    addition, we have begun making Venere hotel supply available
    through certain of our hotels.com-branded websites and have
    plans to expand to other hotels.com sites, as well as our
    Expedia-branded sites.

The TripAdvisor Media Network.

TripAdvisor,
    our comprehensive online travel search engine and directory,
    aggregates traveler opinions and unbiased articles about cities,
    hotels, restaurants and activities in a variety of destinations
    through www.tripadvisor.com and localized versions of the site
    in France, Germany, India, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Spain and the
    United Kingdom. In addition to travel-related information,
    TripAdvisor’s destination-specific search results provide
    links to the websites of TripAdvisor’s travel partners
    (travel providers and marketers) through which travelers can
    make related travel arrangements. TripAdvisor has also acquired
    and now operates a number of travel media content properties
    within the TripAdvisor Media Network, including
    airfarewatchdog.com

Worldwide Travel Exchange and Interactive Affiliate
    Network.

Our private label and co-brand programs
    make travel products and services available to travelers through
    third-party company-branded websites. The products and services
    made available through www.wwte.com and www.ian.com are
    substantially similar to those made available on Expedia-branded
    and hotels.com-branded websites, respectively. We generally
    compensate participants in the
    WWTE

®

and
    IAN

tm

private label programs on a revenue-share basis. We also
    leverage our WWTE and IAN platforms to make Expedia and
    hotels.com-branded sites available in various international
    points of sale.

Classic Vacations.

Classic Vacations offers
    individually tailored vacations primarily through a national
    network of third-party retail travel agents. We deliver a full
    line of premium vacation packages — air, hotels, car
    rentals, activities and private transportation — to
    create customized luxury vacations in Hawaii, the Caribbean,
    Mexico, Costa Rica, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and
    Tahiti. Travel agents and travelers can preview our product
    offering through our websites, www.classicforagents.com and
    www.classicvacations.com.

Expedia Local Expert.

Our network of travel
    desks located at hotels and resorts in Hawaii, Las Vegas,
    Mexico, Orlando and San Francisco enables travelers to
    enjoy local tours, attractions and dining, as well as purchase
    airport transfers and other travel-related services. Our network
    expanded through our acquisition of Activity World and Activity
    Hut, destination service providers in Hawaii in 2004 and 2006,
    respectively, and our 2005 acquisition of Premier Getaways in
    Florida.

Egencia.

Our full-service travel management
    company offers travel products and services available to
    corporations and corporate travelers in Australia, Canada,
    China, Europe, India and the United States. Egencia provides,
    among other things, centralized booking tools for employees of
    our corporations, unique supply targeted at business travelers,
    and consolidated reporting for global, large and “SME”
    (Small & Medium size Enterprise) business segments.
    Egencia charges its corporate clients account management fees,
    as well as transactional fees for making or changing bookings.
    In addition, Egencia provides

on-site

agents to some corporate clients to more fully support the
    account. Egencia has also begun offering consulting and meeting
    management services.

eLong.

Our majority-owned online travel
    service company, based in Beijing, China, specializes in travel
    products and services in China. eLong uses web-based
    distribution technologies and a

24-hour

nationwide call



center to provide consumers with consolidated travel information
    and the ability to make hotel reservations at more than 7,000
    hotels in over 400 cities across China. eLong also offers
    air ticketing and other travel related services. Travelers can
    access eLong travel products and services through its websites,
    including www.elong.com and www.elong.net.

Business
    Strategy

We play a fundamental role in facilitating travel, whether for
    leisure, unmanaged business or managed business travelers. We
    are committed to providing travelers, travel suppliers and
    advertisers the world over with the best set of resources to
    serve their travel needs by leveraging Expedia’s critical
    assets — our brand portfolio, our technology and
    commitment to continuous innovation, our global reach and our
    breadth of product offering. In addition, we intelligently
    utilize our growing base of knowledge about destinations,
    activities, suppliers and travelers and our central position in
    the travel value chain to more effectively merchandise our
    travel offerings.

A discussion of the critical assets that we leverage in
    achieving our business strategy follows:

Portfolio of Travel Brands.

We seek to appeal
    to the broadest possible range of travelers, suppliers and
    advertisers through our collection of industry-leading brands.
    We target several different demographics, from the
    value-conscious traveler through our
    Hotwire

®

brand to luxury travelers seeking a high-touch, customized
    vacation package through our Classic Vacations brand.

We believe our flagship Expedia brand appeals to the broadest
    range of travelers, with our extensive product offering ranging
    from single item bookings of discounted product to dynamic
    bundling of higher-end travel packages. Our hotels.com site and
    its international versions target travelers with premium hotel
    content about lodging properties, such as 360 degree tours and
    hotel reviews. In the United States, hotels.com generally
    appeals to travelers with shorter booking windows who prefer to
    drive to their destinations, and who make a significant portion
    of their travel bookings over the telephone.

Through Egencia, we make travel products and services available
    on a managed basis to corporate travelers in North America,
    Europe and the Asia Pacific region. Further, the TripAdvisor
    Media Network allows us to reach a broad range of travelers with
    travel opinions and user-generated content.

We believe our appeal to suppliers and advertisers is further
    enhanced by our geographic breadth and range of business models,
    allowing them to offer their products and services to the
    industry’s broadest range of travelers using our various
    agency, merchant and advertising business models. We intend to
    continue supporting and investing in our brand portfolio,
    geographic footprint and business models for the benefit of our
    travelers, suppliers and advertisers.

Technology and Continuous Innovation.

Expedia
    has an established tradition of technology innovation, from
    Expedia.com’s inception as a division of Microsoft, to our
    introduction of more recent innovations such as
    Expedia.com’s
    TravelAds

tm

sponsored search product for hotel advertisers, Hotwire’s
    Air Price Protection, hotels.com’s slider tools for
    improving search results, hotels.com’s iPod and iPhone
    applications and the TripAdvisor Media Network’s offering
    of travel applications for download on social media sites,
    including Facebook.com and MySpace.com.

We intend to continue innovating on behalf of our travelers,
    suppliers and advertisers with particular focus on improving the
    traveler experience, supplier integration and presentation,
    platform improvements, search engine marketing and search engine
    optimization.

Global Reach.

Our Expedia, hotels.com and
    TripAdvisor Media Network brands operate both in North America
    and internationally. We also offer Chinese travelers an array of
    products and services through our majority ownership in eLong,
    and we offer hotels to European-based travelers through our
    wholly-owned subsidiary Venere, which we acquired in the third
    quarter of 2008. In 2008, our European segment accounted for
    approximately 21% of worldwide gross bookings and 23% of
    worldwide revenue.

We intend to continue investing in and growing our international
    points of sale. We anticipate launching points of sale in
    additional countries where we find large travel markets and
    rapid growth of online commerce.



Future launches may occur under any of our brands, or through
    acquisition of third-party brands, as in the case of eLong and
    Venere.

Egencia, our corporate travel business, currently operates in
    Australia, Belgium, Canada, China, France, Germany, India,
    Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, Switzerland, the United
    Kingdom and the United States. We believe the corporate travel
    sector represents a large opportunity for Expedia, and we
    believe we offer a compelling technology solution to businesses
    seeking to optimize travel costs and improve their
    employees’ travel experiences. We intend to continue
    investing in and expanding the geographic footprint and
    technology infrastructure of Egencia.

In expanding our global reach, we leverage significant
    investments in technology, operations, brand building, supplier
    relationships and other initiatives that we have made since the
    launch of Expedia.com in 1996. We intend to continue leveraging
    this investment when launching additional points of sale in new
    countries, introducing new website features, adding supplier
    products and services, and offering proprietary and
    user-generated content for travelers.

Our scale of operations enhances the value of technology
    innovations we introduce on behalf of our travelers and
    suppliers. As an example, our traveler review
    feature — whereby travelers have created millions of
    qualified reviews of hotel properties — is able to
    accumulate a larger base of reviews due to the higher base of
    online traffic that frequents our various websites. In addition,
    our increasing scale enhances our websites’ appeal to
    travel and non-travel advertisers.

Breadth of Product Offering.

We offer a
    comprehensive array of innovative travel products and services
    to our travelers. We plan to continue improving and growing
    these offerings, as well as expand them to our worldwide points
    of sale over time. Travelers can interact with us how and when
    they prefer, including via our 24/7 1-800 telesales service,
    which is an integral part of the Company’s appeal to
    travelers.

Over 60% of our revenue comes from transactions involving the
    booking of hotel reservations, with less than 15% of our
    worldwide revenue derived from the sale of airline tickets. We
    facilitate travel products and services either as stand-alone
    products or as part of package transactions. We have emphasized
    growing our merchant hotel and package businesses as these
    result in higher revenue per transaction; however, through
    Venere we are working to grow our agency hotel business,
    particularly in Europe. We also seek to continue diversifying
    our revenue mix beyond core air and hotel products to car
    rental, destination services, cruise and other product
    offerings. We have been working toward and will continue to work
    toward increasing the mix of advertising and media revenue from
    both the expansion of our TripAdvisor Media Network, as well as
    increased advertising revenue from our worldwide websites, such
    as Expedia.com and hotels.com, which have historically been
    focused on transaction revenue. In 2008, advertising and media
    revenue accounted for nearly 10% of worldwide revenue.

Merchant
    and Agency Business Models

We make travel products and services available both on a
    stand-alone and package basis, primarily through two business
    models: the merchant model and the agency model. Under the
    merchant model, we facilitate the booking of hotel rooms,
    airline seats, car rentals and destination services from our
    travel suppliers and for such bookings, we are the merchant of
    record. Under the agency model, we act as an agent in the
    transaction, passing reservations booked by our travelers to the
    relevant airline, hotel, car rental company or cruise line.

As merchant of record, we generally have certain latitude to
    establish prices charged to travelers (as compared to agency
    transactions). Also, we generally negotiate supply allocation
    and pricing with our suppliers, which enables us to achieve a
    higher level of net revenue per transaction as compared to that
    provided through the agency model.

Through our Expedia-branded websites, travelers can dynamically
    assemble multiple component travel packages in a single
    transaction at a lower price as compared to booking each
    component separately. Packages assembled by travelers through
    the packaging model on these websites include a merchant hotel
    component and an air or car component. Travelers select packages
    based on the total package price, without being



provided component pricing. The use of the merchant travel
    components in packages enables us to make certain travel
    products available at prices lower than those charged on an
    individual component basis by travel suppliers without impacting
    their established pricing and position models. We are also
    expanding our use of third-party provided pre-assembled package
    offerings, particularly through our international points of
    sale, further broadening our scope of products and services to
    travelers.

Our agency business is comprised of the sale of airline tickets,
    hotel, cruise and car rental reservations. Airline ticket
    transactions currently make up the majority of this business. In
    the third quarter of 2008, we acquired Venere, an agency-based
    online hotel business in Europe. Although net revenue per
    transaction is lower compared to the merchant model, due to the
    high volume of airline tickets sold our agency gross bookings
    accounted for 57% of total gross bookings for the year ended
    December 31, 2008.

Relationships
    with Travel Suppliers, Distribution and Fulfillment
    Partners

Overview.

We make travel products and services
    available from a variety of large and small commercial and
    charter airlines, lodging properties, car rental companies,
    cruise lines and destination service providers. We seek to build
    and maintain long-term, strategic relationships with travel
    suppliers and global distribution system (“GDS”)
    partners. An important component of the success of our business
    depends on our ability to maintain our existing, as well as
    build new, relationships with travel suppliers and GDS partners.

Travel Suppliers.

We strive to deliver value
    to our travel suppliers through a wide range of innovative,
    targeted merchandising and promotional strategies designed to
    increase their revenue, while simultaneously reducing their
    marketing transaction and customer service costs. Our Partner
    Services Group consists mainly of strategic account managers and
    local market managers who work directly with travel suppliers to
    increase the marketing of their travel products and brands
    through our points of sale, including participation in our
    seasonal and event-driven promotions.

In addition, we have developed proprietary, supplier-oriented
    technology that streamlines the interaction between some of our
    websites and hotel central reservation systems, making it easier
    and more cost-effective for hotels to manage reservations made
    through our brands. Through this “direct connect”
    technology, hotels can upload information about available
    products and services and rates directly from their central
    reservation systems into our websites, as well as automatically
    confirm hotel reservations made by our travelers. In the absence
    of direct connect technology, both of these processes are
    generally completed manually via a proprietary extranet. Our
    travelers can now book reservations with over 50,000 merchant
    hotel properties worldwide, of which approximately 46% are now
    fully direct-connected.

Distribution Partners.

GDSs, also referred to
    as computer reservation services, provide a centralized,
    comprehensive repository of travel suppliers
    “content” — such as availability and pricing
    of seats on various airline

point-to-point

flights, or “segments.” The GDSs act as intermediaries
    between the travel suppliers and travel agencies, allowing
    agents to reserve and book flights, rooms or other travel
    products.

We use Sabre and Amadeus as our primary GDS segment providers.
    Prior to 2007, we primarily used Worldspan. We added the
    additional GDSs in order to ensure the widest possible supply of
    air content for our travelers.

Fulfillment Partners.

We outsource a portion
    of our airline ticket fulfillment functions to third-party
    suppliers. Such functions include the issuance of airline
    tickets and related customer services.

Marketing
    and Promotions

Our marketing programs are intended to build and maintain the
    value of our various brands, drive traffic and conversion
    through our various brands and businesses, optimize ongoing
    traveler acquisition costs and strategically position our brands
    in relation to one another. Our long-term success and
    profitability depends on our continued ability to maintain and
    increase the overall number of traveler transactions in a
    cost-effective manner.



Our marketing channels primarily include online advertising
    including search engine marketing and optimization, offline
    advertising, direct

and/or

personalized traveler communications on our websites as well as
    through direct

e-mail

communication with our travelers. Our marketing programs and
    initiatives include promotional offers such as coupons as well
    as seasonal or periodic special offers from our travel suppliers
    based on our supplier relationships. In addition, we offer
    several traveler loyalty programs to our worldwide travelers,
    including the ThankYou Rewards on Expedia.com, welcomerewards on
    hotels.com and Nectar in the United Kingdom.

We also make use of affiliate marketing. The Expedia.com and
    hotels.com-branded websites receive bookings from consumers who
    have clicked-through to the respective websites through links
    posted on affiliate partner websites. We have agreements with
    thousands of third-party affiliate partners, including a number
    of leading travel companies, pursuant to which we pay a
    commission for bookings originated from their websites.
    Affiliate partners can make travel products and services
    available through an Expedia-branded website, a co-branded
    website or their own private label website. We also provide our
    affiliates with technology and access to a wide range of
    products and services.

Operations
    and Technology

We provide

24-hour-a-day,

seven-day-a-week

traveler support by telephone or via

e-mail.

For
    purposes of operational flexibility, we provide this support
    infrastructure with a combination of outsourced and in-house
    call centers, which are located in various locations throughout
    the world, including extensive outsourced operations in the
    Philippines and El Salvador. We have made significant
    investments in our call center technologies in 2008 and have
    plans to continue these investments in 2009 and beyond.

Our systems infrastructure and web and database servers are
    housed in various locations, mainly in the United States, which
    have communication links as well as

24-hour

monitoring and engineering support. The web hosting facilities
    have their own generators and multiple

back-up

systems. Significant amounts of our owned computer hardware for
    operating the websites are located at these facilities. For some
    critical systems, we have both production and disaster-recovery
    facilities.

We have developed innovative technology to power our global
    travel marketplace. For example, our Best Fare Search technology
    essentially deconstructs segment feeds in the United States from
    GDS partners for air flight searches and recommends the best way
    to re-assemble multi-leg itineraries so that they are less
    expensive and more flexible for the traveler. We are looking to
    expand this technology internationally. We are also investing in
    improving our fare discovery technologies and user interfaces to
    provide more comprehensive and easier discovery of competitive
    rates for our travelers.

We continue to invest in our operations and technology
    infrastructure, and we anticipate additional traveler-facing
    benefits in 2009.

Competition

Our brands compete in rapidly evolving and intensely competitive
    markets. We believe the relatively low percentage of total
    travel sales transacted online, particularly in international
    markets, indicates that these markets represent especially large
    opportunities for Expedia and those of its competitors that wish
    to expand their brands and businesses abroad.

Our competition, which is strong and increasing, includes online
    and offline travel companies that target leisure and corporate
    travelers including travel agencies, tour operators, travel
    supplier direct websites and their call centers, consolidators
    and wholesalers of travel products and services and other
    companies offering travel search engines including meta-search
    engines. We face these competitors in local, regional, national

and/or

international markets. In some cases competitors are offering
    favorable terms and improved interfaces to suppliers and
    travelers which make competition increasingly difficult.

We believe that maintaining and enhancing our brands is a
    critical component of our effort to compete. We differentiate
    our brands from our competitors primarily based on quality and
    breadth of travel products, channel features and usability,
    price or promotional offers, traveler service and quality of
    travel planning



content and advice. The emphasis on one or more of these factors
    varies, depending on the brand or business and the related
    target demographic.

Our brands face increasing competition from travel supplier
    direct websites. In some cases, supplier direct channels offer
    advantages to travelers, such as long standing loyalty programs,
    lower or no transaction fees and better pricing. Our websites
    feature travel products and services from numerous travel
    suppliers (as opposed to a single supplier), and allow travelers
    to combine products and services from multiple providers in one
    transaction. We face competition from airlines, hotels, rental
    car companies, cruise operators and other travel service
    providers, whether working individually or collectively, some of
    which are suppliers to our websites. Our business is generally
    sensitive to changes in the competitive landscape, including the
    emergence of new competitors or business models, and supplier
    consolidation.

Intellectual
    Property Rights

We regard our intellectual property rights, including our
    patents, service marks, trademarks, domain names, copyrights,
    trade secrets and other intellectual property, as critical to
    our success. For example, we rely heavily upon the software
    code, informational databases and other components that make up
    our travel planning service.

We rely on a combination of laws, business practices and
    contractual obligations with employees, suppliers, affiliates
    and others to establish and protect our trade secrets. Despite
    these precautions, it may be possible for a third-party to copy
    or otherwise obtain and use our trade secrets or our
    intellectual property without authorization which, if
    discovered, might require the uncertainty of legal action to
    correct. In addition, there can be no assurance that others will
    not independently and lawfully develop substantially similar
    properties.

We maintain our trademark portfolio by filing trademark
    applications with the appropriate international trademark
    offices, maintaining our current registrations, securing
    contractual trademark rights when appropriate, and relying on
    common law trademark rights when appropriate. We also register
    domain names as we deem appropriate. We protect our trademarks
    and domain names with an enforcement program and use of
    trademark licenses. While we seek to protect our trademarks and
    domain names, effective trademark and domain name protection may
    not be available or may not be sought by us for every trademark
    and domain name used in every country, and contractual disputes
    may affect the use of trademarks and domain names governed by
    private contract. In addition, our infringement monitoring
    resources may not locate every trademark or domain name
    infringement that exists. Similarly, not every variation of a
    domain name may be available, or may be registered by us, even
    if available. The failure to protect our intellectual property
    in a meaningful manner, or challenges to our intellectual
    property rights, could materially adversely affect our business,
    result in erosion of our brand names

and/or

limit
    our ability to control marketing on or through the internet
    using our various domain names.

We have considered, and will continue to consider, the
    appropriateness of filing for patents to protect future
    inventions, as circumstances may warrant. However, many patents
    protect only specific inventions and there can be no assurance
    that others may not create new products or methods that achieve
    similar results without infringing upon patents owned by us.

From time to time, we may be subject to legal proceedings and
    claims in the ordinary course of our business, including claims
    of alleged infringement by us of the trademarks, copyrights,
    patents and other intellectual property rights of third-parties.
    In addition, litigation may be necessary in the future to
    enforce our intellectual property rights, protect our trade
    secrets or to determine the validity and scope of proprietary
    rights claimed by others. Any such litigation, regardless of
    outcome or merit, could result in substantial costs and
    diversion of management and technical resources, any of which
    could materially harm our business.

Regulation

We must comply with laws and regulations relating to the travel
    industry and the provision of travel services, including
    registration in various states as “sellers of travel”
    and compliance with certain disclosure



requirements and participation in state restitution funds. In
    addition, our businesses are subject to regulation by the
    U.S. Department of Transportation and must comply with
    various rules and regulations governing the provision of air
    transportation, including those relating to advertising and
    accessibility.

As we continue to expand the reach of our brands into the
    European, Asia-Pacific and other international markets, we are
    increasingly subject to laws and regulations applicable to
    travel agents in those markets, including, in some countries,
    laws regulating the provision of travel packages and industry
    specific value-added tax regimes. For example, the European
    Economic Community Council Directive on Package Travel Package
    Holidays and Package Tours imposes various obligations upon
    marketers of travel packages, such as disclosure obligations to
    consumers and liability to consumers for improper performance of
    the package, including supplier failure.

Financial
    Information about Segments and Geographic Areas

We generate our revenue through a diverse customer base, and
    there is no reliance on a single customer or small group of
    customers; no customer represented 10% or more of our total
    revenue in the periods presented in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

We have two reportable segments: North America and Europe. The
    segment and geographic information required herein is contained
    in Note 16 — Segment Information, in the notes to
    our consolidated financial statements

We are in the process of reorganizing our business around our
    global brands. Our chief operating decision makers are assessing
    our new structure to determine how we will manage our business
    and report our financial results. Beginning in the first quarter
    of 2009, we expect our reportable segments to change as we will
    no longer manage the business on a geographical basis.

We
    maintain a corporate website at www.expediainc.com. Except as
    explicitly noted, the information on our website, as well as the
    websites of our various brands and businesses, is not
    incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K,

or in any other filings with, or in any information furnished or
    submitted to, the SEC.

We make available, free of charge through our website, our
    Annual Reports on

and Current Reports on

Form 8-K,

and amendments to those reports, filed or furnished pursuant to
    Sections 13(a) or Section 15(d) of the Securities
    Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as soon as reasonably
    practicable after they have been electronically filed with, or
    furnished to, the SEC.

Code of Ethics.

We post our code of business
    conduct and ethics, which applies to all employees, including
    all executive officers, senior financial officers and directors,
    on our corporate website at www.expediainc.com. Our code of
    business conduct and ethics complies with Item 406 of SEC

Regulation S-K

and the rules of NASDAQ. We intend to disclose any changes to
    the code that affect the provisions required by Item 406 of

Regulation S-K,

and any waivers of the code of ethics for our executive
    officers, senior financial officers or directors, on our
    corporate website.

Employees

As of December 31, 2008, we employed approximately
    8,050 full-time and part-time employees, including
    approximately 1,920 employees of eLong. We believe we have
    good relationships with our employees, including relationships
    with employees represented by works councils or other similar
    organizations.



Part I.
    Item 1A.

Risk
    Factors

You should carefully consider each of the following risks and
    uncertainties associated with our company and the ownership of
    our securities. Additional risks not presently known to us or
    that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business
    operations.

Global economic conditions may continue to have an adverse
    effect on our business and financial performance.

Travel expenditures are sensitive to personal and business
    discretionary spending levels and tend to decline or grow more
    slowly during economic downturns, including downturns in any of
    our major markets. In the second half of 2008, there was a rapid
    softening of domestic and global economic conditions, and the
    outlook for 2009 is uncertain. This slowing of the domestic and
    global economies has increased unemployment and reduced the
    financial capacity of both corporate and leisure travelers,
    thereby slowing spending on the services we provide. The
    continuation, or worsening, of domestic and global economic
    conditions could continue to adversely affect our businesses and
    financial performance.

Declines or disruptions in the travel industry could
    adversely affect our business or financial performance.

Our business and financial performance are affected by the
    health of the worldwide travel industry, including by decreases
    in hotel occupancy rates, hotel average daily rates, decreases
    in airline capacity or rising airline ticket prices, all of
    which we have recently experienced. Events or weakness specific
    to the air travel industry that could negatively affect our
    business also include continued fare increases, travel-related
    strikes or labor unrest, bankruptcies or liquidations and fuel
    price volatility. Additionally, our business is sensitive to
    safety concerns, and thus our business has in the past and may
    in the future decline after incidents of actual or threatened
    terrorism, during periods of political instability or
    geopolitical conflict in which travelers become concerned about
    safety issues, as a result of natural disasters such as
    hurricanes or earthquakes or when travel might involve
    health-related risks, such as avian flu. Such concerns could
    result in a protracted decrease in demand for our travel
    services. This decrease in demand, depending on its scope and
    duration, together with any future issues affecting travel
    safety, could significantly and adversely affect our business
    and financial performance over the short and long-term. In
    addition, the disruption of the existing travel plans of a
    significant number of travelers upon the occurrence of certain
    events, such as actual or threatened terrorist activity or war,
    could result in the incurrence of significant additional costs
    and constrained liquidity if we provide relief to affected
    travelers by not charging cancellation fees

and/or

by
    refunding the price of airline tickets, hotel reservations and
    other travel products and services.

We operate in an increasingly competitive global
    environment.

The market for the services we offer is increasingly and
    intensely competitive. We compete with both established and
    emerging online and traditional sellers of travel services,
    including online travel agencies, travel suppliers, large online
    portal and search companies, traditional travel agencies, meta
    search companies and operators of travel industry reservation
    databases. Some of our competitors, particularly travel
    suppliers such as airlines and hotels, may offer products and
    services on more favorable terms, including lower prices, no
    fees or unique access to proprietary loyalty programs, such as
    points and miles. Many of these competitors, such as airlines,
    hotel and rental car companies, have been steadily focusing on
    increasing online demand on their own websites in lieu of
    third-party distributors such as the various Expedia sites. For
    instance, some low cost airlines, which are having increasing
    success in the marketplace, distribute their online supply
    exclusively through their own websites. Suppliers who sell on
    their own websites typically do not charge a processing fee,
    and, in some instances, offer advantages such as increased or
    exclusive product availability and their own bonus miles or
    loyalty points, which could make their offerings more attractive
    to consumers than offerings like ours. In addition, we face
    increasing competition from other travel agencies, which in some
    cases may have favorable offerings for both travelers and
    suppliers, including pricing, connectivity and supply breadth.
    We also compete with other travel agencies for both travelers
    and the acquisition and retention of supply. Increasing
    competition from current and emerging competitors, the
    introduction of new technologies and the expansion of existing
    technologies, such as metasearch and other search engine
    technologies, may force us to



make changes to our business models, including changing our
    approaches to service fees. Increased competition has resulted
    in and may continue to result in reduced margins, as well as
    loss of travelers, transactions and brand recognition. We cannot
    assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against
    current, emerging and future competitors or provide
    differentiated products and services to our traveler base.

Our business depends on our relationships with travel
    suppliers.

An important component of our business success depends on our
    ability to maintain and expand relationships with travel
    suppliers and GDS partners. A substantial portion of our revenue
    is derived from compensation negotiated with travel suppliers
    and GDS partners for bookings made through our websites. Over
    the last several years, air and hotel travel suppliers have
    generally reduced or in some cases eliminated payments to travel
    agents and other travel intermediaries. In addition, as our
    hotel remuneration varies with the room rates paid by travelers
    (Average Daily Rates, or “ADRs”), meaning that our
    revenue for each room will generally be proportionately higher
    or lower depending on the level of the ADR. The recent
    significant decline in ADRs has accordingly negatively impacted
    our hotel booking revenue. To the extent ADRs decline even
    further, as we think is likely in 2009, our hotel booking
    revenue will be further negatively impacted. During the recent
    decline, we have experienced a drop in ADRs generally faster
    than the overall industry due to a number of factors including
    the increased use of our distribution channels for promotional
    activities by hotels. We expect this trend to continue until the
    hotel industry begins to rebound. Also, each year we typically
    negotiate or renegotiate numerous long-term airline and hotel
    contracts. No assurances can be given that GDS partners or
    travel suppliers will not further reduce or eliminate
    compensation, attempt to charge travel agencies for content or
    further reduce their ADRs, any of which could reduce our revenue
    and margins thereby adversely affecting our business and
    financial performance. Adverse changes in existing
    relationships, increasing industry consolidation or our
    inability to enter into new arrangements with these parties on
    favorable terms, if at all, could reduce the amount, quality and
    breadth of attractively priced travel products and services that
    we are able to offer, which could adversely affect our business
    and financial performance.

We rely on the value of our brands, and the costs of
    maintaining and enhancing our brand awareness are increasing.

We believe continued investment in our brands, including
    Expedia.com, hotels.com, Hotwire.com, Classic Vacations,
    Egencia, eLong, Venere, the TripAdvisor Media Network and
    Expedia Local Expert, is critical to retain and expand our
    traveler, supplier and advertiser bases. We have and expect to
    continue having to spend more to maintain our brands’ value
    due to a variety of factors. These include increased spending
    from our competitors, the increasing costs of supporting
    multiple brands, expansion into geographies and products where
    our brands are less well known, inflation in media pricing
    including search engine keywords and the continued emergence and
    relative traffic share growth of search engines and meta search
    engines as destination sites for travelers. We have spent
    considerable money and resources to date on the establishment
    and maintenance of our brands, and we will continue to spend
    money on, and devote resources to, advertising and marketing, as
    well as other brand building efforts to preserve and enhance
    consumer awareness of our brands. We may not be able to
    successfully maintain or enhance consumer awareness of our
    brands, and, even if we are successful in our branding efforts,
    such efforts may not be cost-effective, or as cost-effective as
    they have been historically. If we are unable to maintain or
    enhance consumer awareness of our brands and generate demand in
    a cost-effective manner, it would have a material adverse effect
    on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Our business could be negatively affected by changes in
    search engine algorithms and dynamics.

We increasingly utilize internet search engines such as Google,
    principally through the purchase of travel-related keywords, to
    generate traffic to our websites. Search engines, including
    Google, frequently update and change the logic that determines
    the placement and display of results of a user’s search,
    such that the purchased or algorithmic placement of links to our
    websites can be negatively affected. In addition, a significant
    amount of our business is directed to our own websites through
    our participation in

pay-per-click

and display advertising campaigns on internet media properties
    and search engines whose pricing and operating dynamics can
    experience rapid change, both technically and competitively. If
    a major search engine such as Google, which we utilize for a
    significant amount of our search engine traffic, changes its
    algorithms



in a manner that negatively affects the search engine ranking,
    paid or unpaid, of our websites or that of our third-party
    distribution partners, or if competitive dynamics further impact
    market pricing in a negative manner, our business and financial
    performance would be adversely affected.

We rely on information technology to operate our businesses
    and maintain our competitiveness, and any failure to adapt to
    technological developments or industry trends could harm our
    business.

We depend on the use of sophisticated information technologies
    and systems, including technology and systems used for
    reservations, communications, procurement and administration. As
    our operations grow in both size and scope, we must continuously
    improve and upgrade our systems and infrastructure to offer an
    increasing number of travelers enhanced products, services,
    features and functionality, while maintaining the reliability
    and integrity of our systems and infrastructure. Our future
    success also depends on our ability to adapt our services and
    infrastructure to meet rapidly evolving consumer trends and
    demands while continuing to improve the performance, features
    and reliability of our service in response to competitive
    service and product offerings.

In addition, we may not be able to maintain our existing systems
    or replace or introduce new technologies and systems as quickly
    as we would like or in a cost-effective manner. We are currently
    in the process of migrating portions of our site functionality
    to new technology platforms to enable us to introduce innovation
    more rapidly, achieve better search engine optimization and
    improve our site merchandising capability, among other
    anticipated benefits. We have experienced some delays with this
    migration. Delays or difficulties in implementing new or
    enhanced systems may keep us from achieving the desired results
    in a timely manner, to the extent anticipated, or at all. Also,
    we may be unable to devote financial resources to new
    technologies and systems in the future. If any of these events
    occur, our business could suffer.

We rely on third-parties for many systems and services.

We rely on third-party service providers for certain customer
    care, fulfillment, processing, development, technology and other
    services. If these third-parties experience difficulty meeting
    our requirements or standards, it could damage our reputation or
    make it difficult for us to operate some aspects of our
    business. In addition, if such third-party service providers
    were to cease operations, temporarily or permanently, face
    financial distress or other business disruption, we could suffer
    increased costs and delays in our ability to provide similar
    services until an equivalent service provider could be found or
    we could develop replacement technology or operations. In
    addition, we rely increasingly on outsourced providers of
    traveler care and information technology services. If we are
    unsuccessful in choosing high quality partners or we
    ineffectively manage these partnerships it could have an adverse
    impact on our operations and financial results.

We rely on the performance of highly skilled personnel and,
    if we are unable to retain or motivate key personnel or hire,
    retain and motivate qualified personnel, our business would be
    harmed.

Our performance is largely dependent on the talents and efforts
    of highly skilled individuals. Our future success depends on our
    continuing ability to identify, hire, develop, motivate and
    retain highly skilled personnel for all areas of our
    organization. In particular, the contributions of Barry Diller,
    our Chairman and Senior Executive, and Dara Khosrowshahi, our
    Chief Executive Officer, are critical to the overall management
    of the company. Our future success will depend on the
    performance of our senior management and key employees. Expedia
    cannot ensure that it will be able to retain the services of
    Mr. Diller, Mr. Khosrowshahi or any other member of
    our senior management or key employees, the loss of whom could
    seriously harm our business. Competition for well-qualified
    employees in certain aspects of our business, including software
    engineers and other technology professionals, also remains
    intense.

Our continued ability to compete effectively depends on our
    ability to attract new employees and to retain and motivate our
    existing employees. If we do not succeed in attracting
    well-qualified employees or retaining or motivating existing
    employees, our business would be adversely affected. We do not
    maintain any key person life insurance policies.



We are in the process of restructuring our global workforce to
    simplify and streamline our organization, improve our cost
    structure and strengthen our overall businesses. These changes
    could affect employee morale and productivity and be disruptive
    to our business.

Our stock price is highly volatile.

The market price of our common stock is highly volatile and
    could continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to
    factors such as the following, some of which are beyond our
    control:

•

Quarterly variations in our operating results;

•

Operating results that vary from the expectations of securities
    analysts and investors;

•

Changes in expectations as to our future financial performance,
    including financial estimates by securities analysts and
    investors;

•

Rating agency credit rating actions;

•

Reaction to our earnings releases and conference calls, or
    presentations by executives at investor and industry conferences;

•

Changes in our capital structure;

•

Changes in market valuations of other internet or online service
    companies;

•

Announcements of technological innovations or new services by us
    or our competitors;

•

Announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts,
    acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital
    commitments;

•

Loss of a major supplier participant, such as an airline or
    hotel chain;

•

Changes in the status of our intellectual property rights;

•

Lack of success in the expansion of our business model
    geographically;

•

Announcements by third parties of significant claims or
    proceedings against us or adverse developments in pending
    proceedings;

•

Additions or departures of key personnel;

•

Rumors or public speculation about any of the above
    factors; and

•

Market and volume fluctuations in the stock markets in general.

Volatility in our stock price could also make us less attractive
    to certain investors, and/or invite speculative trading in our
    common stock or debt instruments.

Our international operations involve additional risks and our
    exposure to these risks will increase as we expand our
    international operations.

We operate in a number of jurisdictions outside of the United
    States and intend to continue to expand our international
    presence. To achieve widespread acceptance in the countries and
    markets we enter, we must continue to tailor our services and
    business model to the unique circumstances of such countries and
    markets, including supplier relationships and traveler
    preferences. Learning the customs and cultures of various
    countries, particularly with respect to travel patterns and
    practices, can be difficult, costly and divert management and
    personnel resources. Our failure to adapt our practices and
    models effectively to the traveler and supplier preferences of
    each country into which we expand could slow our international
    growth.

We expect to continue to face additional risks in international
    operations. These risks include political instability;
    threatened or actual acts of terrorism; changes in regulatory
    requirements; our ability to comply with additional
    U.S. laws applicable to U.S. companies operating
    internationally as well as local laws and regulations;
    diminished ability to legally enforce our contractual rights;
    increased risk and limits on our ability to enforce intellectual
    property rights; possible preferences by local populations for
    local providers; restrictions



on the withdrawal of

non-U.S. investment

and earnings; currency exchange restrictions; slower adoption of
    the internet as an advertising, broadcast and commerce medium in
    those markets as compared to the United States and difficulties
    in managing staffing and operations due to distance, time zones,
    language and cultural differences.

Changing laws, rules and regulations and legal uncertainties
    may adversely affect our business or financial performance.

Our business and financial performance could be adversely
    affected by unfavorable changes in or interpretations of
    existing, or the promulgation of new laws, rules and regulations
    applicable to us and our businesses, including those relating to
    the internet and online commerce, consumer protection and
    privacy. Such unfavorable changes could decrease demand for
    products and services, increase costs

and/or

subject us to additional liabilities. For example, there is, and
    will likely continue to be, an increasing number of laws and
    regulations pertaining to the internet and online commerce,
    which may relate to liability for information retrieved from or
    transmitted over the internet, user privacy, taxation and the
    quality of products and services. Furthermore, the growth and
    development of online commerce may prompt calls for more
    stringent consumer protection laws that may impose additional
    burdens on online businesses generally.

Adverse application of tax laws, rules or regulations could
    have an adverse effect on our businesses and financial
    performance.

The application of various domestic and international sales,
    use, occupancy, value-added and other tax laws, rules and
    regulations to our historical and new products and services is
    subject to interpretation by the applicable taxing authorities.
    Many of the fundamental statutes and regulations that impose
    these taxes were established before the growth of the internet
    and

e-commerce.

If the tax laws, rules and regulations were amended, if new
    adverse laws, rules or regulations were adopted, or if current
    laws are interpreted adversely to our interests, particularly
    with respect to occupancy or value-added taxes, the results
    could increase our tax payments (prospectively or
    retrospectively)

and/or

subject us to penalties and decrease the demand for our products
    and services if we pass on such costs to the consumer. As a
    result these changes could have an adverse affect on our
    businesses or financial performance. In addition, we may be
    required in certain jurisdictions to pay tax assessments, which
    may be substantial, prior to contesting the validity of such
    assessments. This requirement is commonly referred to as
    “pay to play.” Payment of these amounts is not an
    admission that the tax payer believes it is subject to such
    taxes. We continue to work with relevant tax authorities and
    legislators to clarify our obligations under existing, new and
    emerging laws and regulations. There have been, and will
    continue to be, substantial ongoing costs, which may include
    “pay to play” payments, associated with complying
    with, and defending our position in, the various indirect tax
    requirements in the numerous markets in which we conduct or will
    conduct business.

Provisions in certain credit card processing agreements could
    adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition.

We have agreements with companies that process customer credit
    card transactions for the facilitation of customer bookings of
    travel services from our travel suppliers. These agreements
    allow these processing companies, under certain conditions, to
    hold an amount of our cash (referred to as a
    “holdback”) or require us to post a letter of credit
    equal to a portion of bookings that have been processed by that
    company. These processing companies may be entitled to a
    holdback upon the occurrence of specified events, including
    material adverse changes in our financial condition, or for
    certain companies, at their discretion. An imposition of a
    holdback by one or more of our processing companies could
    materially reduce our liquidity.

In addition, we may be held liable for accepting fraudulent
    credit cards on our websites for transactions where we are
    merchant of record as well as other payment disputes with our
    customers. Additionally, we are held liable for accepting
    fraudulent credit cards in certain retail transactions when we
    do not act as merchant of record. Accordingly, we calculate and
    record an allowance for the resulting credit card charge backs.
    If we are unable to combat the use of fraudulent credit cards on
    our websites, our results of operations and financial condition
    could be materially adversely affected.



System interruption and the lack of redundancy in our
    information systems may harm our businesses.

We rely on computer systems to facilitate and process
    transactions. We have experienced and may in the future
    experience system interruptions that make some or all of these
    systems unavailable or prevent us from efficiently fulfilling
    orders or providing services to third-parties. Any
    interruptions, outages or delays in our systems, or
    deterioration in their performance, could impair our ability to
    process transactions and decrease our quality of service that we
    can offer to our travelers. If we were to experience frequent or
    persistent system failures, our reputation and brands could be
    harmed.

In addition, we do not have backup systems or contingency plans
    for certain critical aspects of our operations or business
    processes, many other systems are not fully redundant and our
    disaster recovery or business continuity planning may not be
    sufficient. Fire, flood, power loss, telecommunications failure,
    break-ins, earthquakes, acts of war or terrorism, acts of God,
    computer viruses, physical break-ins, electronic intrusion
    attempts from both external and internal sources and similar
    events or disruptions may damage or impact or interrupt computer
    or communications systems or business processes at any time.
    Although we have put measures in place to protect certain
    portions of our facilities and assets, any of these events could
    cause system interruption, delays and loss of critical data, and
    could prevent us from providing services to our travelers

and/or

third
    parties for a significant period of time. Remediation may be
    costly and we may not have adequate insurance to cover such
    costs. Moreover, the costs of enhancing infrastructure to attain
    improved stability and redundancy may be time consuming and
    expensive and may require resources and expertise that are
    difficult to obtain.

Intense competition for advertising revenue may adversely
    affect our ability to achieve or maintain market share and
    operate profitably.

Expedia, Inc. websites, including in particular the TripAdvisor
    Media Network, compete for advertising dollars with large
    internet portal sites, such as American Online, MSN and Yahoo!,
    that offer listing or other advertising opportunities for
    travel-related companies. These companies have significantly
    greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources and
    large client bases. We also compete with search engines like
    Google and Yahoo! Search that offer

pay-per-click

advertising services. In addition, we compete with newspapers,
    magazines and other traditional media companies that provide
    offline and online advertising opportunities. We expect to face
    additional competition as other established and emerging
    companies, including print media companies, enter the online
    advertising market. Competition could results in reduced margins
    on our advertising services, loss of market share or less use of
    our sites by travel companies and travelers. If we are not able
    to compete effectively with current or future competitors as a
    result of these and other factors, our business could be
    materially adversely affected. In addition, the TripAdvisor
    Media Network is increasingly reliant on natural and paid search
    traffic from major search engines, whose per unit costs have
    been increasing.

Mr. Diller currently controls Expedia. If
    Mr. Diller ceases to control the company, Liberty Media
    Corporation may effectively control the company.

Subject to the terms of a Stockholders Agreement between
    Mr. Diller and Liberty Media Corporation, Mr. Diller
    holds an irrevocable proxy to vote shares of Expedia stock held
    by Liberty. Accordingly, Mr. Diller effectively controls
    the outcome of all matters submitted to a vote or for the
    consent of our stockholders (other than with respect to the
    election by the holders of common stock of 25% of the members of
    the Board of Directors and matters as to which Delaware law
    requires a separate class vote). Upon Mr. Diller’s
    permanent departure from Expedia, the irrevocable proxy would
    terminate and depending on the capitalization of Expedia at such
    time, Liberty could effectively control the voting power of our
    capital stock. Mr. Diller, through shares he owns
    beneficially as well as those subject to the irrevocable proxy,
    controlled approximately 60% of the combined voting power of the
    outstanding Expedia capital stock as of December 31, 2008.

In addition, under a Governance Agreement among Mr. Diller,
    Liberty Media Corporation and Expedia, Inc., as amended, each of
    Mr. Diller and Liberty generally has the right to consent
    to limited matters in the event that we incur debt such that our
    ratio of total debt to EBITDA, as defined in the Governance
    Agreement,



equals or exceeds 8:1 over a continuous

12-month

period. We cannot assure you that Mr. Diller and Liberty
    will consent to any such matter at a time when we are highly
    leveraged, in which case we would not be able to engage in such
    transactions or take such actions.

As a result of Mr. Diller’s ownership interests and
    voting power, and Liberty’s ownership interests and voting
    power upon Mr. Diller’s permanent departure from us,
    Mr. Diller is currently, and in the future Liberty may be,
    in a position to control or influence significant corporate
    actions, including, corporate transactions such as mergers,
    business combinations or dispositions of assets and
    determinations with respect to our significant business
    direction and policies. This concentrated control could
    discourage others from initiating any potential merger, takeover
    or other change of control transaction that may otherwise be
    beneficial to us.

Actual or potential conflicts of interest may develop between
    Expedia management and directors, on the one hand, and the
    management and directors of IAC, on the other.

Mr. Diller serves as our Chairman of the Board of Directors
    and Senior Executive, while retaining his role as Chairman and
    Chief Executive Officer of IAC, and Mr. Kaufman serves as
    Vice Chairman of both Expedia and IAC. The fact that
    Messrs. Diller and Kaufman hold positions with both
    companies and own both IAC and Expedia stock could create, or
    appear to create, potential conflicts of interest for each of
    Messrs. Diller and Kaufman when facing decisions that may
    affect both IAC and Expedia. Both Messrs. Diller and
    Kaufman may also face conflicts of interest with regard to the
    allocation of their time between IAC and Expedia.

Our certificate of incorporation provides that no officer or
    director of Expedia who is also an officer or director of IAC
    will be liable to Expedia or its stockholders for breach of any
    fiduciary duty by reason of the fact that any such individual
    directs a corporate opportunity to IAC instead of Expedia, or
    does not communicate information regarding a corporate
    opportunity to Expedia because the officer or director has
    directed the corporate opportunity to IAC. This corporate
    opportunity provision may have the effect of exacerbating the
    risk of conflicts of interest between IAC and Expedia because
    the provision effectively shields an overlapping
    director/executive officer from liability for breach of
    fiduciary duty in the event that such director or officer
    chooses to direct a corporate opportunity to IAC instead of
    Expedia.

We may be unable to access capital when necessary or
    desirable.

The availability of funds depends in significant measure on
    capital markets and liquidity factors over which we exert no
    control. Particularly in light of existing uncertainty in the
    capital and credit markets, we can provide no assurance that
    sufficient financing will be available on desirable or even any
    terms to fund investments, acquisitions, stock repurchases or
    extraordinary actions or that our counterparties in any such
    financings would honor their contractual commitments. In
    addition, any downgrade of our debt ratings by
    Standard & Poor’s, Moody’s Investor Service
    or similar ratings agencies, increases in general interest rate
    levels or the recent general weakening in the credit markets
    could increase our cost of capital. Recently credit spreads for
    below investment grade issuers such as Expedia have increased
    significantly compared with historical levels, impacting returns
    for bondholders and increasing the cost of potential incremental
    debt issuance.

In addition, we have experienced, and may experience declines in
    seasonal liquidity and capital provided by our merchant hotel
    business, which has historically provided a meaningful portion
    of our operating cash flow. The extent of such impact is
    dependent on several factors, including the rate of growth of
    our merchant hotel business, payment terms with suppliers and
    relative growth of businesses which consume rather than generate
    working capital, such as our agency hotel, advertising and
    managed corporate travel businesses.

Our revolving credit facility expires in August 2010, and any
    borrowings thereunder will be classified as current during the
    third quarter of 2009. Given the current uncertainty in the
    credit markets, there is no guarantee we will be able to renew
    our credit facility, or renew it at current commitment levels or
    otherwise on terms acceptable to us. In addition, a recent
    amendment to the facility has increased the cost of borrowing
    under the facility.



We have significant long-term indebtedness, which could
    adversely affect our business and financial condition.

As of December 31, 2008, the face value of our long-term
    indebtedness totaled $1.54 billion. Risks relating to our
    long-term indebtedness include:

•

Increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and
    industry conditions;

•

Requiring us to dedicate a portion of our cash flow from
    operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the
    availability of cash flow to fund working capital, capital
    expenditures, acquisitions and investments and other general
    corporate purposes;

•

Making it difficult for us to optimally capitalize and manage
    the cash flow for our businesses;

•

Limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to,
    changes in our businesses and the markets in which we operate;

•

Placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our
    competitors that have less debt; and

•

Limiting our ability to borrow additional funds or to borrow
    funds at rates or on other terms we find acceptable.

In addition, it is possible that we may need to incur additional
    indebtedness in the future in the ordinary course of business.
    The terms of our credit facility and the indentures governing
    our outstanding senior notes allow us to incur additional debt
    subject to certain limitations. If new debt is added to current
    debt levels, the risks described above could intensify.

The agreements governing our indebtedness contain various
    covenants that limit our discretion in the operation of our
    business and also require us to meet financial maintenance tests
    and other covenants. The failure to comply with such tests and
    covenants could have a material adverse effect on us.

The agreements governing our indebtedness contain various
    covenants, including those that restrict our ability to, among
    other things:

•

Borrow money, and guarantee or provide other support for
    indebtedness of third parties including guarantees;

•

Pay dividends on, redeem or repurchase our capital stock;

•

Make investments in entities that we do not control, including
    joint ventures;

•

Enter into certain asset sale transactions;

•

Enter into secured financing arrangements;

•

Enter into sale and leaseback transactions; and

•

Enter into unrelated businesses.

These covenants may limit our ability to effectively operate our
    businesses.

In addition, our credit facility requires that we meet certain
    financial tests, including an interest coverage test and a
    leverage ratio test. We recently entered into an amendment to
    our credit facility that tightened a number of the restrictions
    listed above.

Any failure to comply with the restrictions of our credit
    facility or any agreement governing our other indebtedness may
    result in an event of default under those agreements. Such
    default may allow the creditors to accelerate the related debt,
    which acceleration may trigger cross-acceleration or
    cross-default provisions in other debt. In addition, lenders may
    be able to terminate any commitments they had made to supply us
    with further funds (including periodic rollovers of existing
    borrowings).



We have foreign exchange risk.

We conduct a significant and growing portion of our business
    outside the United States. As a result, we face exposure to
    movements in currency exchange rates, particularly those related
    to the British pound sterling, the euro, Canadian dollar,
    Australian dollar and Chinese renminbi.

These exposures include but are not limited to re-measurement
    gains and losses from changes in the value of foreign
    denominated assets and liabilities; translation gains and losses
    on foreign subsidiary financial results that are translated into
    U.S. dollars upon consolidation; fluctuations in merchant
    hotel revenue due to relative currency movements from the time
    of booking to the time of stay; planning risk related to changes
    in exchange rates between the time we prepare our annual and
    quarterly forecasts and when actual results occur; and the
    impact of relative exchange rate movements on cross-border
    travel, principally Europe to the United States and the
    United States to Europe travel.

Depending on the size of the exposures and the relative
    movements of exchange rates, if we choose not to hedge or fail
    to hedge effectively our exposure, we could experience a
    material adverse effect on our financial statements and
    financial condition. In addition, given the recent severe
    volatility in exchange rates these exposures have increased, and
    the impact on our results of operations has become more
    pronounced. In addition, the current environment, and the
    increasingly global nature of our business has made hedging
    these exposures both more complex and costly. We have increased
    and plan to continue increasing the scope and complexity of our
    foreign exchange risk management, including the use of forward
    contracts to hedge a portion of our exposures. We make a number
    of estimates in conducting hedging activities including in some
    cases the level of future bookings, cancellations, refunds and
    payments in foreign currencies. In the event those estimates
    differ significantly from actual results, we could experience
    greater volatility as a result of our hedging activities.

We are exposed to various counterparty risks.

We are exposed to the risk of failure to perform by various
    financial counterparties, including for our insurance coverages,
    investments, bank deposits, letters of credit and foreign
    exchange risk management. As it relates to foreign exchange, we
    employ forward contracts to hedge a portion of our exposure to
    foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. As of
    December 31, 2008, we were party to forward contracts with
    a notional value of $165 million and the fair value of
    which was a $1 million liability. The counterparties to
    these contracts were Goldman Sachs, Banc of America, HSBC and
    Fifth Third Bank. Upon the maturity of these or subsequent
    contracts, the counterparties are potentially obligated to pay
    us net settlement values. If any of these counterparties were to
    liquidate, declare bankruptcy or otherwise cease operations, it
    may not be able to satisfy its obligations under these forward
    contracts. In addition, due to the weakening economy we also
    face increased credit risk and payment delays from our
    non-financial contract counterparties.

Our investment in eLong creates risks and uncertainties
    relating to the laws in China.

The success of our investment in eLong, Inc., a company
    organized under Cayman Islands law, whose principal business is
    the operation of an internet-based travel business in China, is
    subject to risks and uncertainties regarding the interpretation
    of China’s laws and regulations. Significant uncertainties
    exist in the interpretation and enforcement of Chinese laws and
    regulations, and such uncertainties could limit the available
    legal protections relating to our investment in eLong. Moreover,
    we cannot predict the effect of future developments in
    China’s legal system, particularly with respect to the
    travel industry, the internet, foreign investment or licensing,
    including the introduction of new laws, changes to existing laws
    or the interpretation or enforcement of current or future laws
    and regulations. In addition, the laws and regulations of China
    restrict certain direct foreign investment in the air-ticketing,
    travel agency and internet content provision businesses.
    Although we have established effective control through a series
    of agreements between eLong, Inc. and its affiliated Chinese
    entities, future developments in the interpretation or
    enforcement of Chinese laws and regulations or a dispute
    relating to the agreements could restrict our ability to operate
    or restructure these entities or to engage in desirable
    strategic transactions. Finally, China does not have treaties
    with the United States or most other western countries
    providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of



judgment of courts. As a result, court judgments obtained in
    jurisdictions with which China does not have treaties on
    reciprocal recognition of judgment may be difficult or
    impossible to enforce in China.

Our processing, storage, use and disclosure of personal data
    could give rise to liabilities as a result of governmental
    regulation, conflicting legal requirements, differing views of
    personal privacy rights, or data security breaches.

In the processing of our traveler transactions, we receive and
    store a large volume of personally identifiable information.
    This information is increasingly subject to legislation and
    regulations in numerous jurisdictions around the world. This
    government action is typically intended to protect the privacy
    and security of personal information that is collected,
    processed and transmitted in or from the governing jurisdiction.
    We could be adversely affected if legislation or regulations are
    expanded to require changes in our business practices or if
    governing jurisdictions interpret or implement their legislation
    or regulations in ways that negatively affect our business,
    financial condition and results of operations. As privacy and
    data protection have become more sensitive issues, we may also
    become exposed to potential liabilities as a result of differing
    views on the privacy of travel

and/or

online data.

We cannot guarantee that our security measures will prevent data
    breaches. In addition, certain of our acquired companies may not
    have the same standards related to data collection, storage and
    transfer that Expedia has historically maintained. Failure to
    improve their standard or a substantial data breach in any of
    our businesses could significantly harm our business, damage our
    reputation, expose us to a risk of loss or litigation and
    possible liability

and/or

cause
    customers and potential customers to lose confidence in our
    security, which would have a negative effect on the value of our
    brands.

These and other privacy and security developments that are
    difficult to anticipate could adversely affect our business,
    financial condition and results of operations.

Acquisitions could result in operating and financial
    difficulties.

Our future growth may depend, in part, on acquisitions. To the
    extent that we grow through acquisitions, we will face the
    operational and financial risks that commonly accompany that
    strategy. We would also face operational risks, such as failing
    to assimilate the operations and personnel of the acquired
    businesses, disrupting their ongoing businesses, increased
    complexity of our business, impairing management resources and
    their relationships with employees and travelers as a result of
    changes in their ownership and management. Further, the
    evaluation and negotiation of potential acquisitions, as well as
    the integration of an acquired business, may divert management
    time and other resources. Some acquisitions may not be
    successful and their performance may result in the impairment of
    their carrying value.

Certain financial and operational risks related to acquisitions
    that may have a material impact on our business are:

•

Use of cash resources and incurrence of debt and contingent
    liabilities in funding acquisitions;

•

Amortization expenses related to acquired intangible assets and
    other adverse accounting consequences;

•

Costs incurred in identifying and performing due diligence on
    potential acquisition targets that may or may not be successful;

•

Difficulties and expenses in assimilating the operations,
    products, technology, privacy protection systems, information
    systems or personnel of the acquired company;

•

Impairment of relationships with employees, suppliers and
    affiliates of our business and the acquired business;

•

The assumption of known and unknown debt and liabilities of the
    acquired company;

•

Failure to generate adequate returns on our acquisitions and
    investments;

•

Entrance into markets in which we have no direct prior
    experience; and

•

Impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets arising from
    our acquisitions.



We cannot be sure that our intellectual property is protected
    from copying or use by others, including potential
    competitors.

Our websites rely on content and technology intellectual
    property, much of which we regard as proprietary. We protect our
    proprietary technology by relying on trademarks, copyrights,
    trade secret laws and confidentiality agreements. In connection
    with our license agreements with third-parties, we seek to
    control access to and distribution of our technology,
    documentation and other proprietary information. Even with all
    of these precautions, it is possible for someone else to copy or
    otherwise obtain and use our proprietary technology or content
    without our authorization or to develop similar technology
    independently. Effective trademark, copyright and trade secret
    protection may not be available in every country in which our
    services are made available through the internet, and policing
    unauthorized use of our proprietary information is difficult and
    expensive. We cannot be sure that the steps we have taken will
    prevent misappropriation of our proprietary information. This
    misappropriation could have a material adverse effect on our
    business. In the future, we may need to go to court to enforce
    our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets
    or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights
    of others. This litigation might result in substantial costs and
    diversion of resources and management attention.

We currently license from third-parties some of the technologies
    incorporated into our websites. As we continue to introduce new
    services that incorporate new technologies, we may be required
    to license additional technology. We cannot be sure that such
    technology licenses will be available on commercially reasonable
    terms, if at all.

Part I. Item 3.

Legal
    Proceedings

In the ordinary course of business, Expedia and its subsidiaries
    are parties to legal proceedings and claims involving property,
    personal injury, contract, alleged infringement of third-party
    intellectual property rights and other claims. The amounts that
    may be recovered in such matters may be subject to insurance
    coverage.

Rules of the SEC require the description of material pending
    legal proceedings, other than ordinary, routine litigation
    incident to the registrant’s business, and advise that
    proceedings ordinarily need not be described if they primarily
    involve damages claims for amounts (exclusive of interest and
    costs) not individually exceeding 10% of the current assets of
    the registrant and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. In
    the judgment of management, none of the pending litigation
    matters that the Company and its subsidiaries are defending,
    including those described below, involves or is likely to
    involve amounts of that magnitude. The litigation matters

Securities
    Class Action Litigation against IAC

Beginning on September 20, 2004, twelve purported
    shareholder class actions were commenced in the United States
    District Court for the Southern District of New York against IAC
    and certain of its officers and directors, alleging violations
    of the federal securities laws. These cases arose out of
    IAC’s August 4, 2004 announcement of its earnings for
    the second quarter of 2004 and generally alleged that the value
    of IAC’s stock was artificially inflated by
    pre-announcement statements about its financial results and
    forecasts that were false and misleading due to the
    defendants’ alleged failure to disclose various problems
    faced by IAC’s travel businesses. On December 20,
    2004, the district court consolidated the twelve lawsuits,
    appointed co-lead plaintiffs, and designated co-lead
    plaintiffs’ counsel. See

In re IAC/InterActiveCorp
    Securities Litigation,

No. 04-CV-7447

(S.D.N.Y.). Expedia is not a party to this litigation, however,
    under the terms of its Separation Agreement with IAC, Expedia
    has generally agreed to bear a portion of the costs and
    liabilities, if any, associated with any securities law
    litigation relating to conduct prior to the Spin-Off of the
    businesses or entities that comprise Expedia following the
    Spin-Off.

On October 18, 2004, a related shareholder derivative
    action,

Stuart Garber, Derivatively on Behalf of
    IAC/InterActiveCorp v. Barry Diller et al.

,

No. 04-603416,

was commenced in the Supreme Court of the State of New York (New
    York County) against certain of IAC’s officers and
    directors. On November 15, 2004, another related
    shareholder derivative action,

Lisa Butler, Derivatively on
    Behalf of IAC/InterActiveCorp v. Barry Diller et al.

,

No. 04-CV-9067,

was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern
    District of New York against certain of IAC’s current and
    former directors. On January 24, 2005, the federal district
    court consolidated the

Butler

case with the securities
    class action for pre-trial purposes only. On April 11,
    2005, the district court issued a similar consolidation order in
    respect of the

Garber

case.

On July 5, 2005, the plaintiffs in the related shareholder
    suits filed a consolidated shareholder derivative complaint
    against IAC (as a nominal defendant) and sixteen current or
    former officers or directors of IAC or its former travel
    business. The complaint, which is based upon factual allegations
    similar to those in the securities class action, purports to
    assert claims for breach of fiduciary duty, abuse of control,
    gross mismanagement, waste of corporate assets, unjust
    enrichment, violation of Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act,
    and contribution and indemnification. The complaint sought an
    order voiding the election of IAC’s then Board of
    Directors, as well as damages in an unspecified amount, various
    forms of equitable relief, restitution, and disgorgement of
    remuneration received by the individual defendants from IAC.

On September 15, 2005, IAC and the other defendants filed
    motions to dismiss both the securities class action and the
    shareholder derivative suits. On November 30, 2005, the
    plaintiffs filed their opposition to the motions. On
    January 6, 2006, the defendants filed reply papers in
    further support of the motions. The court issued an opinion and
    order (i) granting the defendants’ motion to dismiss
    the complaint in the securities class action, with leave to
    replead, and (ii) granting the defendants’ motion to
    dismiss the complaint in the shareholder derivative suits, with
    prejudice.

On April 23, 2007, the plaintiffs in the shareholder
    derivative suits filed a notice of appeal to the
    United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit from
    the District Court’s order of dismissal. On June 14,
    2007, on consent of the parties, the appeal was withdrawn from
    active consideration by the Court of Appeals, subject to
    reinstatement by no later than March 31, 2008.

On May 15, 2007, the plaintiffs in the securities class
    action filed a second amended complaint. The new pleading
    continues to allege that the defendants failed to disclose
    material information concerning problems at the Company’s
    then-travel businesses and to assert the same legal claims as
    its predecessor. On August 15, 2007, the defendants filed a
    motion to dismiss the second amended complaint. On
    October 19, 2007, the plaintiffs opposed the motion. On
    November 9, 2007, the defendants filed their reply brief in
    support of the motion. A hearing on the motion has not been
    scheduled.

Expedia believes that the claims in the class action and
    derivative suits lack merit and will continue to vigorously
    defend against them.

Hotels.com.

On June 20, 2003, a purported
    class action was filed in Texas state court against certain
    hotels.com-affiliated entities (“hotels.com”).

See
    Nora J. Olvera, Individually and on Behalf of All Others



Similarly Situated v. Hotels.com, Inc.

,

No. DC-03-259

(District Court, 229th Judicial District, Duval County).
    The complaint and subsequent amended complaints filed
    August 12, 2003 and May 6, 2004, allege that
    hotels.com collects “excess” hotel occupancy taxes
    from consumers (i.e., allegedly charges consumers more for
    occupancy taxes than it pays to the hotels for the hotels’
    use in satisfying their obligations to the taxing authorities).
    The complaint sought certification of a nationwide class of all
    persons who have purchased hotel accommodations from hotels.com
    since June 20, 1999, as well as restitution of,
    disgorgement of, and the imposition of a constructive trust upon
    all “excess” occupancy taxes allegedly collected by
    hotels.com. On September 25, 2003, the plaintiff filed a
    demand for arbitration containing substantially the same factual
    allegations as the

Olvera

lawsuit. On September 2,
    2004, the arbitrator issued a final award granting
    hotels.com’s motion to dismiss the arbitration claim.

On May 6, 2003, a purported class action was filed in Texas
    state court against hotels.com, L.P. (“hotels.com”),

Mary Canales, Individually and on Behalf of All Others
    Similarly Situated v. Hotels.com, L.P

.,

No. DC-03-162

(District Court, 229th Judicial District, Duval County).
    The complaint, as amended, alleges that hotels.com charges
    customers “taxes” that exceed the amount required by
    or paid to the applicable taxing authorities and that hotels.com
    charges customers “fees” that do not correspond to any
    specific services provided. The complaint seeks restitution of,
    disgorgement of, and the imposition of a constructive trust upon
    all “excess” occupancy taxes allegedly collected by
    hotels.com. On April 29, 2005, the court issued an order
    granting the plaintiff’s motion for class certification. On
    February 1, 2006, the court of appeals reversed the holding
    certifying the class and remanded the case to the trial court.
    On April 20, 2006, Canales filed a fourth amended petition
    and a new motion for class certification. Certification briefing
    has been deferred indefinitely. On November 18, 2008, the
    parties submitted a joint status report to the court asking that
    the next status conference be set in approximately six months.

In re
    Expedia Hotel Taxes and Fees Litigation,

No. 05-2-02060-1,

pending in King County Superior Court. The consolidated
    complaint alleges that Expedia Washington is improperly charging

and/or

failing to pay hotel occupancy taxes and engaging in other
    deceptive practices in charging customers for taxes and fees.
    The complaint seeks certification of a nationwide class of all
    persons who were assessed a charge for “taxes/fees”
    when booking rooms through Expedia Washington. The complaint
    alleges violation of the Washington Consumer Protection Act and
    common-law conversion and seeks imposition of a constructive
    trust on monies received from the plaintiff class, as well as
    damages in an unspecified amount, disgorgement, restitution,
    interest and penalties. Six of the seven originally named
    plaintiffs have withdrawn from the suit. On March 27, 2006,
    a new named plaintiff was permitted to intervene. During a
    March 2, 2007 hearing, the court indicated that the
    plaintiff should amend its complaint and that the parties should
    provide further briefing on class certification issues. Hearings
    on plaintiff’s motion for class certification took place on
    September 28, 2007 and April 4, 2008. On May 7,
    2008, the court entered an order granting plaintiff’s
    motion to certify the class. On June 17, 2008, Expedia
    Washington filed, with the court of appeals, a motion for
    discretionary review of the order certifying the class and a
    motion to stay further proceedings. On August 14, 2008, the
    Court of Appeals denied Expedia Washington’s motion for
    discretionary review of the trial court’s order granting
    the plaintiff’s motion to certify the class. On
    October 17, 2008, the Court of Appeals denied Expedia
    Washington’s motion to modify the denial of its motion for
    discretionary review. Trial is scheduled for July 27, 2009.

Hotwire.

On April 19, 2005, three actions
    filed against Hotwire, Inc. (“Hotwire”) were

Bruce
    Deaton v. Hotwire, Inc. et al.

, Case

No. CGC-05-437631,

in the Superior Court of the State of California, County of
    San Francisco. The consolidated complaint, which was

    deceptive practices in charging customers for taxes and fees.
    The complaint seeks certification of a nationwide class of all
    persons who were assessed a charge for “taxes/fees”



when booking rooms through Hotwire. The amended complaint
    alleges violation of Section 17200 of the California
    Business and Professions Code, violation of the California
    Consumer Legal Remedies Act, and breach of contract, and seeks
    imposition of a constructive trust on monies received from the
    plaintiff class, as well as damages in an unspecified amount,
    disgorgement, restitution, interest and penalties. The court
    held a hearing on January 16, 2007, on plaintiffs’
    motion for class certification. On March 15, 2007, the
    court certified a class of all residents of the United States to
    whom Hotwire charged “taxes/fees” for the facilitation
    of reservations for stand-alone hotel rooms on its website. The
    court has not yet required that Hotwire provide notice to the
    potential class members. The trial on plaintiff’s
    Section 17200 claim that was set for the week of
    January 12, 2009, has been postponed and a new trial date
    has not been set.

    required by municipal ordinance. The complaint seeks a
    declaratory judgment regarding the county’s right to audit
    and collect tax on certain of the defendants’ hotel room

    against each of those online travel companies. The online travel
    companies have challenged those assessments through an
    administrative appeals process. Hearings on those challenges
    have not yet taken place. If the hearing examiner upholds the
    city’s assessments, the online travel companies intend to

    travel companies intend to challenge the city’s purported
    right to require us to pay the tax assessment prior to

    ordinance.

At various times, the Company has also received notices of
    audit, or tax assessments from municipalities and other taxing

    incremental traffic and transactions through our various media
    and advertising offerings on both the TripAdvisor Media Network
    and on our transaction-based websites. For additional
    information about our portfolio of brands, see the disclosure
    set forth in Part  I, Item 1, Business, under the
    caption “Management Overview.”

Trends

The travel industry, including offline agencies, online agencies
    and suppliers of travel products and services, has been
    characterized by intense competition, as well as rapid and
    significant change. In addition, beginning in September 2008,
    global economic and financial market conditions worsened
    markedly, creating



uncertainty for travelers and suppliers. This macroeconomic
    downturn pressured discretionary spending on travel and
    advertising, with weakness we previously identified in the
    United States and the United Kingdom markets increasing and
    spreading to all geographies. We cannot predict the magnitude or
    duration of the downturn, but our current limited visibility
    does not suggest any near-term improvement.

Airline
    Sector

The airline sector in particular has historically experienced
    significant turmoil. Most recently, U.S. airlines have
    responded to chronic overcapacity, financial losses and extreme
    volatility in oil prices by aggressively reducing their cost
    structures and seating capacities. In addition, many carriers
    have raised their per seat yields by increasing fares in the
    early part of 2008, assessing fuel surcharges and increasing the
    use of a la carte pricing for such items as baggage, food and
    beverage and preferred seating.

Reduced seating capacities are generally negative for Expedia as
    there is less air supply available on our websites, and in turn
    less opportunity to facilitate hotel rooms, car rental and other
    services on behalf of air travelers. Carriers have announced
    incremental capacity reductions in 2009, which will again
    pressure our inventories and impact our opportunity to sell
    other travel products.

Fare increases, fuel surcharges and other fees are generally
    negative for Expedia’s business, as they may negatively
    impact traveler demand with no corresponding increase in our
    remuneration as our air revenue is tied principally to ticket
    volumes, not prices. Fare increases were especially pronounced
    through the first three quarters of 2008, but have moderated
    more recently with slowing demand.

In addition to capacity and pricing actions, carriers have
    responded to industry conditions by aggressively reducing costs
    in every aspect of their operations, including distribution
    costs. Prior to 2008, airlines lowered (and in some cases,
    eliminated) travel agent commissions and overrides, and
    increased direct distribution through their proprietary
    websites. Carriers also reduced payments to GDS intermediaries,
    which have historically passed on a portion of these payments to
    large travel agents, including Expedia.

Primarily, as a result of these decreased costs of distribution
    and reduced access to excess air supply, our revenue per air
    ticket decreased more than 10% in each of 2005, 2006 and 2007.
    As a result of these pressures and the relative growth of our
    non-air business lines, air revenue constituted less than 15% of
    2008 global revenue. We saw greater stability in air revenue per
    ticket in 2008 due to our signing long-term agreements with nine
    of the top ten domestic carriers and three GDS providers in
    prior years, as well as an increase in booking fees for
    Expedia.com travelers. However, due to the weakening economy, we
    may encounter additional pressure on air remuneration as certain
    supply agreements renew in 2009 and beyond as well as potential
    pressure on air booking fees due to actions by some of our
    competitors and increased traveler sensitivity to fees in the
    current environment.

In addition to the above challenges, larger carriers
    participating in the Expedia marketplace have generally reduced
    their share of total air seat capacity, while leading low-cost
    carriers such as Southwest in the United States and EasyJet in
    Europe have increased their relative capacities, but have
    generally chosen not to participate in the Expedia marketplace.
    This trend has negatively impacted our ability to obtain supply
    in our air business, and increased the relative attractiveness
    of other online and offline sales channels.

Hotel
    Sector

In 2008, the hotel sector witnessed supply growth and slowing
    demand, resulting in declining occupancy rates. ADR growth,
    which had been robust in 2006 and 2007, slowed considerably
    throughout 2008, and by the end of the year had stopped growing
    entirely. Some key leisure travel markets for Expedia, such as
    Las Vegas and Hawaii, have seen dramatic

year-on-year

declines in ADRs. In addition, in early 2009 due primarily to
    continued declines in industry occupancy rates, we have
    continued to see a weakening in our ADRs.

While lower occupancies have historically increased our supply
    of merchant hotel rooms, and a lower rate of ADR growth can
    positively impact underlying room night growth, lower ADRs also
    decrease our revenue per room night as our remuneration varies
    proportionally with the room price. ADRs on Expedia’s
    worldwide sites grew 7% in 2007, but declined 1% in 2008,
    including a 10% decrease in the fourth quarter of



2008 compared to the same period in 2007. Our hotel remuneration
    is also impacted by our hotel margins, which declined in 2008
    due to adverse movements in foreign exchange rates, lower fees
    and more competitive hotel pricing.

Industry sources forecast lower occupancies and

year-on-year

declines in ADRs in 2009. These trends, combined with softer
    demand in a weakening economy and lower air capacity into our
    core leisure travel destinations, create a challenging backdrop
    for our hotel business, which has been a key source of revenue
    and profitability growth for Expedia.

Online
    Travel

Increased usage and familiarity with the internet have driven
    rapid growth in online penetration of travel expenditures.
    According to PhoCusWright, an independent travel, tourism and
    hospitality research firm, in 2008 approximately 58% of
    U.S. leisure, unmanaged and corporate travel expenditures
    occurred online, compared with approximately 33% of European
    travel. Online penetration in the Asia Pacific region is
    estimated to lag behind that of Europe. These penetration rates
    have increased over the past few years, and are expected to
    continue growing. This significant growth has attracted many
    competitors to online travel. This competition has intensified
    in recent years, and the industry is expected to remain highly
    competitive for the foreseeable future.

In addition to the growth of online travel agencies, airlines
    and lodging companies have aggressively pursued direct online
    distribution of their products and services, and supplier growth
    has outpaced online agency growth since 2002. As a result,
    according to PhoCusWright, by 2008 travel supplier sites
    accounted for 61% of total online travel spend in the United
    States. PhoCusWright forecasts that suppliers’ share of
    online travel has reached an inflection point, and will remain
    relatively constant in 2009 and 2010.

Differentiation among the various website offerings has narrowed
    dramatically in the past several years, and the travel landscape
    has grown extremely competitive, with the need for competitors
    to generally differentiate their offerings on features other
    than price. Newer competitive entrants such as “meta
    search” companies have in some cases been able to introduce
    differentiated features and content compared with the legacy
    online travel agency companies, although in most cases they are
    not providing actual travel booking services.

The online travel industry has also seen the development of
    alternative business models and timing of payment by travelers
    and to suppliers, which in some cases place pressure on
    historical business models. Intense competition has also led to
    aggressive marketing spend by the travel suppliers and
    intermediaries, and a meaningful reduction in our overall
    marketing efficiency and operating margins.

Strategy

We play a fundamental role in facilitating travel, whether for
    leisure, unmanaged business or managed business travelers. We
    are committed to providing travelers, travel suppliers and
    advertisers the world over with the best set of resources to
    serve their travel needs by leveraging Expedia’s critical
    assets — our brand portfolio, our technology and
    commitment to continuous innovation, our global reach and our
    breadth of product offering. In addition, we intelligently
    utilize our growing base of knowledge about destinations,
    activities, suppliers and travelers and our central position in
    the travel value chain to more effectively merchandise our
    travel offerings.

A discussion of the critical assets that we leverage in
    achieving our business strategy follows:

Portfolio of Travel Brands.

We seek to appeal
    to the broadest possible range of travelers, suppliers and
    advertisers through our collection of industry-leading brands.
    We target several different demographics, from the
    value-conscious traveler through our Hotwire brand to luxury
    travelers seeking a high-touch, customized vacation package
    through our Classic Vacations brand.

We believe our flagship Expedia brand appeals to the broadest
    range of travelers, with our extensive product offering ranging
    from single item bookings of discounted product to dynamic
    bundling of higher-end



travel packages. Our hotels.com site and its international
    versions target travelers with premium hotel content such as 360
    degree tours and hotel reviews. In the United States, hotels.com
    generally appeals to travelers with shorter booking windows who
    prefer to drive to their destinations, and who make a
    significant portion of their travel bookings over the telephone.

Through Egencia, we make travel products and services available
    on a managed basis to corporate travelers in North America,
    Europe and the Asia Pacific region. Further, our TripAdvisor
    Media Network allows us to reach a broad range of travelers with
    travel opinions and user-generated content.

We believe our appeal to suppliers and advertisers is further
    enhanced by our geographic breadth and range of business models,
    allowing them to offer their products and services to the
    industry’s broadest range of travelers using our various
    agency, merchant and advertising business models. We intend to
    continue supporting and investing in our brand portfolio,
    geographic footprint and business models for the benefit of our
    travelers, suppliers and advertisers.

Technology and Continuous Innovation.

Expedia
    has an established tradition of technology innovation, from
    Expedia.com’s inception as a division of Microsoft to our
    introduction of more recent innovations such as
    Expedia.com’s TravelAds sponsored search product for hotel
    advertisers, Hotwire’s Air Price Protection,
    hotels.com’s slider tools for improving search results,
    hotel.com’s iPod and iPhone applications and the
    TripAdvisor Media Network’s offering of travel applications
    for download on social media sites such as Facebook.com and
    MySpace.com.

We intend to continue innovating on behalf of our travelers,
    suppliers and advertisers with particular focus on improving the
    traveler experience, supplier integration and presentation,
    platform improvements, search engine marketing and search engine
    optimization.

Global Reach.

Our Expedia, hotels.com and
    TripAdvisor Media Network brands operate both in
    North America and internationally. We also offer Chinese
    travelers an array of products and services through our majority
    ownership in eLong, and we offer hotels to European-based
    travelers through our wholly-owned subsidiary Venere, which we
    acquired in the third quarter of 2008. In 2008, our European
    segment accounted for approximately 21% of worldwide gross
    bookings and 23% of worldwide revenue.

We intend to continue investing in and growing our international
    points of sale. We anticipate launching points of sale in
    additional countries where we find large travel markets and
    rapid growth of online commerce. Future launches may occur under
    any of our brands, or through acquisition of third party brands,
    as in the case of eLong and Venere.

Egencia, our corporate travel business, currently operates in
    Australia, Belgium, Canada, China, France, Germany, India,
    Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, Switzerland, the United
    Kingdom and the United States. We believe the corporate travel
    sector represents a large opportunity for Expedia, and we
    believe we offer a compelling technology solution to businesses
    seeking to optimize travel costs and improve their
    employees’ travel experiences. We intend to continue
    investing in and expanding the geographic footprint and
    technology infrastructure of Egencia.

In expanding our global reach, we leverage significant
    investments in technology, operations, brand building, supplier
    relationships and other initiatives that we have made since the
    launch of Expedia.com in 1996. We intend to continue leveraging
    this investment when launching additional points of sale in new
    countries, introducing new website features, adding supplier
    products and services, and offering proprietary and
    user-generated content for travelers.

Our scale of operations enhances the value of technology
    innovations we introduce on behalf of our travelers and
    suppliers. As an example, our traveler review
    feature — whereby our travelers have created millions
    of qualified reviews of hotel properties — is able to
    accumulate a larger base of reviews due to the higher base of
    online traffic that frequents our various websites. In addition,
    our increasing scale enhances our websites’ appeal to
    travel and non-travel advertisers.

Breadth of Product Offering.

We offer a
    comprehensive array of innovative travel products and services
    to our travelers. We plan to continue improving and growing
    these offerings, as well as expand them to our



worldwide points of sale over time. Travelers can interact with
    us how and when they prefer, including via our 24/7 1-800
    telesales service, which is an integral part of the
    Company’s appeal to travelers.

Over 60% of our revenue comes from transactions involving the
    booking of hotel reservations, with less than 15% of our
    worldwide revenue derived from the sale of airline tickets. We
    facilitate travel products and services either as stand-alone
    products or as part of package transactions. We have emphasized
    growing our merchant hotel and packages businesses as these
    result in higher revenue per transaction; however, through
    Venere we are working to grow our agency hotel business,
    particularly in Europe. We also seek to continue diversifying
    our revenue mix beyond core air and hotel products to car
    rental, destination services, cruise and other product
    offerings. We have been working toward and will continue to work
    toward increasing the mix of advertising and media revenue from
    both the expansion of our TripAdvisor Media Network, as well as
    increasing advertising revenue from our worldwide websites such
    as Expedia.com and hotels.com, which have historically been
    focused on transaction revenue. In 2008, advertising and media
    revenue accounted for nearly 10% of worldwide revenue.

Seasonality

We generally experience seasonal fluctuations in the demand for
    our travel products and services. For example, traditional
    leisure travel bookings are generally the highest in the first
    three quarters as travelers plan and book their spring, summer
    and holiday travel. The number of bookings typically decreases
    in the fourth quarter. Because revenue in the merchant business
    is generally recognized when the travel takes place rather than
    when it is booked, revenue typically lags bookings by several
    weeks or longer. As a result, revenue is typically the lowest in
    the first quarter and highest in the third quarter. The
    macroeconomic downturn in the latter part of 2008 also affected
    our general revenue seasonality trends in the fourth quarter of
    2008. In addition, the continued growth of our international
    operations or a change in our product mix may influence the
    typical trend of our seasonality in the future.

Critical
    Accounting Policies and Estimates

Critical accounting policies and estimates are those that we
    believe are important in the preparation of our consolidated
    financial statements because they require that we use judgment
    and estimates in applying those policies. We prepare our
    consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in
    accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the
    United States (“GAAP”). Preparation of the
    consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes
    requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the
    reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of
    contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the
    consolidated financial statements as well as revenue and
    expenses during the periods reported. We base our estimates on
    historical experience, where applicable, and other assumption
    that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Actual
    results may differ from our estimates under different
    assumptions or conditions.

There are certain critical estimates that we believe require
    significant judgment in the preparation of our consolidated
    financial statements. We consider an accounting estimate to be
    critical if:

•

It requires us to make an assumption because information was not
    available at the time or it included matters that were highly
    uncertain at the time we were making the estimate; and/or

•

Changes in the estimate or different estimates that we could
    have selected may have had a material impact on our financial
    condition or results of operations.

For more information on each of these policies, see
    Note 2 — Significant Accounting Policies, in the
    notes to consolidated financial statements. We discuss
    information about the nature and rationale for our critical
    accounting estimates below.

Accounting
    for Certain Merchant Revenue

We accrue the cost of certain merchant revenue based on the
    amount we expect to be billed by suppliers. In certain instances
    when a supplier invoices us for less than the cost we accrued,
    we generally recognize



those amounts as revenue six months in arrears, net of an
    allowance, when we determine it is not probable that we will be
    required to pay the supplier, based on historical experience and
    contract terms. Actual revenue could be greater or less than the
    amounts estimated due to changes in hotel billing practices or
    changes in traveler behavior.

Marketing
    Promotions

We periodically provide incentive offers to our customers to
    encourage booking of travel products and services, which include
    inducement offers. Inducement offers include discounts granted
    at the time of a current purchase to be applied against a future
    qualifying purchase. We treat inducement offers as a reduction
    to revenue based on estimated future redemption rates. We
    allocate the discount amount between the current purchase and
    the potential future purchase based on our expected relative
    value of the transactions. We estimate our redemption rates
    using our historical experience for similar inducement offers,
    and the amounts we record as a reduction to revenue on current
    purchases could vary significantly based on the redemption
    estimates used.

Recoverability
    of Goodwill and Indefinite and Definite-Lived Intangible
    Assets

Goodwill.

We assess goodwill for impairment
    annually as of October 1, or more frequently, if events and
    circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred. The
    impairment test requires us to estimate the fair value of our
    reporting units. If the carrying value of a reporting unit
    exceeds its fair value, the goodwill of that reporting unit is
    potentially impaired and we proceed to step two of the
    impairment analysis. In step two of the analysis, we will record
    an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying value of
    the reporting unit’s goodwill over its implied fair value
    should such a circumstance arise.

We generally base our measurement of fair value of reporting
    units on a blended analysis of the present value of future
    discounted cash flows and market valuation approach. The
    discounted cash flows model indicates the fair value of the
    reporting units based on the present value of the cash flows
    that we expect the reporting units to generate in the future.
    Our significant estimates in the discounted cash flows model
    include: our weighted average cost of capital; long-term rate of
    growth and profitability of our business; and working capital
    effects. The market valuation approach indicates the fair value
    of the business based on a comparison of the Company to
    comparable publicly traded firms in similar lines of business.
    Our significant estimates in the market approach model include
    identifying similar companies with comparable business factors
    such as size, growth, profitability, risk and return on
    investment and assessing comparable revenue and operating income
    multiples in estimating the fair value of the reporting units.

We believe the weighted use of discounted cash flows and market
    approach is the best method for determining the fair value of
    our reporting units because these are the most common valuation
    methodologies used within the travel and internet industries;
    and the blended use of both models compensates for the inherent
    risks associated with either model if used on a stand-alone
    basis.

In addition to measuring the fair value of our reporting units
    as described above, we consider the combined carrying and fair
    values of our reporting units in relation to the Company’s
    total fair value of equity plus debt as of the assessment date.
    Our equity value assumes our fully diluted market
    capitalization, using either the stock price on the valuation
    date or the average stock price over a range of dates around the
    valuation date, plus an estimated acquisition premium which is
    based on observable transactions of comparable companies. The
    debt value is based on the highest value expected to be paid to
    repurchase the debt, which can be fair value, principal or
    principal plus a premium depending on the terms of each debt
    instrument.

Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets.

We base
    our measurement of fair value of indefinite-lived intangible
    assets, which primarily consist of trade name and trademarks,
    using the relief-from-royalty method. This method assumes that
    the trade name and trademarks have value to the extent that
    their owner is relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for
    the benefits received from them. This method requires us to
    estimate the future revenue for the related brands, the
    appropriate royalty rate and the weighted average cost of
    capital.



Definite-Lived Intangible Assets.

We review
    the carrying value of long-lived assets or asset groups to be
    used in operations whenever events or changes in circumstances
    indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be
    recoverable. Factors that would necessitate an impairment
    assessment include a significant adverse change in the extent or
    manner in which an asset is used, a significant adverse change
    in legal factors or the business climate that could affect the
    value of the asset, or a significant decline in the observable
    market value of an asset, among others. If such facts indicate a
    potential impairment, we would assess the recoverability of an
    asset group by determining if the carrying value of the asset
    group exceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows
    expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the
    assets over the remaining economic life of the primary asset in
    the asset group. If the recoverability test indicates that the
    carrying value of the asset group is not recoverable, we will
    estimate the fair value of the asset group using appropriate
    valuation methodologies which would typically include an
    estimate of discounted cash flows. Any impairment would be
    measured as the difference between the asset groups carrying
    amount and its estimated fair value.

The use of different estimates or assumptions in determining the
    fair value of our goodwill, indefinite-lived and definite-lived
    intangible assets may result in different values for these
    assets, which could result in an impairment or, in period in
    which an impairment is recognized, could result in a materially
    different impairment charge. For additional information about
    our goodwill and intangible asset impairments recorded in 2008,
    see Note 5 — Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Net
    in the notes to consolidated financial statements.

Income
    Taxes

In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    (“SFAS”) No. 109,

Accounting for Income
    Taxes

, we record income taxes under the liability method.
    Deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect our estimation of
    the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the
    carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for book and tax
    purposes. We determine deferred income taxes based on the
    differences in accounting methods and timing between financial
    statement and income tax reporting. Accordingly, we determine
    the deferred tax asset or liability for each temporary
    difference based on the enacted tax rates expected to be in
    effect when we realize the underlying items of income and
    expense. We consider many factors when assessing the likelihood
    of future realization of our deferred tax assets, including our
    recent earnings experience by jurisdiction, expectations of
    future taxable income, and the carryforward periods available to
    us for tax reporting purposes, as well as other relevant
    factors. We may establish a valuation allowance to reduce
    deferred tax assets to the amount we believe is more likely than
    not to be realized. Due to inherent complexities arising from
    the nature of our businesses, future changes in income tax law,
    tax sharing agreements or variances between our actual and
    anticipated operating results, we make certain judgments and
    estimates. Therefore, actual income taxes could materially vary
    from these estimates.

We record liabilities to address uncertain tax positions we have
    taken in previously filed tax returns or that we expect to take
    in a future tax return. The determination for required
    liabilities is based upon an analysis of each individual tax
    position, taking into consideration whether it is more likely
    than not that our tax position, based on technical merits, will
    be sustained upon examination. For those positions for which we
    conclude it is more likely than not it will be sustained, we
    recognize the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than
    50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate
    settlement with the taxing authority. The difference between the
    amount recognized and the total tax position is recorded as a
    liability. The ultimate resolution of these tax positions may be
    greater or less than the liabilities recorded. We adopted
    Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 48
    (“FIN 48”),

Accounting for Uncertainty in
    Income Taxes — an interpretation of FASB Statement
    No. 109

, in the first quarter of 2007.

Other
    Long-Term Liabilities

Various Legal and Tax Contingencies.

We record
    liabilities to address potential exposures related to business
    and tax positions we have taken that have been or could be
    challenged by taxing authorities. In addition, we record
    liabilities associated with legal proceedings and lawsuits.
    These liabilities are recorded when the likelihood of payment is
    probable and the amounts can be reasonably estimated. The
    determination for required liabilities is based upon analysis of
    each individual tax issue, or legal proceeding, taking into



consideration the likelihood of adverse judgments and the range
    of possible loss. In addition, our analysis may be based on
    discussions with outside legal counsel. The ultimate resolution
    of these potential tax exposures and legal proceedings may be
    greater or less than the liabilities recorded.

Occupancy Tax.

Some states and localities
    impose a transient occupancy or accommodation tax, or a form of
    sales tax, on the use or occupancy of hotel accommodations.
    Generally, hotels charge taxes based on the room rate paid to
    the hotel and remit these taxes to the various tax authorities.
    When a customer books a room through one of our travel services,
    we collect a tax recovery charge from the customer which we pay
    to the hotel. We do not collect or remit occupancy taxes, nor do
    we pay occupancy taxes to the hotel operator on the portion of
    the customer payment we retain. Some jurisdictions have
    questioned our practice in this regard. While the applicable tax
    provisions vary among the jurisdictions, we generally believe
    that we are not required to collect and remit such occupancy
    taxes. We are engaged in discussions with tax authorities in
    various jurisdictions to resolve this issue. Some tax
    authorities have brought lawsuits or have levied assessments
    asserting that we are required to collect and remit occupancy
    tax. The ultimate resolution in all jurisdictions cannot be
    determined at this time. Certain jurisdictions may require us to
    pay tax assessments, including occupancy tax assessments, prior
    to contesting any such assessments.

We have established a reserve for the potential settlement of
    issues related to hotel occupancy taxes for prior and current
    periods, consistent with applicable accounting principles and in
    light of all current facts and circumstances. A variety of
    factors could affect the amount of the liability (both past and
    future), which factors include, but are not limited to, the
    number of, and amount of revenue represented by, jurisdictions
    that ultimately assert a claim and prevail in assessing such
    additional tax or negotiate a settlement and changes in relevant
    statutes.

We note that there are more than 7,000 taxing jurisdictions in
    the United States, and it is not feasible to analyze the
    statutes, regulations and judicial and administrative rulings in
    every jurisdiction. Rather, we have obtained the advice of state
    and local tax experts with respect to tax laws of certain states
    and local jurisdictions that represent a large portion of our
    hotel revenue. Many of the fundamental statutes and regulations
    that impose these taxes were established before the growth of
    the internet and

e-commerce.

It is possible that some jurisdictions may introduce new
    legislation regarding the imposition of occupancy taxes on
    businesses that arrange the booking of hotel accommodations. We
    continue to work with the relevant tax authorities and
    legislators to clarify our obligations under new and emerging
    laws and regulations. We will continue to monitor the issue
    closely and provide additional disclosure, as well as adjust the
    level of reserves, as developments warrant. Additionally,
    certain of our businesses are involved in occupancy tax related
    litigation which is discussed in Part I, Item 3, Legal
    Proceedings.

Stock-Based
    Compensation

We record stock-based compensation expense net of estimated
    forfeitures. In determining the estimated forfeiture rates for
    stock-based awards, we periodically conduct an assessment of the
    actual number of equity awards that have been forfeited to date
    as well as those expected to be forfeited in the future. We
    consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures,
    including the type of award, the employee class and historical
    experience. The estimate of stock awards that will ultimately be
    forfeited requires significant judgment and to the extent that
    actual results or updated estimates differ from our current
    estimates, such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative
    adjustment in the period such estimates are revised.

New
    Accounting Pronouncements

For a discussion of new accounting pronouncements, see
    Note 2 — Significant Accounting Policies in the
    notes to consolidated financial statements.

Segments

We have two reportable segments: North America and Europe. We
    determined our segments based on how our chief operating
    decision makers manage our business, make operating decisions
    and evaluate operating performance.



Our North America segment provides a full range of travel

and/or

advertising services to customers primarily located in the
    United States, Canada and Mexico. This segment operates through
    a variety of brands including Classic Vacations, Expedia.com,
    hotels.com, Hotwire.com and the TripAdvisor Media Network.

Our Europe segment provides travel services primarily through
    localized Expedia websites in Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France,
    Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden
    and the United Kingdom, as well as localized versions of
    hotels.com in various European countries. In addition, Venere is
    included within our Europe segment from its acquisition date in
    the third quarter of 2008 forward.

Corporate and Other includes Egencia, Expedia Asia Pacific and
    unallocated corporate functions and expenses. Egencia provides
    travel products and services to corporate customers in North
    America, Europe and the Asia Pacific region. Expedia Asia
    Pacific provides online travel information and reservation
    services primarily through eLong in China, localized Expedia
    websites in Australia, India, Japan and New Zealand, as well as
    localized versions of hotels.com in various Asian countries.

We are in the process of reorganizing our business around our
    global brands. Our chief operating decision makers are assessing
    our new structure to determine how we will manage our business
    and report our financial results. Beginning in the first quarter
    of 2009, we expect our reportable segments to change as we will
    no longer manage the business on a geographical basis.

Operating
    Metrics

Our operating results are affected by certain metrics, such as
    gross bookings and revenue margin, which we believe are
    necessary for understanding and evaluating Expedia. Gross
    bookings represent the total retail value of transactions booked
    for both agency and merchant transactions, recorded at the time
    of booking reflecting the total price due for travel by
    travelers, including taxes, fees and other charges, and are
    generally reduced for cancellations and refunds. As travelers
    have increased their use of the internet to book travel
    arrangements, we have seen our gross bookings increase,
    reflecting the growth in the online travel industry and our
    business acquisitions. Revenue margin is defined as revenue as a
    percentage of gross bookings.

Reclassifications

We restated our Europe segment and total gross bookings for 2007
    and 2006 to conform to our current period presentation. The
    restatement had no impact on revenue.

The year-over-year increases in worldwide gross bookings in 2008
    and 2007 were primarily due to increases in transaction volumes
    and travel product prices.



The increase in worldwide and North America revenue margin in
    2008 as compared to 2007 was primarily due to an increased mix
    of advertising and media revenue. The decrease in Europe revenue
    margin in 2008 as compared to 2007 was primarily due to the
    impact of foreign exchange.

The increase in worldwide and North America revenue margin in
    2007 as compared to 2006 was primarily due to an increased mix
    of advertising and media revenue, partially offset by a decline
    in revenue per air ticket. The decrease in Europe revenue margin
    in 2007 as compared to 2006 was primarily due to lower air
    commissions and booking fees as well as lower revenue resulting
    from more competitive hotel pricing.

In 2008, the increase in revenue was primarily due to increases
    in worldwide hotel revenue and advertising and media revenue.

Worldwide hotel revenue (including both merchant and agency)
    increased 6% in 2008 compared to 2007. The increase was
    primarily due to a 13% increase in room nights stayed, including
    rooms delivered as a component of vacation packages, partially
    offset by an 6% decrease in revenue per room night. Revenue per
    room night decreased due to changes in foreign exchange rates
    and a 1% decrease in worldwide ADRs.

Worldwide air revenue increased 2% in 2008 compared to 2007 due
    to a 2% increase in revenue per air ticket. Tickets sold were
    flat for the year as an 8% growth in the first half of the year
    was offset by an 8% decline in the second half of the year due
    to lower passenger volumes as a result of carrier capacity cuts
    and softer consumer demand.

Our remaining worldwide revenue other than hotel and air revenue
    discussed above, which includes advertising and media, car
    rental, destination services and cruise, increased by 29% in
    2008 compared to 2007 primarily due to increases in our
    advertising and media revenue and car rental revenue.
    Advertising and media revenue increased 55% in 2008, accounting
    for nearly 10% of worldwide revenue.

Package revenue declined 4% in 2008 compared to the prior year
    primarily due to foreign exchange and lower worldwide volumes.

In 2007, the increase in revenue was primarily due to increases
    in worldwide hotel revenue and, to a lesser extent, advertising
    and media revenue.

Worldwide hotel revenue increased 19% in 2007 compared to 2006.
    The increase was primarily due to a 11% increase in room nights
    stayed, including rooms delivered as a component of vacation
    packages, as well as a 7% increase in revenue per room night.
    Revenue per room night increased due to a 7% increase in
    worldwide ADRs partially offset by a decline in hotel margin.

Worldwide air revenue decreased 2% in 2007 compared to 2006 due
    to a 12% decrease in revenue per air ticket partially offset by
    an increase of 12% in air tickets sold. The decrease in revenue
    per air ticket primarily reflects decreased compensation from
    air carriers and GDS providers, and to a lesser extent, reduced
    air service fees versus the prior year period.



Our remaining worldwide revenue other than hotel and air revenue
    discussed above increased by 43% in 2007 compared to 2006
    primarily due to an increase in advertising and media revenue as
    well as car rental revenues.

Package revenue grew 7% in 2007 compared to the prior year
    primarily due to higher European package bookings.

Cost of revenue primarily consists of (1) costs of our data
    and call centers, including telesales, (2) credit card
    expenses, including merchant fees, charge backs and fraud,
    (3) fees paid to fulfillment vendors for processing airline
    tickets and related customer services and (4) costs paid to
    suppliers for certain destination supply.

The year-over-year increases in cost of revenue were primarily
    due to higher costs associated with an increase in transaction
    volumes.

The year-over-year increases in gross profit were primarily due
    to increased revenue. In 2008, the increase in revenue was
    partially offset by a 51 basis point decrease in gross
    margin primarily due to cost increases including our summer gas
    card promotion and costs associated with our data center and
    other projects. Gross margin increased in 2007 as compared to
    2006 primarily due to an increased mix of advertising and media
    revenue as well as cost savings from our various efficiency
    initiatives.

    Expedia Local Expert and stock-based compensation costs.

In 2008 and 2007, the increase in selling and marketing was
    primarily due to increased direct online search spend across our
    worldwide points of sale, as well as higher personnel costs. In
    addition, during 2007 brand spend across our worldwide points of
    sale also increased.

General and administrative expense consists primarily of

    leadership, finance, legal, tax, technology and human resource
    functions as well as fees for external professional services
    including legal, tax and accounting.

In 2008, the increase in general and administrative expense was
    primarily due to the overall growth of our businesses, including
    personnel and other costs related to our information technology
    functions as well as costs related to our European businesses
    and the TripAdvisor Media Network.

In 2007, the increase in general and administrative expense was
    primarily due to higher personnel costs related to expansion of
    our corporate information technology functions, our European
    businesses and the TripAdvisor Media Network as well as higher
    incentive compensation expense, higher legal expenses and higher
    payroll taxes related to stock option exercises.

Technology and content expense consists of expenses for

    product development expenses such as personnel-related costs,
    including stock-based compensation.

The year-over-year expense increase in 2008 was due to increased
    personnel-related expenses primarily in our higher growth
    businesses, including the TripAdvisor Media Network, as well as
    an increase in the amortization of software development costs.

The year-over-year expense increase in 2007 was primarily due to
    growth in personnel-related expenses in our software development
    and engineering teams as we continued to increase our level of
    website innovation and increased amortization of capitalized
    software development costs. For additional information about our
    policy related to capitalized software costs, see Note 2

In 2008 and 2007, amortization of intangible assets expense
    decreased compared to 2007 and 2006 primarily due to the
    completion of amortization related to certain technology and
    supplier intangible assets, partially offset by amortization
    related to new business acquisitions. For additional information
    about our acquisitions, see Note 3 — Acquisitions
    and Other Investments in the notes to consolidated financial
    statements.

Impairment
    of Goodwill, Intangible and Other Long-lived
    Assets

In 2008, we recorded impairments of approximately
    $3 billion of long-term assets, which consisted of
    $2.8 billion of goodwill, $223 million of intangible
    assets and $11 million related to capitalized software.
    Impaired intangible assets consisted of certain of our
    indefinite-lived trade names. In 2006, we recognized an
    impairment charge of $47 million in relation to
    Hotwire’s indefinite-lived trade name intangible asset. For
    additional information about our impairments, see
    Note 5— Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Net in
    the notes to consolidated financial statements.



As a result of continued adverse conditions in the markets in
    which we operate, we will continue to monitor goodwill and
    long-lived intangible assets, as well as long-lived tangible
    assets, for possible future impairment. We cannot assure that
    these assets will not be further impaired in future periods.

Amortization
    of Non-Cash Distribution and Marketing

Amortization of non-cash distribution and marketing expense
    consisted mainly of advertising from Universal Television
    contributed to us by IAC at Spin-Off with an original value of
    $17 million. We used this advertising without any cash
    cost, and during 2006 had fully utilized all media time.

In 2008, the recording of a significant operating loss and the

In 2007, the increase in operating income was primarily due to
    an increase in gross profit, the impairment charge of
    $47 million in 2006 and a decrease in amortization of
    intangibles and amortization of non-cash distribution and

In 2008, the increase in OIBA was primarily due to higher

    sales and marketing expense and technology and content expense
    as a percentage of revenue during 2008.

In 2007, the increase in OIBA was primarily due to an increase
    in gross profit, partially offset by growth in sales and
    marketing expenses and technology and content expenses. OIBA as
    a percentage of revenue decreased primarily due to growth in
    sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue,
    partially offset by an increase in gross margin.

Definition
    of OIBA

We provide OIBA as a supplemental measure to GAAP operating
    income (loss) and net income (loss). We define OIBA as operating
    income (loss) plus: (1) stock-based compensation expense,
    (3) amortization of intangible assets and goodwill and
    intangible asset impairment, if applicable,
    (4) amortization of non-cash distribution and marketing
    expense and (4) certain one-time items, if applicable.

OIBA is the primary operating metric used by which management
    evaluates the performance of our business, on which internal
    budgets are based, and by which management is compensated.
    Management believes that investors should have access to the
    same set of tools that management uses to analyze our results.
    This non-GAAP measure should be considered in addition to
    results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be
    considered a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP. We endeavor
    to compensate for the limitation of the non-GAAP measure
    presented by also providing the comparable GAAP measure, GAAP
    financial



statements, and descriptions of the reconciling items and
    adjustments, to derive the non-GAAP measure. We present a
    reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial measure to GAAP below.

OIBA represents the combined operating results of Expedia,
    Inc.’s businesses, taking into account depreciation of
    property and equipment (including internal-use software and
    website development), which we believe is an ongoing cost of
    doing business, but excluding the effects of other non-cash
    expenses that may not be indicative of our core business
    operations. We believe this performance measure is useful to
    investors for the following reasons:

•

It corresponds more closely to the cash operating income
    generated from our core operations by excluding significant
    non-cash operating expenses, such as stock-based
    compensation; and

•

It provides greater insight into management decision making at
    Expedia, as OIBA is our primary internal metric for evaluating
    the performance of our business.

OIBA has certain limitations in that it does not take into
    account the impact of certain expenses to our consolidated
    statements of operations, including stock-based compensation,
    non-cash payments to partners, acquisition-related accounting
    and certain one-time items, if applicable.

Interest income decreased in 2008 compared to 2007 primarily due
    to lower average interest rates. The year-over-year increase in
    2007 was primarily due to higher average cash and cash
    equivalent balances.

Interest expense increased in 2008 as compared to 2007 due to
    higher average debt balances primarily resulting from the
    $400 million senior unsecured notes issued in June 2008. In
    2007, interest expense increased as compared to 2006 due to
    interest expense related to the $500 million senior
    unsecured notes



issuance in August 2006 and a $500 million draw on our
    revolving credit facility in August 2007 to fund a portion of
    the tender offer completed in the third quarter of 2007. At
    December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, our long-term
    indebtedness totaled $1.545 billion, $1.085 billion

In 2008, our effective tax rate differed from the 35% statutory
    rate and the 2007 effective rate due to the impairment of
    goodwill, of which a substantial portion was not deductible for
    income tax purposes. Absent the impairment of goodwill and
    intangible assets, our 2008 effective tax rate would have been
    41.5%, which was higher than the 35% statutory rate primarily
    due to state income taxes and accruals related to uncertain tax
    positions and higher than our 2007 rate primarily due to higher
    accruals related to uncertain tax positions.

In 2007, our effective tax rate was higher than the 35%
    statutory rate primarily due to state income taxes, taxes
    related to our foreign operations and non-deductible losses
    related to our derivative liabilities. The 2007 effective rate
    increased as compared to 2006 primarily due to higher state
    taxes, including increases to state tax rates, and
    non-deductible losses related to our derivative liabilities
    compared with a gain in 2006.

In 2006, our effective tax rate was higher than the 35%
    statutory rate primarily due to state income taxes and valuation
    allowance on certain foreign losses, partially offset by
    non-taxable gains related to our derivative liabilities.

    Position, Liquidity and Capital Resources

Our principal sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from
    operations; our cash and cash equivalents and short-term
    investment balances which were $758 million and
    $617 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, which
    included $140 million and $158 million of cash and
    short-term investments at eLong, whose results are consolidated
    into our financial statements due to our controlling voting and
    economic ownership position; and our $1 billion revolving
    credit facility, of which $292 million was available as of
    December 31, 2008. This represents the total
    $1 billion facility less $650 million of outstanding
    borrowings and $58 million



of outstanding stand-by letters of credit (“LOC”). We
    intend to repay $550 million of the outstanding borrowings
    by February 20, 2009.

On February 18, 2009, we amended our credit facility to
    replace our tangible net worth covenant with a minimum interest
    coverage covenant, among other changes. As part of this
    amendment our leverage ratio was tightened, pricing on our
    borrowings increased by 200 basis points and we paid
    approximately $6 million in fees, which will be amortized
    over the remaining term of the credit facility. Outstanding
    credit facility borrowings bear interest reflecting our
    financial leverage. Based on our December 31, 2008
    financial statements and the new amendment, the interest rate
    would equate to a base rate plus 287.5 basis points. At our
    discretion, we may choose a base rate equal to (1) the
    greater of the Prime rate or the Federal Funds Rate plus
    50 basis points or LIBOR plus 100 basis points or
    (2) various durations of LIBOR.

Under the merchant model, we receive cash from travelers at the
    time of booking and we record these amounts on our consolidated
    balance sheets as deferred merchant bookings. We pay our airline
    suppliers related to these merchant model bookings generally
    within two weeks after completing the transaction, but we are
    liable for the full value of such transactions until the flights
    are completed. For most other merchant bookings, which is
    primarily our merchant hotel business, we pay after the
    travelers’ use and subsequent billing from the hotel
    suppliers. Therefore, generally we receive cash from the
    traveler prior to paying our supplier, and this operating cycle
    represents a working capital source of cash to us. As long as
    the merchant hotel business grows, we expect that changes in
    working capital will positively impact operating cash flows.
    However, due to various factors, including decelerating bookings
    growth, growth in other business models that lack the same
    working capital benefits as the merchant model, and technology
    and process initiatives which have resulted in quicker payments
    to hotel suppliers, we have experienced a reduction in our
    working capital impacts to cash flows in 2008 compared to 2007.

Seasonal fluctuations in our merchant hotel bookings affect the
    timing of our annual cash flows. During the first half of the
    year, hotel bookings have traditionally exceeded stays,
    resulting in much higher cash flow related to working capital.
    During the second half of the year, this pattern reverses and
    cash flows are typically negative. While we expect the impact of
    seasonal fluctuations to continue, merchant hotel growth rates
    or changes to the model or booking patterns as discussed above
    may affect working capital, which might counteract or intensify
    the anticipated seasonal fluctuations.

As of December 31, 2008, we had a deficit in our working
    capital of $367 million, compared to a deficit of
    $729 million as of December 31, 2007.

We continue to invest in the development and expansion of our
    operations. Ongoing investments include but are not limited to
    improvements to infrastructure, which include our servers,
    networking equipment and software, release improvements to our
    software code and search engine optimization efforts. In
    addition, we relocated many of our global offices, including our
    corporate headquarters, to larger facilities in 2008 to
    accommodate the growth of our business. These moves resulted in
    significant investments to improve the new facilities. Our
    future capital requirements may include capital needs for
    acquisitions or expenditures in support of our business
    strategy. In the event we have acquisitions, this may reduce our
    cash balance

and/or

increase our debt.

Our cash flows are as follows:

In 2008, net cash provided by operating activities decreased by
    $191 million primarily due to a decrease in changes in
    operating assets and liabilities, including an increase in tax
    payments and faster invoice and payment processing for our hotel
    suppliers in the current period. In 2007, net cash provided by
    operating activities increased by $95 million primarily due
    to an increase in changes in operating assets and liabilities
    and an increase in cash flows from operating income, partially
    offset by an increase in interest payments.

In 2008, cash used in investing activities increased by
    $680 million primarily due to a $479 million increase
    in cash paid for acquisitions, including $93 million as a
    contingent payment for the financial performance of a company we
    acquired during 2007, as well as the purchase of short-term
    investments of $93 million by eLong and an increase in
    capital expenditures of $73 million. In 2007, cash used in
    investing activities increased by $66 million primarily due
    to a $27 million increase in cash paid for acquisitions and
    a $32 million increase in long-term investments and
    deposits mainly related to our 50% investment in a travel
    company. These increases were offset by a decrease of
    $6 million in capital expenditures.

In February 2008, eLong announced approval by its board of
    directors of a share repurchase program of up to
    $20 million. Executed purchases are classified as
    acquisitions in the investing section of our statements of cash
    flows. As of November 25, 2008, eLong had executed
    approximately $14 million in purchases under the repurchase
    program.

Cash provided by financing activities in 2008 primarily included
    $457 million of net borrowings of debt.

Cash used in financing activities in 2007 primarily included
    cash paid to acquire shares in the first and third quarter
    tender offers pursuant to which we acquired 30 million
    tendered shares of our common stock at a purchase price of
    $22.00 per share and 25 million tendered shares of our
    common stock at $29.00 per share, for a total cost of
    $1.385 billion plus fees and expenses relating to the
    tender offers. In addition, we paid withholding taxes for stock
    option exercises of $121 million on behalf of our Chairman
    and Senior Executive in exchange for surrendering a portion of
    his vested shares which were concurrently cancelled. These were
    offset in part by $585 million in net borrowings on the
    revolving credit facility used primarily to fund a portion of
    the third quarter tender offer, $55 million in proceeds
    from stock option exercises and $96 million in excess tax
    benefits on equity awards, of which approximately
    $92 million related to the excess tax benefit associated
    with the stock options exercised by our Chairman and Senior
    Executive.

Cash provided by financing activities in 2006 was primarily due
    to the net proceeds of $495 million from our senior notes
    issuance in 2006 and $35 million in proceeds from stock
    option exercises, partially offset by $296 million of
    treasury stock activity primarily related to cash paid to
    acquire shares in the second and third quarters pursuant to
    which we acquired in open market trades 20 million shares
    of our common stock at an average per share price of $14.42 for
    a total cost of $288 million and the $230 million
    repayment of our revolving credit facility, which was initially
    borrowed in 2005.

In June 2008, we privately placed $400 million of
    8.5% senior unsecured notes due in July 2016 (the
    “8.5% Notes”). The 8.5% Notes were issued at
    98.572% of par resulting in a discount, which is being amortized
    over their life. Interest is payable semi-annually in January
    and July of each year, beginning January 1, 2009. We used
    the proceeds, net of the discount and issuance costs paid to
    date, of $392 million to repay the then outstanding
    borrowings under our credit facility of $330 million with
    the remaining cash was used for general corporate purposes.

In August 2006, we issued $500 million of
    7.456% senior unsecured notes due in August 2018 (the
    “7.456% Notes”) for net proceeds of
    $495 million. Interest is payable semi-annually in February
    and August of each year, which began in February 2007. The
    7.456% Notes are repayable in whole or in part on
    August 15, 2013, at the option of the Note holders, and are
    redeemable in whole or in part at any time at our option.

The effect of foreign exchange on our cash balances denominated
    in foreign currency in 2008 showed a net decrease of
    $99 million primarily due to a sharp depreciation in
    foreign currencies during the second half of 2008 compared with
    appreciating foreign currencies throughout 2007, and included a
    $21 million loss related to euro cash holdings during the
    third quarter of 2008 to economically hedge the purchase price
    of an acquisition. The effect of foreign exchange on our cash
    balances denominated in foreign currency in 2007



showed a net decrease of $21 million. Our foreign currency
    cash balances in 2007 benefited from foreign currency
    appreciation, but to a lesser extent than 2006 due to a
    different mix of currencies held and relatively less
    appreciation in certain of the primary foreign currencies in
    which we transacted.

We currently have authorization, for which there is no fixed
    termination date, from our Board of Directors to repurchase up
    to 20 million outstanding shares of our common stock; no
    such repurchases have been made under this authorization. The
    amount of repurchase we may make under this authorization are
    subject to certain of our debt covenants.

In connection with various occupancy tax audits and assessments,
    certain jurisdictions require that tax payers pay any assessed
    taxes prior to being allowed to contest or litigate the
    applicability of the ordinances, which is referred to as
    “pay to play.” We have been assessed approximately
    $8.2 million in taxes, plus $9.5 million in penalties
    and interest by the city of Anaheim, which has a “pay to
    play” tax ordinance. To preserve our right to contest this
    assessment, it is possible that we may be required to make a
    payment to Anaheim, as well as to other California jurisdictions
    that make similar assessments. We are challenging the
    city’s purported right to require us to pay the tax
    assessment prior to commencing litigation. Other jurisdictions
    may also attempt to require that we pay any assessed taxes prior
    to being allowed to contest or litigate the applicability of
    similar tax ordinances. Payment of these amounts is not an
    admission that we believe we are subject to such taxes and we
    intend to continue defending our position vigorously.

We also have a shelf registration statement filed with the SEC
    under which Expedia, Inc. may offer from time to time debt
    securities, guarantees of debt securities, preferred stock,
    common stock or warrants. The shelf registration statement
    expires on October 15, 2010.

In our opinion, available cash, funds from operations and
    available borrowings will provide sufficient capital resources
    to meet our foreseeable liquidity needs. Our liquidity has not
    been materially impacted by the current credit environment.
    There can be no assurance, however, that the cost or
    availability of future borrowings, including refinancings, if
    any, will not be impacted by the ongoing capital market
    disruptions.

Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Market
    Risk Management

Market risk is the potential loss from adverse changes in
    interest rates, foreign exchange rates and market prices. Our
    exposure to market risk includes our long-term debt, our
    revolving credit facility, derivative instruments and cash and
    cash equivalents, accounts receivable, intercompany receivables,
    merchant accounts payable and deferred merchant bookings
    denominated in foreign currencies. We manage our exposure to
    these risks through established policies and procedures. Our
    objective is to mitigate potential income statement, cash flow
    and market exposures from changes in interest and foreign
    exchange rates.

Interest
    Rate Risk

In June 2008, we issued $400 million senior unsecured notes
    with a fixed rate of 8.5%. In August 2006, we issued
    $500 million senior unsecured notes with a fixed rate of
    7.456%. As a result, if market interest rates decline, our
    required payments will exceed those based on market rates. The
    fair values of our 8.5% Notes and our 7.456% Notes
    were approximately $280 million and $365 million as of
    December 31, 2008 as calculated based on quoted market
    prices at year end. A 50 basis point increase or decrease
    in interest rates would decrease or increase the fair value of
    our 8.5% Notes by approximately $7 million and our
    7.456% Notes by approximately $6 million.

In July 2005, we entered into a $1 billion revolving credit
    facility. The revolving credit facility bears interest based on
    market interest rates plus a spread, which is determined based
    on our financial leverage. The weighted average interest rate
    was 1.34% as of December 31, 2008. Because our interest
    rate is tied to a market rate, we will be susceptible to
    fluctuations in interest rates if, consistent with our practice
    to date, we do not hedge the interest rate exposure arising from
    any borrowings under our revolving credit facility. As of
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, our outstanding borrowing under
    the revolving credit facility were $650 million and
    $585 million. A hypothetical 10% increase in market rates
    would increase our interest expense by less than $1 million.



We did not experience any significant impact from changes in
    interest rates for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007
    or 2006.

Foreign
    Exchange Risk

We conduct business in certain international markets, primarily
    in Australia, Canada, China and the European Union. Because we
    operate in international markets, we have exposure to different
    economic climates, political arenas, tax systems and regulations
    that could affect foreign exchange rates. Our primary exposure
    to foreign currency risk relates to transacting in foreign
    currency and recording the activity in U.S. dollars.
    Changes in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and these
    other currencies will result in transaction gains or losses,
    which we recognize in our consolidated statements of operations.

To the extent practicable, we minimize our foreign currency
    exposures by maintaining natural hedges between our current
    assets and current liabilities in similarly denominated foreign
    currencies. Additionally, during the third and fourth quarter of
    2008, we began using foreign currency forward contracts to
    economically hedge certain merchant revenue exposures and in
    lieu of holding certain foreign currency cash for the purpose of
    economically hedging our foreign currency-denominated merchant
    accounts payable and deferred merchant bookings balances. These
    instruments are typically short-term and are recorded at fair
    value with gains and losses recorded in Other, net. As of
    December 31, 2008, we had a net forward liability of
    $1 million recorded in accrued expenses and other current
    liabilities. We may enter into additional foreign exchange
    derivative contracts or other economic hedges in the future. Our
    goal in managing our foreign exchange risk is to reduce to the
    extent practicable our potential exposure to the changes that
    exchange rates might have on our earnings, cash flows and
    financial position. We make a number of estimates in conducting
    hedging activities including in some cases the level of future
    bookings, cancellations, refunds and payments in foreign
    currencies. In the event those estimates differ significantly
    from actual results, we could experience greater volatility as a
    result of our hedges.

Future net transaction gains and losses are inherently difficult
    to predict as they are reliant on how the multiple currencies in
    which we transact fluctuate in relation to the U.S. dollar,
    the relative composition and denomination of current assets and
    liabilities each period, and our effectiveness at forecasting
    and managing, through balance sheet netting or the use of
    derivative contracts, such exposures. As an example, if the
    foreign currencies in which we hold net asset balances were to
    all weaken 10% against the U.S. dollar and foreign
    currencies in which we hold net liability balances were to all
    strengthen 10% against the U.S. dollar, we would recognize
    foreign exchange losses of approximately $8 million based
    on our foreign currency forward positions and the net asset or
    liability balances of our foreign denominated cash and cash
    equivalents, accounts receivable, deferred merchant bookings and
    merchant accounts payable balances as of December 31, 2008.
    As the net composition of these balances fluctuate frequently,
    even daily, as do foreign exchange rates, the example loss could
    be compounded or reduced significantly within a given period.

During 2008, 2007 and 2006 we recorded net foreign exchange rate
    gains (losses) of $(47) million, $(22) million, and
    $10 million. As we increase our operations in international
    markets, our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency
    exchange rates increases. The economic impact to us of foreign
    currency exchange rate movements is linked to variability in
    real growth, inflation, interest rates, governmental actions and
    other factors. These changes, if material, could cause us to
    adjust our financing and operating strategies.

Controls
    and Procedures

Changes
    in Internal Control over Financial Reporting.

There were no changes to our internal control over financial
    reporting that occurred during the quarter ended
    December 31, 2008 that have materially affected, or are
    reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control
    over financial reporting.

Evaluation
    of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.

As required by

Rule 13a-15(b)

under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
    “Exchange Act”), our management, including our
    Chairman and Senior Executive, Chief Executive Officer and Chief
    Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and
    operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined
    in

Rule 13a-15(e)

under the Exchange Act). Based upon that evaluation, our
    Chairman and Senior Executive, Chief Executive Officer and Chief
    Financial Officer concluded that, as of the end of the period
    covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures
    were effective.

Management’s
    Report on Internal Control over Financial
    Reporting.

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
    adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined
    in

Rule 13a-15(f)

of the Exchange Act. Internal control over financial reporting
    is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of our financial reporting for external purposes in
    accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
    United States of America. Management conducted an evaluation of
    the effectiveness of our internal control over financial
    reporting based on the criteria for effective control over
    financial reporting described in

Internal Control —
    Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this
    evaluation, management has concluded that, as of
    December 31, 2008, the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting was effective. Management has reviewed its
    assessment with the Audit Committee. Ernst & Young,
    LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has
    audited the effectiveness of our internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2008, as stated in their
    report which is included below.

Limitations
    on Controls.

Management does not expect that our disclosure controls and
    procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will
    prevent or detect all error and fraud. Any control system, no
    matter how well designed and operated, is based upon certain
    assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute,
    assurance that its objectives will be met. Further, no
    evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that
    misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all
    control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the
    Company have been detected.



Report
    of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Expedia, Inc.

We have audited Expedia, Inc.’s internal control over
    financial reporting as of December 31, 2008, based on
    criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
    the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Expedia,
    Inc.’s management is responsible for maintaining effective
    internal control over financial reporting, and for its
    assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
    financial reporting included in the accompanying
    Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial
    Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting based
    on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
    that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the
    design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
    the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we
    considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
    audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Expedia, Inc. maintained, in all material
    respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as
    of December 31, 2008, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    2008 consolidated financial statements of Expedia, Inc. and our
    report dated February 18, 2009 expressed an unqualified
    opinion thereon.

Report of
    Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Expedia, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    Expedia, Inc. as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, and the
    related consolidated statements of operations, consolidated
    statements of changes in stockholders’ equity and
    comprehensive income (loss), and consolidated statements of cash
    flows for each of the three years in the period ended
    December 31, 2008. These financial statements are the
    responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
    responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
    statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
    present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
    financial position of Expedia, Inc. at December 31, 2008
    and 2007, and the consolidated results of its operations and its
    cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
    December 31, 2008, in conformity with U.S. generally
    accepted accounting principles.

As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial
    statements, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards
    Board (“FASB”) Interpretation No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes — an
    interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109

, effective
    January 1, 2007.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States),
    Expedia, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting
    as of December 31, 2008, based on criteria established in
    Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
    and our report dated February 18, 2009 expressed an
    unqualified opinion thereon.

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements

NOTE 1 —

Organization
    and Basis of Presentation

Description
    of Business

Expedia, Inc. and its subsidiaries provide travel products and
    services to leisure and corporate travelers in the United States
    and abroad. These travel products and services are offered
    through a diversified portfolio of brands including:
    Expedia.com

®

,

    hotels.com

®

,

    Hotwire.com

tm

,

    the
    TripAdvisor

®

Media Network, our private label programs (Worldwide Travel
    Exchange and Interactive Affiliate Network), Classic Vacations,
    Expedia Local Expert,
    Egencia

tm

(formerly
    Expedia

®

Corporate Travel),
    eLong

tm

,

    Inc. (“eLong”) and Venere Net SpA
    (“Venere”). In addition, many of these brands have
    related international points of sale. We refer to Expedia, Inc.
    and its subsidiaries collectively as “Expedia,” the
    “Company,” “us,” “we” and
    “our” in these consolidated financial statements.

Spin-Off
    from IAC/InterActiveCorp

On December 21, 2004, IAC/InterActiveCorp (“IAC”)
    announced its plan to separate into two independent public
    companies. We refer to this transaction as the
    “Spin-Off.” A new company, Expedia, Inc., was
    incorporated under Delaware law in April 2005, to hold
    substantially all of IAC’s travel and travel-related
    businesses. On August 9, 2005, the Spin-Off from IAC was
    completed and Expedia, Inc. shares began trading on The Nasdaq
    Global Select Market (“NASDAQ”) under the symbol
    “EXPE.”

Basis
    of Presentation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include
    Expedia, Inc., our wholly-owned subsidiaries, and entities we
    control, or in which we have a variable interest and are the
    primary beneficiary of expected cash profits or losses. We
    record our investments in entities that we do not control, but
    over which we have the ability to exercise significant
    influence, using the equity method. We record our investments in
    entities over which we do not have the ability to exercise
    significant influence using the cost method. We have eliminated
    significant intercompany transactions and accounts.

We believe that the assumptions underlying our consolidated
    financial statements are reasonable. However, these consolidated
    financial statements do not present our future financial
    position, the results of our future operations and cash flows.

Seasonality

We generally experience seasonal fluctuations in the demand for
    our travel products and services. For example, traditional
    leisure travel bookings are generally the highest in the first
    three quarters as travelers plan and book their spring, summer
    and holiday travel. The number of bookings decreases in the
    fourth quarter. Because revenue in the merchant business is
    generally recognized when the travel takes place rather than
    when it is booked, revenue typically lags bookings by several
    weeks or longer. As a result, revenue is typically the lowest in
    the first quarter and highest in the third quarter. The
    macroeconomic downturn in the latter part of 2008 also affected
    our general revenue seasonality trends in the fourth quarter of
    2008.

NOTE 2 —

Significant
    Accounting Policies

Consolidation

Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
    Expedia, Inc., our wholly-owned subsidiaries, and entities for
    which we control a majority of the entity’s outstanding
    common stock. We record minority interest in our consolidated
    financial statements to recognize the minority ownership
    interest in our consolidated subsidiaries. Minority interests in
    the earnings and losses of consolidated subsidiaries represent

F-7


Expedia,
    Inc.

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

the share of net income or loss allocated to members or partners
    in our consolidated entities, which primarily includes the
    minority interest share of net income or loss from eLong.

In addition, eLong, Inc. has variable interests in certain
    affiliated entities in China in order to comply with Chinese
    laws and regulations, which restricts foreign investment in the
    air-ticketing, travel agency and internet content provision
    businesses. Through a series of contractual agreements, eLong,
    Inc. is the primary beneficiary of the cash losses or profits of
    such variable interest entities. As such, although we do not own
    capital stock of the Chinese affiliates, based on our majority
    ownership of eLong, Inc., we consolidate their results.

We have eliminated significant intercompany transactions and
    accounts in our consolidated financial statements.

Accounting
    Estimates

We use estimates and assumptions in the preparation of our
    consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting
    principles generally accepted in the United States
    (“GAAP”). Our estimates and assumptions affect the
    reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
    contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of our
    consolidated financial statements. These estimates and
    assumptions also affect the reported amount of net income or
    loss during any period. Our actual financial results could
    differ significantly from these estimates. The significant
    estimates underlying our consolidated financial statements
    include revenue recognition; recoverability of current and
    long-lived assets, intangible assets and goodwill; income and
    indirect taxes, such as potential settlements related to
    occupancy taxes; stock-based compensation and accounting for
    derivative instruments.

Reclassifications

We have reclassified prior period financial statements to
    conform to the current period presentation.

Revenue
    Recognition

We recognize revenue when it is earned and realizable based on
    the following criteria: persuasive evidence that an arrangement
    exists, services have been rendered, the price is fixed or
    determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured.

We also evaluate the presentation of revenue on a gross versus a
    net basis through application of Emerging Issues Task Force No.
    (“EITF”)

99-19,

Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an
    Agent

. The consensus of this literature is that the
    presentation of revenue as “the gross amount billed to a
    customer because it has earned revenue from the sale of goods or
    services or the net amount retained (that is, the amount billed
    to a customer less the amount paid to a supplier) because it has
    earned a commission or fee” is a matter of judgment that
    depends on the relevant facts and circumstances. In making an
    evaluation of this issue, some of the factors that should be
    considered are: whether we are the primary obligor in the
    arrangement (strong indicator); whether we have general supply
    risk (before customer order is placed or upon customer return)
    (strong indicator); and whether we have latitude in establishing
    price. The guidance clearly indicates that the evaluations of
    these factors, which at times can be contradictory, are subject
    to significant judgment and subjectivity. If the conclusion
    drawn is that we perform as an agent or a broker without
    assuming the risks and rewards of ownership of goods, revenue
    should be reported on a net basis. For our primary revenue
    models, discussed below, we have determined net presentation is
    appropriate for the majority of revenue transactions.

We offer travel products and services on a stand-alone and
    package basis primarily through two business models: the
    merchant model and the agency model.

F-8


Expedia,
    Inc.

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

Under the merchant model, we facilitate the booking of hotel
    rooms, airline seats, car rentals and destination services from
    our travel suppliers and we are the merchant of record for such
    bookings.

Under the agency model, we act as the agent in the transaction,
    passing reservations booked by the traveler to the relevant
    travel provider. We receive commissions or ticketing fees from
    the travel supplier

and/or

traveler. For agency airline, hotel and car transactions, we
    also receive fees from global distribution systems partners that
    control the computer systems through which these reservations
    are booked.

Merchant Hotel.

Our travelers pay us for
    merchant hotel transactions prior to departing on their trip,
    generally when they book the reservation. We record the payment
    in deferred merchant bookings until the stay occurs, at which
    point we record the revenue. In certain nonrefundable,
    nonchangeable transactions where we have no significant
    post-delivery obligations, we record revenue when the traveler
    completes the transaction on our website, less a reserve for
    chargebacks and cancellations based on historical experience.
    Amounts received from customers are presented net of amounts
    paid to suppliers. In certain instances when a supplier invoices
    us for less than the cost we accrued, we generally recognize
    those amounts as revenue six months in arrears, net of an
    allowance, when we determine it is not probable that we will be
    required to pay the supplier, based on historical experience and
    contract terms.

We generally contract in advance with lodging providers to
    obtain access to room allotments at wholesale rates. Certain
    contracts specifically identify the number of potential rooms
    and the negotiated rate of the rooms to which we may have access
    over the terms of the contracts, which generally range from one
    to three years. Other contracts are not specific with respect to
    the number of rooms and the rates of the rooms to which we may
    have access over the terms of the contracts. In either case we
    may return unbooked hotel room allotments with no obligation to
    the lodging providers within a period specified in each
    contract. For hotel rooms that are cancelled by the traveler
    after the specified period of time, we charge the traveler a
    cancellation fee or penalty that is at least equal to the amount
    a hotel may invoice us for the cancellation.

Merchant Air.

Generally, we determine the
    ticket price for merchant air transactions. We pay the cost of
    the airline ticket generally within two weeks after booking. We
    record cash paid by the traveler as deferred merchant bookings
    and the cost of the airline ticket as prepaid merchant bookings.
    When the flight occurs, we record the difference between the
    deferred merchant bookings and the prepaid merchant bookings as
    revenue on a net basis.

When we have nonrefundable and generally noncancelable merchant
    air transactions, with no significant post-delivery obligations,
    we record revenue upon booking. We record a reserve for
    chargebacks and cancellations at the time of the transaction
    based on historical experience.

Agency Air, Hotel, Car and Cruise.

Our agency
    revenue comes from airline ticket transactions, certain hotel
    transactions as well as cruise and car rental reservations. We
    record agency revenue on air transactions when the traveler
    books the transaction, as we have no significant post-delivery
    obligations. We generally record agency revenue on hotel
    reservations when the stay occurs or on receipt of commissions
    from individual suppliers. We record agency revenue on cruise
    and car rental reservations either on an accrual basis for
    payments from a commission clearinghouse, or on receipt of
    commissions from an individual supplier. We record an allowance
    for cancellations and chargebacks on this revenue based on
    historical experience.

Click-Through Fees.

We record revenue from
    click-through fees charged to our travel partners for traveler
    leads sent to the travel partners’ websites. We record
    revenue from click-through fees after the traveler makes the
    click-through to the related travel partners’ websites.

Advertising.

We record advertising revenue
    ratably over the advertising period or upon delivery of
    advertising impressions, depending on the terms of the
    advertising contract.

Other.

We record revenue from all other
    sources either upon delivery or when we provide the service.

F-9


Expedia,
    Inc.

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

Cash
    and Cash Equivalents

Our cash and cash equivalents include cash and liquid financial
    instruments with maturities of 90 days or less when
    purchased.

Short-term
    Investments

Our short-term investments consist of time deposits with
    financial institutions held by eLong with maturities greater
    than 90 days but less than one year.

Accounts
    Receivable

Accounts receivable are generally due within thirty days and are
    recorded net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. We consider
    accounts outstanding longer than the contractual payment terms
    as past due. We determine our allowance by considering a number
    of factors, including the length of time trade accounts
    receivable are past due, previous loss history, a specific
    customer’s ability to pay its obligations to us, and the
    condition of the general economy and industry as a whole.

Prepaid
    Expenses and Other Current Assets

At December 31, 2008, prepaid expenses and other current
    assets included $16 million in redemptions of money market
    holdings due from the Reserve Primary Fund (the
    “Fund”). The Fund is currently being liquidated due to
    the Reserve’s September 16, 2008 announcement that the
    Fund had a net asset value less than $1.00 and ensuing
    significant redemption requests. As a result, during the third
    quarter of 2008, we reclassified $80 million in redemptions
    due from the Fund from cash and cash equivalents to prepaid
    expenses and other current assets, which was net of an
    approximate $1 million allowance for our estimated pro rata
    share of losses related to the Fund’s write-down of debt
    security holdings of Lehman Brothers Holdings, Inc. We received
    $64 million in distributions from the Fund during the
    fourth quarter of 2008. The timing of receipt of the remaining
    proceeds cannot be determined at this time; however, the
    maturities of the underlying investments are within one year. In
    addition, under the Fund’s plan of liquidation announced
    December 3, 2008, future distributions will continue to be
    made on a pro-rata basis up to the amount of a special reserve,
    which will be established to satisfy legal and accounting fees
    of the Fund. As the Fund has not yet quantified the amount of
    the special reserve, there is no way to determine our pro-rata
    share of such reserve and we may be required to record
    additional losses in future periods.

Property
    and Equipment

We record property and equipment at cost, net of accumulated
    depreciation and amortization. We also capitalize certain costs
    incurred related to the development of internal use software in
    accordance with Statement of Position

98-1,

Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or
    Obtained for Internal Use

, and EITF

No. 00-02,

Accounting for Website Development Costs

. We capitalize
    costs incurred during the application development stage related
    to the development of internal use software. We expense costs
    incurred related to the planning and post-implementation phases
    of development as incurred.

We compute depreciation using the straight-line method over the
    estimated useful lives of the assets, which is three to five
    years for computer equipment, capitalized software development
    and furniture and other equipment. We amortize leasehold
    improvement using the straight-line method, over the shorter of
    the estimated useful life of the improvement or the remaining
    term of the lease.

In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    (“SFAS”) No. 143,

Accounting for Asset
    Retirement Obligations

, we establish assets and liabilities
    for the present value of estimated future costs to return
    certain of our leased facilities to their original condition.
    Such assets are depreciated over the lease

Expedia,
    Inc.

    Statements — (Continued)

period into operating expense, and the recorded liabilities are
    accreted to the future value of the estimated restoration costs.

Recoverability
    of Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets

Goodwill is assigned to reporting units that are expected to
    benefit from the synergies of the business combination as of the
    acquisition date. We assess goodwill and indefinite-lived
    intangible assets, neither of which is amortized, for impairment
    annually as of October 1, or more frequently, if events and
    circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred. See
    Note 5

—

Goodwill and Intangible Assets,
    Net for discussion of impairment of goodwill and
    indefinite-lived assets in 2008 and 2006.

In the evaluation of goodwill for impairment, we first compare
    the fair value of the reporting unit to the carrying value. If
    the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value,
    the goodwill of that reporting unit is potentially impaired and
    we proceed to step two of the impairment analysis. In step two
    of the analysis, we will record an impairment loss equal to the
    excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit’s
    goodwill over its implied fair value should such a circumstance
    arise.

We generally base our measurement of fair value of reporting
    units on a blended analysis of the present value of future
    discounted cash flows and market valuation approach. The
    discounted cash flows model indicates the fair value of the
    reporting units based on the present value of the cash flows
    that we expect the reporting units to generate in the future.
    Our significant estimates in the discounted cash flows model
    include: our weighted average cost of capital; long-term rate of
    growth and profitability of our business; and working capital
    effects. The market valuation approach indicates the fair value
    of the business based on a comparison of the Company to
    comparable publicly traded firms in similar lines of business.
    Our significant estimates in the market approach model include
    identifying similar companies with comparable business factors
    such as size, growth, profitability, risk and return on
    investment and assessing comparable revenue and operating income
    multiples in estimating the fair value of the reporting units.

We believe the weighted use of discounted cash flows and market
    approach is the best method for determining the fair value of
    our reporting units because these are the most common valuation
    methodologies used within the travel and internet industries;
    and the blended use of both models compensates for the inherent
    risks associated with either model if used on a stand-alone
    basis.

In addition to measuring the fair value of our reporting units
    as described above, we consider the combined carrying and fair
    values of our reporting units in relation to the Company’s
    total fair value of equity plus debt as of the assessment date.
    Our equity value assumes our fully diluted market
    capitalization, using either the stock price on the valuation
    date or the average stock price over a range of dates around the
    valuation date, plus an estimated acquisition premium which is
    based on observable transactions of comparable companies. The
    debt value is based on the highest value expected to be paid to
    repurchase the debt, which can be fair value, principal or
    principal plus a premium depending on the terms of each debt
    instrument.

In the evaluation of indefinite-lived intangible assets, an
    impairment charge is recorded for the excess of the carrying
    value of indefinite-lived intangible assets over their fair
    value. We base our measurement of fair value of indefinite-lived
    intangible assets, which primarily consist of trade name and
    trademarks, using the relief-from-royalty method. This method
    assumes that the trade name and trademarks have value to the
    extent that their owner is relieved of the obligation to pay
    royalties for the benefits received from them.

Recoverability
    of Intangible Assets with Definite Lives and Other Long-Lived
    Assets

Intangible assets with definite lives and other long-lived
    assets are carried at cost and are amortized on a straight-line
    basis over their estimated useful lives of two to twelve years.
    We review the carrying value of long-lived assets or asset
    groups, including property and equipment, to be used in
    operations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
    that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable.
    Factors

that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a
    significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an
    asset is used, a significant adverse change in legal factors or
    the business climate that could affect the value of the asset,
    or a significant decline in the observable market value of an
    asset, among others. If such facts indicate a potential
    impairment, we would assess the recoverability of an asset group
    by determining if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds
    the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to
    result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets over
    the remaining economic life of the primary asset in the asset
    group. If the recoverability test indicates that the carrying
    value of the asset group is not recoverable, we will estimate
    the fair value of the asset group using appropriate valuation
    methodologies which would typically include an estimate of
    discounted cash flows. Any impairment would be measured as the
    difference between the asset groups carrying amount and its
    estimated fair value. See Note 5

—

Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Net for discussion of
    impairment of other long-lived assets in 2008.

Assets held for sale, to the extent we have any, are reported at
    the lower of cost or fair value less costs to sell.

Long-term
    Investments

We record investments, which are non-marketable, using the cost
    basis when we do not have the ability to exercise significant
    influence over the investee and generally when our ownership in
    the investee is less than 20%. We record investments using the
    equity method when we have the ability to exercise significant
    influence over the investee.

We periodically evaluate the recoverability of investments and
    record a write-down to fair value if a decline in value is
    determined to be other-than-temporary.

Income
    Taxes

In accordance with SFAS No. 109,

Accounting for
    Income Taxes

, we record income taxes under the liability
    method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect our
    estimation of the future tax consequences of temporary
    differences between the carrying amounts of assets and
    liabilities for book and tax purposes. We determine deferred
    income taxes based on the differences in accounting methods and
    timing between financial statement and income tax reporting.
    Accordingly, we determine the deferred tax asset or liability
    for each temporary difference based on the enacted tax rates
    expected to be in effect when we realize the underlying items of
    income and expense. We consider many factors when assessing the
    likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets,
    including our recent earnings experience by jurisdiction,
    expectations of future taxable income, and the carryforward
    periods available to us for tax reporting purposes, as well as
    other relevant factors. We may establish a valuation allowance
    to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount we believe is more
    likely than not to be realized. Due to inherent complexities
    arising from the nature of our businesses, future changes in
    income tax law, tax sharing agreements or variances between our
    actual and anticipated operating results, we make certain
    judgments and estimates. Therefore, actual income taxes could
    materially vary from these estimates.

On January 1, 2007, we adopted Financial Accounting
    Standards Board (“FASB”) Interpretation No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes — an
    interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109

(“FIN 48”). FIN 48 gives guidance
    related to the financial statement recognition and measurement
    of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return,
    and requires that we recognize in our financial statements the
    impact of a tax position, if that position is more likely than
    not to be sustained upon an examination, based on the technical
    merits of the position.

Occupancy
    Tax

Some states and localities impose a transient occupancy or
    accommodation tax, or a form of sales tax, on the use or
    occupancy of hotel accommodations. Generally, hotels charge
    taxes based on the room rate paid to the hotel and remit these
    taxes to the various tax authorities. When a customer books a
    room through one of our travel services, we collect a tax
    recovery charge from the customer which we pay to the hotel. We
    do not collect or remit occupancy taxes, nor do we pay occupancy
    taxes to the hotel operator on the portion of the customer
    payment we retain. Some jurisdictions have questioned our
    practice in this regard. While the applicable tax provisions
    vary among the jurisdictions, we generally believe that we are
    not required to collect and remit such occupancy taxes. We are
    engaged in discussions with tax authorities in various
    jurisdictions to resolve this issue. Some tax authorities have
    brought lawsuits or have levied assessments asserting that we
    are required to collect and remit occupancy tax. The ultimate
    resolution in all jurisdictions cannot be determined at this
    time. We have established a reserve for the potential settlement
    of issues related to hotel occupancy taxes.

Presentation
    of Taxes in the Income Statement

We present taxes that we collect from customers and remit to
    government authorities on a net basis in our consolidated
    statements of operations.

Derivative
    Instruments

Derivative instruments are carried at fair value on our
    consolidated balance sheets.

We had designated cross currency swap agreements as cash flow
    hedges of certain inter-company loan agreements denominated in
    currencies other than the lending subsidiaries’ functional
    currency (the “hedged items”). The hedges were
    determined to be highly effective, at designation and up until
    settlement during the third quarter of 2008. As such, we
    recorded the total change in the fair value of the hedges in
    other comprehensive income (“OCI”) each period, and
    concurrently reclassify a portion of the gain or loss to Other,
    net to perfectly offset gains or losses related to transactional
    remeasurement of the hedged items.

We report the change in the fair value of derivative
    instruments, which primarily consist of foreign currency forward
    contracts as of December 31, 2008, that do not qualify for
    hedge accounting treatment in Other, net. We do not hold or
    issue financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes.

For additional information about derivative instruments, see
    Note 7 — Derivative Instruments.

Foreign
    Currency Translation and Transaction Gains and
    Losses

Certain of our operations outside of the United States use the
    related local currency as their functional currency. We
    translate revenue and expense at average rates of exchange
    during the period. We translate assets and liabilities at the
    rates of exchange as of the consolidated balance sheet dates and
    include foreign currency translation gains and losses as a
    component of accumulated OCI. Due to the nature of our
    operations and our corporate structure, we also have
    subsidiaries that have significant transactions in foreign
    currencies other than their functional currency. We record
    transaction gains and losses in our consolidated statements of
    operations related to the recurring remeasurement and settlement
    of such transactions.

To the extent practicable, we attempt to minimize this exposure
    by maintaining natural hedges between our current assets and
    current liabilities of similarly denominated foreign currencies.
    Additionally, during the third and fourth quarter of 2008, we
    began using foreign currency forward contracts to economically
    hedge certain merchant revenue exposures and in lieu of holding
    certain foreign currency cash for the purpose of economically
    hedging our foreign currency-denominated merchant accounts
    payable and deferred merchant bookings balances. These
    instruments are typically short-term and are recorded at fair
    value with gains and

F-13

    Inc.

    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

losses recorded in Other, net. Valuation of the foreign currency
    forward contracts is based on foreign currency exchange rates in
    active markets; thus, we measure the fair value of these
    contracts under a Level 2 input as defined by
    SFAS No. 157,

Fair Value Measurements

. As of
    December 31, 2008, we had a net forward liability of
    $1 million recorded in accrued expenses and other current
    liabilities.

Debt
    Issuance Costs

We defer costs we incur to issue debt and amortize these costs
    to interest expense over the term of the debt or, when the debt
    can be redeemed at the option of the holders, over the term of
    the redemption option.

Marketing
    Promotions

We periodically provide incentive offers to our customers to
    encourage booking of travel products and services. Generally,
    our incentive offers are as follows:

Current Discount Offers.

These promotions
    include dollar off discounts to be applied against current
    purchases. We record the discounts as reduction in revenue at
    the date we record the corresponding revenue transaction.

Inducement Offers.

These promotions include
    discounts granted at the time of a current purchase to be
    applied against a future qualifying purchase. We treat
    inducement offers as a reduction to revenue based on estimated
    future redemption rates. We allocate the discount amount between
    the current purchase and the potential future purchase based on
    our expected relative value of the transactions. We estimate our
    redemption rates using our historical experience for similar
    inducement offers.

Concession Offers.

These promotions include
    discounts to be applied against a future purchase to maintain
    customer satisfaction. Upon issuance, we record these concession
    offers as a reduction to revenue based on estimated future
    redemption rates. We estimate our redemption rates using our
    historical experience for concession offers.

Advertising
    Expense

We incur advertising expense consisting of offline costs,
    including television and radio advertising, and online
    advertising expense to promote our brands. We expense the
    production costs associated with advertisements in the period in
    which the advertisement first takes place. We expense the costs
    of communicating the advertisement (e.g., television airtime) as
    incurred each time the advertisement is shown. For the years
    ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, our advertising
    expense was $598 million, $539 million and
    $427 million. As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, we had
    $10 million and $8 million of prepaid marketing
    expenses included in prepaid expenses and other current assets.

Stock-Based
    Compensation

We account for stock-based compensation in accordance with
    SFAS No. 123(R),

Share-Based Payment

, and
    related guidance. We measure and amortize the fair value of
    restricted stock units, stock options and warrants as follows:

Restricted Stock Units.

Restricted stock units
    (“RSU”) are stock awards that are granted to employees
    entitling the holder to shares of common stock as the award
    vests, typically over a five-year period. We measure the value
    of RSUs at fair value based on the number of shares granted and
    the quoted price of our common stock at the date of grant. We
    amortize the fair value, net of estimated forfeitures, as
    stock-based compensation expense over the vesting term on a
    straight-line basis. We record RSUs that may be settled by the
    holder in cash, rather than shares, as a liability and we
    remeasure these instruments at fair value at the end of each
    reporting period. Upon settlement of these awards, our total
    compensation expense recorded over the

F-14


Expedia,
    Inc.

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

vesting period of the awards will equal the settlement amount,
    which is based on our stock price on the settlement date.

Performance-based RSUs vest upon achievement of certain
    company-based performance conditions. On the date of grant, we
    determine the fair value of the performance-based award based on
    the fair value of our common stock at that time and we assess
    whether it is probable that the performance targets will be
    achieved. If assessed as probable, we record compensation
    expense for these awards over the estimated performance period
    using the accelerated method. At each reporting period, we
    reassess the probability of achieving the performance targets
    and the performance period required to meet those targets. The
    estimation of whether the performance targets will be achieved
    and of the performance period required to achieve the targets
    requires judgment, and to the extent actual results or updated
    estimates differ from our current estimates, the cumulative
    effect on current and prior periods of those changes will be
    recorded in the period estimates are revised, or the change in
    estimate will be applied prospectively depending on whether the
    change affects the estimate of total compensation cost to be
    recognized or merely affects the period over which compensation
    cost is to be recognized. The ultimate number of shares issued
    and the related compensation expense recognized will be based on
    a comparison of the final performance metrics to the specified
    targets.

Stock Options and Warrants.

We measure the
    value of stock options and warrants issued or modified,
    including unvested options assumed in acquisitions, on the grant
    date (or modification or acquisition dates, if applicable) at
    fair value, using the Black-Scholes option valuation model. We
    amortize the fair value, net of estimated forfeitures, over the
    remaining vesting term on a straight-line basis.

Estimates of fair value are not intended to predict actual
    future events or the value ultimately realized by employees who
    receive these awards, and subsequent events are not indicative
    of the reasonableness of our original estimates of fair value.
    In determining the estimated forfeiture rates for stock-based
    awards, we periodically conduct an assessment of the actual
    number of equity awards that have been forfeited to date as well
    as those expected to be forfeited in the future. We consider
    many factors when estimating expected forfeitures, including the
    type of award, the employee class and historical experience. The
    estimate of stock awards that will ultimately be forfeited
    requires significant judgment and to the extent that actual
    results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates,
    such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the
    period such estimates are revised.

Earnings
    Per Share

We compute basic earnings per share by taking net income (loss)
    available to common shareholders divided by the weighted average
    number of common and Class B common shares outstanding
    during the period excluding restricted stock and stock held in
    escrow. Diluted earnings per share include the potential
    dilution that could occur from stock-based awards and other
    stock-based commitments using the treasury stock or the as if
    converted methods, as applicable. For additional information on
    how we compute earnings per share, see Note 12 —
    Earnings Per Share.

Fair
    Value of Financial Instruments

The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, restricted
    cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments reported on
    our consolidated balance sheets approximate fair value as we
    maintain them with various high-quality financial institutions.
    The accounts receivable are short-term in nature and are
    generally settled shortly after the sale.

Certain
    Risks and Concentrations

Our business is subject to certain risks and concentrations
    including dependence on relationships with travel suppliers,
    primarily airlines and hotels, dependence on third-party
    technology providers, exposure to

F-15


Expedia,
    Inc.

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

risks associated with online commerce security and credit card
    fraud. We also rely on global distribution system partners and
    third-party service providers for certain fulfillment services,
    including one third-party service provider for which we
    accounted for approximately 41% of its total revenue for the
    year ended December 31, 2007 and approximately 35% of its
    total revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2008.

Financial instruments, which potentially subject us to
    concentration of credit risk, consist primarily of cash and cash
    equivalents. We maintain some cash and cash equivalents balances
    with financial institutions that are in excess of Federal
    Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance limits. Our cash and
    cash equivalents are primarily composed of U.S. government
    obligations and treasury funds as well as interest bearing bank
    account balances denominated in U.S. dollars, euros and
    British pound sterling.

Contingent
    Liabilities

We have a number of regulatory and legal matters outstanding, as
    discussed further in Note 14 — Commitments and
    Contingencies. Periodically, we review the status of all
    significant outstanding matters to assess the potential
    financial exposure. When (i) it is probable that an asset
    has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and
    (ii) the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated, we
    record the estimated loss in our consolidated statements of
    operations. We provide disclosure in the notes to the
    consolidated financial statements for loss contingencies that do
    not meet both these conditions if there is a reasonable
    possibility that a loss may have been incurred that would be
    material to the financial statements. Significant judgment is
    required to determine the probability that a liability has been
    incurred and whether such liability is reasonably estimable. We
    base accruals made on the best information available at the time
    which can be highly subjective. The final outcome of these
    matters could vary significantly from the amounts included in
    the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

Recently
    Adopted Accounting Pronouncements

On January 1, 2008, we adopted certain provisions of
    SFAS No. 157,

Fair Value Measurements

(“SFAS 157”). SFAS 157 defines fair
    value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in GAAP,
    and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.
    SFAS 157 applies when another standard requires or permits
    assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value. Accordingly,
    SFAS 157 does not require any new fair value measurements.
    We will adopt the provisions of SFAS 157 as it relates to
    nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are not recognized or
    disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis on January 1,
    2009. The partial adoption of SFAS 157 did not materially
    impact, nor do we expect the full adoption to materially impact,
    our consolidated financial statements.

On January 1, 2008, we adopted SFAS No. 159,

The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
    Liabilities — Including an Amendment of
    SFAS Statement No. 115

(“SFAS 159”). SFAS 159 permits an entity
    to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain
    other items at fair value at specified election dates as defined
    in the standard. Subsequent unrealized gains and losses on items
    for which the fair value option has been elected will be
    reported in earnings. As we did not elect fair value treatment
    for qualifying instruments that existed as of January 1,
    2008, the adoption of this Statement did not have an impact on
    our consolidated financial statements. We may elect to measure
    qualifying instruments at fair value in the future.

New
    Accounting Pronouncements

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141R,

Business Combinations

(“SFAS 141R”), which
    replaces SFAS 141. SFAS 141R applies to all
    transactions or other events in which an entity obtains control
    of one or more businesses and requires that all assets and
    liabilities of an acquired business as well as any
    noncontrolling interest in the acquiree be recorded at their
    fair values at the acquisition date. Contingent

F-16


Expedia,
    Inc.

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

consideration arrangements will be recognized at their
    acquisition date fair values, with subsequent changes in fair
    value generally reflected in earnings. Pre-acquisition
    contingencies will also typically be recognized at their
    acquisition date fair values. In subsequent periods, contingent
    liabilities will be measured at the higher of their acquisition
    date fair values or the estimated amounts to be realized. The
    Statement is effective for business combinations for which the
    acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first
    annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15,
    2008. We do not expect the adoption of SFAS 141R will have
    a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160,

Accounting and Reporting on Non-controlling Interest in
    Consolidated Financial Statements, an Amendment of ARB 51

(“SFAS 160”), which is effective for fiscal
    years beginning after December 15, 2008.
    SFAS 160 states that accounting and reporting for
    minority interests will be recharacterized as noncontrolling
    interests and classified as a component of equity. The
    calculation of earnings per share will continue to be based on
    income amounts attributable to the parent. FAS 160 applies
    to all entities that prepare consolidated financial statements,
    except not-for-profit organizations, but will affect only those
    entities that have an outstanding noncontrolling interest in one
    or more subsidiaries or that deconsolidate a subsidiary.
    Beginning on January 1, 2009 upon adoption of
    SFAS 160, we will recharacterize our minority interest as a
    noncontrolling interest and classify it as a component of equity
    in our consolidated financial statements with the exception of
    shares redeemable at the option of the minority holders, which
    will remain an obligation outside of stockholders’ equity.

In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161,

Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging
    Activities

(“SFAS 161”), which is effective
    for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after
    November 15, 2008. SFAS 161 requires enhanced
    disclosures about an entity’s derivative and hedging
    activities, including how and why an entity uses derivative
    instruments, how derivative instruments and related hedged items
    are accounted for and how derivative instruments and related
    hedged items affect an entity’s financial position,
    financial performance, and cash flows. We do not expect the
    adoption of SFAS 161 will have a material impact on our
    consolidated financial statements.

NOTE 3 —
    Acquisitions and Other Investments

In 2008, we acquired four online travel media content companies,
    one corporate travel company and two online travel product and
    service companies, which includes Venere, an online travel
    provider based in Italy that focuses on hotel reservations under
    an agency model. The purchase price of these companies as well
    as contingent purchase consideration under prior acquisitions
    and other acquisition-related costs totaled $475 million,
    of which $465 million was paid in cash and $10 million
    was accrued as of December 31, 2008. The following table
    summarizes the allocation of the purchase price for all
    acquisitions made in 2008, in thousands:

Goodwill

$

328,449

Intangible assets with definite lives(1)

112,968

Intangible assets with indefinite lives

47,641

Net liabilities and minority interests acquired, which includes
    $21,480 of cash aquired

(14,486

)

Total

$

474,572

(1)

Acquired intangible assets primarily consist of supplier
    relationship assets with a weighted average life of
    10.6 years and technology assets with a weighted average
    life of 3 years. In total, the weighted average life of
    acquired intangible assets was 8.3 years.

The purchase price allocation of these acquisitions is
    preliminary and subject to revision, and any change to the fair
    value of net assets acquired will lead to a corresponding change
    to the purchase price allocable to goodwill. The results of
    operations of each of the acquired businesses have been included
    in our consolidated

results from each transaction closing date forward; their effect
    on consolidated revenue and operating loss during 2008 was not
    significant.

In one of these 2008 transactions, we acquired a 74% controlling
    interest with certain rights whereby we may acquire, and the
    minority shareholders may sell to us, the additional shares of
    the company at fair value at various times through 2011. In
    another of these 2008 transactions, we acquired an 86%
    controlling interest with certain rights whereby we may acquire,
    and the minority shareholders may sell to us, the additional
    shares of the company at fair value, or at an adjusted fair
    value at our option, during a

30-day

period beginning October 1, 2012. Future changes in fair
    value of the shares for which the minority holders may sell to
    us above the initial minority interest basis will be recorded to
    the minority interest and as charges or credits to retained
    earnings (deficit).

In 2007, we acquired three travel-related companies. The
    purchase price of these and other acquisition related costs
    totaled $152 million, $60 million of which we paid in
    cash and $92 million of which was accrued at
    December 31, 2007 as a result of the financial performance
    of one of the acquired companies during 2007. The accrued
    purchase consideration represented $92 million of
    $100 million total additional purchase price that could be
    achieved based on the annual results of 2007 or 2008, or the two
    periods combined. During 2008, we paid $93 million of the
    additional purchase price based on the annual results of 2007.
    In addition, we accrued the remaining $7 million based on
    the annual results of 2008 to be paid in 2009 and this amount
    was included within the 2008 total purchase price above. As a
    result of these acquisitions, we recorded $126 million in
    goodwill and $18 million of intangible assets with definite
    lives. The results of operations of each of the acquired
    businesses have been included in our consolidated results from
    each transaction closing date forward; their effect on
    consolidated net revenue and operating income during 2007 was
    not significant.

During 2007, we also acquired a 50% ownership interest in a
    travel company for $26 million in cash. We include this
    investment in Long-term investments and other assets and account
    for it under the equity-method. The investment agreement
    contains certain rights, whereby we may acquire and the investee
    may sell to us the additional shares of the company, at fair
    value or at established multiples of future earnings at our
    discretion, at various times beginning in the first quarter of
    2009 through 2013. We have also entered into a commitment to
    provide the investee a $10 million revolving operating line
    of credit and a credit facility for up to $20 million. As
    of the end of 2008 or at any time and from time to time
    thereafter, any amounts due under the credit facility are
    convertible, at our option, into shares of the company at a
    premium to the then fair market value. The revolving operating
    line of credit had $2 million drawn against it and no
    amounts were drawn against the credit facility as of
    December 31, 2008.

In 2006, we purchased the remaining 4.9% minority ownership in
    TripAdvisor for $18 million in cash.

NOTE 5 —

Goodwill
    and Intangible Assets, Net

We performed our annual impairment assessment for goodwill and
    indefinite-lived intangible assets as of October 1, 2008
    and determined we had no impairment as of that date. However,
    during the fourth quarter of 2008, we experienced a significant
    decline in our stock price and operating results in part due to
    an increased negative impact of foreign exchange rates and the
    continued weakness in the macroeconomic environment. Based on
    these and other contributing factors, we concluded that
    sufficient indicators existed to require us to perform an
    interim assessment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible
    assets as of December 1, 2008. Accordingly, we performed an
    interim first step of our impairment assessment for each of our
    reporting units and determined there was a potential impairment
    of goodwill in certain reporting units. Therefore, we performed
    the second step of the assessment in which we compared the
    implied fair value of those reporting unit’s goodwill to
    the book value of that goodwill. The implied fair value of
    goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of
    goodwill recognized in a business combination. That is, the
    estimated fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all
    of the assets and liabilities of that unit (including both
    recognized and unrecognized intangible assets) as if the
    reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and
    the estimated fair value of the reporting unit was the purchase
    price paid. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s
    goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that unit’s
    goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to
    that excess.

We measured the fair value of each of our reporting units and
    both our indefinite-lived and definite lived intangible assets
    using accepted valuation techniques as described above in
    Note 2 — Significant Accounting Policies. The
    significant estimates used included our weighted average cost of
    capital, long-term rate of growth and profitability of our
    business, and working capital effects. Our assumptions are based
    on the actual historical performance of each of the reporting
    units and take into account the recent weakening of operating
    results and implied risk premiums based on market prices of our
    equity and debt as of the assessment date. To validate the
    reasonableness of the reporting unit fair values, we reconcile
    the aggregate fair values of the reporting units determined in
    step one to the enterprise market capitalization. Enterprise
    market capitalization includes, among other factors, the fully
    diluted market capitalization of our stock, an acquisition
    premium based on historical data from acquisitions within the
    same or similar industries and the appropriate redemption

F-19

    Inc.

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

values of our debt. In performing the reconciliation we may,
    depending on the volatility of the market value of our stock
    price, use either the stock price on the valuation date or the
    average stock price over a range of dates around that date and
    consider such other quantitative and qualitative factors we
    consider relevant, which may change depending on the date for
    which the assessment is made. This assessment resulted in the
    recognition in the fourth quarter of 2008 of a loss on
    impairment of long-term assets of approximately $3 billion,
    which consists of $2.8 billion of goodwill and
    $223 million of indefinite-lived trade names. A deferred
    tax benefit of $189 million was recognized as a result of
    these charges.

We determined that the adverse change in the business climate
    discussed above was also an indicator requiring the testing of
    our long-lived assets for recoverability and performed this test
    as of December 1, 2008. We tested the long-lived assets of
    our reporting units for recoverability based on a comparison of
    the respective aggregate values of their undiscounted cash flows
    to the respective carrying values. The results of the evaluation
    indicated that the carrying values of the related assets were
    recoverable. In addition to the above impairment analysis,
    during the fourth quarter of 2008, we wrote off $11 million
    related to capitalized software costs based on the abandonment
    of the related project.

As a result of continued adverse conditions in the markets in
    which we operate, we will continue to monitor goodwill and
    long-lived intangible assets, as well as long-lived tangible
    assets, for possible future impairment. We cannot assure that
    these assets will not be further impaired in future periods.

    America segment, $73 million in our Europe segment and
    $22 million in our Asia Pacific segment. In the third
    quarter of 2006, based on lower than expected year-to-date
    revenue growth, we determined that our indefinite-lived trade
    name intangible asset related to Hotwire, part of our North
    America segment, was impaired based on a valuation of that asset
    and recognized an impairment charge of $47 million.

In 2008 and 2007, the additions to goodwill relate primarily to
    our acquisitions as described in Note 3 —
    Acquisitions and Other Investments. In addition, basis
    adjustments resulting from the implementation of FIN 48
    also contributed to the increase in 2007. The deductions from
    goodwill for both 2008 and 2007 primarily relate to the
    impairments discussed above as well as the income tax benefit
    realized pursuant to the exercise of stock options assumed in
    business acquisitions that were vested at the transaction date
    and are treated as a reduction in purchase price when the
    deductions are realized.

Long-term
    Debt

In June 2008, we privately placed $400 million of
    8.5% senior unsecured notes due in July 2016 (the
    “8.5% Notes”). The 8.5% Notes were issued at
    98.572% of par resulting in a discount, which is being amortized
    over their life. Interest is payable semi-annually in January
    and July of each year, beginning January 1, 2009. The
    8.5% Notes are repayable in whole or in part upon the
    occurrence of a change of control, at the option of the holders,
    at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal plus
    accrued interest. Prior to July 1, 2011, in the event of a
    qualified equity offering, we may redeem up to 35% of the
    8.5% Notes at a redemption price of 108.5% of the principal
    plus accrued interest. Additionally, we may redeem the
    8.5% Notes prior to July 1, 2012 in whole or in part
    at a redemption price of 100% of the principal plus accrued
    interest, plus a “make-whole” premium. On or after
    July 1, 2012, we may redeem the 8.5% Notes in whole or
    in part at specified prices ranging from 104.250% to 100% of the
    principal plus accrued interest.

Our $500 million in registered senior unsecured notes
    outstanding at December 31, 2008 are due in August 2018 and
    bear interest at 7.456% (the “7.456% Notes”).
    Interest is payable semi-annually in February and August of each
    year. The 7.456% Notes are repayable in whole or in part on
    August 15, 2013, at the option of the holders of such
    7.456% Notes, at 100% of the principal amount plus accrued
    interest. We may redeem the 7.456% Notes in accordance with
    the terms of the agreement, in whole or in part at any time at
    our option.

The fair value of our 7.456% Notes was approximately
    $365 million and $517 million as of December 31,
    2008 and 2007, and the fair value of the 8.5% Notes was
    approximately $280 million as of December 31, 2008
    based on quoted market prices.

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

The 7.456% and 8.5% Notes are senior unsecured obligations
    guaranteed by certain domestic Expedia subsidiaries and rank
    equally in right of payment with all of our existing and future
    unsecured and unsubordinated obligations. For further
    information, see Note 19 — Guarantor and
    Non-Guarantor Supplemental Financial Information. Accrued
    interest related to the 7.456% and 8.5% Notes was
    $32 million as of December 31, 2008, and accrued
    interest related to the 7.456% Notes was $14 million
    as of December 31, 2007.

The 7.456% and 8.5% Notes include covenants that limit our
    ability to (i) incur liens, (ii) enter into sale and
    leaseback transactions and (iii) merge, consolidate or sell
    substantially all of our assets.

Credit
    Facility

In July 2005, we entered into a $1 billion five-year
    unsecured revolving credit facility with a group of lenders,
    which is unconditionally guaranteed by certain Expedia
    subsidiaries and expires in August 2010. The $650 million
    carrying amount of the borrowing approximates its fair value as
    of December 31, 2008. The facility bears interest based on
    market interest rates plus a spread, which is determined based
    on our financial leverage. The interest rate was 1.34% as of
    December 31, 2008 and 5.70% as of December 31, 2007.
    The annual fee to maintain the facility ranged from 0.1% to 0.2%
    on the unused portion of the facility, or approximately
    $1 million to $2 million if all of the facility was
    unused. The facility also contained financial covenants
    consisting of a leverage ratio and a minimum tangible net worth
    requirement.

The amount of stand-by letters of credit (“LOC”)
    issued under the facility reduces the amount available to us. As
    of December 31, 2008 and 2007, there were $58 million
    and $52 million of outstanding stand-by LOCs issued under
    the facility.

On February 18, 2009, we amended our credit facility to
    replace our tangible net worth covenant with a minimum interest
    coverage covenant, among other changes. As part of this
    amendment our leverage ratio was tightened, pricing on our
    borrowings increased by 200 basis points and we paid
    approximately $6 million in fees, which will be amortized
    over the remaining term of the credit facility.

NOTE 7 —

Derivative
    Instruments

The fair values of the derivative financial instruments
    generally represent the estimated amounts we would expect to
    receive or pay upon termination of the contracts as of the
    reporting date.

Ask
    Jeeves Notes

As a result of the Spin-Off, we assumed certain obligations of
    IAC related to IAC’s Ask Jeeves Notes. When holders of the
    Ask Jeeves Notes convert their notes, they received shares of
    both IAC and Expedia common stock. Under the terms of the
    Spin-Off, we were obligated to issue shares of our common stock
    to IAC for delivery to the holders of the Ask Jeeves Notes, or
    pay cash in equal value, in lieu of issuing such shares, at our
    option. This obligation represented a derivative liability on
    our consolidated balance sheet because it was not indexed solely
    to shares of our common stock. We recorded the fair value of
    this derivative obligation on our consolidated balance sheets
    with any changes in fair value recorded in our consolidated
    statements of operations in Other, net. The estimated fair value
    of this liability fluctuated primarily based on changes in the
    price of our common stock.

In 2008, the remainder of these notes converted and we released
    approximately 0.5 million shares of our common stock with a
    fair value of $11 million to satisfy the final conversion
    requirements. In 2008, 2007 and 2006, we recognized net gains
    (losses) of $4 million, $(5) million and $8 million
    related to these Ask Jeeves Notes. As of June 1, 2008, we
    had no further obligations related to the Ask Jeeves Notes. As
    of December 31, 2007, the related derivative liability
    balance was $15 million and was included in accrued
    expenses and other current liabilities.

Cross-Currency
    Swaps

We entered into cross-currency swaps to hedge against the change
    in value of certain intercompany loans denominated in currencies
    other than the lending subsidiaries’ functional currency.

In November 2003, we entered into a swap with a notional amount
    of Euro 39 million that matures in October 2013. Under
    the terms of this swap, we paid euro at a rate of the
    three-month EURIBOR plus 0.50% on euro 39 million and
    we received 4.90% interest on $46 million in
    U.S. dollars.

In April 2004, we entered into a swap with a notional amount of
    Euro 38 million that matures in April 2014. Under the
    terms of this swap, we paid euro at a rate of the six-month
    EURIBOR plus 0.90% on euro 38 million and we received
    5.47% interest on $46 million in U.S. dollars.

These swaps were designated as cash flow hedges and were
    re-measured at fair value each reporting period. The fair values
    of our cross-currency swaps were determined using Level 2
    valuation techniques, as defined in SFAS 157, and were
    based on the present value of net future cash payments and
    receipts, which fluctuate based on changes in market interest
    rates and the euro/U.S. dollar exchange rate.

During the third quarter of 2008, we terminated our
    cross-currency swap agreements for a cost of $17 million
    and concurrently capitalized the underlying intercompany loans.
    As a result of these transactions, we recognized a net gain of
    less than $1 million. At the time of termination,
    $13 million of cash collateral was held by the counterparty
    resulting in a net liability of $4 million that was unpaid
    as of December 31, 2008 and was classified in accrued
    expenses and other current liabilities. As of December 31,
    2007, we had a $21 million cross-currency swap liability
    included in other long-term liabilities and a corresponding
    $21 million asset for cash collateral held by our
    counterparty included in long-term investments and other assets.

Stock
    Warrants

In connection with prior transactions, IAC assumed a number of
    stock warrants that were adjusted to become exercisable into IAC
    common stock and subsequent to the Spin-Off, also into our
    common stock. As of December 31, 2008, there are
    approximately 42,700 of these stock warrants outstanding with
    expiration dates through May 2010. Each stock warrant represents
    the right to receive the number of shares of IAC common stock
    and Expedia common stock that the stock warrant holder would
    have received had the holder exercised the stock warrant
    immediately prior to the Spin-Off. Under the terms of the
    Spin-Off between IAC and Expedia, we assumed the obligation to
    deliver our common stock to the stock warrant holders upon
    exercise and will receive a portion of the proceeds from
    exercise. This obligation represents a derivative instrument
    that we record at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets
    with any changes in value recorded in our consolidated
    statements of operations in Other, net. The estimated fair value
    of this liability fluctuates based on changes in the price of
    our common stock.

NOTE 8 —

Employee
    Benefit Plans

Our U.S. employees are generally eligible to participate in
    a retirement and savings plan that qualifies under
    Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Participating
    employees may contribute up to 16% of their pretax salary, but
    not more than statutory limits. We contribute fifty cents for
    each dollar a participant contributes in this plan, with a
    maximum contribution of 3% of a participant’s earnings. Our
    contribution vests with the employee after the employee
    completes two years of service. Participating employees have the
    option to invest in our common stock, but there is no
    requirement for participating employees to invest their
    contribution or our matching contribution in our common stock.
    We also have various defined contribution plans for our
    international employees. Our contributions to these benefit
    plans were $12 million, $9 million and $8 million
    for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006.

Stock-Based
    Awards and Other Equity Instruments

Pursuant to the 2005 Expedia, Inc. Stock and Annual Incentive
    Plan, we may grant restricted stock, restricted stock awards,
    RSUs, stock options and other stock-based awards to directors,
    officers, employees and consultants. As of December 31,
    2008, we had approximately 8 million shares of common stock
    reserved for new stock-based awards under the 2005 Stock and
    Annual Incentive Plan. We issue new shares to satisfy the
    exercise or release of stock-based awards.

RSUs, which are stock awards that are granted to employees
    entitling the holder to shares of our common stock as the award
    vests, have been our primary form of stock-based award. We
    record RSUs that will settle in cash as a liability and we
    remeasure them to fair value at the end of each reporting
    period. These awards that settle in cash and the resulting
    liability are insignificant. Our RSUs generally vest over five
    years, but may accelerate in certain circumstances, including
    certain changes in control.

In 2008, 2007 and 2006, we recognized stock-based compensation
    expense of $61 million, $63 million and
    $80 million. The total income tax benefit related to
    stock-based compensation expense was $21 million,
    $22 million and $27 million for 2008, 2007 and 2006.

Cash received from stock-based award exercises for the years
    ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 was $6 million and
    $55 million. Our employees that held IAC vested stock
    options prior to the Spin-Off received vested stock options in
    both Expedia and IAC. As these stock options are exercised, we
    receive a tax deduction. Total current income tax benefits
    during the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007
    associated with the exercise of IAC and Expedia stock-based
    awards held by our employees were $19 million and
    $121 million, of which we recorded approximately
    $2 million and $9 million as a reduction of goodwill.

In the fourth quarter of 2007, our Chairman and Senior Executive
    exercised options to purchase 9.5 million shares.
    2.3 million shares were withheld and concurrently cancelled
    by the Company to cover the exercise price of $8.59 per share
    and 3.5 million shares were withheld and concurrently
    cancelled to cover tax obligations, with a net delivery of
    3.7 million shares.

As of December 31, 2008, there was approximately
    $131 million of unrecognized stock-based compensation
    expense, net of estimated forfeitures, related to unvested
    stock-based awards, which is expected to be recognized in
    expense over a weighted-average period of 3.21 years.

For all periods presented, we have computed current and deferred
    tax expense using our stand-alone effective tax rate. As of
    December 31, 2008, our current income tax payable
    represents amounts that we will pay to the Internal Revenue
    Service (“IRS”) and other tax authorities based on our
    taxable income.

We reduced our current income tax payable by $19 million,
    $121 million and $34 million for the years ended
    December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, for tax deductions
    attributable to stock-based compensation. For 2008, 2007 and
    2006, we recorded $2 million, $9 million and
    $17 million of the related income tax benefits of this
    stock-based compensation as a reduction of goodwill.

At December 31, 2008, we had federal, state and foreign net
    operating loss carryforwards (“NOLs”) of approximately
    $10 million, $53 million and $70 million. If not
    utilized, the federal and state NOLs will expire at various
    times between 2009 and 2028, $65 million foreign NOLs can
    be carried forward indefinitely, and $5 million foreign
    NOLs will expire at various times between 2009 and 2028.

At December 31, 2008, we had a valuation allowance of
    approximately $32 million related to the portion of net
    operating loss carryforwards and other items for which it is
    more likely than not that the tax benefit will not be realized.
    This amount represented an increase of approximately
    $4 million over the amount recorded as of December 31,
    2007 and was primarily attributable to an increase in foreign
    operating losses.

By virtue of the previously filed separate company and
    consolidated income tax returns filed with IAC, we are routinely
    under audit by federal, state, local and foreign authorities.
    These audits include questioning the timing and the amount of
    income and deductions and the allocation of income among various
    tax jurisdictions. Annual tax provisions include amounts
    considered sufficient to pay assessments that may result from
    the examination of prior year returns. We are no longer subject
    to tax examinations by tax authorities for years prior to 1998.

On January 1, 2007, we adopted FIN 48,

Accounting

As of December 31, 2008, we had $180 million of
    unrecognized tax benefits, of which $190 million is
    classified as long-term and included in Other long-term
    liabilities.

Included in the balance at December 31, 2008 and 2007 were
    $68 million and $17 million of liabilities for
    uncertain tax positions that, if recognized, would decrease our
    provision for income taxes. Also included in the balance at
    December 31, 2008 were $122 million, of which
    $3 million and $95 million was added in 2008 and 2007,
    of excess tax benefits that resulted from our Chairman and
    Senior Executive’s exercises of stock options during 2007
    and 2005. If the IRS were to make a final determination that IAC
    and not Expedia were entitled to such deductions, then under the
    terms of our tax sharing agreement, IAC would pay to Expedia an
    amount equal to any such tax benefit at such time as it were
    actually realized by IAC. Therefore, an unfavorable outcome
    related to this position would not materially impact our cash
    flows.

We recognize interest and penalties related to our liabilities
    for uncertain tax positions in income tax expense. As of
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, we had approximately
    $24 million and $11 million accrued for the potential
    payment of estimated interest and penalties. During the years

NOTE 11 —

Stockholders’
    Equity

Common
    Stock and Class B Common Stock

Our authorized common stock consists of 1.6 billion shares
    of common stock with par value of $0.001 per share, and
    400 million shares of Class B common stock with par
    value of $0.001 per share. Both classes of common stock qualify
    for and would share equally in dividends, if declared by our
    Board of Directors, and generally vote together on all matters.
    Common stock is entitled to one vote per share and Class B
    common stock is entitled to 10 votes per share. Holders of
    common stock, voting as a single, separate class are entitled to
    elect 25% of the total number of directors. Class B common
    stockholders may, at any time, convert their shares into common
    stock, on a one for one share basis. Upon conversion, the
    Class B common stock is retired and is not available for
    reissue. In the event of liquidation, dissolution, distribution
    of assets or

winding-up

of Expedia, Inc., the holders of both classes of common stock
    have equal rights to receive all the assets of Expedia, Inc.
    after the rights of the holders of the preferred stock have been
    satisfied.

Preferred
    Stock

Our preferred stock has a face value of $22.23 per share; each
    share is entitled to an annual dividend of 1.99%. Each preferred
    stockholder is entitled to two votes per share. Preferred
    stockholders may, at certain times through 2017, elect to have
    their shares redeemed or elect to convert their shares into
    common stock based upon formulas described in the related
    Certificate of Designations of Series A Cumulative
    Convertible Preferred Stock of Expedia, Inc. Beginning
    February 4, 2012, we may redeem the preferred stock for
    cash or common stock. On February 4, 2022, all outstanding
    shares of preferred stock automatically convert into common
    stock.

Share
    Repurchases

During 2007, we completed two tender offers pursuant to which we
    acquired 30 million tendered shares of our common stock at
    a purchase price of $22.00 per share and 25 million
    tendered shares of our common stock at $29.00 per share, for a
    total cost of $1.4 billion plus fees and expenses relating
    to the tender offers.

During 2006, we completed the repurchase of 20 million
    shares of our common stock for a total cost of
    $288 million, representing an average price of $14.42 per
    share including transaction costs. All shares were repurchased
    in the open market at prevailing market prices.

In addition, during 2006 our Board of Directors authorized share
    repurchases of up to 20 million outstanding shares of our
    common stock. As of February 13, 2009, we had not made any
    share repurchases under this specific authorization. There is no
    fixed termination date for the repurchase. The amount of
    repurchases we may make under this authorization are subject to
    certain of our debt covenants.

Earnings
    Per Share

Basic
    Earnings Per Share

Basic earnings per share was calculated for the years ended
    December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 using the weighted average
    number of common and Class B common shares outstanding
    during the period excluding restricted stock and stock held in
    escrow. As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, we had
    751 shares of preferred stock outstanding, the impact of
    which on our earnings per share calculation is immaterial.

Diluted
    Earnings Per Share

For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, we
    computed diluted earnings per share using (i) the number of
    shares of common stock and Class B common stock used in the
    basic earnings per share calculation as indicated above
    (ii) if dilutive, the incremental common stock that we
    would issue upon the assumed exercise of stock options and stock
    warrants and the vesting of restricted stock units using the
    treasury stock method, and (iii) the shares we were
    contractually obligated to issue associated with the Ask Jeeves
    Notes, if converted, and other stock-based commitments.

In 2008, in connection with the closing of an acquisition and
    the related holding of euros to economically hedge the purchase
    price, we recognized a net loss of $21 million, included in
    foreign exchange rate gains (losses), net.

In 2007, we recorded refunds based on notification from the IRS
    totaling $15 million related to Federal Excise Tax
    (“FET”) taxes remitted to the IRS but not collected
    from customers for airline ticket sales by one of our
    subsidiaries in the third quarter of 2001 through the third
    quarter of 2004, plus accrued interest thereon. We recorded
    $3 million to revenue as that amount relates to taxes
    remitted on airline ticket sales subsequent to our acquisition
    of the subsidiary. We recorded $12 million to Other, net
    for taxes remitted on airline ticket sales prior to the
    acquisition and total interest earned on all underlying tax
    remittances.

Our purchase obligations represent the minimum obligations we
    have under agreements with certain of our vendors. These minimum
    obligations are less than our projected use for those periods.
    Payments may be more than the minimum obligations based on
    actual use.

We have guarantees primarily related to a specific country
    aviation authority for the potential non-delivery, by us, of
    packaged travel sold in that country. The authority also
    requires that a portion of the total amount of packaged travel
    sold be bonded.

Our LOCs consist of stand-by LOCs, underwritten by a group of
    lenders, which we primarily issue to certain hotel properties to
    secure our payment for hotel room transactions. The contractual
    expiration dates of these LOCs are shown in the table above.
    There were no claims made against any stand-by LOCs during the
    years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006.

Lease
    Commitments

We have contractual obligations in the form of operating leases
    for office space and related office equipment for which we
    record the related expense on a monthly basis. Certain leases
    contain periodic rent escalation adjustments and renewal
    options. Rent expense related to such leases is recorded on a
    straight-line basis. Operating lease obligations expire at
    various dates with the latest maturity in 2018. For the years
    ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, we recorded rental
    expense of $49 million, $33 million and
    $30 million.

Legal
    Proceedings

In the ordinary course of business, we are a party to various
    lawsuits. In the opinion of management, we do not expect these
    lawsuits to have a material impact on the liquidity, results of
    operations, or financial condition of Expedia. We also evaluate
    other potential contingent matters, including value-added tax,
    federal excise tax, transient occupancy or accommodation tax and
    similar matters. We do not believe that the aggregate amount of
    liability that could be reasonably possible with respect to
    these matters would have a material adverse effect on our
    financial results.

Securities Related Class Action
    Litigations.

While we are not a party to the
    securities litigation filed against IAC, under the terms of our
    separation agreement with IAC, we have generally agreed to bear
    a portion of the costs and liabilities, if any, associated with
    any securities law litigation relating to conduct prior to the
    Spin-Off of the businesses or entities that comprise Expedia
    following the Spin-Off. This case arises out of IAC’s
    August 4, 2004, announcement of its earnings for the second
    quarter of 2004.

Litigation relating to the IAC/hotels.com merger agreement
    announced April 10, 2003, is pending in Delaware. The
    principal claim in these actions is that the defendants breached
    their fiduciary duty to the plaintiffs by entering into or
    approving the merger agreement.

Litigation Relating to Hotel Occupancy
    Taxes.

Lawsuits have been filed by forty-four
    cities and counties involving hotel occupancy taxes. In
    addition, there have been six consumer lawsuits filed relating
    to taxes and fees. The municipality and consumer lawsuits are in
    various stages ranging from responding to the complaint to
    discovery. We continue to defend these lawsuits vigorously. To
    date, fifteen of the municipality lawsuits have been dismissed.
    Most of these dismissals have been without prejudice and,
    generally, allow the municipality to seek administrative
    remedies prior to pursuing further litigation. Five dismissals
    (Pitt County, North Carolina; Findlay, Ohio; Columbus and
    Dayton, Ohio; City of Orange, Texas; and Louisville, Kentucky)
    were based on a finding that the defendants were not subject to
    the local hotel occupancy tax ordinance. As a result of this
    litigation and other attempts by certain jurisdictions to levy
    such taxes, we have established a reserve for the potential
    settlement of issues related to hotel occupancy taxes in the
    amount of $20 million and $19 million at
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Our reserve is
    based on our best estimate and the ultimate resolution of these
    issues may be greater or less than the liabilities recorded.

In connection with various occupancy tax audits and assessments,
    certain jurisdictions require that tax payers pay any assessed
    taxes prior to being allowed to contest or litigate the
    applicability of the ordinances, which is referred to as
    “pay to play.” We have been assessed approximately
    $8.2 million in taxes, plus $9.5 million in penalties
    and interest by the city of Anaheim, which has a “pay to
    play” tax ordinance. To preserve our right to contest this
    assessment, it is possible that we may be required to make a
    payment to Anaheim, as well as to other California jurisdictions
    that make similar assessments. We are challenging the
    city’s purported right to require us to pay the tax
    assessment prior to commencing litigation. Other jurisdictions
    may also attempt to require that we pay any assessed taxes prior
    to being allowed to contest or litigate the applicability of
    similar tax ordinances. Payment of these amounts is not an
    admission that we believe we are subject to such taxes and we
    intend to continue defending our position vigorously.

NOTE 15 —

Related
    Party Transactions

In connection with the Spin-Off, we entered into various
    agreements with IAC, a related party due to common ownership, to
    provide for an orderly transition and to govern our ongoing
    relationships with IAC. These agreements include, among others,
    a separation agreement, a tax sharing agreement, an employee
    matters agreement and a transition services agreement.

In addition, in conjunction with the Spin-Off, we entered into a
    joint ownership and cost sharing agreement with IAC, under which
    IAC transferred to us 50% ownership in an airplane, which is
    available for use by both companies. We share equally in capital
    costs; operating costs are pro-rated based on actual usage.

F-35


Expedia,
    Inc.

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

In May 2006, the airplane was placed in service and is being
    depreciated over 10 years. As of December 31, 2008 and
    2007, the net basis in our ownership interest was
    $18 million and $19 million recorded in Long-term
    investments and other assets. In 2008 and 2007, operating and
    maintenance costs paid directly to the jointly-owned subsidiary
    for the airplane were $400,000 for both periods.

On August 20, 2008, IAC completed its plan to separate into
    five publicly traded companies. With this separation, we expect
    our related party transactions with the newly constituted IAC to
    be immaterial on a go-forward basis. In 2008, we paid
    $4 million to IAC businesses. In 2007, we received $100,000
    from IAC businesses, and paid $8 million to IAC businesses.
    In 2006, we received $2 million from IAC businesses, and
    paid $31 million to IAC businesses.

In the fourth quarter of 2006, eLong sold one of its businesses
    to a subsidiary of IAC for approximately $15 million.

NOTE 16 —

Segment
    Information

We have two reportable segments: North America and Europe. We
    determined our segments based on how our chief operating
    decision makers manage our business, make operating decisions
    and evaluate operating performance. Our primary operating metric
    for evaluating segment performance is “Operating Income
    Before Amortization” (OIBA as defined below), which
    includes allocations of certain expenses, primarily cost of
    revenue and facilities, to the segments. We base the allocations
    primarily on transaction volumes and other usage metrics; this
    methodology is periodically evaluated and may change. We do not
    allocate certain shared expenses such as partner services,
    product development, accounting, human resources and legal to
    our reportable segments. We include these expenses in Corporate
    and Other.

Our North America segment provides a full range of travel

and/or

advertising services to customers primarily located in the
    United States, Canada and Mexico. This segment operates through
    a variety of brands including Classic Vacations, Expedia.com,
    hotels.com, Hotwire.com and the TripAdvisor Media Network. Our
    Europe segment provides travel services primarily through
    localized Expedia websites in Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France,
    Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden
    and the United Kingdom, as well as localized versions of
    hotels.com in various European countries. In addition, Venere is
    included within our Europe segment from its acquisition date in
    the third quarter of 2008 forward.

Corporate and Other includes Egencia, Expedia Asia Pacific and
    unallocated corporate functions and expenses. Egencia provides
    travel products and services to corporate customers in North
    America, Europe and the Asia Pacific region. Expedia Asia
    Pacific provides online travel information and reservation
    services primarily through eLong in China, localized Expedia
    websites in Australia, India, Japan and New Zealand, as well as
    localized versions of hotels.com in various Asian countries. In
    addition, we record amortization of intangible assets, any
    impairment charges and stock-based compensation expense in
    Corporate and Other.

We are in the process of reorganizing our business around our
    global brands. Our chief operating decision makers are assessing
    our new structure to determine how we will manage our business
    and report our financial results. Beginning in the first quarter
    of 2009, we expect our reportable segments to change as we will
    no longer manage the business on a geographical basis.

The following table presents our segment information for the
    years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006. As a
    significant portion of our property and equipment is not
    allocated to our operating segments, we do not report the assets
    or related depreciation expense as it would not be meaningful,
    nor do we regularly provide such information to our chief
    operating decision makers.

Definition
    of Operating Income Before Amortization

We provide OIBA as a supplemental measure to GAAP operating
    income (loss) and net income (loss). We define OIBA as operating
    income (loss) plus: (1) stock-based compensation expense,
    (2) amortization of intangible assets and goodwill and
    intangible asset impairment, if applicable,
    (3) amortization of non-cash distribution and marketing
    expense and (4) certain one-time items, if applicable.

OIBA is the primary operating metric used by which management
    evaluates the performance of our business, on which internal
    budgets are based, and by which management is compensated.
    Management believes that investors should have access to the
    same set of tools that management uses to analyze our results.
    This non-GAAP measure should be considered in addition to
    results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be
    considered a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP. We endeavor
    to compensate for the limitation of the non-GAAP measure
    presented by also providing the comparable GAAP measure, GAAP
    financial statements, and descriptions of the reconciling items
    and adjustments, to derive the non-GAAP measure. We present a
    reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial measure to GAAP below.

OIBA represents the combined operating results of Expedia,
    Inc.’s businesses, taking into account depreciation of
    property and equipment (including internal-use software and
    website development), which we believe is an ongoing cost of
    doing business, but excluding the effects of other non-cash
    expenses that may not be indicative of our core business
    operations. We believe this performance measure is useful to
    investors for the following reasons:

•

It corresponds more closely to the cash operating income
    generated from our core operations by excluding significant
    non-cash operating expenses; and

•

It provides greater insight into management decision making at
    Expedia, as OIBA is our primary internal metric for evaluating
    the performance of our business.

OIBA has certain limitations in that it does not take into
    account the impact of certain expenses to our consolidated
    statements of operations, including stock-based compensation,
    non-cash payments to partners, acquisition-related accounting
    and certain one-time items, if applicable.
