Part I

Item 1:   Business

Overview

J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. (“JPMorgan Chase” or “the Firm”) is a
financial holding company incorporated under Delaware law in
1968. As of December 31, 2001, JPMorgan Chase was one of
the largest banking institutions in the United States, with $694
billion in assets and $41 billion in stockholders’ equity.

On December 31, 2000, J.P. Morgan & Co. Incorporated
(“J.P. Morgan”) merged with and into The Chase Manhattan
Corporation (“Chase”). Upon completion of the merger, Chase
changed its name to “J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.” The merger
was accounted for as a pooling of interests. As a result, the
financial information provided herein presents the combined
results of Chase and J.P. Morgan as if the merger had been in
effect for all periods presented. In addition, certain prior-period
amounts for the predecessor institutions’ financial statements
have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation.

JPMorgan Chase is a global financial services firm with operations in over 50 countries. Its principal bank subsidiaries are
JPMorgan Chase Bank (“JPMorgan Chase Bank”), a New York
banking corporation headquartered in New York City, and Chase
Manhattan Bank USA, National Association, headquartered in
Delaware (“Chase USA”). The Firm’s principal nonbank subsidiary
is its investment bank, J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. (“JPMSI”).

The bank and nonbank subsidiaries of JPMorgan Chase operate
nationally as well as through overseas branches and subsidiaries,
representative offices and affiliated banks.

Business segments

JPMorgan Chase’s activities are internally organized, for management reporting purposes, into five major business segments
(Investment Bank, Treasury & Securities Services, Investment
Management & Private Banking, JPMorgan Partners and Retail
& Middle Market Financial Services). A description of the Firm’s
business segments and the products and services they provide
to their respective client bases are discussed in the “Segment
results” section of Management’s Discussion and Analysis
(“MD&A”) beginning on page 28 and Note 29 on page 96.

Competition

JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries and affiliates operate in a
highly competitive environment. Competitors include other
banks, brokerage firms, investment banking companies, merchant
banks, insurance companies, mutual fund companies, credit card
companies, mortgage banking companies, automobile financing
companies, leasing companies, e-commerce and other Internet-based companies, and a variety of other financial services and
advisory companies. JPMorgan Chase’s businesses compete with
these other firms with respect to the range of products and services offered and the types of clients, customers, industries and
geographies served. In addition, the Firm competes with these
firms in attracting and retaining its professional and other personnel, particularly as it has continued to build its Investment
Bank and Investment Management & Private Banking platforms.

The financial services industry has experienced consolidation and
convergence in recent years, as financial institutions involved in
a broad range of financial services industries have merged, of
which the merger of Chase and J.P. Morgan is an example. This
convergence trend is expected to continue and could result in
competitors of JPMorgan Chase gaining greater capital and other
resources, such as a broader range of products and services and
geographic diversity. It is possible that competition will become
even more intense as a result of the enactment of the financial
modernization legislation discussed in more detail below.

Supervision and regulation

Permissible business activities; financial modernization
legislation; conversion to financial holding company:

The Firm is subject to regulation under state and federal law,
including the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended
(the “BHCA”). In November 1999, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act
(“GLBA”) was enacted which eliminated certain legal barriers
separating the conduct of various types of financial services
businesses, such as commercial banking, investment banking
and insurance. In addition, GLBA substantially revamped the
regulatory scheme within which financial institutions such as
JPMorgan Chase operate.

Under GLBA, bank holding companies meeting certain eligibility
criteria may elect to become “financial holding companies,”
which may engage in any activities that are “financial in nature,”
as well as in additional activities that the Board of Governors of
the Federal Reserve System (the “Federal Reserve Board”) and
the United States Department of the Treasury (“U.S. Treasury
Department”) determine are financial in nature or incidental or
complementary to financial activities. Under GLBA, “financial
activities” specifically include insurance, securities underwriting
and dealing, merchant banking, investment advisory and lending
activities. JPMorgan Chase elected to become a financial holding
company as of March 13, 2000. Upon the Firm’s election to
become a financial holding company:

•

Various restrictions imposed by the Glass-Steagall Act were
eliminated, including restrictions on: (1) affiliations between
JPMorgan Chase’s bank subsidiaries and certain securities
firms, (2) JPMorgan Chase’s ability to control and distribute
mutual funds and (3) the portion of JPMorgan Chase’s revenues that could be derived from securities underwriting
and dealing activities;

•

BHCA restrictions on the Firm’s ability to acquire substantial
equity ownership or control of nonfinancial companies were
eliminated in the merchant banking context, thereby permitting certain nonbank subsidiaries of JPMorgan Chase to make
merchant banking investments up to 100% of the voting
shares of a nonfinancial company, subject to conditions



Part I

imposed by GLBA and regulations promulgated by the Federal
Reserve Board and the U.S. Treasury Department, including a
prohibition on routinely managing or operating such a non-financial company; and

•

Limitations on JPMorgan Chase’s insurance activities were
eliminated.

Under regulations implemented by the Federal Reserve Board,
if any depository institution controlled by a financial holding
company ceases to be “well-capitalized” or “well-managed” (as
defined below), the Federal Reserve Board may impose corrective
capital or managerial requirements on the financial holding company and place limitations on its ability to conduct the broader
financial activities permissible for financial holding companies.

In addition, the Federal Reserve Board may require divestiture of
the holding company’s depository institutions if the deficiencies
persist. The regulations also provide that if any depository institution controlled by a financial holding company fails to maintain
a satisfactory rating under the Community Reinvestment Act
(“CRA”), the Federal Reserve Board must prohibit the financial
holding company and its subsidiaries from engaging in any additional activities other than those permissible for bank holding
companies that are not financial holding companies. The depository institution subsidiaries of JPMorgan Chase currently meet
the capital, management and CRA requirements necessary to
permit the Firm to conduct the broader activities permitted under
GLBA. However, there can be no assurance that this will continue
to be the case in the future.

Regulation by Federal Reserve Board under GLBA:

Under
GLBA’s system of “functional regulation,” the Federal Reserve
Board acts as an “umbrella regulator,” and certain of JPMorgan
Chase’s subsidiaries are regulated directly by additional regulatory
authorities based on the particular activities of those subsidiaries
(e.g., securities and investment advisory activities are regulated
by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), and
insurance activities are regulated by state insurance commissioners). The Firm must continue to file reports and other information
with, and submit to examination by, the Federal Reserve Board
as umbrella regulator. However, under GLBA, with respect to
matters affecting functionally regulated subsidiaries, the Federal
Reserve Board is required to defer to the applicable functional
regulators unless the Federal Reserve Board concludes that the
activities at issue pose a risk to a depository institution or
breach a specific law the Federal Reserve Board has authority
to enforce.

Impact of GLBA on activities of subsidiaries of banks:

Under GLBA, subject to certain conditions imposed by their
respective banking regulators, national and state-chartered
banks are permitted to form “financial subsidiaries” that may
conduct financial or incidental activities, thereby permitting bank
subsidiaries to engage in certain activities that previously were
impermissible. In order to insulate the parent bank from the risk
of these new financial activities, GLBA imposes several safeguards
and restrictions on financial subsidiaries, including that the bank’s
equity investment in the financial subsidiary be deducted from
the bank’s assets and tangible equity for purposes of calculating
the bank’s capital adequacy. In addition, GLBA imposes new
restrictions on transactions between the bank and its financial
subsidiaries similar to restrictions applicable to transactions
between banks and nonbank affiliates. See “FDICIA” and
“Other supervision and regulation” below.

Effect of GLBA on bank broker-dealer and investment
advisory activities:

To promote the system of functional
regulation described above, GLBA provides for the amendment
of certain federal securities laws to eliminate various exemptions
previously available to banks. For example, banks will no longer
be generally exempt from the broker-dealer provisions of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934. As a result, JPMorgan Chase’s
bank subsidiaries will either need to register with the SEC
as broker-dealers or cease conducting many activities deemed
broker-dealer activities. GLBA does retain a more limited
exemption from broker-dealer registration for certain “banking”
products and activities, including, among others, municipal and
exempted securities transactions; safe keeping and custody
arrangements; and trust, securitization and derivatives products
and activities. The Investment Advisers Act of 1940 has also been
amended to eliminate certain provisions exempting banks from
the registration requirements of that statute, and the Investment
Company Act of 1940 has been amended to provide the SEC
with regulatory authority over various bank mutual fund activities.
The provisions discussed in this paragraph had an original effective date of May 12, 2001. The SEC has delayed the effective
date of the provisions dealing with broker-dealer registration
requirements until May 12, 2002 and has stated that banks will
be given sufficient lead time to comply with the SEC’s implementing regulations.

Dividend restrictions:

Federal law imposes limitations on the
payment of dividends by the subsidiaries of JPMorgan Chase
that are chartered by a state and are member banks of the
Federal Reserve System (a “state member bank”) or national
banks. Nonbank subsidiaries of JPMorgan Chase are not subject
to those limitations. The amount of dividends that may be paid
by a state member bank, such as JPMorgan Chase Bank, or by
a national bank, such as Chase USA, is limited to the lesser of
the amounts calculated under a “recent earnings” test and an
“undivided profits” test. Under the recent earnings test, a dividend may not be paid if the total of all dividends declared by a
bank in any calendar year is in excess of the current year’s net
income combined with the retained net income of the two preceding years, unless the bank obtains the approval of its appropriate federal banking regulator (which, in the case of a state
member bank, is the Federal Reserve Board and, in the case of
a national bank, is the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency
(the “Comptroller of the Currency”)). Under the undivided profits
test, a dividend may not be paid in excess of a bank’s “undivided
profits.” Similar restrictions on the payment of dividends by
JPMorgan Chase Bank are imposed by New York law. See Note
20 on page 88 for the amount of dividends that the Firm’s
principal bank subsidiaries could pay, at December 31, 2001 and
2000, to their respective bank holding companies without the
approval of their relevant banking regulators.



In addition to the dividend restrictions described above, the
Federal Reserve Board, the Comptroller of the Currency and the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) have authority
to prohibit or to limit the payment of dividends by the banking
organizations they supervise, including JPMorgan Chase and its
bank and bank holding company subsidiaries, if, in the banking
regulator’s opinion, payment of a dividend would constitute an
unsafe or unsound practice in light of the financial condition of
the banking organization.

Capital requirements:

The federal banking regulators have
adopted risk-based capital and leverage guidelines that require
that the Firm’s capital-to-assets ratios meet certain minimum
standards.

The risk-based capital ratio is determined by allocating assets
and specified off-balance sheet financial instruments into four
weighted categories, with higher levels of capital being required
for the categories perceived as representing greater risk. Under
the guidelines, capital is divided into two tiers: Tier 1 capital and
Tier 2 capital. For a further discussion of Tier 1 capital and Tier 2
capital, see Note 21 on page 88. The amount of Tier 2 capital
may not exceed the amount of Tier 1 capital. Total capital is the
sum of Tier 1 capital and Tier 2 capital.

Banking organizations are required to maintain a total capital
ratio (total capital to risk-weighted assets) of 8% and a Tier 1
capital ratio of 4%.

The risk-based capital requirements explicitly identify concentrations of credit risk and certain risks arising from non-traditional
activities, and the management of those risks, as important factors
to consider in assessing an institution’s overall capital adequacy.
Other factors taken into consideration by federal regulators
include: interest rate exposure; liquidity, funding and market risk;
the quality and level of earnings; the quality of loans and investments; the effectiveness of loan and investment policies; and
management’s overall ability to monitor and control financial and
operational risks, including the risks presented by concentrations
of credit and non-traditional activities. In addition, the risk-based
capital rules incorporate a measure for market risk in foreign
exchange and commodity activities and in the trading of debt
and equity instruments. The market risk-based capital rules
require banking organizations with large trading activities (such as
JPMorgan Chase) to maintain capital for market risk in an amount
calculated by using the banking organizations’ own internal
Value-at-Risk models (subject to parameters set by the regulators).

Subject to certain transition rules, the federal banking agencies
amended their regulatory capital standards effective January 1,
2002 to address the treatment of residual interests, recourse
obligations and direct credit substitutes.

The amendment defines “residual interests” as on-balance sheet
interests that are retained by a seller after a securitization or
other transfer of financial assets and that expose the seller to a
greater than

pro rata

share of the credit risk in such assets.
Under the amendment, risk-based capital must be held in an
amount equal to such residual interests even if that amount
exceeds the full risk-based capital charge that would have been
required to be held against the assets transferred. The amendment
also imposes a concentration limit of 25% of Tier 1 capital on
credit-enhancing interest-only strips (a type of residual interest),
requiring any amount in excess of that limit to be deducted from
Tier 1 capital.

The amendment also treats recourse obligations and direct credit
substitutes (such as letters of credit) more consistently for risk-based capital purposes than previously. The amendment introduces
a multi-level approach to assessing capital requirements to positions in certain asset securitizations based on the credit ratings
assigned to such position by nationally recognized statistical
rating organizations (NRSROs). For certain unrated positions
other than residual interests, the amendment provides alternative
methods for assessing capital requirements, including the limited
use of a banking organization’s internal risk rating system, and,
for positions arising under securitization programs covering multiple participants, ratings assigned to the program by NRSROs.

Effective April 1, 2002, the federal banking agencies adopted
regulations that impose increased capital charges on a banking
organization’s equity investments in nonfinancial companies. In
general, the new risk-based capital requirements apply to such
investments regardless of the legal authority under which they
are made. The level of capital charge increases as the banking
organization’s concentration in such investments increases. If the
aggregate value of a banking organization’s nonfinancial equity
investments is less than 15% of its Tier 1 capital, then 8% of
such value is required to be deducted from the banking
organization’s Tier 1 capital. If the aggregate value of a banking organization’s nonfinancial equity investments is more than 15% but less
than 25% of the banking organization’s Tier 1 capital, then the
deduction increases to 12% of such value, and if such aggregate
value is more than 25% of the banking organization’s Tier 1
capital then the deduction rises to 25%. The new charges do
not apply to investments made prior to March 13, 2000. Equity
investments made through small business investment companies
in an amount up to 15% of the banking organization’s
Tier 1 capital are exempt from the new charges, but the full
amount of the equity investments are still included when calculating
the aggregate value of the banking organization’s nonfinancial equity investments.

The federal banking regulators have established minimum leverage ratio guidelines. The leverage ratio is defined as Tier 1 capital
divided by average total assets (net of allowance for loan losses,
goodwill and certain intangible assets). The minimum leverage
ratio is 3% for strong bank holding companies (i.e., those rated
composite 1 under the Bank subsidiaries, Other subsidiaries,
Parent company, Earnings and Capital adequacy, or “BOPEC,”
rating system) and for bank holding companies that have implemented the Federal Reserve Board’s risk-based capital measure
for market risk. Other bank holding companies must have a
minimum leverage ratio of 4%. Bank holding companies may
be expected to maintain ratios well above the minimum levels
depending upon their particular condition, risk profile and
growth plans.



Part I

Tier 1 components: capital surplus and common stock remain
the most important forms of capital at JPMorgan Chase. Because
common equity has no maturity date and because dividends on
common stock are paid only when and if declared by the Board
of Directors, common equity is available to absorb losses over
long periods of time. Noncumulative perpetual preferred stock is
similar to common stock in its ability to absorb losses. If the
Board of Directors does not declare a dividend on noncumulative
perpetual preferred stock in any dividend period, the holders
of the instrument are never entitled to receive that dividend
payment. JPMorgan Chase’s outstanding noncumulative preferred
stock is a type commonly referenced as a “FRAP”: a fixed-rate/adjustable preferred stock. However, because the interest rate on
FRAPs may increase (up to a pre-determined ceiling), the Federal
Reserve Board treats the Firm’s noncumulative FRAPs in a manner
similar to cumulative perpetual preferred and trust preferred
securities. The Federal Reserve Board permits cumulative perpetual
preferred stock and trust preferred securities to be included in
Tier 1 capital but only up to certain limits, as these financial
instruments do not provide as strong protection against losses
as common equity and noncumulative, non-FRAP securities.
Cumulative perpetual preferred stock does not have a maturity
date, similar to other forms of Tier 1 capital. However, any dividends not declared on cumulative preferred stock accumulate
and thus continue to be due to the holder of the instrument until
all arrearages are satisfied. Trust preferred securities are a type of
security generally issued by a special purpose trust established
and owned by JPMorgan Chase. Proceeds from the issuance to
the public of the trust preferred security are lent to the Firm for
at least 30 (but not more than 50) years. The intercompany note
that evidences this loan provides that the interest payments by
JPMorgan Chase on the note may be deferred for up to five
years. During the period of any such deferral, no payments of
dividends may be made on any outstanding JPMorgan Chase
preferred or common stock nor on the outstanding trust preferred
securities issued to the public.

Tier 2 components: Long-term subordinated debt (generally
having an initial maturity of 10-12 years) is the primary form of
JPMorgan Chase’s Tier 2 capital. Subordinated debt is deemed a
form of regulatory capital because payments on the debt are
subordinated to other creditors of JPMorgan Chase, including
holders of senior and medium long-term debt and counterparties
on derivative contracts.

Under GLBA, all financial holding companies are bank holding
companies for purposes of the capital requirements described
above. However, GLBA specifically prohibits the Federal Reserve
Board from imposing capital adequacy rules on certain functionally regulated subsidiaries (such as broker-dealers and insurance
companies) that are in compliance with the applicable capital
requirements of their functional regulators.

The minimum risk-based capital requirements adopted by the
federal banking agencies follow the Capital Accord of the Basel
Committee on Banking Supervision. The Basel Committee,
which is comprised of bank supervisors and central banks from
the Group of Ten countries, issued its Capital Accord in 1988 to
achieve convergence in the capital regulations applicable to internationally
active banking organizations. The Basel Committee
issued a proposed replacement for the Capital Accord in
January 2001, and, subsequently, it issued a number of working papers
supplementing various aspects of that replacement (the “New
Accord”). Based on these documents, the New Accord would
adopt a three-pillar framework for addressing capital adequacy.
These pillars would include minimum capital requirements, more
emphasis on supervisory assessment of capital adequacy and
greater reliance on market discipline. Under the New Accord,
minimum capital requirements would be more differentiated
based upon perceived distinctions in creditworthiness. Such
requirements would be based either on ratings assigned by
rating agencies or, in the case of a banking organization that
met certain supervisory standards, on the organization’s internal
credit ratings. The minimum capital requirements in the New
Accord would also incorporate a capital charge for operational
risk. At present, the target date for implementing the New
Accord is 2005.

FDICIA:

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement
Act of 1991 (“FDICIA”) revised certain provisions of the Federal
Deposit Insurance Act, as well as certain other federal banking
statutes. In general, FDICIA provides for expanded regulation of
depository institutions and their affiliates, including parent holding
companies, by their federal banking regulators and requires the
relevant federal banking regulator to take “prompt corrective
action” with respect to a depository institution if that institution
does not meet certain capital adequacy standards.

Pursuant to FDICIA, the Federal Reserve Board, the FDIC and the
Comptroller of the Currency adopted regulations setting forth a
five-tier scheme for measuring the capital adequacy of the
depository institutions they supervise. Under the regulations
(commonly referred to as the “prompt corrective action” rules),
an institution would be placed in one of the following five capital
categories when these ratios fall within the prescribed ranges:



An institution may be treated as being in a capital category lower
than that indicated based on other supervisory criteria.

Supervisory actions by the appropriate federal banking regulator
under the “prompt corrective action” rules generally will depend
upon an institution’s classification within the five capital categories. The regulations apply only to banks and not to bank
holding companies such as JPMorgan Chase; however, subject to
limitations that may be imposed pursuant to GLBA, as described
below, the Federal Reserve Board is authorized to take appropriate
action at the holding company level based on the undercapitalized
status of the holding company’s subsidiary banking institutions. In
certain instances relating to an undercapitalized banking institution,
the bank holding company would be required to guarantee the
performance of the undercapitalized subsidiary and may be liable
for civil money damages for failure to fulfill its commitments on
that guarantee.

As of December 31, 2001, each of JPMorgan Chase’s banking
subsidiaries was “well-capitalized.”

FDIC insurance assessments:

FDICIA also required the FDIC to
establish a risk-based assessment system for FDIC deposit insurance. Under the FDIC’s risk-based insurance premium assessment
system, each depository institution is assigned to one of nine risk
classifications based upon certain capital and supervisory measures and, depending upon its classification, is assessed insurance
premiums on its deposits.

Depository institutions insured by the Bank Insurance Fund are
required to pay premiums ranging from 0 basis points to 27 basis
points of domestic deposits. Each of JPMorgan Chase’s banks,
including JPMorgan Chase Bank and Chase USA, currently qualifies for the 0 basis point assessment. Legislation has been introduced in Congress that, if enacted, would require among other
things that all depository institutions pay some deposit insurance
premiums. In addition, if the ratio of insured deposits to money
in the Bank Insurance Fund drops below specified levels the FDIC
would be required to impose premiums on all banks insured by
the Bank Insurance Fund. All depository institutions must also pay
an annual assessment so that the Financing Corporation (“FICO”)
may pay interest on bonds it issued in connection with the resolution of savings association insolvencies occurring prior to 1991.
The FICO assessment for the first quarter of 2002 is 1.82 basis
points of domestic deposits. The rate schedules are subject to
future adjustments by the FDIC. In addition, the FDIC has authority
to impose special assessments from time to time, subject to certain limitations specified in the Deposit Insurance Funds Act.

Powers of the FDIC upon insolvency of an insured depository institution:

An FDIC-insured depository institution can be
held liable for any loss incurred or expected to be incurred by the
FDIC in connection with another FDIC-insured institution under
common control with such institution being in “default” or “in
danger of default” (commonly referred to as “cross-guarantee”
liability). “Default” is generally defined as the appointment of a
conservator or receiver and “in danger of default” is defined as
certain conditions indicating that a default is likely to occur
absent regulatory assistance. An FDIC cross-guarantee claim
against a depository institution is generally superior in right of
payment to claims of the holding company and its affiliates
against such depository institution.

If the FDIC is appointed the conservator or receiver of an insured
depository institution, upon its insolvency or in certain other
events, the FDIC has the power: (1) to transfer any of the depository institution’s assets and liabilities to a new obligor without the
approval of the depository institution’s creditors; (2) to enforce
the terms of the depository institution’s contracts pursuant to
their terms; or (3) to repudiate or disaffirm any contract or lease
to which the depository institution is a party, the performance of
which is determined by the FDIC to be burdensome and the disaffirmance or repudiation of which is determined by the FDIC to
promote the orderly administration of the depository institution.
The above provisions would be applicable to obligations and liabilities of those of JPMorgan Chase’s subsidiaries that are insured
depository institutions, such as JPMorgan Chase Bank and Chase
USA, including, without limitation, obligations under senior or
subordinated debt issued by those banks to investors (referred to
below as “public noteholders”) in the public markets.

Under federal law, the claims of a receiver of an insured depository institution for administrative expenses and the claims of
holders of domestic deposit liabilities (including the FDIC, as
subrogee of the depositors) have priority over the claims of other
unsecured creditors of the institution, including public noteholders, in the event of the liquidation or other resolution of the
institution. As a result, whether or not the FDIC ever sought to
repudiate any obligations held by public noteholders of any subsidiary of the Firm that is an insured depository institution, such
as JPMorgan Chase Bank or Chase USA, the public noteholders
would be treated differently from, and could receive, if anything,
substantially less than, the depositors of the depository institution.

The USA PATRIOT Act:

Following the September 11, 2001
attacks on New York and Washington, D.C., the United States
government acted in several ways to tighten control on activities
perceived to be connected to money laundering and terrorist
funding. Beginning on September 23, 2001, President Bush
issued a series of orders which identify terrorists and terrorist
organizations and require the blocking of property and assets
of, as well as prohibiting all transactions or dealing with, such
terrorists, terrorist organizations and those that assist or sponsor
them. On October 26, 2001, President Bush signed into law The
USA PATRIOT Act of 2001. A number of the provisions of the Act became effective in December 2001; others will
go into effect in April and July 2002.

The Act substantially broadens existing anti-money laundering
legislation and the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the United
States, imposes new compliance and due diligence obligations,
creates new crimes and penalties, compels the production of
documents located both inside and outside the United States,
including those of foreign institutions that have a correspondent
relationship in the United States, and clarifies the safe harbor
from civil liability to customers. The Act mandates the U.S.
Treasury Department to issue a number of regulations to further
clarify the Act’s requirements or provide more specific guidance
on their application.



Part I

The Act requires all “financial institutions,” as defined, to establish
anti-money laundering compliance and due diligence programs
no later than April 2002. Such programs must include, among
other things, adequate policies, the designation of a compliance
officer, employee training programs, and an independent audit
function to review and test the program. JPMorgan Chase has
had in place, pursuant to previously existing laws and regulations,
a “Know Your Customer” policy and an anti-money laundering
compliance program which requires, as appropriate based on a
risk-based analysis, performing due diligence with respect to
establishing the identity and address of the beneficial owners
of an account, the source of the account’s funds and the proposed use of the account, as well as requiring the identification
and reporting of suspicious transactions to appropriate law
enforcement authorities.

The Act requires financial institutions that maintain correspondent
accounts for foreign institutions or persons or that are involved
in private banking for “non-United States persons” or their representatives, to establish “appropriate, specific and, where necessary, enhanced due diligence policies, procedures, and controls
that are reasonably designed to detect and report instances of
money laundering through those accounts.” In furtherance of
these provisions, the Act mandates specific minimum standards
regarding the establishment of private banking accounts and
prohibits financial institutions from establishing, maintaining,
administering or managing correspondent accounts with any
foreign bank that does not have a physical presence in any
jurisdiction unless the so-called “shell bank” is affiliated with a
regulated physically established bank. JPMorgan Chase will continue to revise and update its “Know Your Customer” policy and
its anti-money laundering programs to reflect changes required
by the Act, and the U.S. Treasury Department regulations to be
issued thereunder, in order to remain in compliance with the Act
and its provisions.

Other supervision and regulation:

Under current Federal
Reserve Board policy, JPMorgan Chase is expected to act as a
source of financial strength to its bank subsidiaries and to commit
resources to support the bank subsidiaries in circumstances where
it might not do so absent such policy. However, because GLBA
provides for functional regulation of financial holding company
activities by various regulators, GLBA prohibits the Federal Reserve
Board from requiring payment by a holding company or subsidiary
to a depository institution if the functional regulator of the payor
objects to such payment. In such a case, the Federal Reserve
Board could instead require the divestiture of the depository institution and impose operating restrictions pending the divestiture.

Subject to the restrictions under GLBA described in the preceding
paragraph, any loans by a bank holding company to any of its
subsidiary banks are subordinate in right of payment to deposits
and to certain other indebtedness of the subsidiary banks. In the
event of a bank holding company’s bankruptcy, any commitment
by the bank holding company to a federal bank regulatory
agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank at a certain
level will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a
priority of payment.

The bank subsidiaries of JPMorgan Chase are subject to certain
restrictions imposed by federal law on extensions of credit to,
and certain other transactions with, the Firm and certain other
affiliates and on investments in stock or securities of JPMorgan
Chase and those affiliates. These restrictions prevent JPMorgan
Chase and other affiliates from borrowing from a bank subsidiary
unless the loans are secured in specified amounts.

The Firm’s bank and certain of its nonbank subsidiaries are subject to direct supervision and regulation by various other federal
and state authorities (many of which will be considered “functional regulators” under GLBA). JPMorgan Chase Bank as a New
York State-chartered bank and a state member bank, is subject
to supervision and regulation by the New York State Banking
Department as well as by the Federal Reserve Board and the
FDIC. JPMorgan Chase’s national bank subsidiaries, such as Chase
USA, are subject to substantially similar supervision and regulation by the
Comptroller of the Currency. Supervision and regulation by each of the foregoing regulatory agencies generally
include comprehensive annual reviews of all major aspects of the
relevant bank’s business and condition, as well as the imposition
of periodic reporting requirements and limitations on investments
and other powers. The Firm also conducts securities underwriting,
dealing and brokerage activities through JPMSI and other broker-dealer subsidiaries, all of which are subject to the regulations of
the SEC and the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.
JPMSI is a member of the New York Stock Exchange. The operations of JPMorgan Chase’s mutual funds also are subject to regulation by the SEC. The types of activities in which the foreign
branches of JPMorgan Chase Bank and the international subsidiaries of JPMorgan Chase may engage are subject to various
restrictions imposed by the Federal Reserve Board. Those foreign
branches and international subsidiaries also are subject to the
laws and regulatory authorities of the countries in which they
operate.

The activities of JPMorgan Chase Bank and Chase USA as consumer lenders
also are subject to regulation under various federal
laws, including the Truth-in-Lending, the Equal Credit Opportunity,
the Fair Credit Reporting, the Fair Debt Collection Practice and the
Electronic Funds Transfer Acts, as well as various state laws. These
statutes impose requirements on the making, enforcement and
collection of consumer loans and on the types of disclosures that
need to be made in connection with such loans.

In addition, under the requirements imposed by GLBA, JPMorgan
Chase and its subsidiaries are required periodically to disclose
to their retail customers the Firm’s policies and practices with
respect to (1) the sharing of non-public customer information
with JPMorgan Chase affiliates and others and (2) the confidentiality
and security of that information. Under GLBA, retail customers also must
be given the opportunity to “opt out” of
information sharing arrangements with non-affiliates, subject
to certain exceptions set forth in GLBA.



Important factors that may affect future results

From time to time, the Firm has made and will make forward-looking statements. These statements can be identified by the
fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts.
Forward-looking statements often use words such as “anticipate,” “target,”
“expect,” “estimate,” “intend,” “plan,” “goal,”
“believe” or other words of similar meaning. Forward-looking
statements give JPMorgan Chase’s current expectations or forecasts of future events,
circumstances or results. JPMorgan Chase’s
disclosure in this report, including in the MD&A section, contains
forward-looking statements. The Firm also may make forward-looking statements
in its other documents filed with the SEC and
in other written materials. In addition, the Firm’s senior management may
make forward-looking statements orally to analysts,
investors, representatives of the media and others.

Any forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of the
Firm speak only as of the date they are made. JPMorgan Chase
does not undertake to update forward-looking statements to
reflect the impact of circumstances or events that arise after the
date the forward-looking statement was made. The reader
should, however, consult any further disclosures of a forward-looking nature JPMorgan Chase may make in its Annual Reports
on Form 10-K, its Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and its
Current Reports on Form 8-K.

All forward-looking statements, by their nature, are subject to
risks and uncertainties. The Firm’s actual future results may differ
materially from those set forth in JPMorgan Chase’s forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause JPMorgan Chase’s
future financial performance to vary from that described in its
forward-looking statements include the credit, market, operational, liquidity, interest rate and other risks discussed in the
MD&A section of this report and in other periodic reports filed
with the SEC. In addition, the following discussion sets forth certain risks and uncertainties that the Firm believes could cause its
actual future results to differ materially from expected results.
However, other factors besides those listed below or discussed in
JPMorgan Chase’s reports to the SEC also could adversely affect
the Firm’s results, and the reader should not consider any such
list of factors to be a complete set of all potential risks or uncertainties. This discussion is provided as permitted by the Private
Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Merger of Chase and J.P. Morgan.

JPMorgan Chase may fail to
realize the growth opportunities and cost savings anticipated to
be derived from the merger of Chase and J.P. Morgan. In addition, the anticipated benefits from the merger may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected.
For example, it is possible that the integration process could
result in the loss of key employees, the disruption of ongoing
businesses or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures
and policies that could adversely affect JPMorgan Chase’s ability
to maintain relationships with employees, clients or suppliers.

Business conditions and general economy.

The profitability
of JPMorgan Chase’s businesses could be adversely affected by
a worsening of general economic conditions in the United States
or abroad. During 2001, the global economy was entering into
a recession and this challenging environment could persist for
some period of time in 2002. Factors such as the liquidity of the
global financial markets, the level and volatility of equity prices
and interest rates, investor sentiment, inflation, and the availability
and cost of credit could significantly affect the activity level of
clients with respect to size, number and timing of transactions
effected by the Firm’s investment banking business, including its
underwriting and advisory businesses, and also may affect the
realization of cash returns from JPMorgan Chase’s private equity
business. A continued market downturn would likely lead to a
decline in the volume of transactions that JPMorgan Chase executes
for its customers and, therefore, lead to a decline in the
revenues it receives from commissions and spreads. Higher interest
rates or a downturn in the market also could impact the willingness of financial investors to participate in loan syndications or
underwritings managed by JPMorgan Chase. The Firm generally
maintains large trading portfolios in the fixed income, currency,
commodity and equity markets and has significant investment
positions, including merchant banking investments at JPMorgan
Partners. The revenues derived from mark-to-market values of
JPMorgan Chase’s business are affected by many factors, including
JPMorgan Chase’s credit standing; its success in proprietary positioning; volatility in interest rates and in equity and debt markets; and the economic, political and business factors described
below. JPMorgan Chase anticipates that these revenues will experience volatility from time to time. A continued market downturn
or worsening of the economy could cause the Firm to incur
mark-to-market losses in the values of these positions.

A market downturn also could result in a decline in the fees
JPMorgan Chase earns for managing assets. For example, a
higher level of domestic or foreign interest rates or a downturn
in trading markets could affect the flows of moneys to or from
the mutual funds managed by the Firm. Moreover, even in the
absence of a market downturn, below-market performance by
JPMorgan Chase’s mutual funds could result in a decline in assets
under management and, therefore, in the fees it receives.

An economic downturn or significantly higher interest rates could
adversely affect the credit quality of JPMorgan Chase’s on-balance
sheet and off-balance sheet assets by increasing the risk that a
greater number of the Firm’s customers would become delinquent
on their loans or other obligations to JPMorgan Chase. Further,
a continuing challenging economic environment could lead to
a higher rate of delinquencies by customers or counterparties
which, in turn, would result in a higher level of charge-offs and
a higher level of provision for JPMorgan Chase, all of which could
adversely affect the Firm’s earnings. See also “Factors affecting
allowances for credit losses” below.



Part I

Competition.

JPMorgan Chase operates in a highly competitive
environment and expects various factors to cause competitive
conditions to continue to intensify. For example, technological
advances and the growth of e-commerce have made it possible
for non-depository institutions to offer products and services that
traditionally were banking products and for financial institutions
to compete with technology companies in providing electronic
and Internet-based financial solutions. In addition, the Firm expects
cross-industry competition to continue to intensify, particularly as
continued merger activity in the financial services industry produces larger, better-capitalized companies that are capable of
offering a wider array of financial products and services.

Foreign operations; trading in foreign securities.

The Firm
does business throughout the world, including in developing
regions of the world commonly known as emerging markets.
JPMorgan Chase’s businesses and revenues derived from foreign
operations are subject to risk of loss from unfavorable political
and diplomatic developments, currency fluctuations, social instability, changes in governmental policies or policies of central
banks, expropriation, nationalization, confiscation of assets and
changes in legislation relating to foreign ownership. JPMorgan
Chase also invests in the securities of corporations located in
foreign jurisdictions, including emerging markets. Revenues from
the trading of foreign securities also may be subject to negative
fluctuations as a result of the above factors. The impact of these
fluctuations could be accentuated because, generally, foreign
trading markets, particularly in emerging market countries, are
smaller, less liquid and more volatile than U.S. trading markets.

Operational risk.

JPMorgan Chase, like all large corporations,
is exposed to many types of operational risk, including the risk
of fraud by employees or outsiders, unauthorized transactions
by employees or operational errors, including clerical or recordkeeping errors or errors resulting from faulty computer or
telecommunications systems. Given the high volume of transactions at JPMorgan Chase, certain errors may be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and successfully rectified.
In addition, the Firm’s necessary dependence upon automated
systems to record and process its transaction volume may further
increase the risk that technical system flaws or employee tampering or manipulation of those systems will result in losses that are
difficult to detect. Although JPMorgan Chase maintains a system
of controls designed to keep operational risk at appropriate
levels, the Firm has in the past suffered losses from operational
risk, and there can be no assurance that JPMorgan Chase will
not suffer losses from operational risks in the future.

Government monetary policies and economic controls.

JPMorgan Chase’s businesses and earnings are affected by
general economic conditions, both domestic and international.
JPMorgan Chase’s businesses and earnings also are affected by
the fiscal or other policies that are adopted by various regulatory
authorities of the U.S., foreign governments and international
agencies. For example, policies and regulations of the Federal
Reserve Board influence, directly and indirectly, the rate of interest paid by commercial banks on their interest-bearing deposits
and also may impact the value of financial instruments held by
the Firm. These actions of the Federal Reserve Board also determine to a significant degree the cost to JPMorgan Chase of
funds for lending and investing. The nature and impact of future
changes in economic and market conditions and fiscal policies
are not predictable and are beyond JPMorgan Chase’s control. In
addition, these policies and conditions can impact the Firm’s customers and counterparties, both in the U.S. and abroad, which
may increase the risk that such customers or counterparties
default on their obligations to JPMorgan Chase.

Credit, market, liquidity and private equity risk.

JPMorgan
Chase’s revenues also are dependent upon the extent to which
management can successfully achieve its business strategies
within a disciplined risk environment. JPMorgan Chase’s ability
to grow its businesses is affected by pricing and competitive
pressures, as well as by the costs associated with the introduction
of new products and services and the expansion and development of new distribution channels. The ability of management to
utilize the “Shareholder Value Added” methodology to evaluate
investment opportunities and the ability to maintain expense
discipline will be important factors in determining the extent to
which the Firm achieves its financial targets. For a further discussion of the Shareholder Value Added methodology, see Segment
results on page 29. In addition, to the extent any of the instruments and strategies JPMorgan Chase uses to hedge or otherwise
manage its exposure to market, credit and private equity risk are
not effective, the Firm may not be able to mitigate effectively its
risk exposures in particular market environments or against particular types of risk. JPMorgan Chase’s balance sheet growth will
be dependent upon the economic conditions described above,
as well as upon discretionary decisions as to how properly to
determine and assess cost of credit, concentration of risk and
credit limits for portfolio diversification and whether to securitize,
sell, purchase or syndicate particular loans or loan portfolios.
JPMorgan Chase’s trading revenues and interest rate risk are
dependent upon its ability to identify properly changes in the
value of financial instruments caused by changes in market
prices or rates. The successful management of credit, market,
operational and private equity risk is an important consideration
in managing the Firm’s liquidity risk, as evaluation by rating agencies of the management of these risks affects their determinations
as to the Firm’s credit ratings and, therefore, its cost of funds.

Factors affecting allowances for credit losses.

Estimating
losses for purposes of determining the appropriate level of the
allowance for credit losses is inherently uncertain. In addition,
the estimation process assumes that past experience is a valid
indicator for estimating prospective losses, which may not always
be the case. For a further discussion of the Firm’s allowance for
credit losses and the assumptions employed by management in
determining the allowance for credit losses, see pages 41, 54,
and 76-77.

income before income tax expense and net income, see Note 28
on page 95. For a discussion of foreign loans, see Note 8 on
page 76 and the sections entitled “Commercial loans” and
“Country exposure” in the MD&A on pages 51 through 52 and

Item 2:   Properties

The headquarters of JPMorgan Chase is located in New York City
at 270 Park Avenue, which is a 50-story bank and office building
owned by JPMorgan Chase. This location contains approximately
1.3 million square feet of commercial office and retail space.

JPMorgan Chase occupies or is in the process of readying for
occupancy approximately 2.2 million square feet of leased office
space in two midtown Manhattan office buildings, 277 Park
Avenue and 245 Park Avenue. JPMorgan Chase also has a
number of other large office leaseholds in various locations in
Manhattan.

JPMorgan Chase owns and occupies a 60-story building at One
Chase Manhattan Plaza in New York City. This location has
approximately 2 million square feet of commercial office and
retail space, of which approximately 800,000 square feet is
leased to outside tenants.

JPMorgan Chase also owns and occupies a 22-story building at
4 New York Plaza, New York City, with 900,000 square feet of
commercial office and retail space.

On November 1, 2001 JPMorgan Chase sold to an affiliate of
Deutsche Bank AG, its building at 60 Wall Street in New York
City, a 47-story bank and office building comprising approximately
1.6 million square feet. At the time of the sale, JPMorgan Chase
leased back approximately 1.3 million square feet for its operations. JPMorgan Chase is vacating and turning over the leased back
space to Deutsche Bank AG in phases with the final phase to be
delivered by December 31, 2002, subject to extension with
respect to two floors.

JPMorgan Chase entered into a contract with the City of New
York dated May 31, 2001 to sell to the City of New York or its
designee the two-building complex at 23 Wall Street/15 Broad
Street in New York City comprising approximately 1 million
square feet of commercial office and retail space. The City of
New York and the New York Stock Exchange had previously
announced their intention to build a new Exchange on the land
currently occupied by these facilities. JPMorgan Chase vacated
these facilities in anticipation of closing the sale on or before the
originally contractually specified date of December 31, 2001.
Following the attack on the World Trade Center on September
11, 2001, the City of New York requested that JPMorgan Chase
license the facilities to the New York Economic Development
Agency so that it could sublicense them to The Bank of New
York which had been displaced from certain of its properties by
damage that occurred to them on September 11, 2001. The
license expired on December 31, 2001, but The Bank of New
York remains in the property under “hold-over” provisions of the
license. The closing date with the City of New York is currently
under review.

JPMorgan Chase built in 1992 and fully occupies a two-building
complex known as Chase MetroTech Center in downtown
Brooklyn, New York. This facility contains approximately 1.75
million square feet and houses, among other things, operations
and product support functions.

In 2000 JPMorgan Chase entered into leases for two “build to
suit” office buildings at The Newport Office Center in Jersey City,
New Jersey. The first of the two buildings comprising approximately
800,000 square feet of office and retail space is available for
occupancy and JPMorgan Chase operations are relocating there
as interior spaces are completed. The second building comprising
approximately 332,000 square feet of office and retail space is
expected to be fully occupied by JPMorgan Chase in 2002.

JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries also own and occupy
administrative and operational facilities in Hicksville, New York;
Tampa, Florida; Tempe, Arizona; Newark, Delaware; and in
Houston, Arlington and El Paso, Texas.

JPMorgan Chase occupies, in the aggregate, approximately 2.9
million square feet of space in the United Kingdom. The most
significant components of leased space in London are 350,000
square feet at 125 London Wall, 325,000 square feet at
Aldermanbury, 211,000 square feet at One Angel Court and a
715,000 square-foot office complex at 60 Victoria Embankment.
JPMorgan Chase also owns and occupies a 300,000
square-foot operations center in Bournemouth. JPMorgan Chase
previously owned 60 Victoria Embankment subject to a financing
arrangement which involved the sale of a partial interest in this
complex to the lender. In 2001, JPMorgan Chase sold its remaining ownership interest in this property, but remains in occupancy
as lessee.

In addition, JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries occupy branch
offices and other administrative and operational facilities through-out the U.S. and in foreign countries under various types of
ownership and leasehold agreements.

The majority of the properties occupied by JPMorgan Chase are
used across all of JPMorgan Chase’s business segments and for
corporate purposes.

As part of the Firm’s merger integration efforts, JPMorgan Chase
has begun, and will continue, to combine and consolidate
redundant operations conducted by both predecessor firms. For
a further discussion of the Firm’s merger and restructuring costs,
see page 44 and Note 6 on page 73.



Part I

Item 3:   Legal proceedings

In June 1999, Sumitomo Corporation filed a lawsuit against
The Chase Manhattan Bank (“Chase Bank”) in the United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York. The complaint alleges that during the period from 1994 to 1996, Chase
Bank assisted a Sumitomo employee in making copper trades by
funding unauthorized loans to the Sumitomo employee. The
complaint alleges that Chase Bank knew the employee did not
have authority to enter into the transactions on behalf of
Sumitomo. The complaint asserts claims under the Racketeer
Influenced and Corrupt Practices Act (“RICO”) and New York
common law and alleges damages of $532 million (subject to
trebling under RICO), plus punitive damages.

In August 1999, Sumitomo Corporation filed a separate action
against J.P. Morgan & Co. Incorporated, Morgan Guaranty Trust
Company of New York, and a former J.P. Morgan employee
(collectively “Morgan”) in the United States District Court for
the Southern District of New York. The complaint in this action
contains allegations, similar to the allegations in the complaint
filed by Sumitomo against Chase Bank, that during the period
from 1993 to 1996, Morgan assisted a Sumitomo employee in
making copper trades by funding unauthorized loans to the
Sumitomo employee. The complaint alleges that Morgan knew
the employee did not have authority to enter into the transactions on behalf of Sumitomo. The complaint asserts claims under
RICO and New York common law and alleges damages of $735
million (subject to trebling under RICO), plus punitive damages.
The separate actions against Chase Bank and Morgan have been
consolidated for discovery purposes.

J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. (“JPMSI”; formerly known as Chase
Securities Inc.) has been named as a defendant or third-party
defendant in 16 actions that were filed in either the United
States District Court for the Northern District of Oklahoma or
in Oklahoma state court beginning in October 1999 arising
out of the failure of Commercial Financial Services, Inc. (“CFS”).
Plaintiffs in these actions are institutional investors who purchased
over $1.6 billion in original face amount of asset-backed securities
issued by CFS. The securities were backed by delinquent credit
card receivables. In addition to JPMSI, the defendants in various
of the actions are the founders and key executives of CFS, as
well as its auditors, its outside counsel and the rating agencies
that rated the securities. JPMSI is alleged to have been the
investment banker to CFS and to have acted as an initial purchaser and as placement agent in connection with the issuance of
certain of the securities. Plaintiffs allege that defendants either
knew or were reckless in not knowing that the securities were
sold to plaintiffs on the basis of misleading misrepresentations
and omissions of material facts. The complaints against JPMSI
assert claims under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the
Oklahoma Securities Act, and under common law theories of
fraud and negligent misrepresentation. In the actions against
JPMSI, damages in the amount of approximately $1.2 billion
allegedly suffered as a result of defendants’ misrepresentations
and omissions, plus punitive damages, are being claimed.

JPMorgan Chase is involved in a number of lawsuits arising out
of its banking relationships with Enron Corp. The Firm
initiated a lawsuit in New York in December 2001 against 11
insurance companies. That suit seeks payment of $965 million
under Enron-related surety bonds issued by those companies.
The Firm also commenced a lawsuit in London against
Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale (“WLB”) seeking to
compel payment of $165 million under an Enron-related letter
of credit issued by WLB. On March 5, 2002, the court in New
York denied the Firm’s motion for summary judgment against
the insurance companies, ordered discovery, and set a trial date
of December 2, 2002. JPMorgan Chase intends to pursue both
litigations vigorously. Actions have also been initiated by other
parties against JPMorgan Chase and its directors and certain of
its officers. Among these, as of March 18, 2002, are five shareholder derivative actions pending against
the directors of the firm. These derivative actions
were filed in Delaware and New York and seek to redress
alleged breaches of fiduciary duties and alleged failures to exercise due care and diligence by the Firm’s directors
in the management of JPMorgan Chase. Also pending, as of March 18, 2002, are nine purported class action
lawsuits against the Firm and certain of its officers, all
in New York, alleging that the Firm issued false and misleading
press releases and other public documents relating to Enron in
violation of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. JPMorgan Chase believes that
the lawsuits filed against the Firm, its directors and the
named officers are without merit and it intends to defend these
actions vigorously. However, there can be no assurance as to
the outcome of any of these pending lawsuits or of any other
litigation or proceeding that may be brought by or against
JPMorgan Chase relating to Enron.

In addition to the matters described above, JPMorgan Chase and
its subsidiaries have been named from time to time as defendants
in various legal actions and proceedings arising in connection
with their respective businesses and have been involved from
time to time in investigations and proceedings by governmental
agencies. In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the
outcome of such matters, JPMorgan Chase cannot state what
the eventual outcome of pending matters will be. JPMorgan
Chase is contesting the allegations made in each pending matter
and believes, based on current knowledge and after consultation
with counsel, that the outcome of such matters will not have a
material adverse effect on the consolidated financial condition
of JPMorgan Chase but may be material to JPMorgan Chase’s
operating results for any particular period, depending on the
level of JPMorgan Chase’s income for such period.

Item 4:   Submission of matters to a vote of security holders

None.



Executive officers of the registrant

Unless otherwise noted, during the five fiscal years ended December 31, 2001,
all of JPMorgan Chase’s above-named executive officers
have continuously held senior-level positions with JPMorgan Chase or its
predecessor institutions, J.P. Morgan & Co. Incorporated and
The Chase Manhattan Corporation. There are no family relationships among the
foregoing executive officers.

JPMorgan Chase 2001 Annual Report



management’s discussion and analysis

J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.

Overview

J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. (“JPMorgan Chase” or
“the Firm”) is a leading global financial services firm with assets of nearly
$700 billion and operations in more than 50 countries. JPMorgan Chase has
relationships with over 99% of the Fortune 1000 companies and serves more than
30 million consumers. The Firm is comprised of five business
segments: Investment Bank, Treasury & Securities Services, Investment Management &

Services.

Denotes basis points; 100 bp equals 1%.

In 2001, JPMorgan Chase’s reported net
income, which includes merger and restructuring costs, was $1,694 million,
or $0.80 per share. This compares with $5,727 million, or $2.86 per share, in
2000. Operating income was $3,409
million in 2001, compared with $5,927 million last year. Operating earnings per
share were $1.65, compared with $2.96
in 2000.

These results reflect a challenging
economic environment that, in varying degrees, negatively affected activity,
spreads and values in each of the Firm’s major business segments. During 2001,
the global economy was moving into a recession, as evidenced by significant
reductions in asset values globally, lower liquidity in equity and
equity-related markets, sharply reduced mergers and acquisitions (“M&A”)
activity and related declines in overall capital markets activity. These
factors also contributed to cyclical credit pressures on both consumer and
commercial financing markets.

While these economic and market pressures negatively affected 2001 operating
performance, the pace of merger integration was on or ahead of plan, and this
progress was enhanced by the franchise- and brand-power of the newly merged
company. Market share gains in investment banking were realized as clients
embraced the JPMorgan Chase
business model as one that contributes to their success and financial
flexibility. The investment management and private banking business
successfully completed its merger integration and expense initiatives in 2001.
Operating services and consumer businesses continued to produce solid returns
and to execute on efficiency plans. JPMorgan Chase is well-positioned to
produce higher returns when the economy recovers.

were improved or maintained, and equities, a strategic
priority, made important strides towards reaching its goals. Higher credit
costs, including additions to the loan loss allowance, more than offset these
positives and contributed to lower earnings.

Three businesses make up the

Treasury & Securities Services

(“T&SS”) segment. Two of these, Treasury Services and
Institutional Trust Services, posted revenue and earnings growth from 2000.
Revenues and income in Investor Services, the largest of the three, decreased
due to declining market transaction volumes and values. Treasury & Securities
Services provides an important diversification benefit to the Firm and had a
24% ROCE for the year.

The

Investment Management & Private Banking

(“IMPB”) segment was hard hit by
declines in asset values and shifts in asset mix from equities to fixed income
and money market products. In addition, the disappearance of the domestic
technology initial public offering (“IPO”) market and the downturn in the
Japanese equity markets negatively impacted IMPB’s results. With assets under
management of $605 billion, JPMorgan Chase is one of the top five active asset
managers in the world. The private bank continued to win new clients and an
increased share of existing clients’ assets. Expense discipline was strong in
both businesses; however, with lower revenues, the unit saw its margin decline
from last year.

Retail & Middle Market Financial Services

(“RMMFS”) posted revenue growth of
7%, driven by strong production, with record originations in Cardmember
Services, Home Finance and Auto Finance. Cardmember Services realized
double-digit revenue and earnings growth despite higher credit costs. The
deposit businesses were hurt by declining
interest rates despite growth
in the deposit base. Expenses grew at
a lower rate than revenues. A 35% increase in RMMFS’s credit costs,
including an addition to the loan loss allowance, resulted in cash operating
earnings declining 5%.

JPMorgan Partners’

public and private portfolios were negatively affected by
the market conditions in 2001. Unrealized losses of $1,857 million more than
offset realized gains of $675 million for the year. Many of the losses were
attributable to write-downs in the values of the telecommunications companies
in the portfolio. At the same time, sluggish M&A and IPO market activity
negatively affected JPMP’s ability to exit investments, significantly slowing
the pace of realized gains. However, JPMorgan Chase continues to believe that
JPMP’s unique approach to investing across industries, types of investments and
regions will lead to
positive shareholder value added (“SVA”) and improved returns in the future.

Expense management

The Firm aggressively reduced expenses in 2001 through both merger-related and
right-sizing initiatives. Cash operating expenses in 2001 were reduced $1.9
billion from a pro forma 2000 base which assumes that the purchase of Robert
Fleming Holdings Limited (“Flemings”) occurred at the beginning of 2000.
Expense reductions exceeded the original management target to hold expenses
flat. Expense reductions occurred in businesses that were merging and which
also had to align their costs with lower revenues. Businesses of the Firm not
directly affected by the merger also focused on efficiency gains through the
use of tools like Six Sigma.

JPMorgan Chase 2001 Annual Report



management’s discussion and analysis

J.P. Morgan Chase & Co

.

The Firm enters 2002 with the momentum of declining
expenses. The 2001 fourth quarter operating expense run rate of $19.6 billion
(which is the annualized amount of fourth quarter expenses adjusted for
full-year incentives) is almost $3 billion lower than the run rate in the
fourth quarter of 2000. This reduction was driven by merger savings and other
cost reductions as well as lower incentives resulting from the decline in
revenues. In 2001, management increased the original target of merger expense
savings and cost reductions related to right-sizing efforts from $2.0 billion
to $3.8 billion; 100% of these savings are anticipated to be realized by the
end of 2002. The merger and restructuring costs related to achieving these
additional savings also increased. For a more detailed discussion, refer to
page 44 and Note 6 on page 73.

Risk management

The Firm focuses on risk distribution and on diversification, with a
significant weighting of its credit portfolios toward investment-grade
companies. The Firm’s ability to assist its clients in risk management was
affirmed this year by various industry publications’ awards.

The Firm is operating in a recessionary environment. For the first time in many
years, the loan loss provision exceeded loan charge-offs, leading to a higher
loan loss allowance. Nonperforming assets rose substantially in 2001. The
Firm’s focus is on distribution of credit and on continuing the reduction of
its commercial credit exposure, both on- and off-balance sheet. The capacity
and willingness to extend JPMorgan Chase’s balance sheet to clients is an
important competitive advantage.

Capital management

The Firm is committed to maintaining strong capital ratios, including a Tier 1
capital ratio in the range of 8% to 8.25%. At the end of 2001, the ratio was
8.3%.

SVA discipline is applied to all investments and remains a critical performance
metric for evaluating transactions and segment results. In July 2001, the Board
of Directors authorized the repurchase
of up to $6 billion of JPMorgan Chase’s common stock, net of issuance for
employee benefit plans. For a further
discussion of the Firm’s repurchase program, refer to the Capital management
section on page 46.

JPMorgan Chase 2001 Annual Report


Reconciliation of reported financials to operating results

The Firm prepares its financial
statements using generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) in the
United States of America. The primary financial statements prepared in
accordance with GAAP appear on pages 65-68 of this Annual Report.
This presentation, which is referred to as

“reported basis,”

provides the
reader with an understanding of the Firm’s results that can be consistently
tracked from year to year and enables a comparison of the Firm’s performance
with other companies’ GAAP financial statements.

In addition to analyzing the Firm’s results on a reported basis, management
utilizes

“operating basis”

to assess each of its businesses and to measure
overall Firm results against targeted goals. The definition of operating basis
starts with the reported GAAP results and then excludes the impact of merger
and restructuring costs and special items, which usually are significant
nonrecurring gains or losses. Management generally defines “special items” as
nonrecurring revenue or expense events of $50 million or more. Both
restructuring charges and special items are viewed by management as
transactions that are not part of the Firm’s normal daily business operations
or are unusual in nature and are therefore not indicative
of trends.

Operating results also exclude the impact of credit card securitizations.
JPMorgan Chase periodically securitizes a portion of its credit card portfolio
by selling a pool of credit card receivables to a trust, which issues
securities to investors. When credit card receivables are securitized, the Firm
ceases to accrue interest and credit costs on the receivables and, instead,
receives net fee revenue for continuing to service those receivables. As a
result, securitization does not affect JPMorgan Chase’s reported or operating
net income; however, it does affect the classification of items in the
Consolidated statement of income.

Management also utilizes the term

“cash operating earnings,”

defined as
operating earnings excluding the impact of amortization of intangibles.
Commencing January 1, 2002, the Firm
adopted SFAS 142. Adoption of that accounting standard will eliminate the need
for management, in assessing the Firm’s performance, to add back the
amortization of intangibles, as GAAP reported results will become substantially
closer to cash earnings. For a further discussion of the impact of SFAS 142,
see the Accounting and reporting developments section on page 62.

Within the MD&A section of the Annual Report, particularly the Segment results
on pages 28-41 and the consolidated Results of operations for the Firm on
pages 42-45, management provides a discussion of the results for 2001 and 2000
as well as a comparative discussion of the results for

2000 pro forma

. The 2000
pro forma results assume that the purchase of Flemings occurred at the
beginning of 2000 rather than at the time of purchase in August 2000.

The following summary table provides a
reconciliation between the Firm’s reported and its operating and cash operating results.

JPMorgan Chase 2001 Annual Report


JPMorgan Chase’s segment results reflect
the manner in which financial information currently is evaluated by the Firm’s
management.

The Firm allocates equity to its business units utilizing a risk-adjusted
methodology, which quantifies credit, market and operating risks within each
business and, for JPMP, private equity risk. For a discussion of those risks,
see the Risk management section on pages 45-62. The Firm also allocates equity
to its businesses incorporating an “asset capital tax” on managed assets and
some off-balance sheet instruments. In addition, businesses are allocated
equity equal to 100% of goodwill and certain intangibles generated through
acquisitions.

For the Firm, the SVA framework applies
a 12% cost of equity. To derive SVA for businesses, JPMorgan Chase applies a
12% cost of equity for all businesses except JPMorgan Partners. This business
is charged a 15% cost of equity. All prior periods have been restated to
conform with the current presentation.

The capital elements and resultant capital charges provide the businesses with
the financial framework to evaluate the trade-off between the use of capital by
the business unit versus its return to the shareholders. The capital charges are an
integral part of the SVA measurement for each business. See Glossary of terms
on page 101 for a definition of SVA.

Restatements of segment results may occur in future periods to reflect further
alignment of management accounting policies or changes in organizational
structure among businesses.

Financial results overview

In a challenging market environment in 2001, the Investment Bank’s cash
operating margin declined 2% from last year’s pro forma results. Operating
revenue declined 11%, driven by the substantial reduction in market activity
for M&A and equity underwriting. This was largely offset by a 16% decline in
cash expenses
from the prior year. The Investment Bank met its 2001 overhead
ratio target of 60%, which was down from 64% a year ago. Results included
approximately $800 million in pre-tax charges related to Enron and Argentina
as well as higher loan charge-offs and additions to the loan loss allowance.
As a result of these factors,

cash operating earnings

declined 18%.

Financial line-item discussion

Trading-related revenues

, which include trading-related net interest income,
were lower by 10%. The decline was primarily attributable to lower
equity-related trading results, driven by lower margins in equity securities
and reduced demand for equity derivatives. Also contributing to the decline was
$359 million of losses related to exposure to Enron and Argentina in

fixed
income

trading. Excluding the effects of Enron and Argentina, fixed income and
other trading was up 3%, as weaker performance in emerging markets was more
than offset by strong results in interest rate trading products.

Investment banking fees

were 20% lower than last year, driven by the overall
market decline in equity underwriting and M&A activities. These declines were
partially offset by record investment-grade bond underwriting fees.

Advisory
revenues

declined 34%, while overall market volume was down 50%. The Investment
Bank increased its market share in global announced M&A transactions during
2001.

Underwriting and other fees

declined 10%, reflecting significantly lower equity
underwriting activity, partially offset by higher bond underwriting fees.
Record bond issuance for the market was driven by the favorable interest rate
market environment.

2001 highlights

•

Increased market share in M&A transactions and maintained key leadership positions in debt underwriting

•

Exceeded original expense savings target by $1.4 billion

•

Overhead ratio improved to 60% from 64% despite a stronger market environment in 2000 than 2001

Important leadership positions were maintained in leveraged and syndicated

Investment Bank’s equity underwriting business lost market share relative to
the prior year, but increased market share in each of the quarters of 2001,
culminating with a market share of 8% (ranked No. 6) in the 2001 fourth
quarter. In addition, the Investment Bank was named “Bank of the Year”
by

International Financing Review

and “Derivatives House of the Year” by

Risk

magazine.

The increase in

net interest income

of 14% from last year was primarily due to
the Firm’s interest rate risk management in a declining rate environment.

Fees and commissions

declined 21% from the prior year, reflecting lower equity
brokerage commissions.

The decrease in

all other revenue

was attributable to negative valuation
adjustments taken against syndicated loans that are held for sale. Partly
offsetting
the decrease were higher gains on sales of available-for-sale securities as
part
of the Firm’s interest rate risk management activity.

Cash operating expense

declined 16% from 2000. Included in the decline was the
impact of reduced headcount and lower incentive compensation expense.
Compensation as a percentage of revenue decreased from 42% in 2000 to 39%
in 2001 despite lower revenues. Since
the merger announcement date, the Investment Bank has reduced staff levels by
approximately 6,700, or 23% of total headcount, contributing to the Investment
Bank’s ability to meet its 2001 overhead ratio target of 60%.

Credit costs

increased 328%, reflecting the impact, in general, of the
recession on the Firm’s credit portfolio and, in particular, charge-offs for
Enron of $221 million and a provision for Argentina of $140 million.

Average total assets

were $511 billion, an increase of 7%, reflecting growth in
fixed income trading assets, partially offset by a decline in commercial loans
and investment securities.

Average common equity

declined by 4% from last year
as a result of lower operating risk capital, associated with the Investment
Bank’s lower expense base.

The economic outlook remains uncertain, and revenue levels for the Investment
Bank in 2002 will be heavily influenced by the speed and extent of the economic
recovery.

Selected financial data

Denotes basis points; 100 bp equals 1%.

Financial results overview

Treasury & Securities Services’

cash operating earnings

remained virtually
flat, compared with 2000, with growth
in Institutional Trust Services of 22% and Treasury Services of 11% offset by a
decline in Investor Services of 17%. These results reflected the impact of
weaknesses in the economy and financial markets. Significant declines in
interest rates and reduced equity market prices depressed many revenue sources.
Partially offsetting these declines were the positive effects, especially in
Institutional Trust Services, of greater volumes of debt issuance and market
share gains in several key product
lines. The net result was revenue growth of 15% in Institutional Trust Services
and of 3% in Treasury Services—in line with historical growth rates—and a
revenue decline of 4% in Investor Services, which had realized high growth
rates in previous years due to more favorable market conditions.

Financial line-item discussion

Fees and commissions

increased 6%, primarily due to higher fees in
Institutional Trust Services. Institutional Trust Services earns fees from the
issuance and payment of debt securities, servicing secondary market loan
programs for governmental entities, and maintaining American depositary receipt
programs for foreign issuers. The increase in fees in 2001 was attributable to
successful sales in the expanding collateralized debt obligation market and the
acquisition of Colson Services Corp. (“Colson”), a recordkeeper and loan
servicer providing outsourcing support to government agencies. Treasury
Services’ clients shifted their payment method to fees rather than maintain
compensating balances in a low interest rate environment. These increases were
offset by lower revenues at Investor Services, as fees based on equity values
and the volume of transactions declined.

Net interest income

decreased slightly,
reflecting compressed spreads on deposits as a result of lower
interest rates and the impact of lower compensating balances.
This was partially offset by higher deposit levels at
Institutional Trust Services associated with new clients
processing their debt payments.

The events of September 11th caused Treasury &Securities Services’ demand
deposits and noninterest-bearing deposits to grow significantly as customers
looked to depository institutions to hold their cash funds. By the end of 2001,
these cash balances had returned to pre-September 11th levels.

The decline in

all other revenue

of 19% was attributable to lower foreign
exchange revenue, driven by the decrease in clients’ global trading activities
at Investor Services. Also contributing to the decline was the effect of the
divestiture by Institutional Trust Services of a company involved in stock
transfer.

Cash operating expense

grew modestly from 2000, reflecting strategic
investments in all three businesses, partly offset by tighter expense control,
primarily in Treasury Services and Investor Services. The 3% expense growth,
coupled with 2% revenue growth, slightly increased the cash overhead ratio to
71%. Treasury & Securities Services’ long-term cash overhead ratio target is
65%.

bp-

Denotes basis points; 100 bp equals 1%.

Financial results overview

Investment Management & Private Banking’s

cash operating earnings

were 30%
lower than last year. Lower revenues were only partially offset by lower
expenses. Revenues decreased due to declines in the value of assets under
management, lower international retail fund flows and a reduction in
brokerage account volumes. Investment Management revenues of $1.37 billion
decreased 23%, and Private Banking revenues of $1.72 billion declined 16% from
2000. For the year, the percentage of cash operating earnings before taxes to
total operating revenue declined to 19% from 25% in 2000; the business’s
long-term target is 30%.

Financial line-item discussion

Fees and commissions

were 12% lower than the prior year, reflecting the lower
value of assets under management and lower associated investment management
fees, and the shift from higher-margin equities to fixed income and money
market
products. In addition, brokerage commissions declined as private banking
clients executed fewer transactions in 2001. Partially offsetting these factors
were gains realized from new inflows to money market funds.

The decline in

net interest income

of 16% reflected the impact of lower
short-term interest rates on the spread on client deposits.

Operating revenues

Private Banking                 55%

Investment Management   45%

All other revenue

was lower by 58%,
primarily as a result of the decline in trading volumes. Earnings from the
Firm’s 45% investment in American Century Companies, Inc. (“American Century”)
also declined.

Cash operating expense

decreased 13% as a result of merger synergies and the
elimination of approximately 1,500 positions since the merger announcement
date. With the merger integration essentially completed in IMPB, the business
is positioned to benefit from future improvement in market conditions.

The increase in

amortization of intangibles

to $289 million reflected the
full-year impact of the Flemings acquisition.

Average assets

for the year were $34
billion, a decline of 4% from the prior year, primarily reflecting lower
equity-related lending. For 2001,

average common equity

decreased 7%.

Diversification of IMPB’s $605 billion of assets under management at December 31, 2001

Assets under management

at December 31, 2001 declined 5% from the prior year-end, primarily as a result
of market depreciation. However, during 2001, inflows into
assets under management were driven by a significant
increase in money market assets, as investors shifted
toward lower-risk assets. The result was approximately $45
billion in new flows into global money market funds. The
accompanying table demonstrates the diversification across
asset classes and geographic regions, which has helped
mitigate market volatility.

JPMorgan Partners

JPMorgan Partners, the global private
equity organization of JPMorgan Chase, provides equity and
mezzanine capital financing to private and public companies. It invests
throughout the entire life cycle of the business development process, with the
objective of
creating long-term value for the Firm and its
third-party investors.

Financial results overview

JPMorgan Partners recognized a cash operating loss of $1.1 billion in 2001. The
portfolio was negatively affected by
a decline in valuations of private securities and the downturn in the public
equity markets, particularly securities in the telecommunications, media and technology (“TMT”) sector.

Financial line-item discussion

Private equity gains (losses)

JPMP’s portfolio recorded a loss of $1.2 billion in 2001 consisting of losses
in direct investments ($0.9 billion), private funds ($0.2 billion) and from
hedging transactions ($0.1 billion). During the year, unrealized losses from
portfolio revaluations more than offset income from realization activities.
Despite limited exit opportunities, JPMP generated realized cash gains of over
$1.0 billion from sales of investments, including approximately $0.9 billion
from public and private direct investments and $0.1 billion from fund
investments. Realized cash gains were recognized across all industries, with
significant gains harvested from investments in the energy sector. During the
fourth quarter of 2001, JPMP completed significant selldowns of two public TMT
holdings, generating realized cash gains of over $125 million.

JPMP’s realized gains were more than offset by valuation actions taken across
the private portfolio and mark-to-market losses recorded in the public
portfolio. Valuation actions included net write-downs and write-offs of $1.4
billion on private direct securities and $0.3 billion on private fund
investments. JPMP’s private direct TMT investments from 1999
and 2000 currently are valued at 50% of initial cost. In 2001, JPMP also
recorded unrealized losses of $0.5 billion from mark-to-market losses on its
public portfolio.

Other revenue

includes third-party management fees and net revenue allocated to
or from other JPMorgan Chase businesses. While management fee revenue was
stable year over year, net intersegment revenue in 2001 included fees paid to
other areas of the Firm for services associated with the raising of third-party
funding and asset sale activities.

JPMorgan Partners’

cash operating expenses

in 2001 decreased 20%, driven by a
decline in compensation expenses.

Investment pace, portfolio diversification and capital under management

For 2001, JPMorgan Partners’ investment pace declined 65% from last year to
$0.9 billion as JPMP adopted a more cautious approach to new investments in
light of the depressed market conditions.

2001 highlights

•

Private equity losses of $1.2 billion, driven primarily by $1.7 billion in write-downs and write-offs taken across the private investment portfolio

•

Significant decline in new investment activity given adverse market conditions

•

Closed on $1.5 billion of third-party investor commitments for the J.P. Morgan Partners Global Investors, L.P. (Global Fund)

At December 31, 2001, JPMP’s investment portfolio
was $9.2 billion, a decline of $2.6 billion from year-end 2000. The decline
from last year was primarily the result of reductions in carrying values due to
valuation adjustments and sales activities. The decline in JPMP’s assets
resulted in a 15% decline in common equity allocated to JPMP.

At December 31, 2001, TMT investments were $2.5 billion, down 40% from December
31, 2000; they represented 27% of JPMP’s holdings. Management’s goal is to
decrease TMT investments while increasing the industrial and consumer sectors.

The Firm believes that JPMorgan Partners
will continue to create value over time. Given the volatile nature of the
markets, and the NASDAQ market in particular, JPMP’s reported results for any
period may include significant public securities unrealized gains or losses.
The Firm makes no assumptions about the unrealized gains or losses that may be
experienced by the JPMP portfolio.

Financial results overview

Retail & Middle Market Financial Services

’ 2001 results were marked by solid
revenue growth and disciplined expense management. Record originations drove
revenues, while restructuring, Six Sigma and other productivity efforts
moderated expenses. These actions were unable to offset the
negative impact of higher credit costs. As a result, RMMFS realized a 5%
decline in

cash operating earnings

from last year.

Financial line-item discussion

Net interest income

grew 10% from a year ago, driven by higher levels of
consumer loans resulting from record origination volumes across all credit
businesses (CCS, CHF and CAF), partially offset by the lower spreads earned on
customer deposits due to the decline in interest rates experienced in 2001.

Fees and commissions

declined 9%, reflecting the negative impact of the
increased level of mortgage loan prepayments that occurred because of lower
interest rates. Prepayments resulted in accelerated amortization and impairment
of mortgage servicing rights. In CHF, this was substantially offset by
increased securities gains and other revenues. The decline in fees and
commissions was partially offset by growth in credit card, mortgage and auto
loans outstanding, as well as by a higher utilization of consumer banking and
insurance products and services, all of which generated higher fees.

The increase in

securities gains

of 50% was attributable to sales of U.S.
government securities used as economic hedges of mortgage servicing rights.

All other revenue

increased by 60%,
primarily as a result of record residential
mortgage sales activity to government
sponsored enterprises such as Fannie Mae, Ginnie Mae and
Freddie Mac.

Cash expense

rose 4%, reflecting the costs associated with the growth in
origination volumes. The expense increase also included the impact of the
acquisition in 2001 of
the mortgage business of Advanta Corp. (“Advanta”) and higher credit card
marketing expenditures that helped generate a record number of new accounts.
Partially offsetting these increases were $145 million in savings achieved
through restructuring, productivity and quality programs, including an
organization-wide Six Sigma effort. This disciplined expense management
approach helped reduce the cash overhead ratio to 50% from 52% one year ago.

Amortization of intangibles

decreased 8% as a result of the sale of the Hong
Kong credit card business in 2000.

Credit costs

increased by 35% due to
significant growth in credit card customer bankruptcies, increased levels of
delinquencies resulting from the economic slowdown in the U.S. and a higher
level of consumer-related receivables outstanding. RMMFS added $310 million to
its allowance for loan losses in 2001 in response to the deteriorating credit
conditions. For a further
discussion of the consumer credit portfolio, see pages 52-53. The impact of
these events was partially mitigated by more intense collection efforts in all
of the credit businesses. In 2002, credit costs will be dependent upon the
conditions in the domestic economy. RMMFS will continue to pursue collection
and risk management actions to mitigate future credit losses.

Cardmember Services

Cardmember Services is the fifth
largest credit card issuer in the U.S., servicing almost 24 million accounts.
Cash operating earnings for 2001 were a record $595 million, 16% greater than
2000. Operating revenue increased $630 million, or 17%, driven by the increase
in the number of cardholders, growth in receivables and stronger customer
purchase volume. Also contributing to the increase was the decline in the costs
to fund receivables. Cash expense increased 9% when compared with last year due
to higher marketing expenditures that resulted in record originations of over 4
million new accounts, and higher business volume-related expenses. Credit costs
rose 21% due to the impact of the increase in receivables outstanding combined
with the slowdown in the economy that affected the level of consumer
bankruptcies. The managed credit card-related net charge-off ratio was 5.49%,
an increase of 36 basis points from 2000. Managed credit card-related
receivables at December 31, 2001 increased 12% to over $41 billion and total
purchase volume, cash advances and balance transfers increased 19% to over $72
billion. The cash overhead ratio in 2001 improved 200 basis points to 33%.

In the first quarter of 2002, Cardmember Services acquired Providian National
Bank’s interest in the Providian Master Trust, which includes a credit card
portfolio of approximately $8.0 billion. The acquired portfolio is comprised
mainly of Providian’s higher quality or “platinum” assets and consists of
approximately 3.3 million credit card accounts.

Regional Banking Group

The Regional Banking
Group is the No. 1 full-service bank based on deposits for consumers and small
businesses in the New York tri-state area and is one of the leading providers
of financial services to the consumer and small business sectors in the Firm’s
Texas market. RBG provides banking, investment, credit and insurance services
to 2.9 million consumers and 300,000 small businesses. RBG also offers discount
brokerage services through Brown & Company, the 8th largest online brokerage
firm in the U.S.

RBG had cash operating earnings of $504 million in 2001, down 8% from 2000,
driven by the declining interest rates and lower customer trading volumes in
the equities markets, which negatively affected deposit spreads and discount
brokerage transactions revenue, respectively. Partially offsetting these
unfavorable items was the growth in insurance sales, particularly annuities.
The lower interest rate environment also negatively affected the cash overhead
ratio increasing it 100 basis points to 68%.

Total client assets under management of $100 billion, including $67 billion in
deposits and $33 billion of investment assets, grew 4% over 2000.

Cash expense declined $60 million, or 3%, from 2000. This decline reflected the
results of initiatives to realize continued productivity improvement and provide high-quality
service to the Firm’s customers.

Home Finance

Chase Home Finance is the mortgage industry’s second largest mortgage
originator and third largest mortgage servicer in the United States with over 4
million customers. CHF experienced a record year in 2001, with total revenue
increasing 22%, cash operating earnings increasing 20% and mortgage
originations increasing 142% to $184 billion. CHF’s 2001 performance
demonstrated the effectiveness of its balanced business model of being both a
leading originator and servicer of mortgage loans. The significant reduction in
interest rates contributed to higher origination revenue as record loan
originations were packaged and sold as securities. Low interest rates also
improved net interest margins by reducing funding costs. However, the lower
interest rates led to high prepayment levels and reduced mortgage servicing
revenue due to the accelerated amortization and impairment of mortgage
servicing rights (“MSR”). To mitigate the effect of reduced revenue from MSR
impairment and prepayments, CHF used both interest rate derivatives and
available-for-sale (“AFS”) securities that increased in value when interest
rates declined.

Interest rate derivatives that qualify as fair value hedges under SFAS 133 and
the related hedged MSRs were accounted for at fair value. For 2001, the
decrease in revenue resulting from SFAS 133 valuation adjustments and MSR
impairment totaled $1,951 million. These losses were substantially offset by
total gains of $1,773 million relating to a combination of derivative gains,
including those that qualify as SFAS 133 hedges, and realized gains from sales
of AFS securities.

The increase in cash expense of 22% was related to the growth of business
volume and the acquisition in 2001 of Advanta’s mortgage business. The cash
overhead ratio remained flat compared with last year at 60%. Charge-offs of
0.18% were slightly higher in 2001 reflecting weak domestic economic
conditions.

Middle Markets

JPMorgan Middle Market Banking is a premier national provider of commercial banking and corporate financial
services to companies with annual sales of $3 million to $500 million, as well
as to not-for-profit, real estate and public sector entities. Middle Markets enjoys a leadership position in the lucrative
New York tri-state market and select Texas markets, and is leveraging its
expertise in select markets across the country. Product offerings include
corporate finance, cash management, credit and international finance
capabilities. Cash operating earnings declined 7% when compared with the prior
year. Declining interest rates affected earnings as well as revenue. Revenue
declined 3% despite a 7% increase in deposit levels. A 24% increase in deposit
fees offset some of the impact of lower rates. Cash expense rose 1% due to the
increase in volume-related expenses.

Denotes basis points; 100 bp equals 1%.

Auto Finance

Auto Finance is the largest bank
originator of auto loans and leases in the U.S., with over 2 million accounts.
In 2001,
the business unit had a record number of auto loan originations, which grew 63%
over 2000 to $19.9 billion. Loan and lease receivables grew 26% to $28.4
billion, and Auto Finance’s market share among auto finance companies improved
from 2.6% in 2000 to 4.1% in 2001 as a result of strong organic growth and an
origination strategy that allies the business with car manufacturers and
dealers nationwide.

Auto Finance’s operating revenues and cash operating earnings grew 63% and
215%, respectively, from 2000. The cash overhead ratio decreased to 37%. These
results reflected the increase in origination volume, the impact of lower
rates, and the effect of a $100 million charge in 2000 from an estimated
decrease in auto lease residual value. The risk of future charges for residual
values was substantially mitigated in the first quarter of 2001 through the
purchase of a residual value insurance policy to cover previously uninsured
auto leases in the portfolio. New auto lease originations continue to be
insured under an existing policy. The moderately higher charge-off rate in 2001
reflects consumer defaults in a weaker business environment.

The results of Auto Finance also include Chase Education Finance, which is a
top provider of government guaranteed
and private loans for higher education through its joint venture with Sallie
Mae.

Support Units and Corporate

Selected financial data

Note:

2000 amounts are shown in place of % changes.

The Support Units and Corporate include Enterprise Technology Services (“ETS”), Corporate Business
Services (“CBS”), legal, audit and finance.

ETS is an internal technology service organization, and CBS manages the Firm’s support services, including real
estate management, human resources, finance operations and procurement.
CBS and ETS seek to provide services to the Firm’s businesses that are
competitive with comparable third-party providers in terms of price and service
quality. These units leverage the Firm’s global scale and technology to gain
efficiencies through consolidation, standardization, vendor management and
outsourcing.

Corporate reflects the accounting effects remaining at the Corporate level
after the application of management accounting policies of the Firm. These
policies include the allocation of costs associated with technology,
operational and staff support services with the respective revenue generating
businesses and allow management to evaluate business performance on an
allocated basis.

For 2001, Corporate had a cash operating loss of $507 million, compared with
a loss of $334 million in 2000. In 2001, there were $251 million of credit
costs in excess of net charge-offs not allocated to the segments. Also included
in the 2001 net loss was a pre-tax loss of $152 million at LabMorgan resulting
from the write-downs of investments and equity accounting losses. LabMorgan has
been restructured and, going forward, its remaining investment portfolio of $52
million at December 31, 2001 will be managed by JPMorgan Partners.

Critical accounting policies used by the Firm

The Firm’s accounting policies are integral to understanding
the results reported. Accounting policies are described in detail in the Notes
to the consolidated financial statements. The Firm’s most complex accounting
policies
require management’s judgment to ascertain the valuation of assets and
liabilities. The Firm has established detailed policies and control procedures
that are intended to ensure valuation methods are well controlled and applied
consistently from period to period. In addition, the policies and procedures
are intended to ensure that the process for changing methodologies occurs in an
appropriate manner. The following is a brief description of the Firm’s current
accounting policies involving significant management valuation judgments.

Allowance for loan losses

JPMorgan Chase’s allowance for loan losses is intended to adjust the value of
the Firm’s loan assets for probable credit losses. Management also computes an
allowance for lending-related commitments using a methodology similar to that
used for the loan portfolio. The methodology for calculating both allowances
involves judgments at many levels. First and foremost, it involves the early
identification of credits that are deteriorating. Second, management applies
its judgment to derive loss factors. Wherever possible, the Firm uses
independent, verifiable data or the Firm’s own historical loss experience in
its models for estimating loan losses. Many factors can affect management’s estimates of
specific loss and expected loss, including volatility of default probabilities,
rating migrations and loss severity. For example, judgment is required to
determine how many years of data to include when estimating loss severity. If a
full credit cycle is not captured in the data, loss estimates may be
inaccurate. Similarly, there are judgments as to which external data on default
probabilities should be used, and when they should be used. Choosing data that
are not reflective of the Firm’s specific loan portfolio characteristics could
affect loss estimates. Management’s judgments also are applied when considering
uncertainties that relate to current macroeconomic and political conditions,
the impact of currency devaluations on cross-border exposures, changes in
underwriting standards, unexpected correlations within the portfolio or other
factors. For a further discussion of the methodologies used in establishing the Firm’s Allowance for
loan losses, see Credit risk management and Note 8 – Loans on pages 54 and 75,
respectively.

Fair value of financial instruments

A portion of JPMorgan Chase’s assets and liabilities are carried at fair value,
including trading assets and liabilities, available-for-sale securities and
loans held for sale. At December 31, 2001, approximately $315 billion of the
Firm’s assets were recorded at fair value.

Fair value is defined as the value at which positions could be closed out or
sold in a transaction with a willing and knowledgeable counterparty over a
period of time consistent with JPMorgan Chase’s trading or investment strategy.
A majority of assets carried at fair value are determined based on quoted
market prices. If listed prices or quotes are not available, then fair value is
based on internally developed cash flow models. These models use as their basis
independently sourced market parameters including, for example, interest rate
yield curves, option volatilities and currency rates. The valuation process
then takes into consideration factors such as counterparty credit quality,
liquidity and concentration concerns. Management applies judgment in the
determination of these factors. For example, there is often limited market data
to rely on when estimating the impact of holding a large or aged position.
Similarly, judgment must be applied in estimating prices where no external
parameters exist. Finally, other factors can affect estimates of fair value
including market dislocations, incorrect model assumptions, and unexpected
correlations. Imprecision in estimating these factors can impact the amount of
revenue or loss recorded for a particular position. The largest valuation
adjustment relates to credit risk associated with derivatives in the Firm’s
derivatives portfolio. The credit valuation adjustment, or CVA, represents the
estimated credit component of the Firm’s derivative counterparty exposures. The
CVA is recalculated on a daily basis, taking into account market and

J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.

counterparty-related activity, such as changes in credit
ratings and market prices, master netting agreements and collateral. CVA also
includes additional adjustments for name-specific credit risk not reflected in
credit spreads.

Notwithstanding the judgment required in fair valuing JPMorgan Chase’s assets
and liabilities, the Firm believes its estimates of fair value are reasonable
given the Firm’s process for obtaining external prices and parameters, internal
model review and approval, consistent application of approach from period to
period and the validation of estimates through the actual settlement of
contracts.

Specific details on fair values by type of instrument, including the valuation
policy for private equity investments and mortgage servicing rights, are
included in Note 27 – Fair value of financial instruments and Note 10 –
Mortgage servicing rights, respectively.

Results of operations

The following
section provides a discussion of JPMorgan Chase’s results of operations both on
a reported and operating basis. The differences between reported and operating
basis are the treatment of revenues from credit card securitizations, the
exclusion of special items and the reclassification of trading-related net
interest income (“NII”) to trading revenue. See page 27 for a further
discussion.

Revenues

(a)

Trading-related NII is recorded in net interest income on the Consolidated
statement of income. For purposes of this schedule, trading NII has been
reclassified to trading revenue in the reported basis column. See Note 3 on
page 72 for details of trading revenue and the related NII.

(b)

This column presents the impact of credit card securitizations.

(c)

For a description of special items, see Glossary of terms on page
101.

Revenues both on a reported and operating basis were down from 2000 due to
private equity losses and, to a lesser degree, lower investment banking fees
and trading revenue. These were partially offset by higher net interest income
and securities gains.

Investment banking fees

Investment banking fees declined due to lower merger and acquisition advisory
and equity underwriting fees. The decline was partially offset by a record year
for investment-grade bond underwriting fees. For a further discussion of these
fees, see the Investment Bank’s results on page 30 and Note 4 on page 72.

Trading-related revenue

The decline was primarily attributable to lower margins in equity securities
and reduced demand for equity derivatives. Also contributing to the decline was
$359 million of losses related to the exposure to Enron and Argentina. Excluding
these two, the weaker performance in emerging markets was more than offset by
the strong results within the interest rate trading products as a result of the
declining interest rate environment.

Fees and commissions

Fees and commissions both on a reported and operating basis for 2001 were
essentially flat from last year, reflecting:

•

Investment management, custody and processing services fees in 2001 rose 4%
to $3.8 billion, primarily as a result of the acquisition of Flemings in the
second half of 2000, partially offset by the general decline in asset values;

•

Credit card revenue in 2001 rose $337 million, or 19%, on a reported basis
($347 million on an operating basis) due to the increased number of
cardholders, stronger customer purchase volume and an increase in
delinquencies. These factors resulted in higher interchange income, late
charges and other fees. For a further discussion of this revenue, see page 72;

•

Deposit service fees for 2001 were $1.0 billion, an increase of 13% as a
result of more customers opting to pay fees for services, rather than
maintaining a
compensating balance in a low interest rate environment. In addition, consumer
banking fees increased reflecting a higher level of customer utilization of
retail banking products and services;

•

Other fees rose 19% to $794 million in 2001 due to the acquisition of Colson
in early 2001, and strong sales of insurance, particularly annuities and
mortgage
reinsurance;


JPMorgan Chase 2001 Annual Report


partly offset by:

•

Mortgage servicing fees in 2001 were a loss of $230 million, a decline of
$671 million from last year, primarily as a result of the accelerated
amortization and net impairment of servicing rights stemming from the lower
interest rate environment. For a further discussion of these fees, see page 40;

•

Other lending-related service fees in 2001 were $495 million, a decrease of
$95 million from 2000 due to lower volume in the trade finance business,
reducing the commissions on letters of credit.

For a table that breaks out fees and commissions, see Note 4 on page 73.

Private equity gains (losses)

Both realized gains and unrealized losses
on private equity investments deteriorated from last year’s levels due to the
limited opportunities to sell investments and depressed valuations,
particularly in the TMT sector. For a further discussion of private equity
gains (losses), see JPMorgan Partners’ results on page 36.

Securities gains

The Firm’s available-for-sale securities portfolio was positioned for interest
rate reductions in the U.S. and Europe, and thus, the Firm was able to realize
large gains on the sales of those securities in 2001. There were also higher
gains on the sales of debt securities used as economic hedges of the value of
mortgage servicing rights at Home Finance. For a further discussion of
securities gains, see both the Investment Bank and Home Finance discussions on
pages 30 and 40, respectively.

Other revenue

The decrease in other revenue of $288 million included:

•

Mark-to-market gains of $229 million in 2000 on economic hedges for
anticipated overseas revenues, compared with no such gains in 2001;

•

Unfavorable valuation adjustments in 2001 of $177 million related to residual
loan positions held after the syndication period;

•

Lower equity income of $71 million ($36 million in 2001 compared with $107
million in 2000) on the American Century investment due to the decline in the
value of its funds under management, and a nonoperating charge related to its
restructuring activities;

partly offset by:

•

Revenues from residential mortgage sales and origination activities in 2001
increased to $552 million from $194 million in 2000, driven by the reduction in
interest rates. For a further discussion of this revenue,
see page 40.

Reported other revenue reflected the
following special items, all in 2000:

•

Gains of $827 million on the sale of the Hong Kong retail banking business;
$399 million on the transfer of the Firm’s interest in Euroclear; and $81
million on the sale of the Panama operations;

partly offset by:

•

Losses of $176 million on the economic hedge of Flemings’ purchase price.

For a table that breaks out other revenue, see Note 4 on page 73.

Net interest income

Net interest income benefited from the lower interest rate environment in 2001,
resulting in a higher volume of average interest-earning assets (in particular,
credit card receivables and residential mortgages), and slightly wider spreads
on assets (the short-term funding costs to support interest-earning assets
declined faster than the interest earned on them). Also contributing to the
increase in NII was an aggregate of $84 million of interest refunds in 2001
(related to several tax settlements) for prior years’ federal tax overpayments.

The spread on interest-earning assets was 1.99% in 2001, compared with 1.87% in
the prior year. Excluding the impact of the interest refunds, the spread would
have been 1.97% in 2001.

2001 decreased 8%.

JPMorgan Chase 2001 Annual Report



management’s discussion and analysis

J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.

Compensation expense

Compensation expense declined 6% in 2001, primarily as a result of headcount
reductions, particularly in areas affected by the merger such as the Investment
Bank and Investment Management & Private Banking. Also contributing to the
decline were lower incentives as a result of a lower level of earnings. These
items were partially offset by higher compensation expense, reflecting the
full-year impact of Flemings in 2001, the addition of the mortgage business of
Advanta, and new hiring at Home Finance and Cardmember Services related to the
growth in their business volume.

The total number of full-time equivalent employees at December 31, 2001 was
95,812, a decrease of 3,945 employees from the prior year-end, reflecting
headcount reductions at businesses that were impacted by the merger,
particularly IB and IMPB, partly offset by an increase in RMMFS.

Occupancy, technology and communications

The increase of $54 million in occupancy expense was primarily attributable to
the Flemings acquisition, additional space requirements of several business
segments, and the moderate increase in utility, maintenance and building
administration costs. These were partially offset by the savings derived from
the consolidation of offices and the relocations of certain functions from the
New York metropolitan area to the South and Southwest regions of the United
States.

Technology and communications expense reflected the increase in depreciation
expense associated with upgrades to the Firm’s hardware systems and software
applications. Also contributing to the increase were the costs of more
sophisticated telecommunications systems, including greater requirements for
market data used in trading activities and research at the Investment Bank, as
well as the leasing and maintenance of more advanced computer and other
equipment.

Other expense

Other operating expense decreased $245 million from 2000 due to the following
(for the table on other expense, see page 74):

•

Lower all other expense of $171 million due to decreases in operating losses
and employee-related recruitment and relocation expenses;

•

Lower professional services of $64 million, reflecting fewer requirements for
legal services stemming from the slowdown in the Investment Bank’s business
volume, and less need for information technology consultants due to a reduction
in non-merger-related projects;

•

Lower travel and entertainment of $37 million, driven by the slowdown in
business activities, which reduced air travel and hotel expenses, and
implementation of cost-containment measures;

partly offset by:

•

Higher outside services of $21 million, reflecting an increase in outsourced
data processing and mortgage closing costs associated with the significant
increase in securities and cash transactions at Treasury & Securities Services
and origination volume at Home Finance, respectively.

Expenses related to the attacks on the World Trade Center were immaterial. The
branch located at the World Trade Center was destroyed and the Firm experienced
some temporary dislocations in its downtown Manhattan offices, but there were
no significant operational losses.

Amortization of intangibles

The increase was largely attributable to the full-year impact of goodwill
associated with the acquisitions of Flemings and The Beacon Group, LLC in
mid-2000. For a discussion on the impact of SFAS 142 on the Firm’s amortization
of intangibles expense in 2002, see page 62.

Merger and restructuring costs

Management initially estimated that the Firm would incur one-time costs of $3.2
billion in connection with the merger of J.P. Morgan and Chase. These costs
consisted of a $1.25 billion merger charge that was recorded on the December
31, 2000 merger date and $1.95 billion of other costs to be incurred in 2001
and 2002 that were not accruable under existing accounting pronouncements.

In September 2001, management estimated that $1.05 billion of additional merger
costs (consisting primarily of systems integration costs, facilities costs and
retention payments) and severance costs for the right-sizing of employee levels
in certain businesses (2,000 employee reductions) beyond that planned at the
time of the merger would be incurred in the remainder of 2001 and 2002. At that
time, management also increased its estimate of related expense savings from
the $2.0 billion originally estimated at the time of the merger to $3.6
billion. During 2001, the Firm incurred total merger and right-sizing costs of
$2.3 billion. At December 31, 2001, cumulative merger-related and right-sizing
employee reductions, including attrition, since the merger announcement date,
have been approximately 8,200.

In December 2001, management again revised its estimate of total merger and
right-sizing costs to be incurred in 2002 to be approximately $1 billion,
representing an increase of approximately $250 million from the total costs
previously estimated. At the same time, management increased its estimate of
expense savings to be realized from $3.6 billion to $3.8 billion.

For the past few years, the Firm has been relocating several businesses to
Florida, Texas and Massachusetts. Management continues to estimate that $200
million of relocation costs will be incurred in 2002, resulting in cumulative
relocation costs of $585 million and related expense savings of $80 million in
2003 increasing to $140 million in 2007.

Credit costs

Credit costs on an operating basis are composed of the provision for loan
losses related to loans on the Consolidated balance sheet and the provision for
credit card receivables that have been securitized.

JPMorgan Chase 2001 Annual Report


Income taxes

JPMorgan Chase recognized income tax expense on a reported basis of $847
million in 2001, compared with $3.01 billion in 2000. The effective tax rate
was 33.0% in 2001 compared with 34.4% in 2000. The decrease in the effective
tax rate in 2001 as compared with 2000 was principally a result of the decrease
in reported income before income tax expense. JPMorgan Chase’s effective tax
rate in 2002 will likewise be affected by the overall level of reported pre-tax
earnings.

Risk management

The major risks to which the Firm is exposed are:

Risk management at JPMorgan Chase is guided by several principles, including:

Risk management and oversight begins with the Risk
Policy Committee of the Board of Directors, which reviews the governance of
these activities, delegating the formulation of policy and day-to-day risk
oversight and management to the Executive Committee and to the two
corporate risk committees:

•

Capital

•

Risk Management

The Executive Committee provides guidance regarding strategies and risk
appetite and is responsible for an integrated view of risk exposures, including
the interdependencies among JPMorgan Chase’s various risk categories.

The

Capital Committee

focuses on firm-wide capital planning, internal capital
allocation and liquidity risk. The

Risk Management Committee

focuses on credit
risk, market risk, operational and business risks, private equity risk and
fiduciary risk. Both risk committees have decision-making authority, with major
policy decisions and risk exposures subject to review by the Executive
Committee.

In addition to the Risk Policy Committee, the Audit Committee of the Board of
Directors reviews with management the system of internal controls and financial
reporting that is relied upon to assure compliance with the Firm’s operational
risk management processes.

The Firm’s use of SVA, which incorporates a risk-adjusted capital methodology
as its primary performance measure, has strengthened its risk management
discipline by charging the businesses the cost of capital linked to the risks
associated with their respective activities. The result of this discipline has
been controlled growth in, and a lower risk profile for, the assets on the
Firm’s balance sheet.

JPMorgan Chase 2001 Annual Report



management’s discussion and analysis

J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.

Capital management

JPMorgan Chase’s capital management
framework helps to optimize the use of capital by:

•

Determining the amount of capital commensurate with:

•

Internal assessments of risk
as estimated by the Firm’s economic capital allocation model

•

The Firm’s goal to limit losses, even under stress conditions

•

Targeted regulatory ratios
and credit ratings

•

The Firm’s liquidity risk management strategy

•

Directing capital investment
to activities with the most favorable risk-adjusted returns

•

Defining the most efficient composition of the Firm’s capital base

Available versus required capital

Economic risk capital:

JPMorgan Chase assesses
capital adequacy by measuring risk utilizing internal risk assessment
methodologies. The Firm assigns economic capital based primarily on four risk
factors. The methodology quantifies credit, market and operating risk for each
business and, for JPMP, private equity risk, and assigns capital accordingly.
These methodologies are discussed in the risk management sections of this
Annual Report.

Capital also is assessed against
business units for certain nonrisk factors. Businesses are assessed capital
equal to 100% of any goodwill or certain other intangibles generated through
acquisitions. Additionally, JPMorgan Chase assesses an “asset capital tax”
against managed assets and some off-balance sheet instruments. These
assessments recognize that certain minimum regulatory capital ratios must be
maintained by the Firm. JPMorgan Chase also estimates the portfolio effect on
required economic capital based on correlation of risk in stress scenarios
across risk categories. This estimated diversification benefit leads to a
reduction in required economic capital for the Firm.

The total required economic capital for JPMorgan Chase as determined by its
models and after considering the Firm’s estimated diversification benefits is
then compared with available common stockholders’ equity to evaluate overall
capital utilization. The Firm’s policy is to maintain an appropriate level of
excess capital to provide for growth and additional protection against losses.

Regulatory capital:

JPMorgan Chase’s primary federal banking regulator, the
Federal Reserve Board, establishes capital requirements, including
well-capitalized standards and leverage ratios, for the consolidated financial
holding company and its state-chartered banks, including JPMorgan Chase Bank.
The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency establishes similar capital
requirements and standards for the Firm’s national bank subsidiaries, including
Chase Manhattan Bank USA, National Association. As of December 31, 2001, the
financial holding company and its banking subsidiaries maintained capital
levels well in excess of the minimum capital requirements and in excess of
well-capitalized standards.

Additional information regarding the Firm’s capital ratios as well as a more
detailed discussion of federal regulatory capital standards are presented in
Note 21 on pages 88-89 of this Annual Report.

Currently, the Firm’s most important regulatory capital target is to maintain a
Tier 1 capital ratio in the range of 8% to 8.25%. The Capital Committee reviews
the Firm’s capital targets and policies regularly in light of changing economic
conditions and business needs. Capital generated in excess of the Tier 1
capital target and the Firm’s assessment of necessary excess capital
could be used for purchases of JPMorgan Chase common stock or for future
investment opportunities. The components of the Firm’s Tier 1 and total capital
are reflected in Note 21 on pages 88-89 of this Annual Report.

Stock repurchases:

In July 2001, JPMorgan Chase’s Board of Directors authorized
the repurchase of up to $6 billion of the Firm’s common stock, net of any
issuance for employee benefit plans. In the latter half of 2001, the Firm
repurchased approximately 21.9 million shares worth $871 million. These
repurchases were offset by the net issuance of 5.7 million shares during the
same period under JPMorgan Chase’s various stock-based employee benefit plans.
Management anticipates significant repurchases only when the operating income
of the Firm improves and generation of internal excess capital accelerates.

Dividends:

In the first quarter of 2001, JPMorgan Chase raised the quarterly
cash dividend on its common stock to $0.34 per share from $0.32 per share. In
recent years, JPMorgan Chase has had a policy of paying common stock dividends
at a level that over time would be in the range of 25%-35% of an amount equal
to operating earnings less preferred stock dividends. The Firm continues to
consider this range an appropriate target over the medium- and long-term.
However, dividends above this range may be declared for a period if the Firm’s
results for the relevant period are below what the Firm considers its
medium- or long-term operating earnings capacity, as has been the case for the past
several quarters. Dividends declared in any quarter will be determined by
JPMorgan Chase’s Board of Directors after taking into consideration factors
such as the Firm’s current earnings, expected medium- and long-term operating
earnings, financial condition, regulatory capital position and applicable
governmental regulations and policies.


JPMorgan Chase 2001 Annual Report


Credit risk management

Credit risk is the risk of loss due to borrower or counterparty default.
This risk is managed at both the transaction and portfolio levels. Credit risk
management processes are designed to preserve the independence and integrity of
the risk assessment process.

Risk management

Credit risk management begins with an assessment of the risk of loss resulting
from the default by a borrower or counterparty. All credit exposures are
assessed, whether on- or off-balance sheet. These exposures include loans,
receivables under derivative and foreign exchange contracts, and
lending-related commitments (e.g., letters of credit and undrawn commitments to
extend credit).

Using statistical techniques, estimates are made of both expected losses
(average losses over a cycle) and unexpected losses for each segment of the
portfolio. Unexpected losses represent the potential volatility of actual
losses relative to the expected level of loss. Expected losses are used to set
risk-adjusted loss provisions, whereas unexpected losses drive the allocation
of credit risk capital by portfolio segment. Within the consumer businesses,
capital allocations are differentiated by product and product segment. In the
commercial portfolio,
capital allocations are differentiated by risk rating and maturity. Off-balance
sheet exposures are converted to loan equivalent amounts, based on their
probability of being drawn, before applying the expected loss and capital
factors. The credit risk profile of each business unit is an important factor
in assessing its financial performance.

Expected credit losses alone are not key indicators of risk. For commercial
assets,
if losses were entirely predictable, then the expected loss rate could be
factored into pricing and covered as a normal and recurring cost of doing
business. Unexpected losses (i.e., the uncertainty of loss rates relative to
expected levels) are what create risk and represent the primary focus of credit
risk management.

The risks of the consumer and commercial portfolios are markedly different.
Broadly speaking, losses on consumer exposures are more predictable, less
volatile and less cyclical than losses on commercial exposures. For the latter,
the loss volatility can be much greater over the course of an economic cycle.

JPMorgan Chase’s managed credit-related assets totaled $310 billion at December
31, 2001, essentially flat from year-end 2000. The portfolio continues to be
well-balanced between commercial and consumer assets. At December 31, 2001,
consumer assets represented 43% of the total managed credit-related portfolio,
compared with 37% at December 31, 2000.

Credit risk management processes

The credit risk management process is guided by policies and procedures
established by the Credit Risk Policy group. At both the business unit and
corporate level, processes are in place that are designed to ensure that risks
are accurately assessed, properly approved and continuously monitored.

Credit Risk Policy also has primary responsibility for the credit risk
measurement framework, allocating the cost of credit, evaluating the portfolio
risk profile and assessing concentration risks, setting limits to provide for
adequate portfolio diversification, validating internal risk grades and
managing problem assets.

Within each major business unit, there is an independent credit risk management
function that reports jointly to the
relevant business executive and to the Vice Chairman for Finance, Risk
Management and Administration. These functions are responsible for managing
credit decisions on a day-to-day basis. They approve significant new
transactions and product offerings, have the final authority over credit risk
assessments and monitor the credit risk profile of the business unit’s
portfolio.

Credit risk management of
commercial assets

Within the commercial sector, credit risk management begins with the client
selection process. A global industry approach allows the Firm to monitor and
evaluate a given industry’s risk profile; exposures thus can be managed in
industries deemed to have increasing risk profiles. The Firm’s international
strategy, particularly in emerging markets, is to focus on the largest, leading
firms with cross-border financing needs.

2001 highlights

Despite a difficult economic environment in 2001, the overall quality of both
the commercial and consumer credit portfolios remained sound

•

The commercial loan portfolio declined 12% in 2001, reflecting, in
part, the Firm’s strategy of managing risk through the origination of
loans for distribution and its desire to reduce commercial credit

•

Commercial credit-related assets considered investment-grade
equivalent declined to 65% at December 31, 2001 from 67% at year-end

JPMorgan Chase 2001 Annual Report



management’s discussion and analysis

J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.

Concentration management continues to be a key tool in managing commercial
credit risk. The Firm manages concentrations by obligor, risk grade, industry,
product and geographic location. From the perspective of portfolio risk
management in the aggregate, concentration management is enhanced by the Firm’s
established strategy of loan origination for distribution as well as the
purchase of credit protection.

Credit risk management of consumer assets

Consumer credit risk management uses sophisticated portfolio modeling, credit
scoring and decision support tools to project credit risks and establish
underwriting standards. Risk parameters are established in the early stages of
product development, and the cost of credit risk is an integral part of the
pricing and evaluation of a product’s profit dynamics. Consumer portfolios are
monitored to identify deviations from expected performance and shifts in
consumers’ patterns of behavior.

2002 view

The Firm continues to view credit as a lagging economic indicator. The economic
and associated credit environments are expected to remain challenging in 2002.

In the consumer sector, the Firm currently anticipates higher loan losses and
charge-off rates in 2002, reflecting both ongoing portfolio growth and a
continuation of the difficult economic environment.

Loan origination for distribution

The Firm’s business strategy remains one of origination for distribution. The
majority of the Firm’s wholesale loan originations continue to be distributed into
the marketplace. The commercial loan portfolio declined 12% in 2001 reflecting,
in part, the results of the Firm’s strategy to originate for distribution as
well as the Firm’s ongoing goal of reducing its exposure to commercial credit.
In addition, the Firm’s SVA discipline continues to discourage the retention of
loan assets that do not generate a positive return above the cost of
risk-adjusted capital. SVA remains a critical discipline in selecting loan
assets to add to the Firm’s balance sheet, particularly when combined with
other credit and capital management disciplines (e.g., credit derivatives).

Purchase of credit protection

The Firm uses credit derivatives, as well as cash and synthetic collateralized
loan obligations (“CLOs”), to reduce the credit risk of, and the internal
economic capital allocated to loans, loan commitments, and derivatives. The use
of credit derivatives to hedge exposures does not reduce the reported level of
assets on the balance sheet or the level of reported off-balance sheet
commitments. The notional amounts outstanding relating to single name credit
default swaps and CLOs were approximately $19.0 billion and approximately $18.7
billion, respectively, at December 31, 2001.

Commercial credit quality

At December 31, 2001, 65% of the Firm’s commercial credit-related assets were
considered investment-grade equivalent, while approximately 35% were considered
non-investment-grade equivalent, of which 1% was nonperforming.

Total commercial nonperforming assets were $3.297 billion at December 31, 2001.
Excluding the $1.130 billion of nonperforming Enron-related other receivables,
commercial nonperforming assets were $2.167 billion, an increase of $696
million from year-end 2000, which equaled approximately 1% of the total
commercial credit-related assets.

Unfunded commercial lending commitments

The Firm’s unfunded commercial lending-related commitments at December 31, 2001
totaled $248 billion, down from $263 billion at the year-end 2000; 85% of these
unfunded commitments were considered investment grade equivalent and 15% were
considered non-investment grade equivalent, which were essentially unchanged
from the prior year. For a breakdown of the unfunded commitments outstanding at
December 31, 2001, by remaining maturity, see page 60.

The risk profile of the Firm’s total commercial credit exposure at December 31,
2001 (loans, derivatives and unfunded commitments) was considered 77%
investment grade equivalent and 23% non-investment grade equivalent.

Commercial credit exposure

Net charge-offs

In 2001, commercial net charge-offs increased by $582 million, or 146%,
compared with 2000. The increase was primarily the result of higher domestic
commercial net charge-offs, including increased net charge-offs in the
telecommunications sector and for Enron. The annual commercial loan net
charge-off rate for 2001 had been expected to be in the range of 60 basis
points (0.60%) of the total commercial loan portfolio. In 2001, the actual net
charge-off rate on average commercial loans was 0.87%. In 2000, the net
charge-off rate was 0.33%.

Diversification

The Firm remains highly focused on diversifying its commercial credit-related
assets. The graph below displays the Firm’s 10 largest credit-related industry
groups.

•

Commercial Banking, traditionally the largest industry group, continues to
reflect the Firm’s market-leading position in derivatives and in providing
credit to this industry. The portfolio continues to be high-quality,
predominantly investment grade equivalent.

•

The second largest industry group is Holding and Investment Companies. The
underlying exposures in this group are not highly correlated and remain high
quality.

•

The third largest industry group represents extensions of credit to
securities brokers, dealers and exchanges. Like commercial banking, the risk
profile of this portfolio is predominantly investment grade equivalent. As a
leading primary dealer, the Firm has significant credit relationships with
other primary dealers in this industry.

•

The remaining industry groups contribute to the further diversification of
total commercial outstandings. These industry groups, including
Telecommunications Services, are continuously monitored with respect to risk
profile, industry composition and portfolio size. For example,
telecommunications credit-related assets were reduced from $10.1 billion at
mid-year 2001 to $8.4 billion at December 31, 2001. The Firm has placed limits
on its exposure to the higher risk segments of this portfolio; emerging telecom
credit-related assets totaled $1.5 billion at December 31, 2001.


JPMorgan Chase 2001 Annual Report


Commercial loans

Commercial and industrial:

The commercial and industrial (“C&I”) portfolio
consists primarily of loans made to large corporate and middle market
customers. The domestic C&I portfolio declined $7.4 billion from 2000 year-end.
Nonperforming domestic C&I loans increased over 2000, while net charge-offs in
2001 were $796 million, or 1.13% of the average portfolio, higher in both
absolute dollar and percentage terms relative to 2000.

The foreign C&I portfolio totaled $33.5 billion at December 31, 2001,
representing a $3.5 billion decline in outstandings from 2000 year-end levels.
Nonperforming foreign C&I loans increased by $123 million, or 22%, due
primarily to an increase in nonperforming loans in Latin America (largely
Argentina), offset in part by declines in Asia. Net charge-off levels for 2001
increased from the prior year by $44 million, or 37%, reflecting higher
charge-offs in Europe and Latin America in 2001, partly offset by lower
charge-offs in Asia.

Commercial real estate:

The commercial real estate portfolio represents loans
secured primarily by real property (other than loans secured by mortgages on
1-4 family residential properties, which are included in the consumer loan
portfolio). Domestic commercial real estate loans decreased $686 million from
year-end 2000, principally as a result of sales and repayments.

Financial institutions:

The financial institutions portfolio includes loans to
commercial banks and companies whose businesses primarily involve lending,
financing, investing, underwriting or insurance. Loans to financial
institutions decreased $2.1 billion in 2001 from 2000 levels, primarily in the
domestic portion of the portfolio. Nonperforming financial institution loans
increased by $14 million in 2001, primarily in the foreign portfolio. The total
portfolio experienced net charge-offs of $17 million in 2001, compared with $18
million in 2000.

Enron-related exposure

The Firm’s exposure to Enron at the time it declared bankruptcy was
approximately $2.6 billion. At year-end 2001, after giving effect to net
charge-offs, write-downs and payments of $0.5 billion, Enron-related exposure
was $2.1 billion. The following table provides details of Enron-related
exposure at year end:

(a)

Includes $58 million in undrawn letters of credit.

(b)

DIP financings are backed by the unencumbered assets of the company, and
the lender receives priority from the bankruptcy court in terms of payment.
There have been no drawdowns as of February 26, 2002.

Nonperforming Enron-related assets at December 31, 2001 were comprised of $98
million of nonperforming loans, $45 million of nonperforming derivatives, and
the $1,130 million of nonperforming other receivables, which represent surety
receivables and a letter of credit that are the subject of litigation with
insurance companies and a foreign bank.

Derivative and foreign exchange contracts

In the normal course of business, the Firm utilizes derivative and foreign
exchange financial instruments to meet the financial needs of its customers, to
generate revenues through its trading activities, to manage its exposure to
fluctuations in interest and currency rates, and to manage the Firm’s own
credit risk.

The Firm uses the same credit risk management procedures when entering into
derivative and foreign exchange transactions as those used for traditional
lending products. In addition, the Firm actively manages the credit risk of the
derivative counterparties with credit, interest rate, foreign exchange,
equities and commodity derivatives.

In terms of credit risk outstanding exposure, the true measure of risk from
derivative and foreign exchange contracts is the mark-to-market value of the
contracts at a point in time (i.e., the cost to replace the contract at the
current market rates should the counterparty default prior to the settlement
date). For
most derivative transactions, the notional principal amount does not change
hands; it is simply an amount that is used as a reference upon which to
calculate payments. While notional principal is the most commonly used volume
measure in the derivative and foreign exchange markets, it is not a measure of
credit risk. The $24 trillion of notional principal of the Firm’s derivative
and foreign exchange contracts outstanding at December 31, 2001, does not
represent a proxy for, and significantly exceeds the possible credit losses
that could arise from such transactions. At December 31, 2001, the associated
mark-to-market value of the contracts, or the amount owed to the Firm, was $71
billion after taking into consideration the benefit of legally enforceable
master netting agreements. Further, after taking into account $20 billion of
collateral held by the Firm at year-end, the net credit exposure owed to the
Firm relating to derivative and foreign exchange contracts was $51 billion.

The Firm’s primary counterparties in derivative and foreign exchange
transactions are investment-grade financial institutions, most of which are
dealers in these products. The investment-grade equivalent portion of the
derivative and foreign exchange contracts portfolio was 83% at December 31,
2001.

Many of the Firm’s derivative and foreign exchange contracts are short term,
which also mitigates credit risk, since these transactions settle quickly. The
table on the next page provides the remaining maturities of derivative and
foreign exchange contracts outstanding at December 31, 2001 and 2000. The
maturity profile remained relatively consistent with the prior year.

At December 31, 2001, the Firm had approximately $41 billion in notional value
related to energy trading commodity contracts with unrealized gains of $4.3
billion and unrealized losses of $2.8 billion.

At December 31, 2001, nonperforming derivative contracts were $170 million,
compared with $37 million at December 31, 2000.

amounts.

Country exposure

The Firm has a process for measuring and managing its country exposures and
risk. Exposures to a country include all credit-related lending, trading and
investment activities.

The table below presents JPMorgan Chase’s exposure to selected
countries. This disclosure is based on management’s view of country exposure.
Amounts as of December 31, 2000 have been restated to conform to the current
presentation.

The Firm has been closely managing its exposure to Argentina over the last
several quarters and, in particular, in the months leading up to the
government’s announcement of a restructuring of its bond obligations. Since
March of 2001, the Firm reduced its exposure to Argentina from $1.8 billion to
$0.6 billion (before loan loss allowances). The latter number includes the
effect of fair value adjustments on the derivatives portfolio ($0.2 billion)
and write-downs of market positions ($0.1 billion) taken by the end of December
2001.

In addition, the Firm took a $140 million provision against its loans to
Argentina. The increase in the Firm’s exposure to Brazil was largely
concentrated in short-term lending and trading activity.

JPMorgan Chase 2001 Annual Report


JPMorgan Chase’s consumer portfolio consists primarily of mortgages, credit
cards and auto financings. This portfolio is predominately domestic and
continues to be geographically well-diversified.

The Firm’s managed consumer portfolio totaled $134 billion at December 31,
2001, an increase of $20 billion, or 17%, from 2000. The following pie graph
provides a summary of the consumer portfolio by loan type at 2001 year-end and
each loan type’s respective charge-off rate. The Firm’s largest component,
residential mortgage loans, comprised 44% of the total consumer portfolio and
is primarily secured by first mortgages.

Consumer loans

Residential mortgage loans:

1-4 family residential mortgage loans increased 18%
during 2001. While net charge-offs for 2001 increased $14 million, or 39%, over
the prior year, the 2001 net charge-off rate remained low at 0.09%, reflecting
the continued strong credit quality of the portfolio.

Credit card loans:

The Firm analyzes its credit card portfolio on a “managed
basis,” which includes credit card receivables on the balance sheet as well as
credit card receivables that have been securitized.

Managed credit card receivables increased 12% during 2001. The increase in the
net charge-off rate was a result of higher consumer bankruptcy levels as well
as higher contractual losses (i.e., losses on accounts not bankrupt).

A new collection system for Cardmember Services was installed in the fourth
quarter of 2000, the benefits of which were evidenced in 2001. This system
significantly improved the productivity of collections and the accuracy and
sophistication of risk prediction models, as well as enabling the Firm to move
more quickly to decrease credit card lines for high-risk accounts.

Auto financings:

Auto financings increased 30% from year-end 2000, reflecting
strong consumer demand during the second half of 2001 as a result of favorable
pricing programs. The moderately higher charge-off rate in 2001 reflected
consumer defaults in a weaker economic environment.

Allowance for credit losses

Loans

JPMorgan Chase’s Allowance for loan losses is intended to cover probable credit
losses for which either the asset is not specifically identified or the size of
the loss has not been fully determined. Within the allowance, there are
specific and expected loss components and a residual component.

The

specific loss component

covers those commercial loans deemed by the Firm to
be criticized. The Firm internally categorizes its criticized commercial loans
into three groups: doubtful, substandard and special mention.

Nonperforming commercial loans (excluding leases) are considered to be impaired
loans. The allowance for impaired loans is computed using the methodology under
SFAS 114. An allowance is established when the discounted cash flows (or
collateral value or observable market price) of an impaired loan is lower than
the carrying value of that loan. For purposes of computing the specific loss
component of the allowance, larger impaired loans are evaluated individually,
and smaller impaired loans are evaluated as a pool using historical loss
experience for the respective class of assets. The criticized but still
performing loans also are evaluated as a pool using historical loss rates.

The

expected loss component

covers performing commercial loans (except
criticized loans) and consumer loans.

Expected losses are the product of default probability and loss severity. The
computation of the expected loss component of the allowance is based on
estimates of these factors in JPMorgan Chase’s credit risk capital model. These
estimates are differentiated by risk rating and maturity for commercial loans.

The expected loss estimates for each consumer loan portfolio are based
primarily on the Firm’s historical loss experience for the applicable product
portfolio.

Finally, a

residual component

is maintained to cover uncertainties that could
affect management’s estimate of probable losses. The residual component of the
allowance reflects the margin of imprecision inherent in the underlying
assumptions used in the methodologies for estimating specific losses and
expected losses in both the commercial and consumer portfolios. It is
anticipated that the residual component of the allowance will range between 10%
and 20% of the total allowance for loan losses.

Factors affecting the uncertainty of specific loss and expected loss estimates
include the volatility of default probabilities, rating migrations and loss
severity. These uncertainties also could relate to current macroeconomic and
political conditions, the impact of currency devaluations on cross-border
exposures, changes in underwriting standards, unexpected correlations within
the portfolio or other factors.

The Firm’s Risk Management Committee reviews, at least quarterly, the allowance
for loan losses relative to the risk profile of the Firm’s credit portfolio and
current economic conditions. The allowance is adjusted based on that review if,
in management’s judgment, changes are warranted.

The total specific and expected allowance for commercial loan losses was $1,724
million at December 31, 2001, an increase of 13% from the prior year-end. The
specific loss component was approximately $1 billion, up significantly from
year-end 2000 reflecting an increase in commercial loans deemed by the Firm to
be criticized. The expected loss component of the commercial allowance was
approximately $700
million at year-end 2001, a decrease of approximately 20% from the prior
year-end as a result of a lower level of commercial loans outstanding.

The consumer expected loss component of approximately $2.1 billion increased
46% from the prior year-end reflecting the growth in consumer portfolios and a
challenging credit environment.

The residual component at December 31, 2001 was $695 million, approximately the
same at year-end 2000. The residual component represented approximately 15% of
the total allowance for loan losses.

The Firm’s concerns with respect to the continuing challenging credit
environment are reflected in the allowance for credit losses, which was
increased by $850 million over the third and fourth quarters of 2001. The
allowance represented 2.08% of loans at December 31, 2001, compared with 1.70%
at December 31, 2000.

As of December 31, 2001, management deemed the allowance to be adequate (i.e.,
sufficient to absorb losses that currently may exist but are not yet
identifiable).

Lending-related commitments

To provide for risk of losses inherent in the credit extension process,
management also computes specific and expected loss components as well as a
residual component for lending-related commitments, using a methodology similar
to that used for the loan portfolio.

Allowance components


JPMorgan Chase 2001 Annual Report


Market risk management

JPMorgan Chase employs comprehensive, rigorous processes to measure, monitor
and control market risk.

Market risk represents the potential loss in value of portfolios and financial
instruments caused by movements in market variables, such as interest and
foreign-exchange rates, credit spreads, and equity and commodity prices.

The Firm employs a comprehensive approach to market-risk management for its
trading, investment and asset/liability management (“A/L”) portfolios.
Responsible for maintaining a sound market-risk control environment, the Firm’s
Market Risk Management Group operates independently of the business units it
monitors, and comprises professionals in major markets around the globe.

Limits

JPMorgan Chase controls market risk primarily through a series of limits.
Approved by the Firm’s Risk Management Committee, these limits align specific
risk-taking activities with the overall risk appetite of the Firm and of the
individual business units.

Limits are set based on analyses of both the market environment and business
strategy. The analyses encompass criteria such as market volatility, liquidity
of the products involved, business track record, and management experience and
depth. JPMorgan Chase reviews risk limits regularly and the Firm’s Market Risk
Management Group updates the risk limits at least twice a year. The Market Risk
Management Group further limits the Firm’s exposure by specifically designating
which financial instruments each business unit may trade.

Types of limits and where they apply:

At the corporate level:

•

Value-at-risk (“VAR”)

•

Stress test loss advisories

At the segment and line of business levels:

•

VAR

•

Nonstatistical limits

•

P&L loss advisories

The Firm establishes VAR limits at the aggregate corporate and top-level
business, or unit levels. The Firm complements VAR with restrictions on overall
portfolio size, and the amount of value a portfolio can lose as measured by
hypothetical stress test scenarios. Additional types of limits may apply to
business sub-units. As a rule, all businesses are expected to maintain
exposures within their limits. If a limit is exceeded, the business is
responsible for immediately reducing exposure to a level within the limit. When
this is not possible within an acceptable timeframe, senior management is
consulted on the appropriate method of reducing exposure. Together, these
techniques reduce the likelihood that trading losses will exceed the risk
appetite of the Firm as a whole, or that of a single business.

Risk measurement

Because no single measure can reflect all aspects of market risk, the Firm uses
several risk measures, both statistical and nonstatistical. This combined
approach gives JPMorgan Chase a more comprehensive view of its exposure, and
enhances the stability of the Firm’s revenues from market-risk-taking
activities.

Risk measures:

•

Statistical risk measures

–

VAR

•

Nonstatistical risk measures

–

Stress testing

º Economic value

º Net interest income (“NII”)

–

Notional portfolio value

–

Basis point value (“BPV”)

–

Risk identification for large exposures (“RIFLE”)

Value-at-risk

JPMorgan Chase’s statistical risk measure, VAR, gauges the dollar amount of
potential loss from adverse market moves in an ordinary market environment.
Each business day, the Firm undertakes a comprehensive VAR calculation that
includes the trading and investment portfolios, plus all JPMorgan Chase
market-risk-related A/L activities.

JPMorgan Chase’s VAR calculation is highly
granular, comprising more than 500,000 positions and 220,000 market
prices, e.g., securities prices, interest rates, and foreign-exchange
rates. For a large portion of the Firm’s exposure, JPMorgan Chase has
implemented full-revaluation VAR, which management believes
tends to generate more accurate results.

To calculate VAR, the Firm uses historical simulation, which measures risk
across instruments and portfolios in a consistent, comparable way. This
approach assumes that actual historical changes in market prices are
representative of possible future changes. The simulation is based on data for
the previous 12-month period.

Key terms:

•

VAR: Worst-case loss expected within the confidence level; while larger losses are possible, they have a correspondingly low
probability of actually occurring

•

Full-revaluation VAR: Method that prices each financial instrument separately, based on the actual pricing models used by the lines of
business; compared with sensitivity-based VAR, which only approximates the impact of market moves on financial instrument prices

•

Back-testing: Validating a model by comparing its predictions with actual results

•

Confidence level: The probability that actual losses will not exceed estimated VAR; the greater the confidence level, the higher the VAR

JPMorgan Chase 2001 Annual Report



management’s discussion and analysis

J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.

All statistical models involve a degree of uncertainty, depending on the
assumptions they employ. The Firm prefers historical simulation because it
involves fewer assumptions about the distribution of portfolio losses than
parameter-based methodologies.

To evaluate the soundness of the Firm’s VAR model, JPMorgan Chase conducts
daily back-testing of VAR against actual financial results. In addition, the
Firm rigorously assesses the quality of the market data, since their accuracy
is critical to computing VAR.

JPMorgan Chase calculated the VAR numbers reported to the right using a one-day
time horizon and a 99% confidence level. This means the Firm would expect to
incur losses greater than predicted by VAR estimates only once in every 100
trading days, or about 2.5 times a year. For the year 2001, actual Firm-wide
trading losses exceeded the VAR on one day, a result which does not differ
significantly from the 99% confidence level.

A note on confidence levels: Commonly set between 95% and 99%, confidence
levels reflect the degree to which the statistical model accurately captures
the more extreme risks that can occur over the time horizon. Using a 95%
confidence level (as compared with a confidence level of 99%) reduces the predicted VAR by approximately 30%.

Although no single risk statistic can reflect all aspects of market risk, the
table below provides a meaningful overview of the Firm’s market risk
exposure arising from trading activities and the investment and A/L portfolio.
The investment and A/L activities are accounted for on an accrual basis;
therefore, changes in value do not impact income results in the same manner as
trading positions.

Aggregate portfolio

(a)

Substantially all of the risk is interest-rate related.

(b)

The Firm’s aggregate VAR at the end of 2001 was higher than the average VAR
primarily due to increased market volatility during November and December and
to a relatively low diversification among businesses as a result of particular
positions taken at that time. Corporate VAR at the end of 2001 is not
necessarily indicative of the Firm’s future VAR levels.

NM-

Because the minimum and maximum may occur on different days for different
risk components, it is not meaningful to compute a portfolio diversification
effect. JPMorgan Chase’s average and period-end VAR are less than the sum of
the VARs of its market risk components due to risk offsets resulting from
portfolio diversification.

As the chart at the top of the next page shows for 2001, JPMorgan Chase posted
positive daily market risk-related revenue for 220 out of 251 days, with 89
days exceeding positive $50 million. No daily trading losses were incurred in
excess of $125 million.

The inset examines the 31 days on which JPMorgan Chase posted trading losses,
and depicts the amount by which the VAR was greater than the actual loss on
each day. The inset shows that a loss exceeded the VAR on only one day (when
the Firm recognized trading losses related to its exposure to Enron), a
performance statistically consistent with the Firm’s VAR’s 99% confidence
level.

Stress testing

While VAR reflects the risk of loss due to unlikely events in normal markets,
stress testing captures the Firm’s exposure to unlikely but plausible events in
abnormal markets. Stress testing is equally important as VAR to the Firm in
measuring and controlling its risk. The Firm stress tests its portfolios at
least once a month, at both the corporate and line-of-business levels, using
multiple scenarios. Scenarios are continually reviewed and updated to reflect
changes in the Firm’s risk profile and economic events.

The Firm’s stress testing methodology assumes that, during an actual stress
event, no action would be taken to change the risk profile of the Firm’s
portfolios. This lets the Firm capture the decreased liquidity that often
occurs with abnormal markets, and results, in the Firm’s view, in a
conservative stress test result.

The Firm’s Risk Management Committee has established stress test loss
advisories for the Firm. Should a stress test loss exceed a designated
threshold, responsible business managers and senior management discuss how best
to reduce the relevant risk exposure.

JPMorgan Chase conducts both economic-value and NII stress tests. Applying
economic-value stress tests to the Firm’s trading portfolio, investment
portfolio and A/L activities helps the Firm understand how the economic value
of its balance sheet (not the amounts reported under GAAP) would be likely to
change under certain scenarios.

Corporate stress-test results for the month of December reflect updated
market stress scenarios.

The more conventional NII stress test reveals the potential change in JPMorgan
Chase’s net interest income over the next year. NII stress tests highlight
exposures to various interest-rate-sensitive factors, such as rates (e.g., the
prime-lending rate), pricing strategies on deposits, and changes in product
mix. NII stress tests also take into account forecasted balance sheet changes,
such as asset sales and securitizations, as well as prepayment and reinvestment
behavior.

Other nonstatistical risk measures

Nonstatistical risk measures other than stress testing include net open
positions, basis point values, option sensitivities, position concentrations
and position turnover. These risk measures provide additional information on an
exposure’s size and the direction in which it is moving.

Some material risks may escape detection through VAR, stress testing and the
nonstatistical risk measures described above. JPMorgan Chase identifies these
potential earnings vulnerabilities through the RIFLE system. Individuals who
manage risk positions use this system to identify potential “worst-case” losses
and estimate the probability of loss. Through RIFLE, this information flows to
the appropriate level of management.

Capital allocation

JPMorgan Chase allocates market risk capital to each major business division
according to a formula that weights the division’s VAR and stress test
exposures.

The VAR measure captures a large number of one-day price moves, while stress
tests capture a smaller number of very large price moves. Under the capital
allocation formula, capital is allocated to VAR exposure and stress test
exposure equally.

Operational risk management

•

Operational risk management is a principal risk discipline within the Firm

•

Business managers are responsible for maintaining a comprehensive system of internal controls in order to manage
operational risk effectively

•

The Corporate Operational Risk team is executing a multi-year plan to develop a new, integrated, firm-wide
approach for managing and analyzing operational risk

Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed
processes or systems, human factors, or external events.

Overview

Operational risk is an inherent risk element in each of the Firm’s businesses
and key support activities. Such risk can manifest itself in various ways,
including breakdowns, errors, business interruptions, and inappropriate
behavior of employees, and can potentially result in financial losses and other
damage to the Firm.

To monitor and control such risk, the Firm maintains a system of comprehensive
policies and a control framework designed to provide a sound and
well-controlled operational environment. The goal is to keep operational risk
at appropriate levels in view of the Firm’s financial strength, the
characteristics of its businesses and the markets in which it operates, and the
competitive and regulatory environment to which it is subject.

Notwithstanding its control environment, the Firm has incurred operational risk
losses from time to time, and there can be no assurance that such losses will
not be incurred in the future.

Components of the JPMorgan Chase operational risk management practice

The Firm’s operational risk practice is comprised of several integrated
components:

Governance structure:

The governance structure provides the framework for, and
sets the direction of, the Firm’s operational risk management activities.

Primary responsibility for managing operational risk rests with business
managers. These individuals, with the support of their staffs, are responsible
for establishing and maintaining internal control procedures that are
appropriate for their particular operating environments.

The Corporate Operational Risk (“COR”) team, reporting to the Firm’s
Productivity and Quality Executive under the overall responsibility of the Vice
Chairman for Finance, Risk Management and Administration, has oversight
responsibility for the Firm’s operational risk management initiatives. The COR
team is currently executing a multi-year plan to develop a new integrated
operational risk approach that emphasizes active management of operational risk
throughout the Firm.

In 2001, the COR team created the Operational Risk Committee (“ORC”), comprised
of senior operational risk and finance managers from each of the businesses.
The ORC meets quarterly to discuss key operational risk issues of importance to
the Firm. In addition, each of the businesses is required by COR policy to
maintain business control committees which are responsible for overseeing the
operational risk management practices within their respective businesses.

Self-assessment process:

In 2001, a revised, firm-wide self-assessment process
was designed and implemented. The focus of the process is to identify the key
risks specific to each business’ operating environment, and for each business
to assess the degree to which it is maintaining internal control procedures
appropriate for its operating environment.

Components of the Firm’s operational risk management practice

•

Governance structure

•

Corporate Operational Risk team oversight

•

Operational risk policies

•

Operational Risk Committee

•

Business control committees

•

Self-assessment process

•

Owned by the businesses

•

•

Automated using Horizon tool

•

Risk event database

•

Internal data collected and analyzed

•

Enables comparative analysis with external data (where available)

•

Use of key risk indicators as leading indicators

•

Alignment with internal audit activities


JPMorgan Chase 2001 Annual Report


Year-end self-assessments were completed by the businesses in 2001 utilizing
Horizon, an automated software application developed by the Firm. With the aid
of Horizon, the Firm expects to move in 2002 from an annual, year-end
self-assessment process to one that will be used by the businesses as an
ongoing, dynamic risk management tool.

Risk event database:

This database was extended firm-wide in 2001. The database
enables the collection of operational event data thereby permitting analysis of
errors and losses incurred (including analysis of trends and patterns), leading
to a better understanding of the risk events faced by the businesses. Where
available, the internal data can be supplemented with external data for
comparative analysis with industry patterns. The data collected in the risk
event database will also enable the Firm to back-test against self-assessment
results.

Key risk indicators:

Many of the businesses have incorporated “key risk
indicators” for use as leading indicators in their operational risk management
practices. This risk management tool will be further developed in 2002.

Audit alignment:

Close collaboration between the COR team and the Firm’s
internal audit function has helped further the firm-wide implementation of the
operational risk approach, which in turn has led to a stronger overall control
environment.

Capital allocation methodology

A combined capital amount for operational risk and business risk is derived
through top-down benchmarking, by business, against comparable financial
institutions. Capital is allocated to each business based on its complexity,
expense base and control quality.

Benefits of an integrated approach to operational risk management

2002 initiatives

Specific 2002 initiatives include:

Impact of the events of September 11 on the operational risk practices of the Firm

The events of September 11th strongly tested the Firm’s operational risk
practices, and demonstrated the importance of its disaster recovery contingency
planning. While the Firm’s businesses were able successfully to implement their
disaster recovery plans, and to avoid serious operational losses, there were
nevertheless important lessons learned by the entire financial community. These
lessons are currently under review for incorporation, as appropriate, into the
Firm’s ongoing contingency planning.

JPMorgan Chase 2001 Annual Report

Liquidity risk management

The JPMorgan Chase liquidity risk management framework incorporates a
Contingency Funding Plan and three main monitoring tools:

•

Cash capital surplus

•

Basic surplus

•

Holding company short-term surplus

Liquidity risk management policy

Liquidity risk arises from the general funding needs of the Firm’s activities
and in the management of its assets. Liquidity risk management focuses on the
risk that the Firm will be unable to replace maturing obligations when due or
fund its assets at appropriate maturities and rates.

JPMorgan Chase recognizes the importance of sound liquidity management and has
developed a liquidity framework intended to maximize liquidity access and
minimize funding costs.

Liquidity risk management responsibilities

The Capital Committee sets the overall liquidity policy and oversees the
contingency funding plan. The Capital Committee also reviews the Firm’s
exposure to special purpose entities (“SPE”), with particular focus on
potential liquidity support requirements the Firm may have to such SPEs.

The Liquidity Risk Committee is responsible for policy adherence, developing
contingency planning, and monitoring internal and external liquidity warning
signals, such as unusual widening of spreads, to permit timely detection of
liquidity issues.

Liquidity risk management framework

The contingency funding plan considers temporary and long-term stress
scenarios, where access to unsecured funding is severely limited or
nonexistent.

The plan forecasts potential funding needs, taking into account both on- and
off-balance sheet exposures, evaluating separately access to funds by the
parent holding company and JPMorgan Chase Bank.

The goals of the plan are intended to ensure:

•

Maintenance of appropriate liquidity during normal and stress periods

•

Measurement and projection of funding requirements during periods of stress

•

Management of access to funding sources

The Firm’s liquidity risk framework also incorporates tools to monitor three
primary measures of liquidity. Each liquidity position is managed to provide
sufficient surplus liquidity:

•

Cash capital surplus:

Measures the Firm’s ability to fund assets on a fully
collateralized basis, assuming access to unsecured funding is lost.

•

Basic surplus:

Measures JPMorgan Chase Bank’s ability to sustain a 90-day
stress event that is specific to the Firm where no new funding can be raised to
meet obligations as they come due.

•

Holding company short-term surplus:

Measures the parent holding company’s
ability to repay all obligations with a maturity under one year at a time when
the ability of the Firm’s banks to pay dividends to the parent holding company
is constrained.

All three measures involve estimates and rely on management’s judgment about
the Firm’s ability to liquidate assets or use them as collateral for
borrowings.

Each of the Firm’s liquidity surplus positions, as of December 31, 2001,
indicate that JPMorgan Chase’s long-dated funding, including core deposits,
exceeds illiquid assets and that the Firm’s obligations can be met if access to
funding is impaired.

The following table summarizes JPMorgan Chase’s contractual cash obligations
and off-balance sheet lending-related financial instruments by remaining
maturity at December 31, 2001:

(a)

Includes $41.9 billion in unfunded commitments with commercial paper
conduits. Such commitments may be drawn
upon if the commercial paper market is not available to the issuer.


JPMorgan Chase 2001 Annual Report


Sources of funds

JPMorgan Chase has access to diverse global funding sources. Liquidity is
provided by a variety of both short-term and long-term instruments, including
deposits, federal funds purchased, repurchase agreements, commercial paper,
bank notes, medium- and long-term debt, capital securities, and stockholders’
equity.

A major source of liquidity for the Firm’s bank subsidiaries arises from their
ability to generate core deposits. Core deposits include all domestic deposits,
except noninterest-bearing time deposits and certificates of deposit of
$100,000 or more. In addition to core deposits, the Firm generates substantial
deposits from its Treasury & Securities Services business.

The ability to sell assets quickly is an important additional source of
liquidity for the Firm. JPMorgan Chase holds marketable securities and other
short-term investments that can be readily converted to cash. Loan syndication
networks also are utilized to facilitate the disposition of assets when deemed
desirable.

The Firm uses asset securitization programs as alternative funding sources, to
provide liquidity and for asset/liability management purposes. In particular,
securitization activities provide financing for credit cards, residential
mortgages, auto loans, and commercial loans originated by JPMorgan Chase. SPEs
are an integral part of securitization structures. Transactions between the
Firm and these entities are reflected in JPMorgan Chase’s financial statements;
these relationships include retained interests in securitization trusts,
derivative transactions, and liquidity facilities. For further details, see
Notes 1, 9, and 25.

The diversity of the Firm’s funding sources enhances funding flexibility,
limits dependence on any one source of funds, and generally lowers the cost of
funds. In making funding decisions, management considers market conditions,
prevailing interest rates, liquidity needs, and the desired maturity profile of
its liabilities.

Credit ratings

The cost and availability of unsecured financing are influenced by credit
ratings. A reduction in these ratings could increase cost and limit market
access.

JPMorgan Chase’s parent holding company credit ratings as of December 31, 2001 were as follows:

Short-term debt

Senior long-term debt

Fitch

F-1+

AA-

Moody’s

P-1

Aa3

S&P

A-1+

AA-

The ratings of the senior obligations of JPMorgan Chase Bank are generally one
notch higher than the parent holding company. At February 28, 2002, the ratings
outlook for the parent holding company by Standard & Poor’s and Fitch were
negative, while the rating outlook from Moody’s was stable.

JPMorgan Chase 2001 Annual Report

Private equity risk management

Risk management

JPMorgan Partners employs processes for risk measurement and control that are
similar to those employed for other businesses within the Firm. Risk is
initially monitored through limits calculated on original investment cost for
the privately-held securities in JPMP’s portfolio through risk-based measures
such as VAR and stress tests for the publicly-held securities in the portfolio.

JPMP’s limits are also structured to monitor potential industry sector and
regional concentration issues. Industry limits have been set limiting the
portfolio’s cost basis not to exceed 20% to any single sector. Regional limits
have been set limiting the portfolio’s cost basis in international investments
not to exceed 40%. In addition, to manage the pace of new investment activity,
a ceiling on the amount of annual direct private equity investment activity has
been set.

JPMorgan Partners’ holdings in public equities creates a significant exposure
to general declines in the equity markets. To gauge that risk, VAR and stress
test exposures are calculated in the same way as they are for the Firm’s
trading and investment and asset/liability portfolios. See the Market risk
management section of the MD&A on pages 55-57. In addition, to reduce the
revenue volatility that results from this exposure, the Firm entered into
hedging transactions that were intended to partially offset public equity
market movements. These hedges were initially entered into during the third
quarter of 2001. At the end of 2001, cumulative losses from these hedges were
$71 million, primarily as a result of a rise in equity market price levels
while the hedges were in place. The Firm may change the nature and type of
hedges it enters into, as well as close a hedging position altogether, at any
point in time.

Capital allocation

Internal capital is allocated to JPMP’s public equities portfolio based on
stress scenarios that are similar to those applied to other businesses, and
which reflect potential loss in the event of a large equity market decline.
Capital is also allocated against illiquidity risk, which results from the
trading restrictions to which some holdings are subject. For private equities,
capital is allocated based on a long-term equity market stress scenario that is
consistent with the investment horizons associated with these holdings. For
these investments, additional capital is allocated against the risk of an
unexpectedly large number of write-offs or write-downs.

For both public and private equities, the overall internal capital allocation
exceeds 50% of the investments’ carrying value. This is a significantly higher
allocation than the amount that is currently required for regulatory capital.

Accounting and reporting developments

Business combinations and intangible assets

In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS 141, which revises the financial accounting
and reporting for business combinations, and SFAS 142, which revises the
financial accounting and reporting for goodwill and other intangible assets.
SFAS 141 requires that all business combinations be accounted for using the
purchase method. Accounting for business combinations using the pooling of
interests method no longer is allowed. SFAS 141 also requires that intangible
assets acquired in a business combination be recognized apart from goodwill if
the intangible assets meet one of two criteria — the contractual-legal
criterion or the separability criterion. The provisions of SFAS 141 apply to
all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001 as well as business
combinations accounted for by the purchase method for which the date of
acquisition is July 1, 2001 or later.

SFAS 142 establishes how intangible assets (other than those acquired in a
business combination) should be accounted for upon acquisition. It also
addresses how goodwill and other intangible assets should be accounted for
subsequent to their acquisition. Goodwill and intangible assets that have
indefinite useful lives no longer will be amortized but will be tested at least
annually for impairment. Intangible assets with finite lives will continue to
be amortized over their useful lives. The provisions of SFAS 142 are required
to be adopted January 1, 2002. Impairment losses that arise due to the initial
application of SFAS 142 are required to be reported as a change in accounting
principle.

The Firm has determined that the adoption of SFAS 142 will not result in an
impairment of goodwill. Based on current levels of amortization expense, the
Firm estimates that the elimination of goodwill amortization expense will
reduce total noninterest expense by approximately $580 million during 2002 and
that ongoing amortization expense will be approximately $150 million per year
(prior to the Providian card acquisition in the first quarter of 2002).

Derivatives

JPMorgan Chase adopted SFAS 133, which establishes accounting and reporting
standards for all derivative instruments, at January 1, 2001. For a further
discussion on the adoption of SFAS 133, see Note 24.

Allowance for loan losses

In 1999, the Accounting Standards Executive Committee of the American Institute
of Certified Public Accountants formed the Allowance for Loan Losses Task Force
(“Task Force”) to research current accounting guidance and practices as they
relate to loan losses. It is currently expected that the Task Force will issue
an exposure draft of a statement of position in the second half of 2002 that
will provide additional accounting and reporting guidance and clarification of
the factors to consider in determining the allowance for loan losses.


JPMorgan Chase 2001 Annual Report


Comparison between 2000 and 1999

JPMorgan Chase’s reported net income was $5.73 billion in 2000 compared with
$7.50 billion in 1999. Diluted net income per share was $2.86 in 2000 compared
with $3.69 in 1999.

Operating results Including JPMP

Operating earnings, including JPMorgan Partners, were $5.93 billion in 2000, a
decrease of 20% from 1999. Diluted operating earnings per share decreased 19%
when compared with the prior year.

Operating revenues in 2000 rose 3% to $32.8 billion reflecting the impact of
the Hambrecht & Quist (“H&Q”), Flemings and The Beacon Group, LLC (“Beacon”)
acquisitions, which resulted in higher investment banking fees, trading-related
revenue and fees and commissions. The increases in revenues were partially
offset by lower private equity gains, which were significantly affected by the
sharp decline in the NASDAQ during 2000 compared with 1999. Net interest
income, on an operating basis, was $10.0 billion in 2000, remaining relatively
stable with 1999.

Operating expenses were $21.4 billion in 2000, an increase of 20% from the
prior year. The growth in expenses reflected, in particular, the investments in
talent and infrastructure of the Investment Bank to deepen its product
capabilities, and at Investment Management & Private Banking to broaden its
geographic reach.

Credit costs during 2000 were $2.37 billion compared with $2.44 billion in
1999. The slight decrease was due to the impact of lower net charge-offs in
both the commercial and consumer loan portfolios.

Income tax expense in 2000 on a reported basis was $3.01 billion compared with
$3.99 billion in 1999. The effective tax rate was 34.4% for 2000 compared with
34.7% for 1999.

Operating results excluding JPMP

JPMorgan Chase’s cash operating earnings, excluding JPMorgan Partners, were
$6.2 billion in 2000, an increase of 4% from 1999. Diluted cash operating
earnings per share increased 6%, when compared with 1999.

Segment results

Investment Bank cash operating earnings of $3.49 billion for 2000 were up 3%
when compared with 1999. Revenue growth was driven by higher investment banking
fees, trading-related revenue and fees and commissions attributable to the
acquisitions of Flemings, H&Q, and Beacon. These acquisitions contributed to
the advisory and securities underwriting business, in particular, within the
media, telecommunications, healthcare and technology-related industries. Also
an effect of the acquisitions was the significant increase in brokerage
commissions associated with the strong market making volume.

Cash operating expenses rose during 2000 primarily due to the build up of the
investment banking platform and the inclusion of Flemings and H&Q. In addition,
incentive costs increased as a result of the growth in revenue and
acquisition-related compensation commitments to retain key executives.

Treasury & Securities Services cash operating earnings in 2000 increased 28%
when compared with 1999 reflecting revenue growth of 13% for the year.
Broad-based growth in Investor Services and Institutional Trust Services
revenues fueled the growth in revenue, with only a slight increase reflected at
Treasury Services. Expenses rose more slowly than revenues primarily due to
expense reduction efforts at Treasury Services. Total cash operating expense
rose only 8% from 1999, and combined with the higher rate of revenue growth,
operating margin improved significantly from last year.

Investment Management & Private Banking cash operating earnings in 2000
increased 67% from 1999 due to the acquisitions of Flemings and H&Q. IMPB’s
revenues increased 35% from 1999 due to the acquisitions. Pro forma for
Flemings and H&Q, revenues increased primarily due to higher Private Banking
revenues as a result of strong commission revenues and structuring fees during
the first half of 2000. Cash operating expenses of $2.52 billion in 2000 rose
28% from the prior year primarily reflecting the aforementioned acquisitions.

Assets under management within Investment Management & Private Banking stood at
$638 billion as of December 31, 2000, up from $543
billion at the end of 1999, primarily due to the acquisition of Flemings. This
excludes assets attributable to JPMorgan Chase’s 45% stake in American Century.

JPMorgan Partners cash operating earnings decreased by 86% when compared with
the prior year primarily as a result of unrealized losses associated with the
downward movement in the public equity markets in 2000. These losses were
mostly for listed companies at the NASDAQ, and particularly those that belonged
to the telecommunications and technology sectors. Many of these same
investments contributed to the significant unrealized gains recognized in 1999.
These were partially offset by record realized gains reflecting the sales of
direct investments in companies that JPMorgan Partners had financed in prior
years.

Retail & Middle Market Financial Services cash operating earnings rose 5% to
$1.79 billion. The increase in 2000 reflected the improvement in credit quality
from 1999. In addition, the solid growth in deposit volumes helped produce
strong results at RBG and Middle Markets. Partially offsetting these favorable
items were the impact of increased funding costs as a result of higher interest
rates on the credit-related businesses, namely, Cardmember
Services, Home Finance and Auto Finance, as well as the impact of a $100
million decrease in the estimated auto lease residual value recognized in the
first quarter of 2000.

During 2000, Retail & Middle Market Financial Services initiated a number of
business reorganizations that included the sale of the retail operations in
Hong Kong and Panama.

J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.

1 Basis of presentation

Consolidation

On December 31, 2000, J.P. Morgan & Co. Incorporated (“J.P. Morgan”) merged
with and into The Chase Manhattan Corporation (“Chase”). Upon consummation of
the merger, Chase changed its name to J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. (“JPMorgan Chase”
or “the Firm”). The merger was accounted for as a pooling of interests and,
accordingly, the information included in the financial statements and
consolidated notes of JPMorgan Chase reflects the combined results of Chase and
J.P. Morgan as if the merger had been in effect for all periods presented. In
addition, certain amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current
presentation.

JPMorgan Chase is a financial holding company for a group of subsidiaries that
provide a wide range of services to a global client base that includes
corporations, governments, institutions and individuals. For a discussion of
JPMorgan Chase’s business segment information, see Note 29.

The accounting and financial reporting policies of JPMorgan Chase and its
subsidiaries conform to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and
prevailing industry practices. Additionally, where applicable, the policies
conform to the accounting and reporting guidelines prescribed by bank
regulatory authorities.

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of JPMorgan Chase
and its majority-owned subsidiaries after eliminating intercompany balances and
transactions.

Investments in companies in which JPMorgan Chase has significant influence over
operating and financing decisions (generally defined as owning a voting or
economic interest of 20% to 50%) are accounted for in accordance with the
equity method of accounting. These investments are generally included in Other
assets and the Firm’s share of income or loss is included in Other revenue.

Assets held in an agency or fiduciary capacity by JPMorgan Chase are not assets
of JPMorgan Chase and are not included in the Consolidated balance sheet.

Special-purpose entities

(The terms special-purpose entity (“SPE”) and special-purpose vehicle (“SPV”)
are used interchangeably in practice.)

Special-purpose entities are an important part of the financial markets,
providing market liquidity by facilitating investors’ access to specific
portfolios of assets and risks. SPEs are typically set up for a single,
discrete purpose. SPEs are not operating entities and usually have no employees
and a limited life. The basic SPE structure involves a company selling assets
to the SPE. The SPE funds the purchase of those assets by issuing securities to
investors. The legal documents that govern the SPE transaction describe how the
cash earned on the assets held in the SPE must be allocated to the investors
and other parties that have rights to these cash flows.

SPEs can be structured to be bankruptcy remote, thereby insulating investors
from the impact of the creditors of other entities, including the seller of the
assets. They are critical to the functioning of several significant investor
markets, including, for example, the mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed
securities and commercial paper markets.

Where JPMorgan Chase is a transferor of assets to an SPE, the assets sold to
the SPE are derecognized and the SPE is not consolidated on the balance sheet
when the assets are legally isolated from the Firm’s creditors and the SPE is a
qualifying special-purpose entity (“QSPE”). SFAS 140, Accounting for Transfers
and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities, provides
specific criteria for determining when an SPE meets the definition of a QSPE.
When an SPE does not meet the formal definition of a QSPE, the decision whether
or not to consolidate depends on the applicable accounting principles for
non-QSPEs, including a determination regarding the nature and amount of
investment made by third parties to the SPE. Consideration is given to, for
example, whether a third party has made a substantive equity investment in the
SPE; which party has voting rights, if any; who makes decisions about the
assets in the SPE; and who is at risk for loss. The SPE is consolidated if
JPMorgan Chase retains or acquires control over the risks and rewards of the
assets in the SPE.

JPMorgan Chase is involved with SPEs in three broad categories of transactions:
securitizations, conduits, and client intermediation. As part of JPMorgan
Chase’s securitization activity, consumer or commercial loans are sold to an
SPE from the Firm’s balance sheet (see Note 9, Loan securitizations). Consumer
securitizations involve the sale of consumer receivables originated primarily
in the Firm’s residential mortgage, credit card, and auto loan businesses; for
commercial securitizations, the Firm securitizes both Firm-originated and
purchased commercial mortgages to facilitate the issuance of commercial
mortgage-backed securities to investors. Assets sold to the SPEs as part of the
securitization process are not reflected in JPMorgan Chase’s balance sheet
(except for retained interests as described below), but are included on the
balance sheet of the SPE purchasing the assets. Assets held by
securitization-related SPEs as of December 31, 2001 were as follows:

In credit card securitizations, the Firm retains some risk of loss with respect
to the receivables held by the SPE to the extent of its subordinated retained
interest as well as its undivided interest in the credit card master trust.
This risk of loss is reflected as “managed” losses in the Firm’s discussion of
operating income. At December 31, 2001, the Firm’s undivided interest in the
credit card master trust totaled $3.9 billion and is accounted for as set

JPMorgan Chase 2001 Annual Report

J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.

forth in Note 9. Interest-only strips of $38 million are also retained and
carried on the Firm’s balance sheet at fair value. In home mortgage
securitizations and in auto securitizations, JPMorgan Chase retains an
interest-only strip (equal to $1.0 billion and $0.1 billion, respectively),
which reflects first loss risk and is carried on the Firm’s balance sheet at
fair value. In commercial mortgage securitizations, JPMorgan Chase retains a
subordinated interest (equal to $10 million), which is also carried at fair
value. With respect to securitization transactions involving other Firm assets,
the Firm holds retained interests ($56 million, which are fully hedged), and
may be obligated to fund an additional $31.8 million of senior notes. JPMorgan
Chase does not provide any other liquidity commitments to the SPEs utilized in
its commercial or consumer securitization business. All amounts above are as of
December 31, 2001.

For conduit transactions, JPMorgan Chase serves as the administrator and
provides contingency liquidity support for several commercial paper conduits.
Conduits provide clients with a way to access liquidity in the commercial paper
markets by allowing clients to sell assets to the conduit, which then issues
commercial paper to fund the purchases. Issuance of commercial paper by
conduits aggregated $20.2 billion at December 31, 2001. The commercial paper
issued by the conduits is supported with sufficient asset collateral, other
credit enhancement, and liquidity support to receive at least an A-1 or P-1
rating. JPMorgan Chase Bank has commitments to provide liquidity to these
conduits up to $26.2 billion of commercial paper issuances. JPMorgan Chase
applies the same underwriting standards in making liquidity commitments to the
conduits as the Firm would with other extensions of credit.

As a financial intermediary, JPMorgan Chase is involved in structuring SPE
transactions to meet investor and client needs. In this capacity, JPMorgan
Chase has created structured commercial loan vehicles managed by third parties
in which loans are purchased from third parties or through the Firm’s
syndication and trading functions. Investors in these vehicles provide cash
collateral and have a first risk of loss up to the amount of collateral
committed. JPMorgan Chase retains a second risk of loss or has the option to
sell loans from the vehicles if assets deteriorate below specified levels.
Issuance of commercial paper by these vehicles as of December 31, 2001 was $9.1
billion. JPMorgan Chase Bank has a commitment to provide liquidity to these
vehicles for up to $12.0 billion of commercial paper issuances.

As a financial intermediary, JPMorgan Chase also structures SPEs to modify the
cash flows of third-party assets to create investments with specific risk
profiles, or to assist clients in the efficient management of other risks.
JPMorgan Chase may enter into derivative contracts with these SPEs to
accomplish these ends. These derivative contracts are captured on the Firm’s
balance sheet in Trading assets or Trading liabilities in the same manner as
other derivative contracts and are marked-to-market through Trading revenue.
Fees received from any administrative functions related to SPEs (underwriter,
trustee, custodian, etc.) are included when earned in Fees and commissions.
Note 4 provides details on JPMorgan Chase’s Noninterest revenue.

JPMorgan Chase’s maximum liquidity commitment to the structured commercial loan
vehicles, the commercial paper conduits and to other client transactions ($3.7
billion) totaled $41.9 billion at December 31, 2001. These commitments are
included in the Firm’s total of $248 billion in commitments to lend described
in more detail in Note 25 and the Liquidity discussion on page 60 of the MD&A.
The Firm would be required to fund these commitments in the event the
commercial paper market were unavailable to these vehicles. In addition, if
JPMorgan Chase Bank were downgraded below A-1 or P-1, the SPEs could draw on
the commitments since asset-backed commercial paper rated below A-1 or P-1
would generally not be issuable by the vehicle. Under these circumstances,
JPMorgan Chase Bank would have the option to replace itself as liquidity
provider or the assets in the SPE could be sold or refinanced in other markets.
In no circumstances is the Firm committed to issue its own stock to support an
SPE transaction.

As noted above, all transactions and retained interests between the Firm and
the SPEs are reflected in JPMorgan Chase’s balance sheet or Notes to the
financial statements. Internal economic capital is held against all residual
exposures, derivative transactions and lending commitments, as appropriate. The
Firm’s policies require that transactions with SPEs be conducted at arms’
length and reflect market pricing. Consistent with this policy, no JPMorgan
Chase employee is permitted to invest in the SPEs with which JPMorgan Chase are
involved.

Use of estimates in the preparation of consolidated financial statements

The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to
make estimates and assumptions that affect reported revenues, expenses, assets,
liabilities, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual
results could be different from these estimates.

Foreign currency translation

Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are
translated into U.S. dollars using applicable rates of exchange. JPMorgan Chase
translates revenues and expenses using exchange rates at the transaction date.

Gains and losses from translating the financial statements of a foreign
operation where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar are included in
Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within Stockholders’ equity. For
foreign operations where the functional currency is the U.S. dollar, which
include operations in highly inflationary environments, transaction gains and
losses are reported in the Consolidated statement of income.

Statement of cash flows

For JPMorgan Chase’s Consolidated statement of cash flows, cash and cash
equivalents is defined as those amounts included in Cash and due from banks.


JPMorgan Chase 2001 Annual Report


Significant accounting policies

The following table identifies JPMorgan Chase’s significant accounting policies
and the Note and page where a detailed description of each policy can be found:

2 Business changes and developments

Merger with J.P. Morgan on December 31, 2000

Under the terms of the merger agreement, 617 million shares of JPMorgan Chase’s
common stock were issued in exchange for all of the outstanding shares of J.P.
Morgan’s common stock (based on an exchange ratio of 3.7 shares of JPMorgan
Chase’s common stock for each share of J.P. Morgan’s common stock). All of J.P.
Morgan’s series of preferred stock were exchanged on a one-for-one basis for a
corresponding series of JPMorgan Chase’s preferred stock having substantially
the same terms.

Acquisition of the mortgage business of Advanta Corp.

In the first quarter of 2001, Chase Manhattan Mortgage Corporation, an indirect
subsidiary of JPMorgan Chase, acquired all of the mortgage business of Advanta
Corp. The acquisition included Advanta’s origination capability, loan servicing
and subservicing portfolio, and related securitization residual interests.

Sale of Hong Kong retail banking business

During the fourth quarter of 2000, Chase completed the sale of its Hong
Kong-based retail banking business, including Chase Manhattan Card Company
Limited, to Standard Chartered PLC for $1.3 billion in cash. The sale resulted
in a pre-tax gain of $827 million ($537 million after-tax).

Transfer of Euroclear-related business

On December 31, 2000, J.P. Morgan and the Boards of Euroclear Clearance System
PLC and Euroclear Clearance System Société Cooperative consummated their
agreement and created a European-based bank in Brussels, known as Euroclear
Bank, which assumed the operations of the Euroclear System from J.P. Morgan.
The transfer resulted in a gain of $399 million ($267 million after-tax) in
2000, which reflected the impact of the minimum proceeds to be received from
the Euroclear Bank over the next two years. In addition, under the agreement,
the Firm could receive additional proceeds of up to $100 million per year for
each of 2001 and 2002 based on the financial performance of the Euroclear Bank
during those periods. The Firm received $16 million of additional proceeds in
2001.

Sale of ChaseMellon shareholder services

On October 16, 2000, Chase agreed to sell its interest in ChaseMellon
Shareholder Services, then a 50-50 joint venture between Chase and Mellon
Financial Corporation. The sale was completed during November 2000 and did not
have a material impact on JPMorgan Chase’s earnings.

Acquisition of Flemings

On August 1, 2000, Chase acquired Robert Fleming Holdings Limited (“Flemings”).
The consideration issued to Flemings’ shareholders consisted of £2.6 billion in
cash and notes and 65.3 million shares of Chase common stock. Chase also
established retention arrangements for key Flemings employees that aggregated
approximately $220 million (after-tax) and are generally being expensed over
the two years following the acquisition. The transaction was accounted for
under the purchase method.

Acquisition of Beacon

Chase acquired The Beacon Group, LLC (“Beacon”), a privately held investment
banking firm, on July 6, 2000. The acquisition was accounted for under the
purchase method.

Acquisition of Hambrecht & Quist

Chase acquired Hambrecht & Quist (“H&Q”) for $1.46 billion on December 9, 1999.
The acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method.

3 Trading activities

Trading assets include debt and equity securities held for trading purposes
that JPMorgan Chase owns (“long” positions). Trading liabilities include debt
and equity securities that JPMorgan Chase has sold to other parties but does
not own. These securities are “short” positions, and JPMorgan Chase is
obligated to purchase these securities at a future date. Also included in
Trading liabilities are structured notes that JPMorgan Chase transacts as part
of its trading activity. Trading positions, as well as derivatives used for
trading purposes, are carried at fair value on the Consolidated balance sheet,
with changes in the fair value recorded in Trading revenue. Trading positions
are recorded on a trade date basis. The reported receivables (unrealized gains)
and payables (unrealized losses) related to derivatives include the effect of
master netting agreements as permitted under FASB Interpretation No. 39.

The following table shows the components of these costs during 2001 and 2000:

The following table shows the utilization of the $1.25 billion merger liability during 2001 and 2000:

(a)

The remaining balance consists primarily of facilities costs.

Management initially estimated that the Firm would incur one-time costs of $3.2
billion in connection with the merger of J.P. Morgan and Chase. These costs
consisted of a $1.25 billion merger charge that was recorded on the December
31, 2000 merger date and $1.95 billion of other costs to be incurred in 2001
and 2002 that were not accruable under existing accounting pronouncements.

In September 2001, management estimated that $650 million of additional
nonaccruable merger costs would be incurred in 2001 and 2002. These costs
consisted primarily of systems integration costs, facilities costs and
retention payments. In September 2001, management estimated that the Firm would
also incur one-time costs of $400 million in connection with the right-sizing
of employee levels of certain businesses (2,000 employee reductions) beyond
that planned at the time of the merger. These severance costs consisted of a
$300 million charge that was recorded on September 30, 2001 and $100 million of
costs to be incurred in 2001 and 2002 that were not accruable under existing
accounting pronouncements. In 2001, $259 million of the right-sizing liability
was utilized resulting in a remaining balance of $41 million at December 31,
2001.

In connection with several strategic restructuring initiatives in the fourth
quarter of 1999, JPMorgan Chase incurred a charge of $175 million for planned
consolidation actions in certain businesses, planned staff reductions, and the
disposition of premises and equipment resulting from the relocation of several
businesses to Florida, Texas and Massachusetts. At December 31, 2001, the
related restructuring liability was fully utilized. Additionally, in December
1999, $152 million of costs were reversed, primarily relating to occupancy
costs not fully utilized under a restructuring charge incurred in 1998.

Includes a $100 million special contribution to The Chase Manhattan
Foundation in 1999.

7 Securities

Securities are classified as Available-for-sale (“AFS”), Held-to-maturity
(“HTM”), or trading. Securities are classified as AFS when, in management’s
judgment, they may be sold in response to or in anticipation of changes in
market conditions. AFS securities are carried at fair value on the Consolidated
balance sheet. Unrealized gains and losses after application of hedge
accounting are reported net as increases or decreases to Accumulated other
comprehensive income (loss). The specific identification method is used to
determine realized gains and losses on AFS securities, which are included in
Securities gains (losses) on the Consolidated statement of income. Securities
that JPMorgan Chase has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are
classified as HTM and are carried at amortized cost on the Consolidated balance
sheet.

The following table presents realized gains and losses from AFS securities:

Includes the impact of related derivatives.

AFS securities pledged as collateral that can be sold or repledged by the
secured party amounted to $30.2 billion and $28.7 billion at December 31, 2001
and 2000, respectively.

In the calculation of effective yield for mortgage-backed securities (“MBS”)
and collateralized mortgage obligations (“CMO”), JPMorgan Chase actively
monitors the likelihood of prepayment of principal through its portfolio
management function. Management regularly performs simulation testing to
determine the impact that market conditions would have on its MBS and CMO
portfolios. MBSs and CMOs that management believes have high prepayment risk
are included in the AFS portfolio and reported at fair value.

The amortized cost and estimated fair value of AFS and HTM securities were as
follows for the dates indicated:

(a)

Includes CMOs of private issuers, which generally have underlying
collateral consisting of obligations of U.S. government and federal
agencies and corporations.

(b)

As of December 31, 2001, there were no securities of a single issuer,
excluding the U.S. Treasury and U.S. government agencies, whose fair value
exceeded 10% of JPMorgan Chase’s Stockholders’ equity.

(c)

Primarily mortgage-backed securities.

(d)

Includes the impact of related derivatives. Prior to adoption of SFAS
133, related hedges were carried at fair value and unrealized gains and
losses were recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).


JPMorgan Chase 2001 Annual Report


The following table presents the amortized cost, estimated fair value and
average yield at December 31, 2001 of JPMorgan Chase’s AFS and HTM
securities by contractual maturity range:

(a)

The average yield is based on amortized cost balances at year-end. Yields
are derived by dividing interest income (including the effect of related
derivatives on AFS securities and the
amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts) by total amortized cost.
Taxable-equivalent yields are used where applicable.

(b)

Securities with no stated maturity are included with securities with a
contractual maturity of 10 years or more. Substantially all of JPMorgan
Chase’s MBSs and CMOs are due in 10 years or
more based on contractual maturity. The estimated duration, which reflects
anticipated future prepayments based on a consensus of dealers in the market,
is approximately three years for
MBSs and less than one year for CMOs.

Securities purchased under resale agreements (“resale agreements”) and
securities sold under repurchase agreements (“repurchase agreements”) are
generally treated as collateralized financing transactions and are carried on
the Consolidated balance sheet at the amounts the securities will be
subsequently sold or repurchased, plus accrued interest. Similar transactions
that do not meet the SFAS 140 definition of a repurchase agreement are
accounted for as “buys” and “sells” rather than financing
transactions. Where appropriate, resale and repurchase agreements with the
same counterparty are reported on a net basis. JPMorgan Chase takes possession
of securities purchased under resale agreements. On a daily basis, JPMorgan
Chase monitors the market value of the underlying collateral, which consists
primarily of U.S. government and agency securities, and requests additional
collateral from its counterparties when necessary.

Securities borrowed and securities lent (recorded in Other
borrowed funds) are recorded at the amount of cash collateral advanced or
received. Securities borrowed consist primarily of government and equity
securities. JPMorgan Chase monitors the market value of the securities borrowed
and lent on a daily basis and calls for additional collateral when appropriate.
Fees received or paid are recorded in Interest income or Interest expense.

8 Loans

Loans are generally reported at the principal amount outstanding, net of the
allowance for loan losses, unearned income and any net deferred loan fees
(nonrefundable yield-related loan fees, net of related direct origination
costs). Loans held for sale are carried at the lower of aggregate cost or fair
value. Loans held for trading purposes are included in Trading assets and are
carried at fair value, with the gains and losses included in Trading revenue.
Interest income is recognized using the interest method or on a basis
approximating a level rate of return over the term of the loan.

Nonaccrual loans are those loans on which the accrual of interest is
discontinued. Loans (other than certain consumer loans
discussed below) are placed on nonaccrual status immediately
if, in the opinion of management, full payment of principal or interest is in
doubt or when principal or interest is past due 90 days or more and collateral,
if any, is insufficient to cover principal and interest. Interest accrued but
not collected at the date a loan is placed on nonaccrual status is reversed
against Interest income. In addition, the amortization of net deferred loan
fees is suspended when a loan is placed on nonaccrual status. Interest income
on nonaccrual loans is recognized only to the extent it is received in cash.
However, where there is doubt regarding the ultimate collectibility of the loan
principal, all cash receipts
thereafter are applied to reduce the carrying value of the loan. Loans are
restored to accrual status only when interest and
principal payments are brought current and future payments
are reasonably assured.

Consumer loans are generally charged to the allowance for loan losses upon
reaching specified stages of delinquency in accordance with the Federal
Financial Institutions Examination Council’s (“FFIEC”) policy. For example,
credit card loans are charged off at the earlier of 180 days past due or within
60 days from receiving notification of the filing of bankruptcy. Residential
mortgage products are generally charged off to net realizable value at 180 days
past due. Other consumer products are generally charged
off (to net realizable value if collateralized) at 120 days past due. Accrued
interest on residential mortgage products, auto financings and certain other
consumer loans are accounted for in accordance with the nonaccrual loan policy
discussed above. Accrued interest on all other loans is generally reversed
against interest income when the consumer loan is charged off.

A collateralized loan is considered an in-substance foreclosure and is
reclassified to assets acquired as loan satisfactions, within Other assets,
only when JPMorgan Chase has taken physical possession of the collateral,
regardless of whether formal foreclosure proceedings have taken place.

JPMorgan Chase 2001 Annual Report



notes to consolidated financial statements

J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.

The composition of the loan portfolio at each of the
dates indicated was as follows:

(a)

Loans are presented net of unearned income of $1,825 million and $1,571
million at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

Impaired loans

JPMorgan Chase accounts for and discloses nonaccrual commercial loans as
impaired loans. JPMorgan Chase recognizes interest income on impaired loans as
discussed previously for nonaccrual loans. JPMorgan Chase excludes from
impaired loans its small-balance homogeneous consumer loans, loans carried at
fair value or the lower of cost or fair value, debt securities and leases.

The table below sets forth information about JPMorgan Chase’s impaired loans.
JPMorgan Chase uses the discounted cash flow method as its primary method for
valuing its impaired loans:

(a)

When the discounted cash flows, collateral value or market price equals
or exceeds the carrying value of the loan, then the loan does not require
an allowance under SFAS 114.

(b)

The allowance for impaired loans under SFAS 114 is included in JPMorgan
Chase’s allowance for loan losses.

Allowance for credit losses

JPMorgan Chase’s Allowance for loan losses is intended to cover probable credit
losses for which either the asset is not specifically identified or the size of
the loss has not been fully determined. Within the allowance, there are
specific and expected loss components and a residual component.

The

specific loss component

covers those commercial loans deemed by JPMorgan
Chase to be criticized. JPMorgan Chase internally categorizes its criticized
commercial loans into three groups: doubtful, substandard and special mention.

Nonperforming commercial loans (excluding leases) are considered to be impaired
loans. The allowance for impaired loans is computed using the methodology under
SFAS 114. An allowance is established when the discounted cash flows (or
collateral value or observable market price) of an impaired loan is lower than
the carrying value of that loan. For the purposes of computing the specific
loss component of the allowance, larger impaired loans are evaluated
individually, and smaller impaired loans are evaluated as a pool using
historical loss experience for the respective class of assets. The criticized
but still performing loans also are evaluated as a pool using historical loss
rates.

The

expected loss component

covers performing commercial loans (except
criticized loans) and consumer loans.

Expected losses are the product of default probability and loss severity. The
computation of the expected loss component of
the allowance is based on estimates of these factors in JPMorgan Chase’s credit
risk capital model. These estimates are differentiated by risk rating and
maturity for commercial loans.

The expected loss estimates for each consumer loan portfolio are based
primarily on JPMorgan Chase’s historical loss experience for the applicable
product portfolio.


JPMorgan Chase 2001 Annual Report


Finally, a

residual component

is maintained to cover uncertainties that
could affect management’s estimate of probable losses. The residual
component of the allowance reflects the margin of imprecision inherent in
the underlying assumptions used in the methodologies for estimating
specific losses and expected losses in both the commercial and consumer
portfolios. It is anticipated that the residual component of the allowance
will range between 10% and 20% of the total Allowance for loan losses.

Factors affecting the uncertainty of specific loss and expected loss estimates
include the volatility of default probabilities, rating migrations and loss
severity. These uncertainties also could relate to current macroeconomic and
political conditions, the impact
of currency devaluations on cross-border exposures, changes in underwriting
standards, unexpected correlations within the portfolio or other factors.

JPMorgan Chase’s Risk Management Committee reviews, at least quarterly, the
Allowance for loan losses relative to the risk profile of the Firm’s credit
portfolio and current economic conditions. The allowance is adjusted based on
that review if, in management’s judgment, changes are warranted. As of December
31, 2001, JPMorgan Chase deemed the allowance to be adequate (i.e., sufficient
to absorb losses that currently may exist but are not yet identifiable).

To provide for risk of losses inherent in the credit extension process,
management also computes specific and expected loss components as well as a
residual component for lending-related commitments, using a methodology similar
to that used for the loan portfolio.

9 Loan securitizations

JPMorgan Chase securitizes, sells and services residential mortgage, credit
card, automobile and commercial loans. Interests in the securitized and sold
loans are generally retained in the form of senior or subordinated
interest-only strips, subordinated tranches, escrow accounts and servicing
rights. JPMorgan Chase’s undivided interest in its credit card master trust is
recorded in and accounted for as Loans. This undivided interest represents
credit card receivables owned by JPMorgan Chase within the master trust that
have not been sold. JPMorgan Chase’s interest in these receivables rank
pari-passu with the investors’ interests in the master trust. Other retained
interests are primarily recorded in Other assets.

JPMorgan Chase retains the servicing responsibilities for all of its
residential mortgage, credit card and automobile loan securitizations and for
certain of its commercial loan securitizations and receives annual servicing
fees based on the securitized loan
balance plus certain ancillary fees. JPMorgan Chase also retains the right to
service the residential mortgage loans sold as a result of mortgage-backed
security transactions with the Government National Mortgage Association
(“GNMA”), Federal National Mortgage Association (“FNMA”) and Federal Home Loan
Mortgage Corporation (“Freddie Mac”). For a discussion of mortgage servicing
rights, see Note 10.

Gains or losses on securitizations and sales depend, in part, on the previous
carrying amount of the loans involved in the transfer and are allocated between
the loans sold and the retained interests based on their relative fair values
at the date of sale. Since quoted market prices are generally not available,
JPMorgan Chase usually estimates fair value of these retained interests by
determining the present value of future expected cash flows using modeling
techniques that incorporate management’s best estimates of key variables,
including credit losses, prepayment speeds and discount rates commensurate with
the risks involved. Gains on securitizations and sales are reported in Other
revenue. Retained interests that are subject to prepayment risk such that
JPMorgan Chase may not recover substantially all of its investment are recorded
at fair value with subsequent adjustments reflected in Other comprehensive
income or in earnings if the fair value of the retained interest has declined
below its carrying amount and such decline has been determined to be
other-than-temporary.

During 2001, JPMorgan Chase securitized approximately $7.9 billion of
residential mortgage loans, $6.0 billion of credit card loans, $2.5 billion of
automobile loans and $5.5 billion of commercial loans, resulting in pre-tax
gains on securitizations of
$242 million, $42 million, $17 million and $40 million, respectively. During
2000, JPMorgan Chase securitized approximately $2.7 billion of residential
mortgage loans, $2.9 billion of credit card loans, $1.3 billion of automobile
loans and $4.7 billion of commercial loans, resulting in pre-tax gains (losses)
on securitizations of $46 million, $7 million, $(1) million and $53 million,
respectively. In addition, JPMorgan Chase sold residential mortgage

notes to consolidated financial statements

J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.

loans totaling $45.8 billion and $21.5 billion during
2001 and 2000, respectively, primarily as GNMA, FNMA and Freddie Mac
mortgage-backed securities, which sales resulted in gains of $262 million in
2001 and $106 million in 2000.

The following table summarizes certain cash flows received from securitization
trusts for sales that were completed during 2001 and 2000 and the key economic
assumptions used in measuring the retained interests as of the dates of such
sales:

(a)

WAC/WAM: Weighted average coupon/weighted average maturity; HEP: Home
equity prepayment curve; CPR: Constant prepayment rate.

(b)

Not applicable since these retained interests are not subject to
prepayment risk.

(c)

Not applicable due to collateral coverage on loans in commercial
securitizations.

At December 31, 2001 and 2000, JPMorgan Chase had $3.9
billion and $6.7 billion, respectively, related to its undivided interest
in its credit card master trusts. JPMorgan Chase also maintains escrow
accounts up to predetermined limits for some of its residential mortgage,
credit card and automobile securitizations in the unlikely event that
deficiencies in cash flows owed to investors occur. The amounts available
in such escrow accounts are recorded in Other assets and totaled $1
million, $341 million and $79 million as of December 31, 2001 for
residential mortgage, credit card and automobile securitizations,
respectively, and $7 million, $297 million and $81 million as of December
31, 2000, respectively. In addition, the Firm had other retained
interests as of December 31, 2001 and 2000 totaling $1.0 billion
and $363 million from its residential mortgage, $38 million and $2 million
from its credit card, $141 million and $87 million from its automobile
securitizations, and $66 million and $138 million from its commercial
securitizations, respectively. These retained interests are primarily
subordinated or residual interests.

The table below outlines the key economic assumptions and the sensitivity of
the fair value at December 31, 2001 of the remaining retained interests to
immediate 10% and 20% adverse changes in those assumptions:

(a)

Not applicable since these retained interests are not subject to
prepayment risk.

(b)

Not applicable due to collateral coverage on loans in commercial
securitizations.

(c)

Includes approximately $416 million of retained interests resulting from
the acquisition of Advanta’s mortgage operations.

(d)

Unrealized gains recorded in Stockholders’ equity that relate to these
retained interests totaled $159.6 million, $5.6 million and $6.8 million
for residential mortgage, credit card and automobile, respectively.


JPMorgan Chase 2001 Annual Report


The sensitivity analysis in the preceding
table is hypothetical and should be used with caution. As the figures
indicate, changes in fair value based on a 10% variation in assumptions
generally cannot easily be extrapolated because the relationship of the change
in the assumptions to the change in fair value may not be linear. Also, in
this table, the effect that a change in a particular assumption may have on
the fair value is calculated without changing any other assumption. In
reality, changes in one factor may result in changes in another, which might
magnify or counteract the sensitivities.

Expected static pool net credit losses include actual incurred losses plus
projected net credit losses divided by the original balance of the outstandings
comprising the securitization pool. The table below displays the expected
static pool net credit losses for 2001 and 2000 based on securitizations
occurring in that year.

establishing
uniform guidelines for charge-offs on consumer loans to delinquent, bankrupt, deceased and
fraudulent borrowers. Of this total amount, $80 million relates to reported loans, and the remaining
$13 million relates to securitized loans.

10 Mortgage servicing rights

JPMorgan Chase capitalizes the value that is expected to be realized from
performing specified residential mortgage servicing
activities for others as Mortgage servicing rights (“MSRs”). Such capitalized
servicing rights are purchased or retained upon sales
or securitization of mortgages. These rights are amortized in proportion to,
and over the period of, the estimated future net servicing income stream of the
underlying mortgage loans as a reduction of the actual servicing income
received. MSRs are
periodically evaluated for impairment based on their current fair values, which
are estimated using a discounted future cash flow model that considers
portfolio characteristics and assumptions regarding prepayment speeds,
delinquency rates, ancillary revenues and other economic factors. For purposes
of evaluating and measuring impairment of MSRs, the Firm stratifies its
portfolio on the basis of the predominant risk characteristics: loan type and
interest rate. Any indicated impairment is recognized as a reduction in revenue
through a valuation allowance to the extent that the carrying value of an
individual stratum exceeds its estimated fair value. Management has used its
best judgment in estimating fair value. Since many economic factors can affect
the estimate of the fair value of MSRs, the Firm closely assesses the major
assumptions and modeling techniques used in its estimate of
the fair value of its MSRs and reviews such assumptions against market
comparables, if available. To mitigate the effect of changes in revenue from
the interest rate risk inherent in the MSRs, the Firm uses both interest rate
derivatives and AFS securities.

The following table summarizes mortgage servicing rights activity and related
amortization. It also includes the key assumptions and the sensitivity of the
fair value of MSRs at December 31, 2001 to immediate 10% and 20% adverse
changes in each of those assumptions:

CPR:

Constant prepayment rate.

JPMorgan Chase 2001 Annual Report



notes to consolidated financial statements

J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.

The sensitivity analysis in the preceding table is
hypothetical and should be used with caution. As the figures indicate, changes
in fair value based on a 10% and 20% variation in assumptions generally cannot
be easily extrapolated because the relationship of the change in the
assumptions to the change in fair value may not be linear. Also, in this table,
the effect that a change in a particular assumption may have on the fair value
is calculated without changing any other assumption. In reality, changes in one
factor may result in changes in another, which might magnify or counteract the
sensitivities.

As of January 1, 2001, certain interest rate derivatives that qualify as fair
value hedges under SFAS 133 and the related hedged MSRs are accounted for at
fair value in accordance with SFAS 133.

For the year ended December 31, 2001, the decrease in revenue resulting from
SFAS 133 valuation adjustments and the change in the valuation allowance due to
impairment totaled $1,951 million. These losses were substantially offset by
total gains of $1,773 million relating to a combination of derivative gains,
including those that qualify as SFAS 133 hedges, and realized gains from sales
of AFS securities. Prior to January 1, 2001, realized gains and losses from the
settlement or termination of derivative contracts that qualified as hedges were
deferred as adjustments to the carrying value and amortized over the remaining
life of the MSRs. At December 31, 2000 and 1999, net deferred hedge gains of
$152 million and $193 million, respectively, were included as an adjustment to
the carrying value of the MSRs.

11 Long-term debt

The following table is a summary of long-term debt (net of unamortized original
issue debt discount):

(a)

The interest rates shown are the range of contractual rates in effect at
year-end, including non-U.S. dollar fixed and variable rate issuances
which excludes the effects of related derivative
instruments. The use of these derivative instruments modifies JPMorgan Chase’s
exposure to the contractual interest rates disclosed in the table above. The
modified weighted average interest rate for total long-term debt, including
the effects of related derivative instruments, was 4.64% at December 31, 2001.

(b)

At December 31, 2001, long-term debt aggregating $3.1 billion was
redeemable at the option of JPMorgan Chase, in whole or in part, prior to
maturity, based on the terms specified in the respective notes.

(c)

The aggregate principal amount of debt that matures in each of the five
years subsequent to 2001 is $10,414 million in 2002, $5,758 million in
2003, $4,049 million in 2004, $2,879 million
in 2005 and $2,643 million in 2006.

(d)

Includes $1.2 billion of outstanding zero-coupon notes at December 31,
2001. The aggregate principal amount of these notes at their respective
maturities is $4.7 billion.


JPMorgan Chase 2001 Annual Report


JPMorgan Chase issues long-term debt
denominated in various currencies, although predominately U.S. dollars, with
both fixed and variable interest rates.

The weighted-average contractual interest rate for total long-term debt was
5.12% and 6.52% as of December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. In order to
modify exposure to interest rate and currency exchange rate movements, JPMorgan
Chase utilizes derivative instruments, primarily interest rate and currency
swaps, in conjunction with some of its debt issues. The use of these
instruments modifies the Firm’s interest expense on the associated debt. The
modified weighted average interest rate for total long-term debt, including the
effects of related derivative instruments, was 4.64% and 6.70% as of December
31, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

JPMorgan Chase has guaranteed several long-term debt issues of its
subsidiaries. Guaranteed debt totaled $180 million and $195 million at December
31, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

Guaranteed preferred beneficial interests in the Firm’s junior subordinated
deferrable interest debentures

At December 31, 2001, 11 wholly owned Delaware statutory business trusts
established by JPMorgan Chase had issued an aggregate $4,439 million in capital
securities, net of discount.
The capital securities qualify as Tier 1 capital of the Firm. The proceeds from
each issuance were invested in a corresponding series of junior subordinated
deferrable interest debentures of JPMorgan Chase. The sole asset of each
statutory business trust is the relevant debenture. The Firm has fully and
unconditionally guaranteed each of the business trust’s obligations under each
trust’s capital securities to the extent set forth in the guarantee. Each
trust’s capital securities are subject to mandatory redemption, in whole or in
part, upon repayment of the debentures at their stated maturity or earlier
redemption.

The following is a summary of the outstanding capital securities, net of
discount, issued by each trust and the junior subordinated deferrable interest
debenture issued by JPMorgan Chase to each trust as of December 31, 2001:

(a)

Represents the amount of capital securities issued to the public by each
trust. These amounts are reflected as liabilities of JPMorgan Chase.

(b)

Represents the principal amount of JPMorgan Chase debentures held as
assets by each trust. These amounts represent intercompany transactions
and are eliminated in JPMorgan Chase’s Consolidated financial
statements.

Series N are 4.50% and 10.50%, respectively. The fixed/adjustable rate
preferred stock remains fixed at 4.96% through June 30, 2003; thereafter,
the minimum and maximum rates are 5.46% and 11.46%, respectively.

14 Common stock

JPMorgan Chase is authorized to issue 4.5 billion shares of

On July 19, 2001, JPMorgan Chase’s Board of Directors authorized the repurchase
of up to $6 billion of the Firm’s common stock, net of issuance for employee
benefit plans. As of December 31, 2001, the Firm had repurchased 21.9 million
shares of common stock under this authorization. During 2001, approximately
65.0 million shares were issued, under various employee stock option and other
stock-based plans, and
approximately 1.8 million shares were issued in connection
with purchase accounting acquisitions.

During 2000, approximately 20.3 million shares of outstanding common stock were
repurchased by JPMorgan Chase under a stock repurchase plan which began on
January 19, 2000 and
was formally terminated on October 17, 2000.

JPMorgan Chase shareholders approved a three-for-two stock split at their
annual meeting on May 16, 2000. The record date for the split was May 17, 2000,
and the additional shares of the Firm’s common stock issued as a result of the
split were distributed on June 9, 2000.

As of December 31, 2001, approximately 399 million unissued shares of common
stock were reserved for issuance under various employee incentive, option and
stock purchase plans.

Common shares issued (newly issued or distributed from treasury) by JPMorgan
Chase during 2001, 2000 and 1999 were as follows:

Shares distributed from treasury were 10.0 million in 2001, 150.8 million
in 2000 and 72.4 million in 1999.


JPMorgan Chase 2001 Annual Report


15 Earnings per share

SFAS 128 requires the presentation of basic and diluted earnings per share
(“EPS”) in the income statement. Basic EPS is computed by dividing net income
applicable to common stock by the weighted-average number of common shares
outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS is computed using the same method as
basic EPS, but, in the denominator, common shares outstanding reflect the
potential dilution that could occur if convertible
securities or other contracts to issue common stock were
converted or exercised into common stock. Net income available for common stock
is the same computation for basic EPS and diluted EPS as JPMorgan Chase had no
convertible securities, and, therefore, no adjustments to net income available
for
common stock were necessary.

Basic and diluted earnings per share were as follows for the dates indicated:

16 Comprehensive income

Comprehensive income is composed of net income and other comprehensive income,
which includes the after-tax change in unrealized gains and losses on AFS
securities, cash flow hedging activities and foreign currency translation
adjustments (including the impact of related derivatives).

The following table presents other comprehensive income balances:

The net change amount, in the following table, represents the sum of net
unrealized holding gains (losses) and reclassification adjustments of AFS
securities. Reclassification adjustments are amounts recognized in net income
during the current year that had been part of other comprehensive income in
previous years.

17 Income taxes

JPMorgan Chase and its eligible subsidiaries file a consolidated
U.S. federal income tax return. JPMorgan Chase uses the asset and liability
method required by SFAS 109 to provide income taxes on all transactions
recorded in the consolidated financial statements. This requires that income
taxes reflect the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences
between the carrying amounts of assets or liabilities for book purposes and for
tax purposes. Accordingly, a deferred tax liability or asset for each temporary
difference is determined based on the tax rates that JPMorgan Chase expects to
be in effect when the underlying items of income and expense are to be
realized. JPMorgan Chase’s expense for income taxes includes the current and
deferred
portions of that expense. A valuation allowance is established
to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount JPMorgan Chase expects to be
realized.

Deferred income tax expense (benefit) results from differences between assets
and liabilities measured for financial reporting purposes and for income tax
return purposes. The significant components of deferred tax assets and
liabilities are reflected in the following table:

(a)

Includes $80 million expiring in 2004 and $20 million expiring in 2005.

A valuation allowance has been recorded in accordance with SFAS 109, primarily
relating to tax benefits associated with foreign operations and with state and
local deferred tax assets.
The components of income tax expense included in the Consolidated statement of income were as follows:

The preceding table does not reflect the tax effects of unrealized gains and
losses on AFS securities, SFAS 133 transactions and certain tax benefits
associated with JPMorgan Chase’s employee stock plans. The tax effect of these
items is recorded directly in Stockholders’ equity. Stockholders’ equity
increased by $541
million and $1,860 million in 2001 and 1999, respectively, and decreased by
$281 million in 2000 as a result of these tax effects.

Federal income taxes have not been provided on the undistributed earnings of
certain foreign subsidiaries, to the extent such earnings have been reinvested
abroad for an indefinite period of time. For 2001, such earnings approximated
$263 million on a pre-tax basis. At December 31, 2001, the cumulative amount of
undistributed earnings in these subsidiaries approximated $1,667 million. It is
not practicable at this time to determine the income tax liability that would
result upon repatriation of these earnings.

The tax expense (benefit) applicable to securities gains and
losses for the years 2001, 2000 and 1999 was $286 million,
$78 million and $(84) million, respectively.

A reconciliation of the applicable statutory U.S. income tax rate
to the effective tax rate for the past three years is shown in the
following table:

18 Postretirement employee benefit plans

New domestic postretirement plans were approved in 2001, and the prior plans of
Chase and J.P. Morgan were merged as of December 31, 2001.

Pension plans

JPMorgan Chase has a noncontributory domestic pension plan that provides
defined benefits to substantially all domestic employees. The domestic plan
employs a cash balance defined benefit formula that provides for benefits based
on salary and service. For J.P. Morgan employees who were earning benefits
under a prior plan formula as of December 31, 1998, the plan also provides a
minimum benefit based on eligible compensation and service through December 31,
2003. The following table presents the funded status and actuarial assumptions
for the domestic plan.

Domestic pension plan

(a)

Range of assumptions in 2000 of individual predecessor plans.

The periodic domestic pension plan expense (reported in Compensation expense)
totaled $113 million in 2001, $76 million in 2000 and $75 million in 1999.

JPMorgan Chase also has a number of other defined benefit pension plans (i.e.,
domestic plans not subject to Title IV of the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act) and several foreign pension plans. Compensation expense related
to these plans totaled $50 million in 2001, $45 million in 2000 and $48 million
in 1999. At December 31, 2001 and 2000, JPMorgan Chase’s liability (included in
Accrued expenses) related to plans that JPMorgan Chase elected not to prefund
fully totaled
$249 million and $234 million, respectively. A prepaid asset of $184 million
was included in Other assets at December 31, 2001, as the Firm elected to fund
certain plans during the year.

Compensation expense related to defined contribution plans totaled $208 million
in 2001, $213 million in 2000 and $195 million in 1999.

Postretirement medical and life insurance

JPMorgan Chase provides postretirement medical and life insurance benefits to
qualifying domestic and foreign employees. These benefits vary with length of
service and date of hire and provide for limits on JPMorgan Chase’s share of
covered medical benefits. The medical benefits are contributory, while the life
insurance benefits are noncontributory.

JPMorgan Chase’s postretirement benefit obligations are funded with
corporate-owned life insurance (“COLI”) purchased on the lives of eligible
employees and retirees. Assets of the COLI policies are held in a separate
account with the insurance company.
The insurance company invests the cash value of the policies in equities, bonds
and other debt securities. While JPMorgan Chase owns the COLI policies, COLI
proceeds (death benefits, withdrawals and other distributions) may be used only
to reimburse the Firm for its net postretirement benefit claim payments and
related administrative expenses.

Postretirement medical and life insurance liability

(a)

Net of $13 million and $12 million of retiree contributions in 2001 and
2000, respectively.

Postretirement medical and life insurance expense (reported in Compensation
expense) totaled $27 million in 2001, $32 million in 2000 and $44 million in
1999.

The discount rates and rates of increase for future compensation used to
determine the actuarial values for postretirement medical and life insurance
benefits are generally consistent with those used for the domestic pension
plan. At December 31, 2001, JPMorgan Chase’s assumed weighted-average medical
benefits cost trend rate used to measure the expected cost of benefits covered
was 8.75% for 2001, declining gradually over seven years to a floor of 5.0%.
The effect of a 1% change in the assumed medical cost trend rate would result
in a corresponding change in the December 31, 2001 benefit obligation and 2001
periodic expense by up to 5.2%.

19 Employee stock-based incentives

Key employee stock-based awards

JPMorgan Chase has long-term stock-based incentive plans (the “LTI Plans”) that
provide for grants of common stock-based awards, including stock options,
restricted stock and restricted stock units (“RSU”) to certain key employees.

Under the LTI Plans, stock options are granted with exercise prices equal to
JPMorgan Chase’s common stock price on the grant date. Generally, options
cannot be exercised until at least one year after the grant date and become
exercisable over various periods as determined at the time of the grant.
Options generally expire ten years after the grant date.

In January 2001, JPMorgan Chase granted 82.2 million options under the LTI
Plans pursuant to a growth performance incentive program (“GPIP”). The exercise
price of all GPIP awards is $51.22, the price of JPMorgan Chase’s common stock
on the grant date. One half of the GPIP options are exercisable after two years
if a firm-wide performance target (“corporate performance goal”) is achieved,
with the remaining 50% exercisable after two years if certain business specific
performance targets are achieved. The corporate performance goal will be
achieved if cumulative diluted cash operating earnings per share for 2001 and
2002, excluding JPMorgan Partners, equals or exceeds $8.50. Business specific
performance targets are based primarily on SVA. If the targets
are not achieved, options will be exercisable after six years. As
of December 31, 2001, 4.8 million GPIP options had been
forfeited. All GPIP options expire ten years after the grant date.

The following table presents a summary of JPMorgan Chase’s option activity
under the LTI Plans, excluding GPIP, during the last three years.

(a)

Includes 5,124,000 options at a weighted-average exercise price of $15.61
related to the acquisition of H&Q.

The following table details the distribution of options outstanding under the
LTI Plans, excluding GPIP, at December 31, 2001.

Restricted stock and RSUs are granted by JPMorgan Chase under the LTI Plans at
no cost to the recipient. Restricted stock/units are subject to forfeiture
until certain restrictions have lapsed, including continued employment for a
specified period. The recipient of a share of restricted stock is entitled to
voting rights and dividends on the common stock. An RSU entitles the recipient
to receive a share of common stock after the applicable restrictions lapse; the
recipient is entitled to receive cash payments equivalent to dividends on the
underlying common stock during the period the RSU is outstanding.

During 2001, 25.9 million restricted stock/unit awards (all payable solely in
stock) were granted by JPMorgan Chase. Of the 25.9 million restricted
stock/unit awards granted, vesting of 1.3 million of such awards also is
conditioned upon certain vesting periods being met and JPMorgan Chase’s stock
price reaching and sustaining target prices (the “targets”) during the service
period. The awards are forfeited in their entirety if the targets are not
achieved (“forfeitable awards”). Half of the 2001 forfeitable awards have a
target price of $75, which exceeded the stock price on the grant date by 46%.
The other half have a target price of $85, which exceeded the stock price on
the grant date by 66%.


JPMorgan Chase 2001 Annual Report


Under the LTI Plans, in 2000 and 1999,
36.1 million and 26.2 million awards (all payable solely in stock),
respectively, were granted by JPMorgan Chase. In both years, 1.3 million of the
restricted stock/unit awards that were granted are forfeitable if target prices
are not achieved. None of the 2000 and 1999
forfeitable awards have vested as the target prices have not
been achieved.

A portion of certain employees’ incentive compensation that exceeds specified
levels is awarded in restricted stock or RSUs (the “required deferral plan”)
that are issued under the LTI Plans. These restricted stock/units vest solely
based on continued employment. During 2001, 2000 and 1999, 137,500, 160,000 and
149,000, respectively, of such awards were granted.

Broad-based employee stock options

In January 2001, JPMorgan Chase granted Value Sharing Plan awards, under which
26.0 million options to purchase common stock were granted to all eligible
full-time (375 options each) and part-time (188 options each) employees. This
award is the second of three equal annual grants to eligible active employees.
The exercise price for each annual grant is equal to JPMorgan Chase’s common
stock price on the grant date. The options become exercisable after five years,
or earlier if JPMorgan Chase’s stock price reaches and sustains a target price
for a minimum period. The 2000 and 2001 grants have not achieved their price
targets.

Under the Value Sharing Plan adopted by JPMorgan Chase in December 1996, annual
awards were granted in December of 1996, 1997 and 1998. The 1996, 1997 and 1998
awards became exercisable in 1997, 1998 and 1999, respectively, as a result of
the target prices having been achieved. All outstanding options expire ten
years after their respective grant dates.

The following table presents a summary of JPMorgan Chase’s broad-based employee
stock option plan activity during the past three years:

The following table details the distribution of broad-based employee stock
options outstanding at December 31, 2001.

Comparison of the fair and intrinsic value based measurement methods

JPMorgan Chase accounts for its employee stock-based compensation plans under
the intrinsic value based method in accordance with Accounting Principles Board
Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees.” There is no expense
recognized for stock options, as they have no intrinsic value on the grant
date. Forfeitable restricted stock and RSUs are expensed based upon the target
prices. The expense for restricted stock and RSUs other than forfeitable awards
is measured by the grant-date stock price. Pre-tax stock compensation expense
recognized in reported earnings totaled $0.8 billion in 2001, $1.1 billion in
2000 and $1.0 billion in 1999.

If JPMorgan Chase had adopted the fair value based method pursuant to SFAS 123,
options would be valued using a Black-Scholes model. The following table
presents net income and basic and diluted earnings per share as reported and
after the impact of applying SFAS 123. The higher impact from applying SFAS 123
in 2001 reflects the lower level of net income and increased options granted
during 2001.

The following table presents JPMorgan Chase’s weighted-average grant-date fair
value and assumptions used to value the options using a Black-Scholes model for
equity awards granted:

(a)

The expected dividend yield is based primarily on historical data at the
grant dates.

20 Restrictions on cash and intercompany funds transfers

The Federal Reserve Board requires depository institutions to maintain cash
reserves with a Federal Reserve Bank. The average amount of reserve balances
deposited by JPMorgan Chase’s bank subsidiaries with various Federal Reserve
Banks was approximately $1.1 billion in 2001 and $0.6 billion in 2000.

Restrictions imposed by federal law prohibit JPMorgan Chase and certain other
affiliates from borrowing from banking subsidiaries unless the loans are
secured in specified amounts. Such secured loans to JPMorgan Chase or to other
affiliates generally are limited to 10% of the banking subsidiary’s total
capital, as determined by the risk-based capital guidelines; the aggregate
amount of all such loans is limited to 20% of the banking subsidiary’s total
capital. JPMorgan Chase and its affiliates were well within these limits
throughout the year.

The principal sources of JPMorgan Chase’s income (on a parent
company-only basis) are dividends and interest from JPMorgan Chase Bank
and the other banking and nonbanking subsidiaries of JPMorgan Chase. In
addition to dividend restrictions set forth in statutes and regulations,
the Federal Reserve Board, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency
(“OCC”) and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) have
authority under the Financial Institutions Supervisory Act to prohibit or
to limit the payment of dividends by the banking organizations they
supervise, including JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries that are banks or
bank holding companies, if, in the banking regulator’s opinion, payment of
a dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice in light of the
financial condition of the banking organization.

At December 31, 2001 and 2000, JPMorgan Chase’s bank subsidiaries could pay, in
the aggregate, $2.2 billion and $2.1 billion, respectively, in dividends to
their respective bank holding companies without prior approval of their
relevant banking regulators.

In compliance with rules and regulations established by domestic and foreign
regulators, cash of $2.0 billion and $1.6 billion and securities with a market
value of $4.4 billion and $6.2 billion were segregated in special bank accounts
for the benefit of securities and futures brokerage customers as of December
31, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

21 Capital

There are two categories of risk-based capital: core capital (referred to as
Tier 1 capital) and supplementary capital (referred to as Tier 2 capital). Tier
1 capital includes common stockholders’ equity, qualifying preferred stock and
minority interest less goodwill and other adjustments. Tier 2 capital consists
of preferred stock not qualifying as Tier 1, long-term debt and other
instruments qualifying as Tier 2, the aggregate allowance for credit losses up
to a certain percentage of risk-weighted assets, less investments in certain
subsidiaries. Under the risk-based capital guidelines of the Federal Reserve
Board, JPMorgan Chase is required to maintain minimum ratios of Tier 1 and
total (Tier 1 plus Tier 2) capital to risk-weighted assets. Failure to meet
these minimum requirements could result in actions taken by the Federal Reserve
Board. Bank subsidiaries also are subject to these capital requirements by
their respective primary regulators. Management believes that as of December
31, 2001, JPMorgan Chase met all capital requirements to which it was subject
and is not aware of any subsequent events that would alter this classification.


JPMorgan Chase 2001 Annual Report


The following table presents the risk-based capital ratios for JPMorgan Chase and its significant banking
subsidiaries:

The following table shows the components of the Firm’s Tier 1 and total capital.

(a)

Minority interest includes trust preferred stocks of certain business trust subsidiaries and the preferred stock of a Real Estate Investment Trust
subsidiary of JPMorgan Chase. For a further discussion, see Notes 11 and 12.

22 Premises and equipment, goodwill and other intangibles

Premises and equipment, including leasehold improvements, are carried at cost
less accumulated depreciation and amortization. JPMorgan Chase generally
computes depreciation using the straight-line method over the estimated useful
life of an asset. For leasehold improvements, the Firm uses the straight-line
method over the lesser of the remaining term of the leased facility or the
estimated economic life of the improvement. JPMorgan Chase capitalizes certain
costs associated with the acquisition or development of internal-use software.
Once the software is ready for its intended use, these costs are amortized on a
straight-line basis over the software’s expected useful life.

Goodwill and other acquired intangibles, such as core deposits and credit card
relationships, are amortized over the estimated periods to be benefited,
generally ranging from 7 to 25 years. An impairment review is performed
periodically on these assets.

Capitalized mortgage servicing assets consist of purchased and originated
servicing rights. These rights are amortized in proportion to, and over the
period of, the estimated future net servicing income stream of the underlying
mortgage loans. Mortgage servicing rights are periodically evaluated for
impairment based on their current fair values. For purposes of evaluating and
measuring impairment of MSRs, the Firm stratifies its portfolio on the basis of
the predominant risk characteristics: loan type and interest rate.

23 Commitments and contingencies

At December 31, 2001, JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries were obligated under
a number of noncancelable operating leases for premises and equipment used
primarily for banking purposes. Certain leases contain rent escalation clauses
for real estate taxes and other operating expenses and renewal option clauses
calling for increased rents. No lease agreement imposes any restrictions on
JPMorgan Chase’s ability to pay dividends, engage in debt or equity financing
transactions, or enter into
further lease agreements. Future minimum rental payments required under
operating leases with noncancelable lease terms that expire after December 31,
2001 were as follows:

JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries are defendants in a number of legal
proceedings. After reviewing with counsel all such actions and proceedings
pending against or involving JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries, management
does not expect the aggregate liability or loss, if any, resulting from such
proceedings to have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial
condition of JPMorgan Chase although the outcome of a particular proceeding may
be material to JPMorgan Chase’s results of operations for any particular period
depending on the size of the loss or liability relative to JPMorgan Chase’s
income for that period.

The Firm has $1,130 million of nonperforming Enron-related other receivables,
which represent surety receivables and a letter of credit that are the subject
of litigation with insurance companies and a foreign bank.

JPMorgan Chase may guarantee the obligations of its subsidiaries. These
guarantees rank on a parity with all other unsecured and unsubordinated
indebtedness of JPMorgan Chase. See Note 11 for a discussion of JPMorgan
Chase’s guarantees of long-term debt-related instruments of its subsidiaries.

24 Accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities

On January 1, 2001, JPMorgan Chase adopted SFAS 133, which establishes
accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including
derivative instruments embedded in other contracts used for trading and hedging
activities. All derivatives, whether designated for hedging relationships or
not, are required to be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. If the
derivative is designated as a fair value hedge, all changes in the fair value
of the derivative and changes in the fair value of the hedged item attributable
to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings.
If the derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of
the change in the fair value of the derivative is recorded in other
comprehensive income (“OCI”) and recognized in the income statement when the
hedged item affects earnings. The ineffective portions of cash flow hedges are
immediately recognized in earnings.

The majority of JPMorgan Chase’s derivatives are entered into for trading
purposes and were not affected by the adoption
of SFAS 133. The Firm also uses derivatives as an end user to hedge market
exposures, modify the interest rate characteristics of related balance sheet
instruments or meet longer-term
investment objectives. Both trading and end-user derivatives
are recorded at fair value in Trading assets and Trading liabilities.

The adoption of SFAS 133 resulted in an after-tax reduction to net income of
$25 million and an after-tax reduction to OCI of $36 million. The impact of
reclassifying certain SFAS 115 securities from AFS to trading was not material
at the adoption date.


JPMorgan Chase 2001 Annual Report


Due to SFAS 133, JPMorgan Chase
changed certain hedging strategies and elected not to designate some
derivatives utilized to manage economic exposure as accounting hedges. For
example, to moderate its use of derivatives, the mortgage business began using
AFS securities as economic hedges of mortgage servicing rights.

Certain interest rate derivatives are recorded in Trading revenue due to
operational and cost constraints of applying hedge accounting. Changes in the
fair value of credit derivatives used to manage the Firm’s credit risk are
recorded in Trading revenue because of the difficulties in qualifying such
contracts as hedges of loans and commitments. Because of hedge ineffectiveness
and management’s decision to no longer apply hedge accounting but to continue
to enter into economic hedges to support certain business strategies, the
application of SFAS 133 may cause volatility in quarterly earnings and equity.

Prior to the adoption of SFAS133, derivatives used for hedging purposes
generally were not recorded on the Consolidated
balance sheet and the unrealized gains and losses were deferred on those
contracts.

Derivatives used as hedges must be considered to be highly effective at
reducing the risk associated with the exposure being hedged. Each derivative
must be designated as a hedge, with documentation of the risk management
objective and strategy for the hedge, including identification of the hedging
instrument, the hedged item and the risk exposure, and how effectiveness
is assessed prospectively and retrospectively.

JPMorgan Chase’s fair value hedges primarily include hedges of fixed rate
long-term debt, loans, AFS securities and mortgage servicing rights. Interest
rate swaps are the most common type
of derivative contract used to modify exposure to interest rate risk by
converting fixed rate assets and liabilities to a floating rate. All amounts
have been included in earnings consistent with the hedged transaction,
primarily net interest income, Fees and commissions and Other revenue. JPMorgan
Chase did not recognize any gains or losses during 2001 on firm commitments
that no longer qualify as fair value hedges.

JPMorgan Chase enters into derivative contracts to hedge exposure to
variability in cash flows for floating rate financial instruments and
forecasted transactions, that primarily include the rollover of short-term
assets and liabilities, loan sales and anticipated securities transactions.
Interest rate swaps, futures and options are the most common instruments used
to reduce the impact of interest rate changes on future earnings. All amounts
have been included in earnings consistent with the hedged transaction,
primarily net interest income.

JPMorgan Chase primarily uses forward foreign exchange contracts and foreign
currency denominated debt instruments to protect the value of its net
investments in its foreign subsidiaries in foreign currencies. The portion of
the hedging instruments excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness
(forward points) is recorded in Net interest income.

The following table presents derivative instrument and hedging related activities for the period indicated.

(a)

Includes ineffectiveness and the components of hedging instruments that
have been excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness.

(b)

Represents recognized gains in net interest income for cash flow hedges
of AFS security purchases that were discontinued because the forecasted
transaction failed to occur.

(c)

Represents the
reclassification of
net losses on
derivative
instruments from OCI
to earnings that are
expected to occur
over the next 12
months. The maximum
length of time over
which forecasted
transactions are
hedged is ten years,
related to core
lending
activities.

25 Off-balance sheet lending-related financial instruments

JPMorgan Chase utilizes lending-related financial instruments
as one method by which to meet the financing needs of its
customers. JPMorgan Chase issues commitments to extend
credit, standby letters of credit and guarantees and also provides
securities-lending services. For lending-related financial instruments, the
contractual amount of the financial instrument represents the maximum potential
credit risk if the counterparty does not perform according to the terms of the
contract. A large majority of these commitments expire without being drawn
upon. As a result, total contractual amounts are not representative of the
Firm’s actual future credit exposure or liquidity requirements for these
commitments.

Additionally, to provide for risk of losses inherent in the credit extension
process, management computes specific and expected loss components as well as a
residual component for lending-related commitments. At December 31, 2001 and 2000, the Allowance for credit
losses on lending-related commitments, which is reported in Other liabilities,
was $282 million and $283 million, respectively.

The following table summarizes the contract amounts relating to JPMorgan
Chase’s lending-related financial instruments at December 31, 2001 and 2000:

JPMorgan Chase 2001 Annual Report



notes to consolidated financial statements

J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.

Unfunded commitments to extend credit

are agreements
to lend to a customer who has complied with predetermined contractual
conditions. Commitments generally have fixed
expiration dates. Unfunded commitments to extend credit include $41.9 billion
of commitments to SPEs.

Standby letters of credit and guarantees

are conditional commitments issued by
JPMorgan Chase generally to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third
party in borrowing arrangements, such as commercial paper issuances, bond
financing, construction and similar transactions. The credit risk involved in
issuing standby letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in
extending loan facilities to customers and may be reduced by participations to
third parties. JPMorgan Chase holds collateral to support those standby letters
of credit and guarantees when deemed necessary.

Customers’ securities lent

are customers’ securities held by JPMorgan Chase, as
custodian, which are lent to third parties. JPMorgan Chase obtains collateral,
with a market value exceeding 100% of the contract amount, for customers’
securities lent, which is used to indemnify customers against possible losses
resulting from third-party defaults.

26 Credit risk concentrations

Concentrations of credit risk arise when a number of customers are engaged in
similar business activities, or activities in the same geographic region, or
have similar economic features that would cause their ability to meet
contractual obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic
conditions.

JPMorgan Chase regularly monitors various segments of its credit risk portfolio
to assess potential concentration risks and to obtain collateral when deemed
necessary.

JPMorgan Chase’s exposures within these major segments are diversified, and
these diversification factors reduce concentration risk. More information about
geographic and other concentrations can be found at the following tables in the
MD&A:

The table below indicates major product and industry segments, including both
on-balance sheet (principally loans) and off-balance sheet (principally
unfunded commitments to extend credit) exposures:

27 Fair value of financial instruments

Fair value is defined as the value at which positions
could be closed out or sold in a transaction with a willing and knowledgeable
counterparty over a period of time consistent with JPMorgan Chase’s trading or
investment strategy.

The accounting for an asset or liability may differ based on the type of
instrument and/or its use in a trading or investing strategy. Generally, the
measurement framework recorded in financial statements is one of the following:

•

Recorded at fair value on the balance sheet with changes in fair value
recorded each period in the Consolidated statement of income;

•

Recorded at fair value on the balance sheet with changes in fair value
recorded each period in a separate component of Stockholders’ equity
and as part of other comprehensive income;

•

Recorded at cost (less other-than-temporary impairments) with changes
in fair value not recorded in the financial statements but disclosed
in the notes thereto; or

•

Recorded at the lower-of-cost or market.


JPMorgan Chase 2001 Annual Report


Fair value is based on quoted market
prices, where available.
If listed prices or quotes are not available, fair value is based on internally
developed models that primarily use market-based or independent information as
inputs. These methods may produce a fair value calculation that may not be
indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values.
Valuation adjustments are made, at times, based on defined methodologies that
are applied consistently over time and that are intended to ensure that
positions are carried at the best estimate of fair value. Valuation adjustments
include amounts to reflect counterparty credit quality, liquidity and
concentration concerns, and ongoing servicing costs. JPMorgan Chase’s valuation
process is continually subject to a rigorous review, which includes valuation
model and methodology reviews and price testing with independent sources where
appropriate.

Certain financial instruments and all nonfinancial instruments are excluded
from the scope of SFAS 107. Accordingly, the fair value disclosures required by
SFAS 107 provide only a partial estimate of the fair value of JPMorgan Chase. For example, JPMorgan Chase has
developed long-term relationships with its customers through its deposit base
and its credit card accounts, commonly referred to as core deposit intangibles
and credit card relationships. In the opinion of management, these items in the
aggregate add significant value to JPMorgan Chase, but their fair value is not
disclosed in this Note.

The following captions describe the methodologies and assumptions used, by
financial instrument, to determine fair value.

Financial assets

Assets for which fair value approximates carrying value

Fair values of certain financial assets carried at cost, including cash and due
from banks, deposits with banks, Federal funds sold and securities purchased
under resale agreements, securities borrowed, short-term receivables and
accrued interest receivable are considered to approximate their respective
carrying values due to their short-term nature and generally negligible credit
losses.

Assets where fair value differs from cost

JPMorgan Chase’s debt, equity and derivative instruments are carried at their
estimated fair value. Quoted market prices, when available, are used to
determine the fair value of trading instruments. If quoted market prices are
not available, then fair values are estimated by using pricing models, quoted
prices of instruments with similar characteristics or discounted cash flows.

Securities

Fair values of actively-traded securities are determined by the secondary
market, while the fair values for nonactively traded securities are based on
independent broker quotations.

Derivatives

Fair value for derivatives is determined based on the following:

•

Position valuation principally based on liquid market pricing as evidenced by
exchange traded prices, broker-dealer quotations or related input factors which
assume all counterparties have the same credit rating;

•

Adjustments to the resulting portfolio valuation to reflect the credit quality of
individual counterparties that are principally based on market prices for credit
risk; and

•

Other pricing adjustments to take into consideration are liquidity, ongoing
servicing costs, transaction hedging costs and other factors.

Loans

Fair value for loans is determined using methodologies suitable for each type of loan:

•

Fair value for the commercial loan portfolio is based on the assessment of the two
main risk components of the portfolio: credit and interest. The estimated cash
flows are adjusted to reflect the inherent credit risk and then are discounted
using a rate appropriate for each maturity that incorporates the effects of
interest rate changes.

•

Fair values for consumer installment loans (including auto financings) and
residential mortgages for which market rates for comparable loans are readily
available are based on discounted cash flows, adjusted for prepayments. The
discount rates used for consumer installment loans are current rates offered by
commercial banks. For residential mortgages, secondary market yields for comparable
mortgage-backed securities, adjusted for risk, are used.

•

Fair value for credit card receivables is based on discounted expected cash flows.
The discount rates used for credit card receivables incorporate the effects of
interest rate changes only since the estimated cash flows are adjusted for credit
risk.

•

The fair value of loans, in the held-for-sale and trading portfolios, is generally
based on observable market prices and prices of similar instruments, including
bonds and credit derivatives. Otherwise, if market prices are not available, the
fair value is based on the estimated cash flows adjusted for credit risk that is
discounted using a rate appropriate for each maturity that incorporates the effects
of interest rate changes.

JPMorgan Chase 2001 Annual Report



notes to consolidated financial statements

J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.

Other assets

This caption includes private equity investments and mortgage servicing rights.

The fair value of public securities held by JPMP are marked-to-market at the
quoted public value. To determine the carrying value, JPMP’s valuation policy
for public securities incorporates the use of liquidity discounts and price
averaging methodologies in certain circumstances to take into account the fact
that JPMP cannot immediately realize the quoted public values as a result of
the regulatory, corporate, or other contractual sales restrictions generally
imposed on these holdings. Private investments are initially carried at cost,
which is viewed as an approximation of fair value. The carrying value of
private investments is adjusted to reflect valuation changes resulting from
unaffiliated party transactions and for evidence of a decline in value.

Fair value for mortgage servicing rights is estimated using a
discounted future cash flow model that considers portfolio
characteristics and assumptions regarding prepayment speeds, delinquency rates,
ancillary revenues and other economic factors. The Firm reviews such
assumptions against market comparables, if available.

Financial liabilities

Liabilities for which fair value approximates carrying value

SFAS 107 requires that the fair value disclosed for deposit liabilities with no
stated maturity (i.e., demand, savings and certain money market deposits) be
equal to the carrying value. SFAS 107 does not allow for the recognition of the
inherent funding value of these instruments.

Fair value of federal funds purchased and securities sold under repurchase
agreements, commercial paper, other borrowed funds, accounts payable and
accrued liabilities is considered to approximate their respective carrying
values due to their short-term nature.

Interest-bearing deposits

Fair value of interest-bearing deposits is estimated by discounting cash flows
based on contractual maturities of funds having similar interest rates and
similar maturities.

Long-term debt-related instruments

Fair value for long-term debt, including the guaranteed preferred beneficial
interests in the Firm’s junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures, is
based on current market rates and is adjusted for JPMorgan Chase’s credit
quality.

Commitments to extend credit

JPMorgan Chase has reviewed the unfunded portion of its
commitments to extend credit as well as its standby and other letters of credit
and, based on market prices observed at the point of origination to extend
undrawn credit, has determined that the fair value of such financial
instruments is not material.

The following table presents the carrying value and estimated fair value of
financial assets and liabilities valued under SFAS 107. Accordingly, certain
amounts which are not considered financial instruments are excluded from the
table.

28 International operations

The following table presents income statement information of
JPMorgan Chase by major geographic areas. JPMorgan Chase defines
international activities as business transactions that involve customers
residing outside the U.S., and the information presented below is
based primarily on the domicile of the customer. However, many of the Firm’s
domestic operations service international businesses.

As these operations are highly integrated, estimates and subjective assumptions
have been made to apportion revenue and expense between domestic and
international operations. The estimates and assumptions used to apportion
revenue and expense are consistent with the allocations used for JPMorgan
Chase’s
segment reporting as set forth in Note 29.

JPMorgan Chase’s long-lived assets for the periods presented are not considered
by management to be significant in relation to total assets. The majority of
its long-lived assets are located domestically.

(a)

Revenue is composed of net interest income and noninterest revenue.

(b)

Expense is composed of noninterest expense and provision for loan
losses.

29 Segment information

JPMorgan Chase is organized into five major businesses. These businesses are
segmented based on the products and services provided, or the type of customer
serviced, and reflect the manner in which financial information is evaluated by
management.

JPMorgan Chase uses SVA, operating earnings and cash operating earnings as its
principal measures of segment profitability. For a definition of these
measurements, see the Glossary of terms on pages 100 and 101.

Operating revenues and expenses directly associated with each segment are
included in determining the segment’s operating earnings. Guidelines exist for
assigning those remaining expenses that are not directly incurred by the
segments, such as overhead and taxes. In addition, management has developed a
risk-adjusted

Segment results and reconciliation

(table continued on next page)


JPMorgan Chase 2001 Annual Report


capital methodology that quantifies different types of risk – credit, market,
operational and private equity – within the various businesses and assigns
capital accordingly. The provision for loan losses is allocated to the segments
utilizing a credit risk methodology and a risk grading system appropriate for
each segment’s portfolio.

A summary of the business segment results is shown in the following table. The
Corporate/reconciling items column reflects revenues and expenses excluded from
the determination of the segment’s operating earnings. This column includes the
effects remaining at the corporate level after the application of management
accounting policies, including income tax expenses (the difference between the
amounts allocated to business units and JPMorgan Chase’s consolidated income
tax expense).

For a further discussion concerning JPMorgan Chase’s business segments, see
Segment results in the MD&A on pages 28 and 29. Additionally, financial
information relating to JPMorgan Chase’s operations by geographic area is
provided in Note 28.

Glossary of terms

Asset capital tax:

The tax which is included in each of the business unit’s
capital charge, recognizing the need for the Firm to maintain certain capital
ratios to meet bank regulatory definitions of “well capitalized.”

Basis point value (“BPV”):

This measurement quantifies the change in the market
value of JPMorgan Chase’s assets and liabilities (that are not part of its
trading activities) that would result from a one basis point change in interest
rates or one basis point widening of interest rate spreads. BPV shows whether
an increase of 1/100 of 1% (or one basis point) in a market rate will yield a
profit or loss, and of what magnitude.

CAGR:

“Compound annual growth rate.”

Cash operating earnings:

Operating earnings excluding the impact of the
amortization of intangibles.

Cash overhead ratio:

Noninterest expense, excluding amortization of
intangibles, as a percentage of the total of net interest income and
noninterest revenue (excluding merger and restructuring costs and special
items).

Credit derivatives

are contractual agreements that provide insurance against a
credit event of one or more referenced credits. The nature of the credit event
is established by the buyer and seller at the inception of the transaction, and
such events include bankruptcy, insolvency and failure to meet payment
obligations when due. The buyer of the credit derivative pays a periodic fee in
return for a contingent payment by the seller (insurer) following a credit
event.

Credit risk:

The risk of loss due to borrower or counterparty default.

Cross-currency interest rate swaps

are contracts that generally involve the
exchange of both interest and principal amounts in two different currencies.
Also see interest rate swaps in this glossary.

Debt, equity, commodity and other contracts

include swaps and options and are
similar to interest rate contracts except the underlying instrument is debt-,
equity- or commodity-related.

FASB:

Financial Accounting Standards Board.

Foreign currency options

are similar to interest rate options except they are
based on foreign exchange rates. Also see interest rate options in this
glossary.

Foreign exchange contracts

are contracts that provide for the future receipt or
delivery of foreign currency at previously agreed-upon terms.

Forward rate agreements

are contracts to exchange payments on a specified
future date, based on a market change in interest rates from trade date to
contract settlement date.

Interest rate futures and forwards

are contracts for the delayed delivery of
securities or money market instruments. The selling party agrees to deliver, on
a specified future date, a specified instrument at a specified price or yield.

Interest rate options

, including caps and floors, are contracts to modify
interest rate risk in exchange for the payment of a premium when the contract
is initiated. As a writer of interest rate options, JPMorgan Chase receives a
premium in exchange for bearing the risk of unfavorable changes in interest
rates. Conversely, as a purchaser of an option, JPMorgan Chase pays a premium
for the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell a financial instrument or
currency at predetermined terms in the future.

Interest rate swaps

are contracts in which a series of interest rate flows in a
single currency is exchanged over a prescribed period. Interest rate swaps are
the most common type of derivative contract that JPMorgan Chase uses in its A/L
activities. An example of a situation in which JPMorgan Chase would utilize an
interest rate swap would be to convert its fixed-rate debt to a variable rate.
By entering into the swap, the principal amount of the debt would remain
unchanged, but the interest streams would change.

Investment grade equivalent:

JPMorgan Chase’s internal risk assessment which
generally represents a risk profile similar to that of a BBB-/Baa3 or better
rating as defined by independent rating agencies, such as Standard & Poor’s or
Moody’s.

Liquidity risk:

The risk of being unable to fund JPMorgan Chase’s portfolio of
assets at appropriate maturities and rates, and the risk of being unable to
liquidate a position in a timely manner at a reasonable price.

Managed credit card receivables or managed basis:

JPMorgan Chase uses this
terminology to refer to its credit card receivables on the balance sheet plus
securitized credit card receivables.

Mark-to-market exposure:

Mark-to-market exposure is a measure, at a point in
time, of the value of a derivative or foreign exchange contract in the open
market. When the mark-to-market is positive, it indicates the counterparty owes
JPMorgan Chase and, therefore, creates a repayment risk for JPMorgan Chase.
When the mark-to-market is negative, JPMorgan Chase owes the counterparty. In
this situation, JPMorgan Chase does not have repayment risk.

Market risk:

The potential loss in value of portfolios and financial
instruments caused by movements in market variables, such as interest and
foreign-exchange rates, credit spreads, and equity and commodity prices.

Merger:

The term refers to the December 31, 2000 merger of The Chase Manhattan
Corporation and J.P. Morgan & Co. Incorporated.

Net yield on interest-earning assets:

The average rate for interest-earning
assets less the average rate paid for all sources of funds.


JPMorgan Chase 2001 Annual Report


Operating basis or operating earnings:

Reported results excluding the impact of
merger and restructuring costs, special items and credit card securitizations.

Operational risk:

The risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed
processes or systems, human factor, or external events.

All amounts are on a pre-tax basis. There were no special items
in 2001. Special items in 2000 include a gain on the sale of the Hong Kong
retail banking business ($827 million), a gain from the transfer of
Euroclear-related business ($399 million), gain from the sale of the Panama

interest rates and interest differentials

Consolidated average balance sheet, interest and rates

A summary of JPMorgan Chase’s consolidated average balances,
interest rates and interest differentials on a taxable-equivalent
basis for the years 1999 through 2001 is provided below. Income
computed on a taxable-equivalent basis is the income reported in
the Consolidated statement of income adjusted to make income
and interest-earning yields on assets exempt from income taxes
(primarily federal taxes) comparable with other taxable income.
The incremental tax rate used for calculating the taxable-equivalent
adjustment was approximately 41% in the year 2001 and

(Table continued on next page)



approximately 42% in each of the years 1999 and 2000. A substantial portion of JPMorgan Chase’s securities is taxable.

Within the Consolidated average balance sheet, interest and
rates summary, the amounts of nonaccrual and renegotiated loans have been included in the average loan balances
used to determine the average interest rate earned on loans. For
additional information on nonaccrual loans, including interest
accrued, see Note 8 on pages 75 and 76.

Interest rates and interest differential analysis of net interest income –

domestic and foreign

A summary of interest rates and interest differentials segregated
between domestic and foreign operations for the years 1999
through 2001 is presented below. The segregation between the
domestic and foreign components is based on the location of
the office recording the transaction. Intra-company funding
transactions are generally dollar-denominated deposits originated in various
foreign and domestic locations that are centrally managed by
JPMorgan Chase’s treasury units. Domestic net interest income

(Table continued on next page)

(a)

See note (c) on page 102. Excluding the tax refunds, the domestic net yield on
interest-earning assets would be 2.10% in 2001 and 2.26% in 1999.

(b)

Represents the amount of noninterest-bearing
liabilities funding interest-earning assets.



was $8,432 million in 2001, an increase of $1,437 million from
the prior year. The increase in 2001 primarily was attributable
to improved spreads. Net interest income from foreign operations
was $2,454 million for 2001, compared with $2,601 million
in 2000. The decrease reflected a shift from higher-yielding
interest-earning assets (primarily loans) to lower-yielding assets
(primarily trading assets and securities) and
lower net yields.

For further discussion, see the section entitled “Net interest
income” in the MD&A on page 43.

(Continuation of table)



Changes in net interest income, volume and rate analysis

The table below presents an analysis of the effect on net interest income of volume and rate changes for the periods 2001 versus
and 2000 versus 1999. In this analysis, the change due to the volume/rate variance has been
allocated to volume.



Securities portfolio

The amortized cost, estimated fair value and average yield (including the
impact of related derivatives) of JPMorgan Chase’s securities by
contractual maturity range and type of security are presented in the table that
follows:

(a)

Securities with no stated maturity are included with securities with a
contractual maturity of 10 years or more. Substantially all of JPMorgan Chase’s
mortgaged-backed securities (“MBSs”)
and collateralized mortgage obligations (“CMOs”) are due in 10 years or
more based on contractual maturity. The estimated duration, which reflects
anticipated future prepayments based on
a consensus of dealers in the market, is approximately three years for
MBSs and less than one year for CMOs.

(b)

The average yield is based on amortized cost balances at the end of the
year. Yields are derived by dividing interest income (including the effect of
related derivatives on available-for-sale
securities and the amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts) by
total amortized cost. Taxable-equivalent adjustments are used where applicable.

(c)

Includes obligations of state and political subdivisions, debt
securities issued by foreign governments, corporate debt securities, CMOs of
private issuers, and other debt and equity securities.

(d)

For the amortized cost of the above categories of securities at December
31, 2000, see Note 7 on page 74. At December 31, 1999, the amortized cost of
U.S. government and federal agencies
and other available-for-sale securities was $62,983 million and $14,552
million, respectively. At December 31, 1999, the amortized cost of U.S.
government and federal agencies and other
held-to-maturity securities was $886 million and $2 million, respectively.

The U.S. government and certain of its agencies were the only
issuers whose securities exceeded 10% of JPMorgan Chase’s total
stockholders’ equity at December 31, 2001.

For a further discussion of JPMorgan Chase’s securities portfolios,
see Note 7 on page 74.



Loan portfolio

The table below sets forth the amounts of loans outstanding by type:

(a)

Loans are presented net of unearned income of $1,825 million, $1,571 million, $1,530 million, $1,691 million, and
$1,644 million at December 31, 2001, 2000, 1999, 1998 and 1997,
respectively. For a discussion of JPMorgan Chase’s loan outstandings, see
“Credit-related portfolio” on pages 48 through 53.

Maturities and sensitivity to changes in interest rates

The following table shows, at December 31, 2001, commercial loan maturity and
distribution between fixed and floating interest rates
based upon the stated terms of the commercial loan agreements. The table below
does not include the impact of derivative instruments.

(a)

Includes demand loans, overdrafts and loans
having no stated schedule of repayments and no
stated maturity.



Cross-border outstandings

Cross-border disclosure is based upon the Federal Financial
Institutions Examination Council’s (“FFIEC”) guidelines governing
the determination of cross-border risk. In accordance with FFIEC
revised guidelines, credit derivatives were included in the determination of cross-border exposure beginning in 2000. Prior-year
amounts do not include these instruments.

The following table lists all countries in which JPMorgan Chase’s
cross-border outstandings exceed 0.75% of consolidated assets
as of any of the dates specified. The disclosure includes certain
exposures that are not required under the disclosure requirements
of the SEC. The most significant differences between the FFIEC
and SEC methodologies relate to the treatments of local country
exposure and to foreign exchange and derivatives.

For a further discussion of JPMorgan Chase’s cross-border exposure based on management’s view of this exposure, see page 52.

Cross-border outstandings exceeding 0.75% of total assets

(a)

Outstandings include loans and accrued interest receivable, interest-bearing deposits with banks, acceptances, resale
agreements, other monetary assets, cross-border trading debt and equity
instruments, mark-to-market exposure of foreign exchange and derivative contracts, and local country assets, net of local
country liabilities. The amounts associated with foreign exchange and
derivative contracts are presented after taking into account the
impact of legally enforceable master netting agreements.

(b)

Commitments include outstanding letters of credit and undrawn commitments to extend
credit and for 2001 and 2000 include credit derivatives.

JPMorgan Chase’s cross-border outstandings tend to fluctuate greatly, and the
amount of outstandings at year-end tends to be a function of
timing rather than representing a consistent trend.



Risk elements

The following table sets forth nonperforming assets and contractually past-due
assets at the dates indicated:

(a)

This amount relates to the Enron-related surety receivables and letter of
credit, which are the subject of litigation with credit-worthy entities.

(b)

Accruing loans past-due 90 days or more as to principal and
interest, which are not characterized as nonperforming loans.

For a discussion of nonperforming loan and past-due loan policies,
see Note 8 on page 75. Renegotiated loans are those for which
concessions, such as the reduction of interest rates or the deferral
of interest or principal payments, have been granted as a result
of a deterioration in the borrowers’ financial condition.

Impact of nonperforming loans on interest income

The negative impact on interest income from nonperforming
loans represents the difference between the amount of interest
income that would have been recorded on nonperforming loans
according to their contractual terms and the amount of interest that
actually was recognized on a cash basis. The following table sets
forth this data for the years specified. The increases in both 2001
and 2000 in total negative impact on interest income reflect a
higher level of interest that was not recognized in income due to
the increased levels of nonperforming loans.



Summary of loan loss experience

For a further discussion, see Note 8 on pages 75 through 77.

Allowance for loan losses

The table below summarizes the changes in the allowance for loan losses
during the periods indicated.

(a)

Includes $160 million in 1997 related to the purchase of a credit card portfolio.

Loan loss analysis

(a)

Includes a charge of $80 million to conform to FFIEC revised policy.



Derivative and FX contracts

The following table summarizes the risk profile, as of December 31, 2001, of the
Firm’s derivative and foreign exchange contract balance sheet
exposure, both before and after
taking into account cash and other highly liquid collateral held by
the Firm. The Firm's internal risk ratings generally
represent a risk profile similar to that of the independent rating
