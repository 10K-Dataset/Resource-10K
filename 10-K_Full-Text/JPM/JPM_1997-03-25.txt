   Item 1: Business
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

On March 31, 1996, The Chase Manhattan Corporation ("Chase") merged with and
into Chemical Banking Corporation ("Chemical"). Upon consummation of the merger,
Chemical Banking Corporation changed its name to "The Chase Manhattan
Corporation". (See Note One of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements on
page 67 for a more complete description of the merger).

   The merger was accounted for as a pooling of interests and, accordingly, the
information presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K presents the combined
results of Chase and Chemical as if the merger had been in effect for all
periods presented.

================================================================================
Overview

The Chase Manhattan Corporation (the "Corporation") is a bank holding company
organized under the laws of the State of Delaware in 1968 and registered under
the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the "BHCA").

   The Corporation conducts domestic and international financial services
businesses through various bank and non-bank subsidiaries. At December 31, 1996,
the principal bank subsidiaries of the Corporation were: The Chase Manhattan
Bank ("Chase Bank"), a New York banking corporation headquartered in New York
City, Texas Commerce Bank National Association ("Texas Commerce"), a national
bank headquartered in Texas, and Chase Manhattan Bank USA, National Association
("Chase USA"), a national bank headquartered in Delaware. The principal non-bank
subsidiary of the Corporation is Chase Securities Inc. ("CSI"), the
Corporation's "Section 20" subsidiary, which is engaged in securities
underwriting and dealing activities. At December 31, 1996, the Corporation was
the largest bank holding company in the United States in terms of total assets
and Chase Bank was the largest bank in the United States in terms of total
assets.

   The bank and non-bank subsidiaries of the Corporation operate nationally as
well as through overseas branches and an international network of representative
offices, subsidiaries and affiliated banks.

   The financial services provided by the Corporation's domestic subsidiaries
include personal and commercial checking accounts, savings and time deposit
accounts, personal and business loans, consumer financing, leasing, real estate
financing, investment banking, mortgage banking, money transfer, cash
management, safe deposit facilities, personal trust and estate administration,
corporate and institutional trust and securities processing services, full
investment services, discount brokerage, insurance, United States Government 
and Federal agency securities dealership, corporate debt and equity securities 
dealership and underwriting, and United States corporate tax depository 
facilities.

   Internationally, services also include correspondent banking arrangements,
merchant banking, and underwriting and trading of Eurosecurities.

   The Corporation also provides products to ensure that a customer will have a
specific currency-exchange or interest rate at some future date. These products
include interest rate and currency swaps, interest rate options, forward rate
agreements, forward interest rate contracts, foreign exchange contracts and
financial futures.

   The Corporation retains a 20% interest in The CIT Group Holdings, Inc.
("CIT"). CIT, directly or through its subsidiaries, engages in diversified
financial services activities, primarily in the United States.

   Certain amounts in prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the
current presentation.

================================================================================
Lines-of-Business

The Corporation's activities are internally organized, for management reporting
purposes, into two major business franchises (Global Wholesale Banking and
Regional and Nationwide Consumer Banking). A description of the Corporation's
business franchises are discussed in the section of Management's Discussion and
Analysis entitled "Lines of Business Results" beginning on page 43.

================================================================================
Competition

The Corporation and its subsidiaries and affiliates operate in a highly
competitive environment. The Corporation's bank subsidiaries compete with other
domestic and foreign banks, thrift institutions, credit unions, and money market
and other mutual funds for deposits and other sources of funds. In addition, the
Corporation and its bank and non-bank subsidiaries face increased competition
with respect to the diverse financial services and products they offer.
Competitors include finance companies, brokerage firms, investment banking
companies, merchant banks, insurance companies, leasing companies, and a variety
of other financial services and advisory companies. Many of these competitors
are not subject to the same regulatory restrictions as are domestic bank holding
companies and banks, such as the Corporation and its bank subsidiaries.

================================================================================
Government Monetary Policies and Economic Controls

The earnings and business of the Corporation are affected by general economic
conditions, both domestic and international. In addition, fiscal or other
policies that are adopted by various regulatory authorities of the United
States, by foreign governments, and by international agencies can have important
consequences on the financial performance of the Corporation. The Corporation is
particularly affected by the policies of the Board of Governors of the Federal
Reserve System (the "Federal Reserve Board"), which regulates the national
supply of bank credit. An important purpose of these policies is to curb
inflation and moderate recessions through the control of the supply of money and
credit. The Federal Reserve Board uses its powers to establish reserve
requirements of insured depository institutions and to conduct open market
operations in United States government securities so as to influence the supply
of money and credit. These policies have a direct effect on the amounts of bank
loans and deposits and on interest rates charged 




on loans and paid on deposits, with the result that Federal Reserve Board
policies can have a material effect on bank earnings.

   The Corporation has economic, credit, legal, and other specialists who
monitor economic conditions, and domestic and foreign government policies and
actions. However, since it is difficult to predict changes in macroeconomic
conditions and in governmental policies and actions relating thereto, it is
difficult to foresee the effects of any such changes on the business and
earnings of the Corporation and its subsidiaries.

================================================================================
Supervision and Regulation

General: The Corporation is subject to regulation as a registered bank holding
company under the BHCA. As such, the Corporation is required to file with the
Federal Reserve Board an annual report and other information required quarterly
pursuant to the BHCA. The Corporation is also subject to the examination powers
of the Federal Reserve Board.

   Under the BHCA, the Corporation may not engage in any business other than
managing and controlling banks or furnishing certain specified services to
subsidiaries, and may not acquire voting control of non-banking corporations,
except those corporations engaged in businesses or furnishing services which the
Federal Reserve Board deems to be so closely related to banking as "to be a
proper incident thereto". Further, the Corporation is prohibited, with certain
exceptions, from acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than
5% of the voting shares of any corporation that is engaged in activities that
are not closely related to banking, and may not acquire direct or indirect
ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting shares of any domestic bank
without the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board.

Dividend Restrictions: Federal law imposes limitations on the payment of
dividends by the subsidiaries of the Corporation that are state member banks of
the Federal Reserve System (a "state member bank") or national banks. Non-bank
subsidiaries of the Corporation are not subject to such limitations. The amount
of dividends that may be paid by a state member bank, such as Chase Bank, or by
a national bank, such as Chase USA or Texas Commerce, is limited to the lesser
of the amounts calculated under a "recent earnings" test and an "undivided
profits" test. Under the recent earnings test, a dividend may not be paid if the
total of all dividends declared by a bank in any calendar year is in excess of
the current-year's net income combined with the retained net income of the two
preceding years unless the bank obtains the approval of its appropriate Federal
banking regulator (which, in the case of a state member bank, is the Federal
Reserve Board and, in the case of a national bank, is the Office of the
Comptroller of the Currency (the "Comptroller of the Currency")). Under the
undivided profits test, a dividend may not be paid in excess of a bank's
"undivided profits".

   In accordance with the foregoing restrictions, the Corporation's bank
subsidiaries could, during 1997, without the approval of their relevant banking
regulators, pay aggregate dividends of approximately $1.5 billion to their
respective bank holding companies, plus an additional aggregate amount equal to
their net income from January 1, 1997 through the date in 1997 of any such
dividend payment.

   In addition to the dividend restrictions described above, the Federal Reserve
Board, the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation ("FDIC") have authority under the Financial Institutions Supervisory
Act to prohibit or to limit the payment of dividends by the banking
organizations they supervise, including the Corporation and its subsidiaries
that are banks or bank holding companies, if, in the banking regulator's
opinion, payment of a dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice in
light of the financial condition of the banking organization.

Capital Requirements: The Federal banking regulators have also adopted
risk-based capital and leverage guidelines, which require that the Corporation's
capital-to-assets ratios meet certain minimum standards.

   The risk-based capital ratio is determined by allocating assets and specified
off-balance sheet financial instruments into four weighted categories, with
higher levels of capital being required for the categories perceived as
representing greater risk. Under the guidelines, a banking corporation's capital
is divided into two tiers. Tier 1 Capital includes common equity, qualifying
perpetual preferred stock, minority interests in the equity accounts of
consolidated subsidiaries, less goodwill and other non-qualifying intangibles
and other assets. Tier 2 Capital includes, among other items, perpetual
preferred equity not qualifying for Tier 1, limited-life preferred stock with an
original maturity of greater than 20 years, mandatory convertible debt,
subordinated debt and intermediate-term preferred stock with an original
weighted-average maturity of at least five years, and qualifying allowance for
credit losses, less required deductions as provided by regulation. The amount of
Tier 2 Capital may not exceed the amount of Tier 1 Capital. Total Capital is the
sum of Tier 1 Capital and Tier 2 Capital.

   Banking organizations are required to maintain a Total risk-based capital
ratio (Total Capital to risk-weighted assets) of 8%, of which at least 4% must
be Tier 1 Capital.

   The Federal banking regulators have also established minimum leverage ratio
guidelines. The leverage ratio is defined as Tier 1 Capital divided by average
total assets (net of allowance for credit losses, goodwill and certain
intangible assets). The minimum leverage ratio is 3% for banking organizations
that have well-diversified risk (including no undue interest rate risk);
excellent asset quality; high liquidity; good earnings; and, in general, are
considered strong banking organizations. Other banking organizations are
expected to have ratios of at least 4%-5% depending upon their particular
condition and growth plans. Higher capital ratios could be required if warranted
by the particular circumstance or risk profile of a given banking organization.

   The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 ("FDICIA")
required each Federal banking regulator to revise its risk-based capital
standards within 18 months of enactment of the statute to ensure that those
standards take adequate account of interest rate risk, concentration of credit
risk and the risk of non-traditional activities, as well as reflect the actual
performance and expected risk of loss on multi-family mortgages. On December 15,
1994, the Federal banking regulators adopted amendments to their respective
risk-based capital requirements that explicitly identify concentration of credit
risk and certain risks 




arising from non-traditional activities, and the management of such risks, as
important factors to consider in assessing an institution's overall capital
adequacy. The amendments do not, however, mandate any specific adjustments to
the risk-based capital calculations as a result of such factors.

   In May 1996, the Federal banking agencies announced that they were going to
refrain from imposing a separate, explicit capital charge for interest rate
risk, although they might do so in the future. In August 1996, the Federal
banking agencies adopted amendments to their risk-based capital rules to
incorporate a measure for market risk in foreign exchange and commodity
activities and in the trading of debt and equity instruments. These amendments,
which become effective at year-end 1997, will require banking organizations with
relatively large trading activities, such as the Corporation, to maintain
capital for market risk in an amount that may be calculated by using the banking
organizations' own internal value-at-risk models (subject to parameters set by
the regulators). The effect of these amendments is that, in addition to existing
capital requirements for credit risk, the Corporation will be required to
maintain additional capital for market risk. This additional requirement may be
satisfied, in part, by issuing short-term subordinated debt that qualifies as
"Tier 3 Capital". The Corporation does not anticipate that these amendments to
the risk-based capital rules will have a material effect on its operations.

FDICIA: FDICIA also required the FDIC to establish a risk-based assessment
system for FDIC deposit insurance and revised certain provisions of the Federal
Deposit Insurance Act, as well as certain other Federal banking statutes. In
general, FDICIA provides for expanded regulation of depository institutions and
their affiliates, including parent holding companies, by such institutions'
Federal banking regulators, and requires the Federal banking regulator to take
"prompt corrective action" with respect to a depository institution if such
institution does not meet certain capital adequacy standards.

Prompt Corrective Action: Pursuant to FDICIA, the Federal Reserve Board, the
FDIC and the Comptroller of the Currency adopted regulations setting forth a
five-tier scheme for measuring the capital adequacy of the depository
institutions they supervise. Under the regulations (commonly referred to as the
"prompt corrective action" rules), an institution would be placed in one of the
following capital categories: (i) well capitalized (an institution that has a
Total risk-based capital ratio of at least 10%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital
ratio of at least 6% and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 5%); (ii)
adequately capitalized (an institution that has a Total risk-based capital ratio
of at least 8%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 4% and a Tier 1
leverage ratio of at least 4%); (iii) undercapitalized (an institution that has
a Total risk-based capital ratio of under 8% or a Tier 1 risk-based capital
ratio under 4% or a Tier 1 leverage ratio under 4%); (iv) significantly
undercapitalized (an institution that has a Total risk-based capital ratio of
under 6% or a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio under 3% or a Tier 1 leverage
ratio under 3%), and (v) critically undercapitalized (an institution that has a
ratio of tangible equity to total assets of 2% or less).

   Supervisory actions by the appropriate Federal banking regulator will depend
upon an institution's classification within the five categories. All
institutions are generally prohibited from declaring any dividends, making any
other capital distribution, or paying a management fee to any controlling
person, if such payment would cause the institution to become undercapitalized.
Additional supervisory actions are mandated for an institution falling into one
of the three "undercapitalized" categories, with the severity of supervisory
action increasing at greater levels of capital deficiency. For example,
critically undercapitalized institutions are, among other things, restricted
from making any principal or interest payments on subordinated debt without
prior approval of their Federal banking regulator. The regulations apply only to
banks and not to bank holding companies, such as the Corporation; however, the
Federal Reserve Board is authorized to take appropriate action at the holding
company level based on the undercapitalized status of such holding company's
subsidiary banking institution. In certain instances relating to an
undercapitalized banking institution, the bank holding company would be required
to guarantee the performance of the undercapitalized subsidiary and may be
liable for civil money damages for failure to fulfill its commitments on such
guarantee.

   As of the date hereof, each of the Corporation's banking subsidiaries were
"well capitalized".

Brokered Deposits: The ability of depository institutions to accept brokered
deposits is regulated under FDICIA. The term "brokered deposits" is defined to
include deposits that are solicited by a bank's affiliates on its behalf. A
significant portion of Chase Bank's and Chase USA's wholesale deposits are
solicited on their behalf by broker-dealer affiliates and are considered
brokered deposits. Under the rule, (i) an "undercapitalized" institution is
prohibited from accepting, renewing or rolling over brokered deposits, (ii) an
"adequately capitalized" institution must obtain a waiver from the FDIC before
accepting, renewing or rolling over brokered deposits and is not permitted to
pay interest on brokered deposits accepted in such institution's normal market
area at rates that "significantly exceed" rates paid on deposits of similar
maturity in such area, and (iii) a "well capitalized" institution may accept,
renew or roll over brokered deposits without restriction. The definitions of
"well capitalized", "adequately capitalized", and "undercapitalized" are the
same as those utilized in the "prompt corrective action" rules described above.

FDIC Insurance Assessments: Under the FDIC's risk-based insurance premium
assessment system, each depository institution is assigned to one of nine risk
classifications based upon certain capital and supervisory measures and,
depending upon its classification, is assessed insurance premiums on its
deposits. Depository institutions insured by the Bank Insurance Fund ("BIF")
which are ranked in the top risk classification category were required to pay
only the statutory minimum of $2,000 annually for deposit insurance during 1996,
while all other banks were required to pay premiums ranging from 3 basis points
to 27 basis points of domestic deposits. Each of the Corporation's banks,
including Chase Bank, Chase USA and Texas Commerce, paid the statutory minimum
premium in 1996. As a result of the enactment on September 30, 1996 of the
Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act of 1996 (the "Deposit
Funds Act"), the statutory minimum annual assessment of $2,000 was eliminated
for top-ranked depository institutions. However, the Deposit Funds Act imposed
an annual assessment on all depository institutions in order to pay interest on
bonds issued by the Financing 




Corporation ("FICO") in connection with the resolution of savings association
insolvencies occurring prior to 1991. The FICO assessment will be 1.3 basis
points of domestic deposits in the case of BIF-insured institutions such as
Chase Bank, Chase USA and Texas Commerce. These rate schedules are subject to
future adjustments by the FDIC. In addition, the FDIC has authority to impose
special assessments from time to time, subject to certain limitations specified
in the Deposit Funds Act.

Powers of the FDIC Upon Insolvency of an Insured Depository Institution: The
Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989 ("FIRREA")
imposes liability on an FDIC-insured depository institution (such as the
Corporation's bank subsidiaries) for costs incurred by the FDIC in connection
with the insolvency of other FDIC-insured institutions under common control with
such institution (commonly referred to as "cross-guarantees" of insured
depository institutions). An FDIC cross-guarantee claim against a depository
institution is superior in right of payment to claims of the holding company and
its affiliates against such depository institution.

   In the event an insured depository institution becomes insolvent, or upon the
occurrence of certain other events specified in the Federal Deposit Insurance
Act, whenever the FDIC is appointed the conservator or receiver of such insured
depository institution, the FDIC has the power: (i) to transfer any of such
bank's assets and liabilities to a new obligor (including, but not limited to,
another financial institution acquiring all or a portion of the bank's business,
assets or liabilities), without the approval of such bank's creditors; (ii) to
enforce the terms of such bank's contracts pursuant to their terms, or (iii) to
repudiate or disaffirm any contract or lease to which such depository
institution is a party, the performance of which is determined by the FDIC to be
burdensome and the disaffirmance or repudiation of which is determined by the
FDIC to promote the orderly administration of such depository institution. Such
provisions of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act would be applicable to
obligations and liabilities of those of the Corporation's subsidiaries that are
insured depository institutions, such as Chase Bank, Chase USA and Texas
Commerce, including without limitation, obligations under senior or subordinated
debt issued by such banks to investors (hereinafter referred to as "public
noteholders") in the public markets.

   In its resolution of the problems of an insured depository institution in
default or in danger of default, the FDIC is not permitted to take any action
that would have the effect of increasing the losses to a deposit insurance fund
by protecting depositors for more than the insured portion of their deposits or
by protecting creditors of the insured depository institution (including public
noteholders), other than depositors. In addition, the FDIC is authorized to
settle all uninsured and unsecured claims in the insolvency of an insured
institution by making a final settlement payment after the declaration of
insolvency based upon a percentage determined by the FDIC reflecting an average
of the FDIC's receivership recovery experience, regardless of the assets of the
insolvent institution actually available for distribution to creditors. Such a
payment would constitute full payment and disposition of the FDIC's obligations
to claimants.

   The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 included a "depositor
preference" provision, which provided that the claims of a receiver of an
insured depository institution for administrative expenses and the claims of
holders of deposit liabilities (including the FDIC, as subrogee of such holders)
have priority over the claims of other unsecured creditors of such institution,
including public noteholders, in the event of the liquidation or other
resolution of such institution.

   As a result of the provisions described above, whether or not the FDIC ever
sought to repudiate any obligations held by public noteholders of any subsidiary
of the Corporation that is an insured depository institution, such as Chase
Bank, Chase USA or Texas Commerce, the public noteholders would be treated
differently from, and could receive, if anything, substantially less than,
holders of deposit obligations of such depository institution.

Other Supervision and Regulation: Under Federal Reserve Board policy, the
Corporation is expected to act as a source of financial strength to each bank
subsidiary and to commit resources to support such bank subsidiary in
circumstances where it might not do so absent such policy. Any loans by a bank
holding company to any of its subsidiary banks are subordinate in right of
payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of the subsidiary banks.
In the event of a bank holding company's bankruptcy, any commitment by the bank
holding company to a Federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a
subsidiary bank at a certain level will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and
entitled to a priority of payment.

   The bank subsidiaries of the Corporation are subject to certain restrictions
imposed by Federal law on extensions of credit to, and certain other
transactions with, the Corporation and certain other affiliates and on
investments in stock or securities thereof. Such restrictions prevent the
Corporation and other affiliates from borrowing from a bank subsidiary unless
the loans are secured in specified amounts. Without the prior approval of the
Federal Reserve Board, secured loans, other transactions and investments by any
bank subsidiary are generally limited in amount as to the Corporation and as to
each of the other affiliates to 10% of the bank's capital and surplus and as to
the Corporation and all such other affiliates to an aggregate of 20% of the
bank's capital and surplus. Federal law also requires that transactions between
a bank subsidiary and the Corporation or certain non-bank affiliates, including
extensions of credit, sales of securities or assets and the provision of
services, be conducted on terms at least as favorable to the bank subsidiary as
those that apply or that would apply to comparable transactions with
unaffiliated parties.

   The Corporation's bank and non-bank subsidiaries are subject to direct
supervision and regulation by various other Federal and state authorities. Chase
Bank, as a New York State-chartered bank and member bank of the Federal Reserve
System, is subject to supervision and regulation of the New York State Banking
Department as well as by the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC. The
Corporation's national bank subsidiaries, such as Chase USA and Texas Commerce,
are subject to substantially similar supervision and regulation by the
Comptroller of the Currency. Supervision and regulation by each of the foregoing
regulatory agencies generally include comprehensive annual reviews of all major
aspects of the relevant bank's business and condition, as well 




as the imposition of periodic reporting requirements and limitations on
investments and other powers. The operations of The Vista Funds, the
Corporation's mutual funds, including the means by which they may be distributed
in the United States, are subject to regulation by the Securities and Exchange
Commission ("SEC") and the Federal Reserve Board. The types of activities in
which the foreign branches of Chase Bank and the international subsidiaries of
the Corporation may engage are subject to various restrictions imposed by the
Federal Reserve Board. Such foreign branches and international subsidiaries are
also subject to the laws and banking authorities of the countries in which they
operate.

   The Corporation also conducts securities underwriting, dealing and brokerage
activities through various broker-dealer subsidiaries, all of which are subject
to the regulations of the SEC and the National Association of Securities
Dealers, Inc. CSI, the Corporation's "Section 20" subsidiary, is also subject to
the supervision and regulation of the Federal Reserve Board. The Federal Reserve
Board has generally required Section 20 subsidiaries to operate under a large
number of conditions, commonly referred to as "firewalls", that separate Section
20 companies from affiliated banks and, to a certain degree, from other bank
holding company affiliates. In addition, the Federal Reserve Board required that
no more than 10% of a Section 20 subsidiary's gross revenues be derived from
underwriting and dealing in "ineligible" securities (i.e., securities in which a
national bank may not underwrite or deal). On December 20, 1996, the Federal
Reserve Board increased, effective March 6, 1997, the ineligible revenue limit
to 25% of total revenues. The effect of this regulatory action will be to enable
the Corporation to substantially expand CSI's underwriting and dealing
capabilities. On January 9, 1997, the Federal Reserve Board proposed eliminating
most of the firewalls and incorporating the remaining firewalls in a statement
of operating standards. The proposal, if adopted, would enable CSI to operate
somewhat more efficiently.

   The activities of Chase Bank, Chase USA and Texas Commerce as consumer
lenders are also subject to regulation under various Federal laws including the
Truth-in-Lending, the Equal Credit Opportunity, the Fair Credit Reporting, the
Fair Debt Collection Practice and the Electronic Funds Transfer Acts, as well as
various state laws. These statutes impose requirements on the making,
enforcement and collection of consumer loans and on the types of disclosures
that need to be made in connection with such loans. During 1996, the United
States Supreme Court decided two cases involving the consumer lending activities
of banks. In January 1996, the Court held that Federal law pre-empted state laws
prohibiting a credit card issuing bank located in one state from assessing
various fees and charges (such as late fees, over-the-limit fees, returned check
fees and annual membership fees) on credit card holders residing in another
state. In March 1996, the Court held that the Federal statute authorizing
national banks to sell insurance in small towns pre-empts a state statute
forbidding national banks from selling insurance in that state. The effect of
these decisions should be to enhance the Corporation's ability to conduct its
consumer banking businesses.

Important Factors Relating to Forward-Looking Statements.

Certain statements in this report are forward-looking statements within the
meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements
are subject to risks and uncertainties and the Corporation's actual future
results may differ materially from those set forth in such forward-looking
statements. The Corporation notes that the forward-looking statements contained
in this report speak only as of the date of this report and the Corporation
undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect
events or circumstances after the date on which such statement is made or to
reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.

   Factors that might cause the Corporation's future financial performance to
vary include, but are not limited to, those set forth in the "Management's
Discussion and Analysis" and "Supervision and Regulation" sections of this
report, as well as the following:

The Merger: Because of the inherent uncertainties associated with merging two
large companies, there can be no assurance that the Corporation will be able
fully to realize the cost savings it currently expects to realize as a result of
the merger or that such savings will be realized at the times currently
anticipated. Currently unforeseen changes in real estate markets or personnel
requirements, if they occur, could affect the timing and magnitude of the
anticipated savings. In addition, there is no assurance that the remaining work
that needs to be accomplished in order to complete fully the technology
integration and systems conversions undertaken with the merger will be done on
the originally contemplated time schedule or at the originally estimated cost.
Currently unanticipated problems in the merger integration process could, if
they occur, delay the cost savings or increase the expenses of the merger beyond
the level originally anticipated.

Competition: As noted above in Item 1 of this report, the Corporation operates
in a highly competitive environment. The Corporation expects that competitive
conditions will continue to intensify as a result of technological advances.
Technological advances have, for example, made it possible for non-depository
institutions to offer customers automatic transfer systems and other automated
payment systems services that have been traditional banking products.
Competition is also expected to increase as a result of legislation enacted in
1994 permitting interstate banking. Legislation pending in Congress, which would
permit new types of affiliations between banks and financial service companies,
including securities firms, could, if enacted, also have increased competitive
effects (See, "Legislation and Pending Litigation" below).

Foreign Operations: The Corporation does business throughout the world,
including in developing regions of the world commonly known as emerging markets.
The Corporation also invests in the securities of corporations located in such
emerging markets. The Corporation's businesses and revenues derived from
emerging markets securities are subject to risk of loss from unfavorable
political and diplomatic developments, currency fluctuations, social
instability, changes in governmental policies, expropriation, nationaliza-




tion, confiscation of assets and changes in legislation relating to foreign
ownership. In addition, foreign trading markets, particularly in emerging market
countries, are often smaller, less liquid, and more volatile than the U.S.
trading markets.

Government Monetary Policies and Economic Controls: As noted above in Item 1 of
this report, the earnings and business of the Corporation are affected by
general economic conditions, both domestic and international, and by the fiscal
or other policies that are adopted by various regulatory authorities of the
United States, foreign governments, and international agencies. The nature and
impact of future changes in economic and market conditions and fiscal policies
are not predictable and beyond the Corporation's control. In addition, these
policies and conditions can impact the Corporation's customers and
counterparties, which may increase the risks of default on their obligations to
the Corporation.

Legislation and Pending Litigation: Federal and state legislation affecting the
banking industry has played, and will continue to play, a significant role in
shaping the nature of the financial services industry. For example, during 1994,
the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994 (the
"Riegle Act") was enacted. The Riegle Act permitted, commencing September 29,
1995, interstate banking under certain conditions relating to concentration of
deposits. The Riegle Act also permits, commencing June 1, 1997 (subject to
enactment by any state of "opt-out" legislation), interstate branching by
consolidation across state lines, of banks under the common control of a bank
holding company. The States of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut have
"opted-in" early to the provisions of the Riegle Act. As a result, the
Corporation was able to integrate the branches of its New Jersey and Connecticut
banks into Chase Bank, thereby increasing the operational efficiency of such
branches. However, another effect of the early "opt-in" by New York, New Jersey
and Connecticut may be to increase competition within the tri-state region,
although the Corporation cannot predict whether and to what extent such
competition will increase. The State of Texas has "opted-out" of the provisions
of the Riegle Act.

   Legislation is pending in Congress that would, if enacted, substantially
reform the regulatory structure under which U.S. bank holding companies and
other financial services institutions operate and could, therefore, have
important implications for the Corporation and other financial services
companies. Given the current status of these legislative efforts, it is not
possible for the Corporation to predict the extent to which the Corporation and
its subsidiaries may be affected by any of these initiatives.

Business Conditions and General Economy: The Corporation is a leading provider
of services in the global markets, global services, investment banking, private
banking and national consumer businesses. The profitability of these businesses,
as well as the Corporation's credit quality, could be adversely affected by a
worsening of general economic conditions, particularly by a higher domestic
interest rate environment, as well as by foreign and domestic trading market
conditions. An economic downturn or significantly higher interest rates could
increase the risk that a greater number of the Corporation's customers would
become delinquent on their loans or other obligations to the Corporation, or
would refrain from securing additional debt. In addition, a higher level of
domestic interest rates could affect the amount of assets under management by
the Corporation (for example, by affecting the flows of moneys to or from the
mutual funds managed by the Corporation), impact the willingness of financial
investors to participate in loan syndications and underwritings managed by the
Corporation's corporate finance business, adversely impact the Corporation's
loan and deposit spreads and affect its domestic trading revenues. Revenues from
foreign trading markets may also be subject to negative fluctuations as a result
of the impact of unfavorable political and diplomatic developments, social
instability and changes in the policies of central banks or foreign governments,
and the impact of these fluctuations could be accentuated by the volatility and
lack of relative liquidity in some of these foreign trading markets.

   Item 2: Properties
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The headquarters of the Corporation is located in New York City at 270 Park
Avenue, which is a 50-story bank and office building owned by the Corporation.
This location contains approximately 1.3 million square feet of commercial
office and retail space.

   The Corporation also owns and occupies a 60-story building at One Chase
Manhattan Plaza in downtown Manhattan, New York. This location has approximately
2 million square feet of commercial office and retail space, of which
approximately 800,000 square feet is leased to outside tenants.

   The Corporation also owns and occupies a 22-story bank and office building at
4 New York Plaza, New York City, with 900,000 square feet of commercial office
and retail space. In addition, the Corporation owns a 50-story building known as
One New York Plaza in downtown Manhattan which is leased to outside tenants.

   The Corporation built in 1992 and fully occupies a two-building complex known
as Chase MetroTech in downtown Brooklyn, New York. This facility contains
approximately 1.75 million square feet and houses, among other things, the
Corporation's operations and product support functions.




   The Corporation also occupies under leasehold agreements, office space at 55
Water Street, 95 Wall Street, 2 Chase Manhattan Plaza (20 Pine Street) and
various other locations in New York City and on Long Island, New York.

   The Corporation occupies, in the aggregate, approximately one million square
feet of space in the United Kingdom. Approximately 352,000 square feet of this
total is scheduled to be exited during the second quarter of 1997. The most
significant components of the leased space in London are 218,000 square feet at
125 London Wall and 147,000 square feet at Thomas More Square. The Corporation
also owns and occupies a 300,000 square foot operations center in Bournemouth.

   In addition, the Corporation and its subsidiaries own and occupy
administrative and operational facilities in Hicksville, New York; Tampa,
Florida; Tempe, Arizona; and in Houston, Austin, Arlington, and El Paso, Texas.

   The Corporation and its subsidiaries occupy branch offices and other
locations throughout the United States and in foreign countries under various
types of ownership and leasehold agreements which, when considered in the
aggregate, are not material to its operations.

   The Corporation is currently eliminating approximately 100 existing branches
in New York State which are located near other existing Chase and Chemical
branches. In addition, the Corporation has begun, and will continue, to combine
and consolidate redundant operations conducted by both Chase and Chemical prior
to the merger.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
Summary of Selected Financial Data



(a) Reflects the adoption of SFAS 106 in 1995 for the accounting for other
postretirement benefits relating to The Chase Manhattan Corporation's (the
"Corporation") foreign plans. Also reflects the adoption in 1993 of SFAS 106 for
the Corporation's domestic plans and SFAS 109 relating to accounting for income
taxes. (b) Excluding the gross-up impact of FASI 39, which was adopted by the
Corporation in 1994, the return on average assets for 1996, 1995 and 1994 was
1.22%, 1.08% and 1.07%, respectively, before restructuring costs and accounting
changes, and 0.84%, 1.07% and 0.96%, respectively, based on net income.(c)
Excludes restructuring costs, foreclosed property expense and nonrecurring
items. 



MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS


Certain forward-looking statements contained herein are subject to risks and
uncertainties. The Corporation's actual results may differ materially from those
set forth in such forward-looking statements. Reference is made to the
Corporation's reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a
discussion of factors that may cause such differences to occur. See Glossary of
Terms on page 93 for a definition of terms used throughout the annual report.


OVERVIEW


The Corporation's net income, excluding merger restructuring costs, was $3,586
million in 1996, an increase of 20% from $2,979 million, in 1995. The
Corporation's primary earnings per share were $7.54 in 1996, compared with $6.25
in 1995. On a fully-diluted basis, earnings per share rose 22% when compared
with the prior year, to $7.43. The return on average common stockholders' equity
was 18.74% in 1996, an increase from 16.27% in 1995.

   The 1996 results were characterized by strong earnings growth across the full
breadth of the Corporation's businesses, and were realized at the same time the
Corporation executed significant merger integration plans.

   Including merger restructuring costs, the Corporation's net income for 1996
was $2,461 million compared with $2,959 million for 1995. Primary earnings per
share were $5.02 in 1996 and $6.20 in 1995, while fully-diluted earnings per
share were $4.94 in 1996, compared with $6.04 in 1995.

   The Corporation's financial targets for 1996 through 1998 included
double-digit operating earnings per share growth in each of the three years
through 1998, and an efficiency ratio in the low 50 percent range and a return
on average common stockholders' equity of 18 percent or higher by the end of
1998. These targets are based on measuring the Corporation's results using
operating earnings (net income less restructuring costs and nonrecurring items).
Nonrecurring items had a $70 million net favorable impact on net income in 1996
compared with a $65 million net favorable impact in 1995.


                          [GRAPH 1 - SEE APPENDIX I]


   The following table reflects the Corporation's results on an operating basis.



Note - See Performance Goals table for footnotes.

   In connection with the merger of The Chase Manhattan Corporation ("old
Chase") into Chemical Banking Corporation ("Chemical") in March 1996, the
Corporation announced additional performance goals for 1996. In 1996, the
Corporation largely exceeded its performance goals.



(a) Excludes the impact of credit card securitizations.

(b) Excludes foreclosed property expense, a charge to conform retirement
benefits provided to foreign employees, start-up costs incurred in connection
with the co-branded Wal-Mart credit card program ("Wal-Mart program") and the
Real Estate Investment Trust ("REIT") minority interest expense.

(c) Excluding restructuring costs.

   The Corporation's total revenue in 1996 was $15.9 billion, an increase of 6%
from the prior year. On a managed basis, which excludes the impact of credit
card securitizations, total revenue for 1996 increased 9% and exceeded the
Corporation's 5%-7% performance target range. Management currently expects
annual operating revenue growth on a managed basis of approximately 6%-8% in
1997.

   During 1996, the Corporation realized merger-related expense savings of $555
million, exceeding management's original target of $510 million and reflecting
the acceleration of merger savings originally expected to be realized in 1997.
Management expects cumulative merger-related annual cost savings will
approximate $1.2 billion by the end of 1997 and $1.7 billion by the end of 1998.

   Although operating noninterest expense for 1996 declined 2.1% from the prior
year, total operating noninterest expense for 1996 exceeded the original target
as a result of higher than anticipated incentive costs due to the strong growth
in revenue and competitive market pressures. Management expects that the
underlying operating noninterest expense of the Corporation, before merger
savings, will be approximately 5%-6% higher in 1997 than in 1996.

   During 1996, the Corporation maintained a disciplined approach to the use of
its capital. On October 15, 1996, the Corporation's Board of Directors announced
a buy-back program pursuant to which the Corporation is authorized until
December 1998 to repurchase up to $2.5 billion of its common stock, in addition
to such other common share repurchases as may be neces-



                                                 THE CHASE MANHATTAN CORPORATION
                                                                AND SUBSIDIARIES


sary to provide for expected issuances under its dividend reinvestment plan and
its various stock-based director and employee benefits plans. By the end of
1996, the Corporation had repurchased approximately $1.0 billion of common
equity under the buy-back program. In early 1997, management announced that it
intended to purchase equity on a more accelerated time schedule than previously
expected and, therefore, management believes it is likely that the buy-back
program will be completed in late 1997 or early 1998. Additionally, in 1996, the
Corporation increased its quarterly common stock dividend by 12% to $.56 per
share, while maintaining Tier 1 risk-based capital at 8.2% at December 31, 1996.

   The Corporation's nonperforming assets at December 31, 1996 were $1,151
million, a decline of 31% from the 1995 year-end. As a result of the continued
decline in nonperforming assets, the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to
nonperforming loans reached 348% at December 31, 1996. Nonperforming assets have
been reduced by over $10 billion, or 90%, from their peak level in 1991.


RESULTS OF OPERATIONS


NET INTEREST INCOME

Reported net interest income totaled $8,340 million in 1996, an increase of $138
million from 1995. The level of reported net interest income in both 1996 and
1995 was reduced by the impact of credit card securitizations. On a managed
basis, net interest income increased by 8% in 1996 to $9,254 million, reflecting
a higher level of interest-earning assets (particularly consumer receivables and
trading-related assets), as well as the funding benefit of higher equity levels.
Also contributing to the increase was $54 million of interest related to Federal
and State tax audit settlements in 1996.



(a) Reflected on a taxable equivalent basis in order to permit comparisons of
yields on tax-exempt and taxable assets.

   The reported net yield on interest-earning assets was 3.21% in 1996, compared
with 3.37% for the prior year. Adjusting for securitizations, the net yield on a
managed basis was 3.40%, a slight decline from 3.45% in 1995, reflecting a shift
in the composition of interest-earning assets from higher-yielding loans to
lower-yielding securities and liquid assets. The following table reflects the
composition of the Corporation's average interest-earning assets (on a balance
sheet basis) for the periods indicated.



   Average interest-earning assets in 1996 were $260.9 billion, an increase of
$16.4 billion from 1995. The Corporation has continued to increase its liquid
interest-earning assets through its trading and Section 20 activities, and to
increase its securities portfolio as part of its asset/liability management
("ALM") activities. The increase in the Corporation's average total loans in
1996 reflected growth of $3.5 billion in consumer loans, despite the impact of
an increase in average credit card securitizations of approximately $6.3 billion
from 1995.

   The growth in interest-earning assets was largely funded by a $10.0 billion
increase in Federal funds purchased and securities sold under repurchase
agreements, which provided short-term funding for trading-related positions and
the securities portfolio.

   Management anticipates that, given its current expectations for interest rate
movements in 1997, the Corporation's managed net interest income in 1997 will be
higher than in 1996.

PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES

The provision for credit losses in 1996 was $897 million, compared with $758
million in 1995. The increase resulted primarily from higher commercial net
charge-offs as a result of a lower level of recoveries. During 1996 the
Corporation recorded lower consumer net charge-offs due, in part, to a decline
in the level of credit card receivables retained on the balance sheet.

   Management believes that the credit quality of the Corporation's overall
commercial and industrial portfolio will remain relatively stable in 1997.
Management expects the provision for credit losses in 1997 (which is anticipated
to equal net charge-offs) to be modestly higher than in 1996, primarily as a
result of growth in retained consumer loans, higher losses in credit card loans,
and lower recoveries in commercial loans.


                          [GRAPH 2 - SEE APPENDIX I]

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS


NONINTEREST REVENUE

Total noninterest revenue was $7,512 million in 1996, an 11% increase from 1995,
reflecting strong trading results, higher credit card revenue, strong corporate
finance and syndication activities, as well as higher trust, custody, and
investment management fees. The Corporation continued to generate fee growth by
offering clients integrated financing and advisory solutions.




                          [GRAPH 3 - SEE APPENDIX I]


FEES AND COMMISSIONS

Corporate finance and syndication fees in 1996 increased 17% to $929 million
from the prior year, resulting from strong loan syndication, advisory and debt
securities underwriting activities. The active merger and acquisition
environment during 1996 was an underlying factor for the increases in these
activities. During 1996, the Corporation acted as agent for approximately $434
billion of syndicated credit facilities, a reflection of the Corporation's large
client base and strong distribution network.

   Trust, custody, and investment management fees for 1996 were $1,176 million,
an increase of 16% from 1995, reflecting increased global services and
securities processing activities, higher fees attributable to growth in assets
under management and growth in fees from the Vista mutual funds. The acquisition
of the securities processing businesses of U.S. Trust Corporation ("US Trust")
in September 1995 also contributed to the increase in fees.



(a) Represents fees for trustee, agency, registrar, estate services, safekeeping
and maintenance of securities, as well as providing advisory services and
investment management for asset holdings, for domestic and global customers.
Customers include corporations, individuals, governments and nonprofit
organizations.

(b) Represents administrative, custody, trustee and other fees in connection
with the Corporation's Vista mutual funds.

(c) Includes securities lending and broker clearing.

   Credit card revenue increased $229 million from the 1995 level as a result of
an increase in securitization volume as well as overall growth in managed
outstandings. The securitization of credit card receivables changes the
classification in which the revenue associated with the credit card
securitization is reported in the Consolidated Statement of Income. Amounts that
would previously have been reported as net interest income and as provision for
credit losses are instead reported as components of noninterest revenue (i.e.,
credit card revenue). During 1996, average securitized credit card receivables
were $10.6 billion compared with an average of $4.3 billion during 1995. The
higher level of securitizations accounted for $145 million of the increase in
credit card revenue with the remaining increase the result of higher interchange
income (fees from merchants for processing sales volume) and various other fees
on retained credit card receivables. Total average managed credit card
receivables grew 13% to $23.7 billion for 1996, from $21.0 billion in 1995. For
a further discussion of the credit card portfolio and related securitization
activity, see pages 50-51.



   Fees for other financial services for 1996 increased by $76
million, or 5%, from 1995 primarily due to an increase in fees related to
automobile securitizations, and higher transaction volume and a larger customer
base at the Corporation's discount brokerage firm, Brown and Company.


                                                 THE CHASE MANHATTAN CORPORATION
                                                                AND SUBSIDIARIES




(a) Net interest income attributable to trading activities includes interest
recognized on interest-earning and interest-bearing trading-related positions as
well as management allocations reflecting the funding cost or benefit associated
with trading positions. This amount is included in the net interest income
caption on the Consolidated Statement of Income.

(b) For the classes of financial instruments included, see Note Two of the Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements.

   The increase in revenue from interest rate contracts during 1996 was
primarily due to the volatility experienced in certain Western European, Asian
and U.S. interest rate markets, as well as higher customer demand for
derivatives used for risk management purposes. The decline in foreign exchange
revenue in 1996 was largely caused by the decrease in the level of
cross-currency trading activity in the European markets in anticipation of the
integration of the European Monetary System. In the long-term, management
expects a further reduction in foreign exchange trading revenues in Europe,
although market volatility will still create opportunities from time to time.
The increase in debt instrument and other revenue during 1996 was primarily the
result of strong performances in emerging markets in Latin America and Eastern
Europe. In addition, the 1995 results had been adversely affected by major
declines in the prices of emerging markets debt instruments during the early
part of 1995.

   Trading revenues are affected by many factors including volatility of
currencies and interest rates, the volume of transactions executed by the
Corporation on behalf of its customers, the Corporation's success in proprietary
positioning, the credit standing of the Corporation, and the steps taken by
central banks and governments that affect financial markets. The Corporation
expects its trading revenues will fluctuate as these factors will vary from
period to period.



   Securities gains were $135 million in 1996, a slight increase from the 1995
amount. All securities sales were from the available-for-sale portfolio and were
made in connection with the Corporation's asset/liability management ("ALM")
activities. For further discussion of the Corporation's securities, see Note
Three of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

   Revenue from equity-related investments includes income from venture capital
activities and emerging markets investments. The increase from 1995 reflects the
continuing benefits of a broad-based portfolio of investments in an active
market. At December 31, 1996, the Corporation had equity-related investments
with a carrying value of approximately $2.8 billion. The Corporation believes
that equity-related investments (which have been averaging approximately $170
million of revenue per quarter for the previous eight quarters), will continue
to make contributions to the Corporation's earnings, although the timing of the
recognition of gains from these activities is unpredictable and revenues from
such activities could vary significantly from period to period.

   Other revenue in 1996 was $290 million, compared with $466 million in 1995.
Contributing to the decline were higher net losses related to the disposition of
available-for-sale emerging markets securities, lower revenue from residential
mortgage origination/sales activities, a $60 million loss on the sale of a
building in Japan in 1996 and lower income from the Corporation's investment in
CIT Group Holdings, Inc. ("CIT"). In addition, the 1995 results included an $85
million gain on the sale of the Corporation's investment in Far East Bank and
Trust Company. Partially offsetting the declines in other revenue were higher
gains during 1996 from the sales of various nonstrategic assets and from
securitizations.

   Residential mortgage origination/sales activities declined $116 million for
1996, when compared with 1995, largely reflecting higher gains from the sale of
servicing rights and loans during 1995.

   The Corporation's investment in CIT produced $48 million of revenue in 1996,
a decrease of $31 million from the prior year, as a result of the sale of half
of the Corporation's investment in CIT in December 1995.



(a) Includes a $40 million charge to conform retirement benefits for foreign
employees.

(b) Excludes restructuring costs, foreclosed property expense and charge to
conform retirement benefits for foreign employees.



MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS


                          [GRAPH 4 - SEE APPENDIX I]


   Noninterest expenses, excluding restructuring costs and foreclosed property
expense, totaled $9,346 million in 1996, a decrease from $9,450 million in 1995.
The results for 1996 include noninterest expenses of $44 million related to the
introduction of the Corporation's co-branded Wal-Mart MasterCard and $13 million
of expenses associated with preferred stock dividends issued by a newly
organized real estate investment trust ("REIT") subsidiary of The Chase
Manhattan Bank.

   One measure by which the Corporation gauges its financial performance is that
of operating noninterest expense. Operating noninterest expense for 1996, which
excluded the impact of a one-time $40 million charge for conforming foreign
employees retirement benefits and the aforementioned Wal-Mart and REIT expenses,
totaled $9,249 million compared with $9,450 million in 1995 (as there were no
nonrecurring expenses in 1995). The decline is primarily due to staff
reductions, merger integration efforts and lower FDIC expenses.

   Operating noninterest expense for 1996 reflected merger-related expense
savings of $555 million, exceeding management's original target of $510 million
and reflecting the acceleration of merger savings originally expected to be
realized in 1997. Underlying operating expense growth for 1996, before merger
saves, was 3.7%, reflecting higher incentive costs due to strong revenue growth.

   The Corporation's operating efficiency ratio for 1996 was 59%, compared with
64% for 1995. Adjusting for the impact of securitizations, the efficiency ratio
was 57% in 1996. Management is currently targeting the Corporation to achieve an
operating efficiency ratio in the low 50's range by 1998.

SALARIES AND EMPLOYEE BENEFITS

Salaries increased by $24 million in 1996 as a result of higher incentive costs
due to strong revenue growth for most businesses and a competitive recruiting
environment for specialized skills in selected businesses. Also contributing to
the increase in salaries was the vesting in 1996 of certain stock-based
incentive awards, as a result of the improvement in the Corporation's stock
price. Partially offsetting these increases were the impact of personnel
reductions undertaken in 1996 as a result of the merger. The total number of
full-time equivalent employees was 67,785 at December 31, 1996, a decrease of 7%
when compared with 72,696 at December 31, 1995.
   The increase of $27 million in employee benefits during 1996 reflected a $40
million charge related to conforming retirement benefits provided to foreign
employees, higher social security expenses associated with the exercise of
options granted under broad-based employee plans and an increase in pension
expense due to a decline in the discount rate. Partially offsetting the increase
was the impact of merger-related staff reductions on medical and other benefit
costs.


                          [GRAPH 5 - SEE APPENDIX I]


OCCUPANCY AND EQUIPMENT EXPENSE

Occupancy expense decreased $73 million in 1996 largely as a result of the
consolidation of operations and branch facilities from merger integration
efforts as well as pre-merger expense-reduction programs.

   Equipment expense in 1996 was $724 million, a decrease of $31 million from
1995 reflecting the disposition of equipment and the consolidation of
back-office and other operations in connection with merger integrations.

FORECLOSED PROPERTY EXPENSE

Foreclosed property expense was a credit of $16 million in 1996, compared with a
credit of $75 million in 1995, due to lower gains on the sale of a lower level
of foreclosed properties during 1996.

RESTRUCTURING CHARGE AND EXPENSES

In connection with the merger, $1.9 billion of one-time merger-related costs
were identified, of which $1.65 billion was taken as a restructuring charge on
March 31, 1996. An additional $164 million of merger-related expenses, from an
expected $250 million of merger-related expenses, were incurred during 1996 and
included in the restructuring charge and expenses caption of the income
statement. The remaining merger-related expenses are expected to be
substantially incurred over the next year as these costs do not



                                                 THE CHASE MANHATTAN CORPORATION
                                                                AND SUBSIDIARIES


qualify for immediate recognition under an existing accounting pronouncement and
were not included in the $1.65 billion charge taken on March 31, 1996. These
remaining costs will also be reflected in the restructuring charge and expenses
caption when incurred. For a further discussion, see Note Eleven of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.

   Because of the inherent uncertainties associated with merging two large
corporations, there can be no assurance that the $1.9 billion of merger-related
costs (or the composition between restructuring charge and merger-related
expenses) will reflect the actual costs ultimately incurred by the Corporation
in implementing the merger or that the Corporation would not deem it appropriate
to take additional charges, as the merger implementation process continues.

   During 1995, the Corporation recorded a $15 million restructuring charge
related to exiting a futures brokerage business.



   Other expense decreased by $51 million, or 2%, during 1996 when compared with
1995. The improvement reflected lower FDIC assessments of $108 million (which
resulted from the elimination of FDIC assessments except for deposits associated
with former savings and loan branches). Reductions were also experienced in
various expense categories such as stationery and other supplies, postage and
shipping, reflecting the Corporation's sourcing and other expense-reduction
initiatives.

   Partially offsetting the declines were the impact of consolidating a foreign
investment that had been accounted for on the equity method, and higher travel
and other incidental costs related to services provided by employees involved
with merger-integration efforts. In addition, during 1996, the Corporation
incurred $44 million of expenses related to the Wal-Mart MasterCard and $13
million of minority interest expense associated with the REIT.

   Management has initiated an enterprise-wide program to prepare the
Corporation's computer systems and applications for the year 2000. The
Corporation expects to incur internal staff costs as well as consulting and
other expenses related to infrastructure and facilities enhancements necessary
to prepare the systems for the year 2000. Testing and conversion of system
applications is expected to cost approximately $200 million to $250 million over
the next three years. A significant proportion of these costs are not likely to
be incremental costs to the Corporation, but rather will represent the
redeployment of existing information technology resources.

INCOME TAXES

The Corporation recognized income tax expense of $1,350 million in 1996 compared
with $1,842 million in 1995. The 1996 amount includes tax benefits related to
restructuring costs as well as aggregate tax benefits and refunds of $132
million. The Corporation's effective tax rates for 1996 and 1995 (excluding the
aforementioned tax benefits and refunds) were 38.0% and 38.3%, respectively. For
additional information, refer to Note Twelve of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements.


LINES OF BUSINESS RESULTS

The Corporation manages itself using an economic-based risk-adjusted management
information system ("MIS"). This system includes many key lines of business
which are organized into two major business franchises, Global Wholesale Banking
and Regional and Nationwide Consumer Banking ("RNCB"). Within each of these
franchises, key businesses are measured independently on a profit and loss and
rate of return basis, as well as by other key performance measures. Highlights
of key business performance measures follow, reflecting risk-adjusted MIS
line-of-business results.

   Lines-of-business results are subject to restatement as appropriate whenever
there are refinements in management reporting policies or changes to the
management organization. The current presentation of the lines-of-business
results have been restated to reflect a single, uniform post-merger set of
management accounting policies.

   Guidelines exist for assigning expenses that are not directly incurred by the
businesses, such as overhead and taxes, as well as for allocating stockholders'
equity and the provision for credit losses, utilizing a risk-based methodology.
Also incorporated in the guidelines is a process for matching assets and
liabilities with similar maturity, liquidity and interest characteristics within
each business. Noninterest expenses of the Corporation are fully allocated to
the business units, except for special corporate one-time charges. Management
has developed a risk-adjusted capital methodology that quantifies different
types of risk -- credit, market, and operating -- within various businesses and
assigns capital accordingly. The provision for credit losses is allocated to
business units utilizing a credit risk methodology applied consistently across
the Corporation and a risk grading system appropriate for a business unit's
portfolio. The difference between the risk-based provision for credit losses and
the Corporation's provision for credit losses is included in the Corporate
results. Long-term expected tax rates are assigned in evaluating the
Corporation's businesses and the difference between the risk-based tax rate and
the Corporation's tax rate is included in the Corporate results.



MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

(a) Total column includes Corporate results. See description of Corporate
results on page 47.

(b) Nonrecurring items for 1996 include the loss on the sale of a building in
Japan, costs incurred in combining the Corporation's foreign retirement plans,
and aggregate tax benefits and refunds. The 1995 results include the gains on
the sales of the Corporation's investment in Far East Bank and Trust Company and
Chemical New Jersey Holdings, Inc. and the loss on the sale of half of the
Corporation's 40% interest in CIT.


GLOBAL WHOLESALE BANKING

Global Wholesale Banking provides financing, advisory, sales and trading, trade
finance, asset management, private banking and operating services to clients
worldwide, including corporations, institutions, governments and wealthy
individuals. Through these businesses, the Corporation is driving towards a new
model for the delivery of global financial services, integrating product
expertise, industry knowledge and geographic reach to effect superior customer
solutions. Global Wholesale Banking operates in more than 50 countries,
including major operations in all key international financial centers.

   Global Wholesale Banking encompasses investment banking and corporate
lending, global markets activities, equity investing, private banking, asset
management and information and transaction services. Terminal Businesses,
representing discontinued portfolios (primarily the remaining refinancing
country debt and commercial real estate problem asset and nonperforming
portfolio), are also included in Global Wholesale Banking.

   Global Wholesale Banking's operating net income for 1996 was $2,149 million
and operating return on common equity was 21%. These favorable results were
driven by higher trading-related revenue, reflecting strong performance in the
emerging markets, combined with higher fee revenue from loan syndication,
securities underwriting and advisory activities and higher equity-related
investment revenue.

   The following table sets forth certain key financial performance measures of
the businesses within Global Wholesale Banking for the periods indicated.



Global Investment Banking and Corporate Lending: Global Investment Banking and
Corporate Lending finances and advises corporations, financial sponsors,
governments and projects by providing integrated one-stop financial solutions
and industry expertise to clients globally. Client industries include
broker/dealers, chemicals, healthcare, insurance, media and telecommunications,
multinationals, natural resources, oil and gas, power and environmental, real
estate, retail and transportation. The product offerings encompass syndicated
finance, high-yield securities, merger and acquisitions, project finance,
restructuring, private placements, lease financings and lending. The Corporation
is the global leader in syndicated finance, raising over $434 billion for
clients in 1996 as agent. Also, the Corporation is the market leader in



                                                 THE CHASE MANHATTAN CORPORATION
                                                                AND SUBSIDIARIES


leveraged finance, raising over $55 billion in 1996 for the Corporation's
clients, including loans and high-yield securities. Net income in 1996 was $686
million, an increase of $59 million, or 9%, from 1995. These favorable results
were driven by 20% growth in corporate finance and syndication fees due to
increased market activity and broadened product offerings and client reach.

Global Markets: Global Markets' activities encompass the trading and sales of
foreign exchange, derivatives, fixed income securities and commodities,
including related origination functions. A leader in capital markets, the
Corporation operates 24 hours a day covering the major international
cross-border markets as well as many local markets in both developed and
developing countries. Global Markets is a recognized world leader in such key
activities as foreign exchange, interest rate swaps and emerging markets debt.
Also included within Global Markets are the domestic and international treasury
units which have the primary responsibility of managing the Corporation's
asset/liability and investment securities activities. The strong growth in
trading-related revenue contributed to a net income for 1996 of $743 million and
a return on common equity of 31%, a significant improvement from 1995's result
of $393 million and 15%, respectively. Trading-related revenue for 1996 was
$1,951 million, an increase of 27% from last year's results, driven by a strong
performance in emerging markets which recovered from the 1995 decline in the
prices of emerging market debt instruments. ALM activities in the treasury units
are managed on a total return basis, with one of the major objectives being the
creation of economic value over time. In 1996, the gross total return from
asset/liability management activities amounted to $475 million.

Chase Capital Partners: Chase Capital Partners ("CCP") is a global private
equity organization with approximately $4.0 billion under management, including
$2.8 billion in equity-related investments. Through professionals focused on
investing in the United States, Europe, Asia and Latin America, CCP provides
equity and mezzanine financing for a wide variety of investment opportunities.
During 1996, CCP's direct investments totaled a record $725 million in over 60
venture capital, management buyout, recapitalization, growth equity and
mezzanine transactions. CCP's net income for 1996 was $397 million, a 42%
increase from the prior year's results of $280 million. Return on common equity
rose to 36% from 30% in 1995. These improved results were attributable to higher
revenue derived from realizing gains on a broad-based portfolio of approximately
300 investments, during an active and favorable market.

Global Asset Management and Private Banking: The Global Asset Management and
Private Banking group serves a global client base of wealthy individuals,
institutional investors, mutual fund investors and self-directed investors.
Services include a full range of private banking capabilities, including trust
and estates, custody, corporate finance, capital markets, and other global
banking services; investment management for individuals and institutional
investors globally; Vista Family of Mutual Funds (at December 31, 1996, the
fourth largest bank-managed mutual fund family in the U.S.) and discount
brokerage. Total assets under management amounted to $126 billion at December
31, 1996. Net income grew 26% to $158 million in 1996, with a return on common
equity of 30%. A 12% growth in revenue was driven by higher revenues in trust
and investment management fees, Vista mutual fund fees and the discount
brokerage operations as well as by an 11% increase in loan volume.

Global Services: Global Services is a leading provider of information and
transaction services globally. As the world's largest provider of global custody
and a leader in trust and agency services, Global Services was custodian for
over $3.6 trillion in assets at year-end and serviced over $1.4 trillion in
outstanding debt. Global Services also operates the largest U.S. dollar funds
transfer business in the world and is a market leader in FedWire, ACH and CHIPS
volume. Net income in 1996 was $255 million, an increase of $35 million, or 16%,
from 1995. Return on common equity for 1996 was 23%; excluding the impact of
goodwill, the return on tangible common equity was 31%. The 1996 results were
favorably affected by an 11% revenue increase reflecting the U.S. Trust
portfolio acquisition ($79 million); mutual fund and equity markets growth; and
the impact of industry consolidation in the securities processing business. New
business development in the cash management and trust businesses and higher
deposit balances across all businesses contributed to the current-year's growth
in revenue.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

                          [GRAPH 7 - SEE APPENDIX I]




REGIONAL AND NATIONWIDE CONSUMER BANKING

The Regional and Nationwide Consumer Banking franchise includes the third
largest bank credit card issuer in the U.S., the third largest originator and
servicer of residential mortgages and a leading provider of auto financing and
other consumer lending products. The Corporation maintains a leading market
share position in the New York metropolitan tri-state area in serving the
financial needs of consumers, middle market commercial enterprises and small
businesses. It offers customers convenient access to financial services by
telephone, PC, and the Internet, and has the most branches and ATMs in the New
York metropolitan tri-state area. Additionally, included in RNCB is Texas
Commerce Bank, which is the second-largest bank in Texas and a leader in
providing financial products and services to businesses and individuals
throughout Texas. RNCB also includes a small international consumer presence
which is highly profitable.

   For 1996, RNCB's operating net income was $1,343 million, an increase of $179
million over 1995. Operating return on common equity for 1996 was 20%, compared
with 16% in 1995. These favorable results were driven mainly by strong growth in
loan volume related to credit card and mortgage banking products, combined with
lower FDIC costs on customer deposits and the benefit of merger-related savings.

   The following table sets forth certain key financial performance measures of
the businesses within RNCB for the periods indicated.



- ----------
(a) Insurance products managed within Deposits and Investments, but included for
reporting purposes in Credit Cards, Mortgage Banking, and National Consumer
Finance, generated revenues of $81 million and $70 million in 1996 and 1995,
respectively.

(b) Excluding the impact of goodwill, the return on tangible common equity was
13% for 1996.

Credit Cards: For 1996, Chase Cardmember Services ranked as the third largest
bank card issuer in the U.S., with a $25 billion managed portfolio, inclusive of
the Shell MasterCard, which now totals $4.5 billion in outstandings. During
1996, the Corporation introduced a co-branded MasterCard with Wal-Mart, a
premier retailer of consumer-based products in the U.S., and announced a
partnership with First Data Corporation to establish a joint venture in the
merchant credit card processing business. For 1996, net income (reflected on a
managed basis) was $311 million, a $26 million decrease from 1995's results of
$337 million. Earnings were driven by the revenue generated from growth in the
loan portfolio offset by the start-up costs for the Wal-Mart MasterCard ($27
million after-tax) and a higher credit provision.

Deposits and Investments: At December 31, 1996, Deposits and Investments has the
leading share of primary bank relationships among consumers and small businesses
in the New York metropolitan tri-state area. In addition to its tri-state
businesses, the Corporation makes available insurance and investment products
nationwide. Deposits and Investments allows customers to choose the way they
handle their financial relationships, offering telephone, PC and Internet
banking, in addition to branches



                                                 THE CHASE MANHATTAN CORPORATION
                                                                AND SUBSIDIARIES


and ATMs. It is also developing a major business in electronic payments,
including its MasterDebit product and its 1997 electronic cash "Smart Card"
pilot (through its investment in Mondex U.S.). Net income in 1996 was $267
million, an increase of $29 million from $238 million in 1995. Return on common
equity for 1996 was 26%, compared with 25% in 1995. The improvement in net
income was due to an increase in deposit and managed asset volume and lower
operating and FDIC expenses.

Middle Market: At December 31, 1996, the Corporation was the number one middle
market bank in the New York tri-state area where it has relationships with 52%
of regional companies with sales ranging from $10 million to $500 million.
Credit reengineering initiatives, greater use of technology in service delivery
and focus on customer profitability and corporate finance products have resulted
in a strong efficiency ratio of 50%. Net income was $223 million for 1996
compared with 1995 results of $228 million. The results reflected lower spreads
on deposits and an increase in the credit provision resulting from lower
recoveries.

Mortgage Banking: At December 31, 1996, Mortgage Banking was the third-largest
originator and servicer of residential mortgage loans in the U.S., serving more
than 1.6 million customers nationwide. In 1996, $33 billion in loans were
originated and the Corporation's servicing portfolio totaled $141 billion at
December 31, 1996. Typically, the mortgages originated by the Corporation are
sold in the secondary market, while the Corporation retains the related
servicing rights. In addition, the Mortgage Bank also purchases and sells
mortgage servicing rights from and to other mortgage-related companies. Net
income improved in 1996 to $110 million, a $54 million increase from 1995.
Return on common equity rose to 8%; excluding the impact of goodwill, the return
on tangible common equity was 13%. The 1996 results were favorably affected by a
15% increase in average loan outstandings, improved loan spreads and lower staff
expense as the mortgage unit has begun to significantly restructure its
origination operations to lower its fixed-cost base as part of a restructuring
program to improve its overall returns.

National Consumer Finance: National Consumer Finance is a leading provider of
auto financing, home equity secured lending, student lending, unsecured consumer
lending (Chase Advantage Credit) and manufactured housing financing. At December
31, 1996, Chase Auto Finance ($11 billion in outstandings at year-end) was
ranked number one among noncaptive finance companies in new originations ($11
billion in 1996 originations). In 1996, the Corporation and the Student Loan
Marketing Association ("Sallie Mae") formed a joint venture (Educational First
Finance) creating the largest student loan origination business in the U.S. Net
income in 1996 was $147 million, an increase of $30 million from $117 million in
1995. Return on common equity for 1996 was 32%, compared with 25% in 1995. These
improved results were due to a 17% growth in loan volume and higher servicing
fees.

International Consumer: International Consumer provides deposit, investment and
insurance products for individuals in Hong Kong. Also included is The Manhattan
Card Company Limited (the Corporation's 54% owned subsidiary), which is the
third largest credit card issuer in Hong Kong. Additionally, the Corporation has
a leading full-service banking presence in Panama and the Eastern Caribbean,
providing deposit, investment and asset products for individuals, small
businesses, large corporations and government entities. Net income for 1996 was
$64 million, a $21 million increase over the prior year's results of $43
million. The increase in earnings was driven by increased loan and deposit
volumes.

Texas Commerce: Texas Commerce is the primary bank for more large corporations
and middle market companies than any other bank in Texas. Texas Commerce also
maintains a strong consumer banking presence in Texas through its 124 locations
statewide. Corporate/middle market revenues and consumer revenues contributed
48% and 36%, respectively, of Texas Commerce's 1996 revenue. Additionally, Texas
Commerce is the largest bank for personal and corporate trust services in the
Southwest. As of December 31, 1996, Texas Commerce had $23 billion in total
assets. Net income for 1996 was $272 million, a $64 million increase from the
prior year's results of $208 million. Return on common equity rose to 19%;
excluding the impact of goodwill, the return on tangible common equity was 25%.
The improved results were due to 12% growth in loan volume, higher corporate
finance fees, lower FDIC costs and the benefits of an aggressive expense
management program.


CORPORATE

Corporate includes the management results attributed to the Corporation's
investment in CIT and some effects remaining at the Corporate level after the
implementation of management accounting policies, including residual credit
provision and tax expense. The securitized portion of the credit card portfolio
is included in Corporate. Corporate also includes one-time unallocated special
items such as merger-related restructuring charge and income tax refunds. For
1996, Corporate had operating net income of $24 million, compared with $96
million in 1995. Due to the economic risk-based methodology for capital applied
on a business unit level basis for credit, market and operating risk, Corporate
housed unallocated equity of $1,887 million in 1996 and $950 million in 1995.
This reflects the significantly improved overall risk profile of the
Corporation.



MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS


  CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT


Credit risk, the risk of loss from the default by an obligor or counterparty, is
inherent in many of the Corporation's businesses. Under the direction of the
Chief Credit Officer, policies and procedures for measuring and managing such
risks are formulated, approved and communicated throughout the Corporation.
Senior credit executives representing the major lines of business are
responsible for maintaining sound credit processes, addressing transaction and
product risk issues, providing an independent review function and monitoring the
aggregate portfolio.

   Credit risk management is an integrated and continuous process operating
concurrently and interactively at both the transaction and portfolio levels. At
the transaction level, credits are originated by line business units in the
context of business strategies that address potential risks and rewards of
specific market segments. Credit executives are involved early in the
origination and underwriting process to ensure adherence to risk policies and
underwriting standards. Transactions or product offerings require approval by an
officer with the requisite credit authority. Such authorities are differentiated
by dollar amount, risk rating and industry expertise. Only a limited number of
highly experienced credit executives have sufficient authority to approve major
exposures.

   Portfolio diversification lowers the Corporation's risk profile. Within the
loan, derivatives and foreign exchange instruments portfolios, diversification
is achieved by minimizing excessive concentrations to any one obligor, industry,
risk grade, product or geographic location. For a further discussion of these
portfolios, see the sections which follow.

LOAN PORTFOLIO

The following table presents loan-related information for the dates indicated.



- ----------
(a) Consists of installment loans (direct and indirect types of consumer
finance), student loans and unsecured revolving lines of credit. There are
essentially no credit losses in the student loan portfolio due to the existence
of Federal and State government agency guarantees. At December 31, 1996 and
1995, student loans that were past due 90 days and over and still accruing were
approximately $54 million and $107 million, respectively.

   The consumer and commercial segments of the portfolio have different risk
characteristics and different techniques are utilized to measure and manage
their respective credit risks. The consumer loan risk management process
utilizes sophisticated credit scoring and other analytical methods to
differentiate risk characteristics. Risk management procedures include
monitoring both loan origination credit standards and loan performance quality
indicators. The consumer portfolio review process also includes evaluating
product-line performance, geographic diversity and consumer economic trends.

   Within the commercial sector, all credit facilities are risk-rated based on
an assessment of the business and financial risks of the borrower. Risk ratings
are periodically checked against external benchmarks, such as bond ratings, when
available.



                                                 THE CHASE MANHATTAN CORPORATION
                                                                AND SUBSIDIARIES

                          [GRAPH 8 - SEE APPENDIX I]

Facilities are also subject to hold targets based on their risk rating and other
factors and are often syndicated to lower potential concentration risks.
Aggregate exposure to a single obligor and affiliated parties is monitored
against target thresholds that vary by risk rating and other factors. The risk
characteristics of industries and countries are also evaluated and incorporated
into the credit risk management process at both the transaction and portfolio
levels. Finally, the aggregate portfolio is regularly monitored to detect
changes in its overall risk profile or potential concentration risks.

   The commercial loan review process includes industry specialists and country
risk managers who provide expert insight into the portfolio. Industries and
countries are also evaluated in a process which is incorporated into credit-risk
decisions through the facility-risk grading system and by direct consultation
with originating officers.

   Nonperforming assets decreased $513 million from the 1995 year-end level. The
reduction in nonperforming assets reflects the improvement in the Corporation's
credit profile as a result of a lower level of loans being placed on
nonperforming status, repayments, charge-offs and the Corporation's continuing
loan workout and collection activities. Also contributing to the reduction was
the transfer of $161 million of domestic commercial real estate nonperforming
assets to the Assets Held for Accelerated Disposition portfolio.

   Net charge-offs increased $57 million in 1996 when compared with 1995,
excluding a charge of $102 million recorded in the 1996 first quarter related to
conforming the credit card charge-off policies of old Chase and Chemical. Total
net charge-offs (on a managed basis) were $1,441 million in 1996, compared with
$1,014 million in 1995, primarily reflecting higher delinquencies in managed
credit card receivables as well as lower recoveries in commercial loans.

   Management expects the Corporation's total net charge-offs in 1997 to be
modestly higher than in 1996, primarily as a result of growth in retained
consumer loans, higher losses in credit card loans, and lower recoveries in
commercial loans.

DOMESTIC CONSUMER PORTFOLIO

The domestic consumer loan portfolio consists of one-to-four family residential
mortgages, credit cards, auto financings and other consumer loans. The domestic
consumer loan portfolio totaled $69.1 billion at December 31, 1996, a decrease
of $347 million from the 1995 year-end, reflecting strong loan growth offset by
the impact of credit card, auto loan and residential mortgage securitizations
during 1996.

Residential Mortgage Loans: Residential mortgage loans at December 31, 1996 were
$36.6 billion, an increase of $2.6 billion from the 1995 year-end, primarily
reflecting a higher level of adjustable-rate loan outstandings. Nonperforming
loans related to residential mortgage loans were $249 million at December 31,
1996, compared with $238 million for the 1995 year-end. Net charge-offs for 1996
were $30 million, a decline from $62 million in 1995.


                          [GRAPH 9 - SEE APPENDIX I]


                         [GRAPH 10 - SEE APPENDIX I]


MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS


RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE LOANS BY GEOGRAPHIC REGION



   The Corporation both originates and services residential mortgage loans as
part of its mortgage banking activities. The following table presents the
residential mortgage servicing portfolio activity for 1996 and 1995.



   Mortgage servicing rights (included in other assets) amounted to $1,404
million at December 31, 1996, compared with $1,242 million at December 31, 1995.
The increase reflects the corresponding increase in the Corporation's
residential mortgage servicing portfolio. The Corporation continually evaluates
prepayment exposure of the servicing portfolio, adjusting the balance and
remaining life of the servicing rights as a result of prepayments, and utilizes
derivative contracts (interest rate swaps and purchased option contracts) to
reduce its exposure to such prepayment risks.

Credit Card Loans: The Corporation analyzes its credit card portfolio on a
"managed basis", which includes credit card receivables on the balance sheet as
well as credit card receivables which have been securitized. During 1996, the
Corporation securitized $7.5 billion of credit card receivables compared with
$4.8 billion of receivables during 1995. At December 31, 1996, the Corporation
had $25.2 billion of managed receivables ($12.2 billion of receivables on the
balance sheet), compared with $23.7 billion ($17.1 billion on the balance sheet)
at year-end 1995, reflecting the continued strong growth in credit card
outstandings due in large part to active account and balance solicitations.

DOMESTIC CREDIT CARD RECEIVABLES BY GEOGRAPHIC REGION



   The following table presents the Corporation's managed credit card-related
data for the periods presented.



- ----------
(a) Excludes a charge related to conforming credit card charge-off policies.

   The increase in net charge-offs of managed credit card receivables for 1996,
when compared with 1995, reflects growth in average managed credit card
outstandings and higher levels of personal bankruptcies. Management currently
expects the Corporation's credit card net charge-offs, as a percentage of
average managed credit card receivables, to increase modestly in 1997 when
compared with 1996, primarily as a result of higher personal bankruptcies and
delinquencies in credit card loans.


                          [GRAPH 11 - SEE APPENDIX I]


                          [GRAPH 12 - SEE APPENDIX I]
                                          


                                                 THE CHASE MANHATTAN CORPORATION
                                                                AND SUBSIDIARIES


Credit Card Securitizations: In a credit card securitization, the Corporation
takes a portion of its credit card receivables and packages them into
securities. Securitizations change the Corporation's status from that of a
lender to that of a loan servicer. The securitization of credit card receivables
does not significantly affect the Corporation's reported net income; due to the
revolving nature of the credit card receivables sold, the recognition of
servicing fees results in a pattern of income recognition that is substantially
similar to the pattern that would be experienced if the receivables had not been
sold. The initial gain on the sale of the securitized receivables is recorded at
the time of the securitization. Thereafter, for securitized receivables, amounts
that would previously have been reported as net interest income and as provision
for credit losses are instead reported as components of noninterest revenue in
the income statement, as shown in the following table.



Auto Financings: This portfolio consists of auto loans and leases. Auto
financings were $11.1 billion at December 31, 1996, an increase of $2.8 billion
from the prior year-end level. The increase in auto financings reflect stronger
consumer demand during the first half of 1996 due to favorable pricing programs,
partially offset by the impact of auto loan securitizations. Total originations
were $11.6 billion in 1996, compared with $7.2 billion in 1995. The Corporation
securitized approximately $4.0 billion of auto loans during 1996, compared with
approximately $3.0 billion during 1995.

   Net charge-offs related to auto financings were $38 million in 1996, an
increase of $20 million from 1995, primarily reflecting growth in the portfolio
and the performance of a discontinued product line. The largest concentrations
of auto financings are in the Texas, New York and California markets,
representing 18%, 17% and 13%, respectively, of the portfolio. No other state
represents more than 10% of the auto financings portfolio.

Other Consumer Loans: These consumer loans consist of secured installment loans
(primarily loans related to recreational vehicles and manufactured housing
financing), student loans and unsecured revolving lines of credit.

   Other consumer loans were $9.2 billion at December 31, 1996, a decrease of
$.8 billion from the prior year-end level. The decrease primarily reflected the
sale of approximately $1.5 billion of student loans during the fourth quarter of
1996 in conjunction with the formation of the Corporation's joint venture with
Sallie Mae (which is accounted for on the equity basis), partly offset by
increased demand for installment loans. Net charge-offs related to the other
consumer loans were $138 million in 1996, versus $104 million in 1995, primarily
relating to higher bankruptcies on unsecured revolving lines of credit.

DOMESTIC COMMERCIAL PORTFOLIO

Domestic Commercial and Industrial Portfolio: The domestic commercial and
industrial portfolio totaled $34.7 billion at December 31, 1996, compared with
$32.3 billion at December 31, 1995. The portfolio consists primarily of loans
made to large corporate and middle market customers and is diversified
geographically and by industry.

   Net charge-offs of domestic commercial and industrial loans were $86 million
in 1996, compared with net recoveries of $4 million in 1995, reflecting lower
recoveries during 1996. Management believes that the credit quality of the
Corporation's commercial and industrial loan portfolio will remain relatively
stable in 1997, although it expects net charge-offs in 1997 to be modestly
higher than in 1996, as a result of an anticipated reduction in recoveries from
the high levels achieved during 1996 and 1995.

Domestic Commercial Real Estate Portfolio: The domestic commercial real estate
portfolio represents loans secured primarily by real property, other than loans
secured by mortgages on one-to-four family residential properties (which are
included in the consumer loan portfolio).

   Domestic commercial real estate loans were $5.9 billion at December 31, 1996,
a decrease of $.7 billion from 1995, principally as a result of securitizations,
repayments from borrowers, transfers, collections and sales primarily from the
terminal commercial real estate portfolio. The Corporation initiated the
securitization of commercial real estate loans in 1996.

   Nonperforming domestic commercial real estate loans were $156 million at
December 31, 1996, a 58% decrease from the 1995 year-end level, reflecting the
transfer of $145 million of nonperforming loans to the Assets Held for
Accelerated Disposition portfolio in the fourth quarter of 1996. This transfer
had no impact on the Corporation's allowance for loan losses or its 1996
results. Net charge-offs of domestic commercial real estate loans were $14
million in 1996, compared with $31 million in 1995. As a percentage of average
domestic commercial real estate loans, net charge-offs represented .22% in 1996,
compared with .43% in 1995.

   The largest concentration of domestic commercial real estate loans is in the
New York/New Jersey and Texas markets, representing 52% and 24%, respectively,
of the portfolio. No other state represents more than 6% of the domestic
commercial real estate loan portfolio.



MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS


Domestic Financial Institutions Portfolio: The domestic financial institutions
portfolio includes loans to commercial banks and companies whose businesses
primarily involve lending, financing, investing, underwriting or insurance.
Loans to domestic financial institutions were $5.5 billion at December 31, 1996,
or 3% of total loans outstanding at December 31, 1996, compared with $5.7
billion at December 31, 1995. Loans to domestic financial institutions are loans
to broker-dealers, which are predominately secured, and to domestic commercial
banks and domestic branches of foreign banks. The portfolio maintained its
strong credit quality throughout 1996, with no net charge-offs in 1996 and net
recoveries of $12 million in 1995.

FOREIGN PORTFOLIO

The foreign portfolio includes commercial and industrial loans, loans to
financial institutions, commercial real estate loans, loans to foreign
governments and official institutions, and consumer loans. Included in foreign
loans were commercial and industrial loans of $23.1 billion at year-end 1996, an
increase of $2.3 billion from the 1995 year-end. Total foreign commercial real
estate loans at December 31, 1996 were $.8 billion, unchanged from the 1995
year-end. Net recoveries of foreign loans were $27 million in 1996 and $34
million in 1995.

   For year-end balances by type of loan included in the foreign portfolio, see
Note Four of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

INDUSTRY DIVERSIFICATION

As of December 31, 1996, only two industry sectors exceeded 5% of total
Commercial and Industrial loans outstanding: food, beverage and tobacco
(approximately $3.1 billion) and oil and gas exploration (approximately $3.0
billion). These sectors represented 5.4% and 5.2%, respectively, of the
Commercial and Industrial loan portfolio and 2.0% and 1.9%, respectively, of the
total loan portfolio.

CROSS-BORDER EXPOSURE

At December 31, 1996, the Corporation held cross-border outstandings exceeding
1% of its total assets, as follows: $6.0 billion to United Kingdom, $5.3 billion
to Japan, $5.2 billion to Germany and $3.6 billion to Italy. The Corporation
does not have significant local currency outstandings in these individual
countries that are not hedged or funded by local currency borrowings. The
majority of outstandings to the above countries are primarily short-term in
nature, which mitigates the credit risk as transactions settle quickly. These
outstandings generally represent interbank placements and trading assets.   

The Corporation's total outstandings to countries which it considers to be
emerging markets countries were $18.6 billion at December 31, 1996, compared
with $17.2 billion at December 31, 1995. Outstandings (loans and accrued
interest, interest-bearing deposits with banks, securities, acceptances and
other monetary assets, except equity investments) represent both the public and
private sectors and are net of written guarantees and tangible liquid collateral
held outside the foreign country. Exposure to emerging markets is largely
concentrated in Latin America, principally Brazil ($3.1 billion) and Mexico
($1.8 billion). These amounts exclude bonds issued by foreign governments, known
as Brady Bonds, because the principal is collateralized by U.S. Treasury
obligations. For a further discussion of the Corporation's Brady Bonds and its
trading assets-debt and equity instruments with emerging market countries, see
Notes Four and Two, respectively, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements.

DERIVATIVE AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

In the normal course of its business, the Corporation utilizes various
derivative and foreign exchange financial instruments to meet the financial
needs of its customers, to generate revenues through its trading activities, and
to manage its exposure to fluctuations in interest and currency rates.

   Derivative and foreign exchange transactions involve, to varying degrees,
credit risk and market risk. The effective management of credit and market risk
is vital to the success of the Corporation's trading and ALM activities. Because
of changing market environments, the monitoring and managing of these risks is a
continual process. For a further discussion of market risk, see the Market Risk
Management section on page 54.

   The Corporation seeks to control the credit risk arising from derivative and
foreign exchange transactions through its credit approval process and the use of
risk control limits and monitoring procedures. The Corporation uses the same
credit procedures when entering into derivative and foreign exchange
transactions as it does for traditional lending products. The credit approval
process involves evaluating each counterparty's creditworthiness, and then
assessing the appropriateness of derivative, foreign exchange and structured
transactions to the risks the counterparty is attempting to manage, and
determining if there are specific transaction characteristics that alter the
risk profile. Credit limits are calculated and monitored on the basis of
potential exposures which takes into consideration current market values and
estimates of potential future movements in market values. If collateral is
deemed necessary to reduce credit risk, then the amount and nature of the
collateral obtained is based on management's credit evaluation of the customer.
Collateral held varies but may include cash, investment securities, accounts
receivable, inventory, property, plant and equipment, and real estate.

   The Corporation believes the true measure of credit risk exposure is the
replacement cost of the derivative or foreign exchange product. This is also
referred to as repayment risk or the mark-to-market exposure amount. While
notional principal is the most commonly used volume measure in the derivative
and foreign exchange markets, it is not a measure of credit or market risk. The
notional principal amounts of the Corporation's derivative and foreign exchange
products greatly exceed the possible credit and market loss that could arise
from such transactions.



                                                 THE CHASE MANHATTAN CORPORATION
                                                                AND SUBSIDIARIES


   Mark-to-market exposure is a measure, at a point in time, of the value of a
derivative or foreign exchange contract in the open market. When the
mark-to-market is positive, it indicates the counterparty owes the Corporation
and, therefore, creates a repayment risk for the Corporation. When the
mark-to-market is negative, the Corporation owes the counterparty.
In this situation, the Corporation does not have repayment risk.

   When the Corporation has more than one transaction outstanding with a
counterparty, and there exists a legally enforceable master netting agreement
with the counterparty, the "net" mark-to-market exposure represents the netting
of the positive and negative exposures with the same counterparty. If there is a
net negative number, then the Corporation's exposure to the counterparty is
considered to be zero. Net mark-to-market is, in the Corporation's view, the
best measure of credit risk when there is a legally enforceable master netting
agreement between the Corporation and the counterparty. For the notional amounts
and related credit risk exposure amounts by product, see Note Seventeen of the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

   Many of the Corporation's contracts are short-term, which also mitigates the
credit risk as transactions settle quickly. The following table provides the
remaining maturities of derivative and foreign exchange contracts outstanding at
December 31, 1996 and 1995. Percentages are based upon remaining contract life
of mark-to-market exposure amounts.



   The Corporation routinely enters into derivative and foreign exchange
transactions with regulated financial institutions, which the Corporation
believes have relatively low credit risk. At December 31, 1996, approximately
86% of the Corporation's mark-to-market exposure in derivative and foreign
exchange transactions was with commercial bank and financial institution
counterparties, most of whom are dealers in these products. Nonfinancial
institutions accounted for only approximately 14% of the Corporation's
derivative and foreign exchange mark-to-market exposure.

   The Corporation does not deal, to any significant extent, in derivatives,
which dealers of derivatives (such as other banks and financial institutions)
consider to be leveraged. As a result, the mark-to-market exposure as well as
the notional amount of such derivatives were insignificant at December 31, 1996.

ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES

The allowance for credit losses is available to absorb potential credit losses
from the entire loan portfolio, as well as derivative and foreign exchange
contracts, letters of credit and guarantees. As of December 31, 1996, the
allowance for credit losses has been allocated into three components: a $3,549
million allowance for loan losses, which is reported net in Loans; a $75 million
allowance for credit losses on derivative and foreign exchange financial
instruments, which is reported net in Trading Assets-Risk Management
Instruments; and a $70 million allowance for credit losses on letters of credit
and guarantees, which is reported in Other Liabilities. Prior period amounts
have not been reclassified due to immateriality.

   The Corporation deems its allowance for credit losses at December 31, 1996 to
be adequate (i.e., sufficient to absorb losses that may currently exist in the
portfolio, but are not yet identifiable). Estimating potential future losses is
inherently uncertain and depends on many factors, including general
macroeconomic and political conditions, rating migration, structural changes
within industries which alter competitive positions, event risk, unexpected
correlations within the portfolio, and other external factors such as legal and
regulatory requirements. The Corporation periodically reviews such factors and
reassesses the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses.

   The Corporation's actual credit losses arising from derivative and foreign
exchange transactions were immaterial from 1994


                         [GRAPH 13 - SEE APPENDIX I]



MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS


through 1996. Additionally, for both December 31, 1996 and 1995, nonperforming
derivatives contracts were immaterial.

ALLOWANCE COVERAGE RATIOS




   MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT


The market risk management function is responsible for the measurement,
monitoring and control of market risk, and the communication of risk limits
throughout the Corporation in connection with its trading and ALM activities.

TRADING ACTIVITIES

Trading assets and liabilities are used by the Corporation to meet the financial
needs of customers as well as to generate revenues through its trading
activities. An integral strategy of the Corporation's risk management governance
structure is to manage the market risks associated with trading activities
through geographic and product diversification. Trading activities are conducted
in more than 20 countries throughout the world, with an emphasis placed on the
major trading centers in North America, Europe and Asia. The Corporation trades
a wide range of products, including derivative and foreign exchange instruments,
corporate securities, government securities, and emerging markets instruments. A
more complete description of the classes of debt, equity and risk management
instruments used in the Corporation's trading activities, as well as the credit
risk and market risk factors involved in such activities, are disclosed in Notes
Two and Seventeen of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

   The Corporation generates revenue through four fundamental trading
activities: market-making, sales, arbitrage, and positioning. The Corporation
places more emphasis on the first three trading activities since they are
considered to be more stable businesses than positioning.

Market-making: The Corporation trades with the intention of profiting from the
spread between bid and ask prices. Market-making tends to be one of the more
stable trading businesses since it is related principally to market volumes.

Sales: The Corporation provides products for its clients at competitive prices.
Sales, like market-making, is considered to be a relatively stable activity
because revenue is related principally to the volume of products sold to the
Corporation's worldwide client base.

Arbitrage: The Corporation enters into a risk position and offsets that risk in
a different, but closely related, market or instrument. The Corporation believes
this strategy can be effectively utilized to generate revenue based on its
knowledge of products and participation in markets where there are numerous
products that relate to each other.

Positioning: The Corporation takes certain positions in financial instruments in
anticipation of changes in the value of such instruments. The Corporation places
less emphasis on this trading strategy since it is considered to have the lowest
stability of the four fundamental trading activities.

   Management believes a risk management process that allows risk-taking within
well defined limits can be used to create and enhance both shareholder value and
competitive advantage through effective employment of risk capital. In support
of this philosophy, the Corporation has defined several fundamental risk
management principles, including:

   - Formal definition of risk management governance;

   - Measurement of risk using "value-at-risk" methodologies and nonstatistical
     measures; and

   - Continual evaluation of risk appetite, communicated through risk limits.

   The risk management governance structure at the Corporation begins with broad
oversight responsibility by the Board of Directors. The market risk management
governance structure consists of the Risk Policy Committee, Risk Management
Committee, and Market Risk Committee, all of which meet on a monthly basis. The
Risk Policy Committee, a committee of the Board of Directors overseeing both
market and credit risk, has been delegated the responsibility to review the
Corporation's risk management policies and control framework, approve aggregate
levels of market risk, and evaluate the risk/return performance of trading and
treasury businesses.

   In order to move the focus from oversight responsibility to active day-to-day
management of risk, the Corporation's risk management governance structure
extends into the business areas. The Office of the Chairman's Risk Management
Committee, comprised of senior business-line, credit and finance executives,
provides direction for the market risk profile of the Corporation, as well as a
forum to discuss market risk issues that may require increased corporate
awareness. The Market Risk Committee is made up of both senior business-line
managers and managers independent of the line areas that collectively have
direct accountability for all corporate-wide market risk activities.
Responsibilities of the Market Risk Committee include, among other things,
review of market risk measurement methodologies, risk limits, and risk capital
assessments.

   Market risk is measured and monitored on a daily basis through a
value-at-risk ("VAR") methodology, which captures the potential overnight dollar
loss from adverse market movements. The quantification of market risk through a
VAR methodology requires a number of key assumptions including confidence level
for losses, number of days of price history, hold-



                                                 THE CHASE MANHATTAN CORPORATION
                                                                AND SUBSIDIARIES


ing period, measurement of inter-business correlation, and the treatment of
risks outside the VAR methodology, such as event risk and liquidity risk. The
Corporation supplements its VAR calculations by performing alternative scenario
analyses to estimate the economic impact of sudden market movements on selected
portions of the trading portfolio. The Corporation has adopted as a standard for
its VAR methodology, the guidelines set forth by the Federal Reserve, effective
January 1, 1998, in its implementation of the Basle Capital Accord amendment to
incorporate market risks.

   The Corporation utilizes a comprehensive limit structure as part of the
market risk management process. In addition to establishing VAR limits on market
risk activities at the aggregate and business unit levels, the Corporation also
maintains nonstatistical risk limits to mitigate risk in those instances where
statistical assumptions break down. Nonstatistical measures include net open
positions, basis point values, position concentrations and position turnover.
Criteria for risk limits include, among other factors, relevant market analysis,
market liquidity, prior track record, business strategy, and management
experience and depth. Risk limits are reviewed regularly to ensure consistency
with trading strategies and material developments in market conditions. The
Corporation also uses stop-loss advisories to inform senior management when
losses of a certain threshold are sustained from a trading activity. The
Corporation believes the use of nonstatistical measures and stop-loss advisories
in tandem with VAR limits reduces the likelihood that potential trading losses
will reach the daily VAR limit.

   The following chart contains a histogram of the Corporation's daily market
risk-related revenue for 1996 and 1995. Market risk-related revenue is defined
as the daily change in value in marked-to-market trading portfolios plus any
trading-related net interest income or other revenue. Net interest income
related to funding and investment activity is excluded.


                         [GRAPH 14 - SEE APPENDIX I]


   For 1996, the Corporation posted positive daily market risk-related revenue
for 243 out of 260 days. For 225 of the 260 days, the Corporation's daily market
risk-related revenue or losses occurred within a range of negative $5 million to
positive $15 million which is representative of the Corporation's emphasis on
market-making, sales and arbitrage activities. For 1995, the Corporation posted
positive daily market risk-related revenue for 232 out of 260 days. For 234 of
the 260 days in 1995, the Corporation's daily market risk-related revenue or
losses occurred within the negative $5 million to positive $15 million range.

   For the 1996 year, the Corporation did not have any daily losses over $15
million and only one occurrence of a trading loss in excess of $10 million. The
three losses over $30 million shown for the 1995 year were all sustained in the
first quarter of 1995, primarily due to unusual volatility experienced in
emerging markets countries at the time.

   Based on actual 1996 trading results, which captures the historical
correlation among business units, 95% of the variation in the Corporation's
daily trading results fell within a $24 million band centered on the daily
average amount of $8 million for the year. This compares with a $31 million band
centered on the daily average amount of $6 million for 1995.

ASSET/LIABILITY MANAGEMENT

Key elements of the Corporation's ALM process include oversight by the Board of
Directors and senior management as to the level of balance sheet interest rate
risk assumed by the Corporation relative to its financial condition, earnings
and capital. The Board of Directors reviews and approves risk management
policies, risk limits and the control framework and delegates to the Risk Policy
Committee of the Board specific oversight functions. The Asset-Liability
Committee (the "Committee"), comprised of the Office of the Chairman and senior
business and finance executives, establishes the balance sheet interest rate
risk appetite for the Corporation. The Committee is supported by a comprehensive
risk management process that identifies, measures, manages and monitors interest
rate risk.



MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS


   A key element of the Corporation's ALM process is that it allows the
assumption of risk by a limited number of authorized units with close contacts
to the markets. Interest rate risk is generally managed with consideration for
both total-return and reported earnings. The interest rate risk profile of the
Corporation's assets, liabilities and derivatives exposures is modified based on
an ongoing assessment of fundamental trends in interest rates, economic
developments and technical analysis.

   Interest rate risk arises from a variety of factors, including differences in
the timing between the contractual maturity or repricing (the "repricing") of
the Corporation's assets and liabilities and derivative financial instruments.
For example, the Corporation's net interest income and financial condition are
affected by changes in the level of market interest rates as the repricing
characteristics of its loans and other assets do not necessarily match those of
its deposits, other borrowings and capital. In the case of floating-rate assets
and liabilities, the Corporation may also be exposed to basis risk, which is the
difference in repricing characteristics of two floating rate indices, such as
the Prime rate and the three-month London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR"). In
addition, many of the Corporation's products have embedded options which impact
pricing and principal balance levels.

   The Corporation, as part of its ALM process, employs a variety of cash
(primarily securities) and derivative instruments in managing its exposure to
fluctuations in market interest rates. The Corporation uses derivative
instruments to adjust the interest rate repricing characteristics of specific
on-balance sheet assets and liabilities, or groups of assets and liabilities
with similar repricing characteristics. See Note One of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of the Corporation's
accounting policy relative to derivative instruments used for ALM.

Measuring Interest Rate Sensitivity: In managing exposure, the Corporation uses
quantifications of net gap exposure, measurements of earnings at risk based on
net interest income simulations, and valuation sensitivity measures. An example
of aggregate net gap analysis is presented below. Assets, liabilities and
derivative instruments are placed in gap intervals based on their repricing
dates. Assets and liabilities for which no specific contractual repricing or
maturity dates exist, or whose contractual maturities do not reflect their
expected maturities, are placed in gap intervals based on management's judgment
and statistical analysis, as applicable, concerning their most likely repricing
behaviors. Derivatives used in interest rate sensitivity management are also
included in the applicable gap intervals.

   A net gap for each time period is calculated by subtracting the liabilities
repricing in that interval from the assets repricing. A negative gap - more
liabilities repricing than assets - will benefit net interest income in a
declining interest rate environment and will detract from net interest income in
a rising interest rate environment. Conversely, a positive gap - more assets
repricing than liabilities - will benefit net interest income if rates are
rising and will detract from net interest income in a falling rate environment.

INTEREST SENSITIVITY TABLE



- ----------
(a) Represents net repricing effect of derivative positions, which include
interest rate swaps, futures, forward rate agreements and options, that are used
as part of the Corporation's overall ALM activities.

   At December 31, 1996, the Corporation had $7,945 million more liabilities
than assets repricing within one year (including net repricing effects of
derivative positions), amounting to 2% of total assets. The consolidated gaps
include exposure to U.S. dollar interest rates as well as exposure to non-U.S.
dollar rates in currency markets in which the Corporation does business. Since
U.S. interest rates and non-U.S. interest rates may not move in tandem, the
overall cumulative gaps may tend to differ from the actual exposures of the
Corporation.

   Gap analysis is the simplest representation of the Corporation's interest
rate sensitivity. However, it cannot reveal the impact of factors such as
administered rates (e.g., the prime lending rate), pricing strategies on
consumer and business deposits, changes in balance sheet mix, or the effect of
various options embedded in balance sheet instruments. Accordingly, the
Corporation conducts simulations of net interest income under a variety of
market interest rate scenarios. These simulations, which consider forecasted
balance sheet changes, such as asset sales and securitizations, and forecasted
changes in interest rate spreads, provide an estimate of earnings at risk for
given changes in interest rates.



                                                 THE CHASE MANHATTAN CORPORATION
                                                                AND SUBSIDIARIES


   At December 31, 1996, based on the Corporation's simulation models, which
provide comprehensive simulations of net interest income under a variety of
market interest rate scenarios, earnings at risk to an immediate 100 basis point
rise in market interest rates over the next twelve months was estimated to be
less than 3.5% of projected 1997 after-tax net income. During 1996, the
Corporation's earnings exposure to an immediate 100 basis point rise in interest
rates averaged less than 3% of projected after-tax net income (excluding the
merger-related restructuring charge). An immediate 100 basis point rise in
interest rates is a hypothetical rate scenario, used to calibrate risk, and does
not necessarily represent management's current view of future market
developments.

   All the measurements of risk described above are made based upon the
Corporation's business mix and interest rate exposures at a particular point in
time. The exposures change continuously as a result of the Corporation's ongoing
businesses and its risk management initiatives. While management believes these
measures provide a meaningful representation of the Corporation's interest rate
sensitivity, they do not take into account all business developments that have
an effect on net income, such as changes in credit quality or the size and
composition of the balance sheet.

Interest rate swaps: Interest rate swaps are one of the various financial
instruments used in the Corporation's ALM activities.

   The following table summarizes the outstanding ALM interest rate swap
notional amounts at December 31, 1996, by yearly intervals. The decrease in
notional amounts from one period to the next period represents maturities of the
underlying contracts. The weighted-average fixed interest rates to be received
or paid on such swaps are presented for each yearly interval.

   Three-month LIBOR is provided for reference in the following table and
reflects the average implied forward yield curve for that index as of December
31, 1996. However, actual repricings of the Corporation's interest rate swaps
will be based on the applicable rates that are in effect at the actual repricing
date. To the extent rates change, the variable rates paid or received will
change. The Corporation expects the impact of any interest rate changes to be
largely mitigated by corresponding changes in the interest rates and values
associated with the linked assets and liabilities.

OUTSTANDING INTEREST RATE SWAPS NOTIONAL AMOUNTS AND RECEIVE/PAY RATES BY YEARLY
INTERVALS



   The following table summarizes the Corporation's assets and liabilities at
December 31, 1996, along with the notional amounts of derivative contracts used
for ALM activities related to such assets and liabilities.

DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS AND RELATED BALANCE SHEET POSITIONS



- ----------
(a) At December 31, 1996, notional amounts of approximately $8 billion of
interest rate swaps and $1 billion of other ALM contracts, both of which are
used in place of cash instruments (See Note One of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements), have been excluded from the above table.

(b) Includes futures, forwards and options.


   Included in the preceding table are notional amounts of approximately $7.6
billion of derivatives related to mortgage servicing assets and approximately
$7.6 billion of derivatives related to mortgage and consumer loans held for sale
which were outstanding at December 31, 1996. The weighted-average maturity of
contracts linked to mortgage servicing assets is approximately four years.
Contracts related to loans held for sale generally mature within one year.

   The unfavorable impact on net interest income from the Corporation's ALM
derivative activities was $103 million for 1996, compared with a favorable
impact of $153 million for 1995. The Corporation also has derivatives that
affect noninterest revenue (such as derivatives linked to mortgage servicing
rights).



MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS


   The following table reflects the deferred gains and losses on closed
derivative contracts and unrecognized gains and losses on open derivative
contracts utilized in the Corporation's ALM activities.



   Net deferred gains and losses on closed contracts relate to futures, forwards
and swaps used in connection with available-for-sale securities, loans, deposits
and debt. The net unrecognized gains and losses relating to ALM activities are
largely the result of interest rate swaps, options, forward and futures
contracts primarily used in connection with loans, deposits and debt. These net
unrecognized losses do not include the net favorable impact from the
assets/liabilities being hedged by these derivative contracts. For a further
discussion of unrecognized gains/losses on open derivative contracts, see Note
Twenty of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

   The net deferred losses at December 31, 1996 are expected to be amortized as
yield adjustments in interest income, interest expense or noninterest revenue
over the periods reflected in the following table. The Consolidated Balance
Sheet includes unamortized premiums on open ALM option contracts that will be
amortized as a reduction to net interest income or noninterest revenue over the
following periods.

AMORTIZATION OF NET DEFERRED GAINS (LOSSES) ON CLOSED ALM CONTRACTS AND OF
PREMIUMS ON OPEN ALM OPTIONS CONTRACTS



   Foreign currency exposures (arising from activities conducted in the
Corporation's overseas units) and net investments in overseas entities, are
managed through the use of foreign exchange forward contracts. Entities having
exposures in other than their functional currency match outstanding foreign
currency positions on a currency-by-currency basis to hedge the impact of
foreign exchange rate changes on their operating performance. The notional
amount of these foreign exchange forward contracts, which are not included in
the previous tables, amounted to $51.6 billion at December 31, 1996.


   OPERATING RISK MANAGEMENT


The Corporation, like all large financial institutions, is exposed to many types
of operating risk, including the risk of fraud by employees or outsiders,
unauthorized transactions by employees, and errors relating to computer and
telecommunications systems. The Corporation maintains a system of controls that
is designed to keep operating risk at appropriate levels in view of the
financial strength of the Corporation, the characteristics of the businesses and
markets in which the Corporation operates, competitive circumstances and
regulatory considerations. However, from time to time in the past, the
Corporation has suffered losses from operating risk and there can be no
assurance that the Corporation will not suffer such losses in the future.


   CAPITAL AND LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT



CAPITAL

The Corporation's level of capital at December 31, 1996 remained strong, with
capital ratios well in excess of regulatory guidelines. The Corporation's Tier 1
and Total Capital ratios were 8.15% and 11.78%, respectively, at December 31,
1996. As part of the Corporation's commitment to a disciplined capital policy,
management has continued to target a Tier 1 Capital ratio for the Corporation of
8% to 8.25%. The Corporation manages its capital to execute its strategic
business plans and support its growth and investments, including its acquisition
strategies in its core businesses.

   Total capitalization, which is the sum of Tier 1 Capital and Tier 2 Capital,
increased by $1.1 billion during 1996, to $29.4 billion at December 31, 1996.
Total capital includes the recently issued $550 million of preferred stock of
Chase Preferred Capital Corporation and $600 million of 7.67% Capital
Securities, Series A, of Chase Capital I, both of which are included in the
Corporation's Tier 1 Capital. See Notes Six and Seven of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.

   During 1996, the Corporation repurchased approximately 26.7 million shares of
its outstanding common stock. Of this amount, 15.2 million shares were
repurchased primarily to meet the anticipated needs of the Corporation's
employee stock option and incentive plans and were part of a buy-back program
that terminated at September 30, 1996. The remaining 11.5 million shares were
repurchased in the 1996 fourth quarter as part of a new stock repurchase program
announced in October 1996.



                                                 THE CHASE MANHATTAN CORPORATION
                                                                AND SUBSIDIARIES


                         [GRAPH 15 - SEE APPENDIX I]


   The October 1996 common stock repurchase program enables the Corporation to
purchase up to $2.5 billion of its common stock until December 31, 1998, in
addition to such other number of common shares as may be necessary to provide
for expected issuances under its dividend reinvestment plan and its various
stock-based director and employee benefits plans. The Corporation repurchased $1
billion of its common equity during the fourth quarter of 1996. In early 1997,
management announced that it intended to purchase equity on a more accelerated
time schedule than previously expected and, therefore, management believes it is
likely that the buy-back program will be completed in late 1997 or early 1998.

   The Corporation raised the cash dividend on its common stock by 12%, to $.56
per share, in the first quarter of 1996. Management currently expects the
Corporation to pay a common stock dividend equal to approximately 25%-35% of the
Corporation's net income (excluding restructuring costs) less preferred stock
dividends. Future dividend policies will be determined by the Board of Directors
in light of the earnings and financial condition of the Corporation and its
subsidiaries and other factors, including applicable governmental regulations
and policies.

   Total stockholders' equity at December 31, 1996 was $21.0 billion, compared
with $20.8 billion at December 31, 1995. The slight increase from 1995 reflects
net income of $2,461 million generated during 1996 partially offset by common
and preferred stock dividends totaling $1,280 million, and the impact of the
Corporation's common stock buy-back programs, net of reissuances, in the amount
of $798 million.

LIQUIDITY

The objective of liquidity management is to ensure the availability of
sufficient cash flows to meet all of the Corporation's financial commitments and
to capitalize on opportunities for the Corporation's business expansion.
Liquidity management addresses the Corporation's ability to meet deposit
withdrawals either on demand or at contractual maturity, to repay borrowings as
they mature, and to make new loans and investments as opportunities arise.
Liquidity is managed on a daily basis at both the parent company and the
subsidiary levels, enabling senior management to monitor effectively changes in
liquidity and to react accordingly to fluctuations in market conditions.
Contingency plans exist and could be implemented on a timely basis to minimize
the risk associated with dramatic changes in market conditions.

   In managing liquidity, the Corporation takes into account the various legal
limitations on the extent to which banks may pay dividends to their parent
companies or finance or otherwise supply funds to certain of their affiliates.

   The primary source of liquidity for the bank subsidiaries of the Corporation
derives from their ability to generate core deposits. The Corporation considers
funds from such sources to comprise its subsidiary banks' "core" deposit base
because of the historical stability of such sources of funds. These deposits
fund a portion of the Corporation's asset base, thereby reducing the
Corporation's reliance on other, more volatile, sources of funds. The
Corporation's average core deposits for 1996 were $78 billion, or 52% of average
loans.

   The Corporation holds marketable securities and other short-term investments
that can be readily converted to cash. As part of the Corporation's ongoing
capital management process, loan syndication networks and retail securitization
programs are maintained in order to facilitate the timely disposition of assets,
if and when deemed desirable.

   The Corporation is an active participant in the capital markets and issues
commercial paper, medium-term notes, long-term debt, common stock and preferred
stock.

   The slight decrease in long-term debt during 1996 resulted primarily from
maturities of $1,433 million of the Corporation's long-term debt (including $997
million of senior medium-term notes, $365 million of other senior notes and $71
million of subordinated notes) and the redemption of $20 million of senior
medium-term notes. These decreases were partially offset by additions to the
Corporation's long-term debt of $1,291 million (including $650 million of senior
medium-term notes, $75 million of subordinated medium-term notes, $366 million
of other senior notes and $200 million of other subordinated notes). The
Corporation will continue to evaluate the opportunity for future redemptions of
its outstanding debt and preferred stock in light of current market conditions.
The Corporation has approximately $1.1 billion of fixed-rate preferred stock
which becomes callable in 1997.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS


   ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTS



ACCOUNTING FOR TRANSFERS AND SERVICING OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND EXTINGUISHMENTS
OF LIABILITIES
 
In June 1996, the FASB issued SFAS 125 which provides standards
for distinguishing between transfers of financial assets that are sales from
transfers that are secured borrowings.

   As issued, SFAS 125 is effective for transfers and servicing of financial
assets and extinguishments of liabilities occurring after December 31, 1996.
However, in December 1996, the FASB issued SFAS 127 which deferred for one year
the effective date of SFAS 125 as applied to securities lending, repurchase
agreements and other secured financing transactions. The Corporation adopted the
requirements of SFAS 125 commencing January 1, 1997 for the following types of
transactions: securitizations, recognitions of servicing assets and liabilities,
transfers of receivables with recourse, loan participations, and extinguishments
of liabilities. The Corporation believes that the adoption of SFAS 125 will not
significantly affect the Corporation's earnings, liquidity, or capital
resources.

DERIVATIVE AND MARKET RISK DISCLOSURES

In January 1997, the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") issued Release
Nos. 33-7386 and 34-38223 which requires (i) quantitative and qualitative
disclosures outside the financial statements about the market risk inherent in
derivatives and other financial instruments and (ii) enhanced descriptions of
accounting policies for derivatives in the footnotes to the financial
statements.

   The market risk disclosure requirements of this release will be applicable
commencing with the Corporation's 1997 annual report. The Corporation is
currently evaluating this release and expects to comply with the requirements of
the release in its 1997 annual report.


   COMPARISON BETWEEN 1995 AND 1994



OPERATING HIGHLIGHTS

The Corporation reported net income of $2,959 million in 1995, compared with
$2,486 million in 1994. Primary earnings per share were $6.20 in 1995, an
increase from $5.02 in 1994. On a fully-diluted basis, earnings per share were
$6.04 in 1995, compared with $4.97 for the prior year.

   Net income on an operating basis was $2,903 million in 1995, an increase of
12% from comparable earnings of $2,589 million in 1994. Primary earnings per
share on a operating basis were $6.07 in 1995, an increase of 15% from $5.26 in
1994, while fully-diluted earnings per share were $5.92 in 1995, compared with
$5.20 for the prior year.

NET INTEREST INCOME

The Corporation's net interest income was $8,202 million in 1995, compared with
$8,312 million in 1994. Excluding, in 1995, the impact of securitizations ($94
million) and the sale of Chemical New Jersey Holdings, Inc. ($33 million), the
improvement was primarily due to an increase in interest-earning assets and
higher trading-related net interest income, partially offset by narrower
spreads. Average interest-earning assets were $244.5 billion in 1995, compared
with $227.3 billion in 1994, reflecting an increase led by growth in consumer
loans and commercial lending.

PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES AND NET CHARGE-OFFS

The provision for credit losses in 1995 was $758 million, compared with $1,050
million in 1994, a decline of 28%. Net charge-offs were $840 million compared
with $1,612 million in 1994, a decline of 48%, reflecting a significant
improvement in the Corporation's credit quality and an increase in commercial
loan recoveries. The 1994 net charge-off amount of $1,612 million included a
$148 million charge related to the decision to designate certain assets as held
for accelerated disposition as well as a $291 million charge incurred in
connection with management's final valuation of its emerging markets portfolio.

NONINTEREST REVENUE

Noninterest revenue totaled $6,758 million in 1995, a $57 million increase
compared with 1994, reflecting higher fees and commissions, principally from
corporate finance and syndication activities and credit card revenue, partially
offset by lower other revenue.

   Corporate finance and syndication fees in 1995 were $796 million, a 34%
increase from the prior year, principally reflecting increases in global
investment banking activities, especially loan syndications and new issues of
high-yield securities.

   Trust, custody and investment management fees in 1995 declined 4% from the
1994 level, largely due to the absence of $46 million in fees related to the
joint venture with Mellon Bank Corporation, which was recorded on an equity
basis within other revenue in 1995.

   Credit card revenue increased $80 million from 1994 due to a growing
cardholder base and increased fees related to securitizations.



                                                 THE CHASE MANHATTAN CORPORATION
                                                                AND SUBSIDIARIES


   Fees for other financial services for 1995 were $1,453 million, an increase
of $40 million from 1994, primarily due to increased mortgage servicing fees
reflecting higher volume from the acquisitions of Margaretten Financial
Corporation ("Margaretten") in July 1994, and American Residential Holding
Corporation ("AmRes") in September 1994, as well as additions to the portfolio
from mortgage originations.

   Trading-related revenue (which includes net interest income attributable to
trading activities) in 1995 increased 9% from the prior year, benefitting from
anticipated volatility in the currency markets and from the Corporation's
market-making activities. The 1994 results included a $70 million loss from
unauthorized foreign exchange transactions involving the Mexican peso.

   Securities gains were $132 million in 1995, an increase of $67 million from
1994, resulting from the Corporation's ALM activities.

   Revenue from Equity-Related Investments in 1995 increased by $49 million from
the 1994 level reflecting the continuing benefits of a broad-based portfolio of
investments in an active market.

   The Corporation's other noninterest revenue for 1995 was $466 million,
compared with $662 million in 1994. Other revenue declined in 1995 primarily due
to the absence of gains related to the disposition of emerging markets
securities that were included in the 1994 results.

NONINTEREST EXPENSE

Noninterest expense in 1995 was $9,390 million, compared with $10,002 million in
1994. Included in the results for 1994 was a $260 million restructuring charge,
taken in connection with a program to improve earnings per share, a $48 million
restructuring charge related to the closing of 50 New York branches, and a
charge of $157 million related to productivity initiatives. For a further
discussion regarding the restructuring charges taken by the Corporation during
1995 and 1994, see Note Eleven of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements.

   Excluding restructuring charges and foreclosed property expense in both
years, noninterest expense for 1995 decreased by $37 million, when compared with
the prior year. The improvement in 1995 reflects the benefits of pre-merger
expense-reduction initiatives, a reduction in the FDIC assessment rate, the sale
of certain New Jersey banking operations, and the shareholder services joint
venture with Mellon Bank Corporation. These declines were partially offset by a
full year of noninterest expense relating to the acquisitions of Margaretten and
AmRes, and the 1995 acquisition of the U.S. Trust processing business.

   Salaries and employee benefits expenses in 1995 were $5,107 million, compared
with $4,861 million in 1994. The increase in 1995 was primarily due to higher
incentives related to improved earnings in most businesses, additional staff
costs resulting from business acquisitions, the vesting of certain stock-based
incentive awards due to improved stock prices, and the continued growth in the
Corporation's securities underwriting business. Partially offsetting these
increases were the impact of personnel reductions undertaken in 1995.

   Occupancy expense declined $71 million from 1994 largely resulting from the
consolidation of operational and branch facilities and other expense-reduction
initiatives.

   Equipment expense in 1995 was $755 million, an increase of $31 million,
principally due to continued technology enhancements to support the
Corporation's investments in certain key businesses.

   Foreclosed property expense was a credit of $75 million in 1995, compared
with an expense of $50 million in 1994, reflecting the significant progress made
in reducing the Corporation's real estate portfolio. The 1995 amount included
gains recorded on the sale of certain foreclosed properties.

   For 1995, other expense was $2,691 million, a decrease of $243 million from
the 1994 level. The decrease reflected a reduction in the FDIC assessment rate
during 1995 and an 11% decrease in all other expense due to expense reduction
initiatives, partially offset by higher telecommunications expense.

INCOME TAXES

The Corporation recorded income tax expense of $1,842 million in 1995 compared
with $1,475 million in 1994. The effective tax rate was 38.3% in 1995 compared
with 39.0% in 1994, after excluding $70 million of tax benefits recognized in
1994.



Management's Report on Responsibility for Financial Reporting

TO OUR STOCKHOLDERS

The management of The Chase Manhattan Corporation and its subsidiaries has the
responsibility for preparing the accompanying consolidated financial statements
and for their integrity and objectivity. The statements were prepared in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The consolidated
financial statements include amounts that are based on management's best
estimates and judgments. Management also prepared the other information in the
annual report and is responsible for its accuracy and consistency with the
consolidated financial statements.

  Management maintains a comprehensive system of internal control to assure the
proper authorization of transactions, the safeguarding of assets, and the
reliability of the financial records. The system of internal control provides
for appropriate division of responsibility and is documented by written policies
and procedures that are communicated to employees. The Corporation maintains a
strong internal auditing program that independently assesses the effectiveness
of the system of internal control and recommends possible improvements thereto.
Management believes that as of December 31, 1996, the Corporation maintains an
effective system of internal control.

  The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors reviews the systems of internal
control and financial reporting. The Committee meets and consults regularly with
management, the internal auditors and the independent accountants to review the
scope and results of their work.

  The accounting firm of Price Waterhouse LLP has performed an independent audit
of the Corporation's financial statements. Management has made available to
Price Waterhouse LLP all of the Corporation's financial records and related
data, as well as the minutes of stockholders' and directors' meetings.

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of The Chase Manhattan Corporation:
In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheet and the related
consolidated statements of income, of changes in stockholders' equity and of
cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
The Chase Manhattan Corporation and its subsidiaries at December 31, 1996 and
1995, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 1996, in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Corporation's management. Our responsibility is to express
an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our
audits of these statements in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards which require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for the opinion expressed above.

1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

On March 31, 1996, The Chase Manhattan Corporation ("Chase") merged (the
"Merger") with and into Chemical Banking Corporation ("Chemical"). Upon
consummation of the Merger, Chemical changed its name to "The Chase Manhattan
Corporation" (the "Corporation"). Under the terms of the merger agreement, 183
million shares of the Corporation's common stock were issued in exchange for all
of the outstanding shares of Chase's common stock (based on an exchange ratio of
1.04 shares of the Corporation's common stock for each share of Chase's common
stock). All of Chase's series of preferred stock were exchanged on a one-for-one
basis for a corresponding series of the Corporation's preferred stock having
substantially the same terms as the Chase preferred stock so converted. The
Merger was accounted for as a pooling of interests and, accordingly, the
information included in the financial statements presents the combined results
of Chase and Chemical as if the Merger had been in effect for all periods
presented. In addition, on July 14, 1996, The Chase Manhattan Bank, N.A., a
national bank, merged with and into Chemical Bank, a New York State bank, and
Chemical Bank changed its name to "The Chase Manhattan Bank." Certain amounts
have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation.

   The Corporation provides diversified financial services principally through
its two major franchises, Global Wholesale Banking and Regional and Nationwide
Consumer Banking. Global Wholesale Banking provides investment banking,
financial advisory, trading, investment services and information and transaction
services to corporations and public-sector clients worldwide. Regional and
Nationwide Consumer Banking serves the financial needs of consumers, middle
market, commercial enterprises and small businesses.

   The Corporation conducts its domestic and international financial services
businesses through various bank and nonbank subsidiaries. The principal bank
subsidiaries of the Corporation are The Chase Manhattan Bank, a New York State
bank headquartered in New York City, Texas Commerce Bank National Association
("Texas Commerce"), a national bank headquartered in Texas and Chase Manhattan
Bank USA National Association ("Chase USA"), a national bank headquartered in
Delaware. The principal nonbank subsidiary of the Corporation is Chase
Securities Inc.

   The accounting and financial reporting policies of the Corporation and its
subsidiaries conform to generally accepted accounting principles and prevailing
industry practices and, where applicable, the accounting and reporting
guidelines prescribed by bank regulatory authorities. The preparation of
financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of
revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The following is a
description of significant accounting policies.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
BASIS OF PRESENTATION

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Corporation
and its majority-owned subsidiaries, after eliminating intercompany balances and
transactions. Equity investments in less than majority-owned companies (20%-50%
ownership interest) are generally accounted for in accordance with the equity
method of accounting and are reported in Other Assets. The Corporation's
pro-rata share of earnings (losses) of these companies is included in Other
Revenue.

   Assets held in an agency or fiduciary capacity by commercial banking
subsidiaries and by trust and investment advisory subsidiaries are not assets of
the Corporation and, accordingly, are not included in the Consolidated Balance
Sheet.
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TRADING ACTIVITIES

The Corporation trades debt and equity instruments and risk management
instruments, as discussed below. These instruments are carried at their
estimated fair value. Quoted market prices, when available, are used as the
basis to determine the fair value of trading instruments. If quoted market
prices are not available, then fair values are estimated on the basis of pricing
models, quoted prices of instruments with similar characteristics, or discounted
cash flows.

   Realized and unrealized gains (losses) on these instruments are recognized in
Trading Revenue. The portion of the market valuation of risk management
instruments attributable to credit considerations as well as ongoing direct
servicing costs is deferred and accreted to income over the life of the
instruments, as appropriate. Interest earned on debt and dividends earned on
equity instruments and interest payable on securities sold but not yet purchased
are reported as interest income and interest expense, respectively.

Debt and Equity Instruments; Securities Sold, Not Yet Purchased; and Structured
Notes: Debt and equity instruments which includes securities, loans, and other
credit instruments held for trading purposes are reported as Trading Assets.
Obligations to deliver securities sold but not yet purchased and structured
notes issued by the Corporation are reported as Trading Liabilities.

Risk Management Instruments: The Corporation primarily deals in interest rate,
foreign exchange, precious metals and commodity contracts to generate trading
revenues. Such contracts include futures, forwards, forward rate agreements,
swaps, and options (including interest rate caps and floors). The estimated fair
values of such contracts are reported on a gross basis as Trading Assets-Risk
Management Instruments (positive fair values) and Trading Liabilities (negative
fair values), except for contracts executed with the same counterparty under
legally enforceable master netting agreements, which are presented on a net
basis.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DERIVATIVES USED IN ASSET/LIABILITY MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES

As part of its asset/liability management ("ALM") activities, the Corporation
predominantly uses interest rate swaps and futures and, to a lesser degree,
forward rate agreements and option contracts (including interest rate caps and
floors) to hedge exposures or to modify the interest rate characteristics of
related balance sheet instruments. Derivative contracts used for ALM activities
have high correlation between the derivatives contract and the item being
hedged, both at inception and throughout the hedge period; and are linked to
specific assets or groups of similar assets or specific liabilities or groups of
similar liabilities. For futures contracts only, a risk reduction criteria is
also required.

   The instruments that meet the above criteria are accounted for under the
accrual method or available-for-sale fair value method, as discussed below.

Accrual Method: Under the accrual method, interest income or expense on
derivative contracts is accrued and there is no recognition of unrealized gains
and losses on the derivatives in the balance sheet. Premiums on option contracts
are amortized to interest income, interest expense or noninterest revenue over
the life of such contracts.

Available-for-Sale Fair Value Method: Derivatives linked to available-for-sale
securities are carried at fair value. The accrual of interest receivable or
interest payable on these derivatives is reported in Interest Income on
Securities. Changes in the market values of these derivatives, exclusive of net
interest accruals, are reported, net of applicable taxes, in Stockholders'
Equity consistent with the reporting of unrealized gains and losses on the
related securities.

   For both the accrual and available-for-sale fair value method, realized gains
and losses from the settlement or termination of derivative contracts are
deferred on the balance sheet and are amortized to interest income, interest
expense and noninterest revenue over the appropriate risk management periods.
Amortization commences when the contract is settled or terminated. If the
related assets or liabilities are sold or otherwise disposed, then the deferred
gains or losses on the derivative contract is recognized as an adjustment to the
gain or loss on disposition of the related assets or liabilities.

   Prior to January 1, 1995, the Corporation used interest rate swaps in place
of cash market instruments. Effective January 1, 1995, this practice was
discontinued. Accordingly, interest rate contracts entered into subsequent to
January 1, 1995 that do not meet the criteria described above are designated as
trading activities and are accounted for at estimated fair value.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
RESALE AND REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS

The Corporation enters into short-term purchases of securities under agreements
to resell (resale agreements) and sales of securities under agreements to
repurchase (repurchase agreements) of substantially identical securities. The
amounts advanced under resale agreements and the amounts borrowed under
repurchase agreements are carried on the balance sheet at the amount advanced or
borrowed plus accrued interest. Interest earned on resale agreements and
interest incurred on repurchase agreements are reported as interest income and
interest expense, respectively. The Corporation offsets resale and repurchase
agreements executed with the same counterparty under legally enforceable netting
agreements that meet the applicable netting criteria. During 1996, the maximum
month-end balances of outstanding resale and repurchase agreements,
respectively, were $35,244 million and $53,961 million. The average amounts of
outstanding resale and repurchase agreements were $34,963 million and $53,072
million, respectively. Averages were calculated on daily outstandings.

   It is the Corporation's policy to take possession of securities purchased
under resale agreements. The Corporation monitors the market value of securities
and adjusts the level of collateral for resale and repurchase agreements, as
appropriate.
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SECURITIES

Securities that may be sold in response to or in anticipation of changes in
interest rates and resulting prepayment risk, or other factors, are classified
as Available-for-Sale and are carried at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses
on these securities, along with any unrealized gains and losses on related
derivatives, are reported, net of applicable taxes, in Stockholders' Equity.
Securities that the Corporation has the positive intent and ability to hold to
maturity are classified as Held-to-Maturity and are carried at amortized cost.

   Interest and dividend income on securities, including amortization of
premiums and accretion of discounts, are reported in Interest Income on
Securities. Interest income is recognized using the interest method. The
specific identification method is used to determine realized gains and losses on
sales of securities, which are reported in Securities Gains. The carrying value
of individual securities is reduced through writedowns against Securities Gains
to reflect other-than-temporary impairments in value.

   The Corporation anticipates prepayments of principal in the calculation of
the effective yield for collateralized mortgage obligations ("CMOs") and
mortgage-backed securities ("MBSs"). The prepayment of CMOs and MBSs is actively
monitored through the Corporation's portfolio management function. The
Corporation typically invests in CMOs and MBSs with stable cash flows, thereby
limiting the impact of interest rate fluctuations on the portfolio. Management
regularly does simulation testing regarding the impact that interest and market
rate changes would have on its CMO and MBS portfolios. CMOs and MBSs that
management believes have high prepayment risk are included in the
available-for-sale portfolio.



                                                 THE CHASE MANHATTAN CORPORATION
                                                                AND SUBSIDIARIES

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
LOANS

Loans are generally reported at the principal amount outstanding, net of the
allowance for loan losses, unearned income and net deferred loan fees
(nonrefundable yield-related loan fees, net of related direct origination
costs), if any. Loans held for sale are carried at the lower of aggregate cost
or fair value. Certain loans meeting the accounting definition of a security are
classified as loans but are measured pursuant to SFAS 115. Interest income is
recognized using the interest method or on a basis approximating a level rate of
return over the term of the loan.

   The Corporation sells or securitizes certain commercial and consumer loans.
Such sales are generally without recourse to the Corporation. A limited number
of assets are sold with recourse for which appropriate reserves are provided.
Gains and losses are reported in Other Revenue.

   Nonaccrual loans are those loans on which the accrual of interest has ceased.
Loans, other than certain consumer loans discussed below, are placed on
nonaccrual status immediately if, in the opinion of management, principal or
interest is not likely to be paid in accordance with the terms of the loan
agreement, or when principal or interest is past due 90 days or more and
collateral, if any, is insufficient to cover principal and interest. Interest
accrued but not collected at the date a loan is placed on nonaccrual status is
reversed against interest income. In addition, the amortization of net deferred
loan fees is suspended when a loan is placed on nonaccrual status. Interest
income on nonaccrual loans is recognized only to the extent received in cash.
However, where there is doubt regarding the ultimate collectibility of the loan
principal, cash receipts, whether designated as principal or interest, are
thereafter applied to reduce the carrying value of the loan. Loans are restored
to accrual status only when interest and principal payments are brought current
and future payments are reasonably assured.

   Consumer loans (exclusive of residential mortgage products which are
accounted for in accordance with the nonaccrual loan policy discussed above) are
generally charged to the allowance for loan losses upon reaching specified
stages of delinquency. Credit card loans, for example, are charged-off at the
earlier of 180 days past due or 75 days after notification of the filing of
bankruptcy. Other consumer products are generally charged-off at 120 days past
due. Accrued interest is reversed against interest income when such consumer
loans are charged-off.

   Loans are considered impaired loans when, based on current information, it is
probable that the borrower will be unable to pay contractual interest or
principal payments as scheduled in the loan agreement. The Corporation accounts
for and discloses nonaccrual commercial loans as impaired but excludes
small-balance homogeneous consumer loans, loans carried at fair value or the
lower of cost or fair value, debt securities, and leases. Impaired loans are
carried at the present value of the future cash flows discounted at the loan's
effective interest rate or, as a practical expedient, at the loan's observable
market price or the fair value of the collateral, if the loan is collateral
dependent. The Corporation recognizes interest income on impaired loans pursuant
to the discussion above for nonaccrual loans.

   A collateralized loan is considered an in-substance foreclosure and is
reclassified to Assets Acquired as Loan Satisfactions only when the Corporation
has taken physical possession of the collateral regardless of whether formal
foreclosure proceedings have taken place.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES

The allowance for credit losses provides for risks of losses inherent in the
credit extension process. The allowance is a general allowance and is based on
periodic reviews and analyses of the portfolio, which comprises primarily loans,
derivatives and foreign exchange contracts, and letters of credit and
guarantees. The periodic analyses include consideration of such factors as the
risk rating of individual credits, the size and diversity of the portfolio,
economic and political conditions, prior loss experience and results of periodic
credit reviews of the portfolio. The allowance for credit losses is increased by
provisions for credit losses charged against income and is reduced by
charge-offs, net of recoveries. Charge-offs are recorded when, in the judgment
of management, an extension of credit is deemed uncollectible, in whole or in
part.

   As of December 31, 1996, in accordance with the AICPA's Audit and Accounting
Guide for Banks and Savings Institutions, the allowance for credit losses has
been allocated into three components: an allowance for loan losses, which is
reported net in Loans; an allowance for credit losses on derivative and foreign
exchange financial instruments, which is reported net in Trading Assets - Risk
Management Instruments; and an allowance for credit losses on letters of credit
and guarantees, which is reported in Other Liabilities. Prior period amounts
have not been reclassified due to immateriality. The Corporation still views the
aggregate allowance for credit losses to be available for all credit activities.
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PREMISES AND EQUIPMENT

Premises and equipment, including leasehold improvements, are carried at cost
less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Capital leases are included in
premises and equipment at the capitalized amount less accumulated amortization.
Depreciation and amortization of premises are included in Occupancy Expense,
while depreciation of equipment is included in Equipment Expense. Depreciation
and amortization are computed using the straight-line method over the estimated
useful life of the owned asset and, for leasehold improvements, over the
estimated useful life of the related asset or the lease term, whichever is
shorter. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred, while major
improvements are capitalized.
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

OTHER ASSETS

Assets Acquired as Loan Satisfactions: Assets acquired in full or partial
satisfaction of loans are reported at the lower of cost or estimated fair value
less costs to sell. These assets are primarily real estate. Writedowns at the
date of transfer from Loans to Assets 



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Acquired as Loan Satisfactions and within six months after the date of transfer
are charged to the Allowance for Credit Losses. Writedowns of such assets
subsequent to six months from the date of transfer are included in Foreclosed
Property Expense. Operating expenses, net of related revenue, and gains and
losses on sales of such assets are reported net in Foreclosed Property Expense.

Assets Held for Accelerated Disposition: These assets consist primarily of real
estate loans and real estate assets acquired as loan satisfactions. At the date
of transfer to the accelerated disposition portfolio, these assets are recorded
at their initial estimated disposition value less costs to sell. Subsequently,
assets held for accelerated disposition are carried at the lower of cost or
current estimated disposition value. Cash interest income received from these
assets is recognized either in income or applied to reduce the carrying value of
loans depending on management's judgment of collectibility. Any adjustments to
the carrying value of these assets or realized gains and losses as assets are
sold are reported in Other Revenue.

Equity and Equity-Related Investments: Equity and equity-related investments
include venture capital activities and emerging markets investments.
Nonmarketable holdings are carried at cost, net of other-than-temporary
impairment losses. Marketable holdings are marked-to-market at a discount to the
public value. Income from these investments is reported in Revenue from
Equity-Related Investments.

Intangibles: Goodwill and other acquired intangibles, such as core deposits and
credit card relationships, are amortized over the estimated periods to be
benefited generally ranging from 10 to 25 years. An impairment review is
performed periodically on these assets.

Mortgage Servicing Rights: Capitalized mortgage servicing assets consist of both
purchased and originated servicing rights. These rights are amortized into Fees
for Other Financial Services in proportion to, and over the period of, the
estimated future net servicing income stream of the underlying mortgage loans.
The Corporation's policy for assessing impairment of these rights is based on
their fair values and is evaluated by stratifying the mortgage servicing rights
by interest rate bands. Fair value is determined considering market prices for
similar assets or based on discounted cash flows using market-based prepayment
estimates for similar coupons and incremental direct and indirect costs.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FEE-BASED REVENUE

Corporate finance and syndication fees primarily include fees received for
managing and syndicating loan arrangements; providing financial advisory
services in connection with leveraged buyouts, recapitalizations, and mergers
and acquisitions; arranging private placements; and underwriting debt and equity
securities. Corporate finance and syndication fees are recognized when the
services to which they relate have been provided. In addition, recognition of
syndication fees is subject to certain tests being satisfied.

   Trust, custody and investment management fees primarily include fees received
in connection with personal, corporate, and employee benefit trust and
investment management activities. Fees for other financial services primarily
include fees received in connection with mortgage servicing, loan commitments,
standby letters of credit, compensating balances and brokerage and other fees.
Trust, custody and investment management fees and fees for other financial
services are generally recognized over the period the related service is
provided.

   Credit card revenues primarily include fees received in connection with
credit card activities such as annual, late payment, cash advance and
interchange fees, as well as servicing fees earned in connection with
securitization activities. Credit card revenues are generally recognized as
billed, except for annual fees, which are recognized over a twelve-month period.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
INCOME TAXES

The Corporation recognizes both the current and deferred tax consequences of all
transactions that have been recognized in the financial statements. Calculations
are based on the provisions of enacted tax laws and the tax rates in effect for
current and future years. The deferred tax liability (asset) is determined based
on enacted tax rates which will be in effect when the underlying items of income
and expense are expected to be reported to the taxing authorities. Net deferred
tax assets, whose realization is dependent on taxable earnings of future years,
are recognized when a more-likely-than-not criterion is met. Annual deferred tax
expense (benefit) is equal to the change in the deferred tax liability (asset)
account from the beginning to the end of the year. A current tax liability
(asset) is recognized for the estimated taxes payable or refundable for the
current year.
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

EARNINGS PER SHARE

Primary earnings per share is computed by dividing net income after deducting
preferred stock dividends by average common and common equivalent shares
outstanding, which reflect the dilutive effect of stock options and warrants
during the period. The dilutive effect of stock options and warrants is computed
under the treasury stock method using the average market price of the
Corporation's common stock for the period.

   Earnings per common share, assuming full dilution, is computed based on the
average number of common shares outstanding during the period, plus the dilutive
effect of stock options, warrants, and any convertible preferred stock
outstanding during the period. The dilutive effect of outstanding stock options
and warrants is computed using the greater of the closing market price or the
average market price of the Corporation's common stock for the period. Any stock
options or warrants exercised or any preferred stock converted are assumed to
have occurred at the beginning of the period. Net income applicable to common
stock is adjusted for dividends on the convertible preferred stock for the
period.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION
Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated to U.S.
dollars using prevailing rates of exchange. Gains and losses on foreign currency
translation from operations for which the functional currency is other than the
U.S. dollar, together with related hedges and tax effects, are reported in
Stockholders' Equity. For foreign operations for which the U.S. dollar is the
functional currency, gains and losses resulting from converting foreign currency
assets and liabilities to the U.S. dollar, including the related hedges, are
reported in the Income Statement.
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS
For purposes of preparing the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, the
Corporation defines cash and cash equivalents as those amounts included in the
balance sheet caption Cash and Due from Banks. Cash flows from loans and
deposits are reported on a net basis.


2 - TRADING ACTIVITIES                         

The Corporation uses its trading assets and liabilities to meet the financial
needs of its customers and to generate revenue through its trading activities.
The Corporation generates trading revenue through market-making, sales,
arbitrage and, to a lesser degree, positioning. A description of the various
classes of derivative and foreign exchange instruments used in the Corporation's
trading activities as well as the credit and market risk factors involved in its
trading activities are disclosed in Note Seventeen.
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TRADING REVENUE

The following table sets forth the components of total trading-related revenue.



(a) Net interest income attributable to trading activities includes interest
recognized on interest-earning and interest-bearing trading-related positions as
well as management allocations reflecting the funding cost or benefit associated
with trading positions. This amount is included in the net interest income
caption on the Consolidated Statement of Income. 
(b) Includes interest rate swaps, cross-currency interest rate swaps, foreign
exchange forward contracts, interest rate futures, and forward rate agreements
and related hedges.
(c) Includes foreign exchange spot and option contracts.
(d) Includes U.S. and foreign government and government agency securities,
corporate debt securities, emerging markets debt instruments, debt-related
derivatives, equity securities, equity derivatives, and commodity derivatives.
(e) Reflects $70 million reduction as a result of losses sustained from
unauthorized foreign exchange transactions involving the Mexican peso.

TRADING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES

The following table presents trading assets and trading liabilities for the
dates indicated.



(a) Includes emerging markets instruments of $5,500 million in 1996 and $3,654
million in 1995.

   Average trading assets and average trading liabilities were as follows for
the periods indicated.




3 - SECURITIES
                 
See Note One for a discussion of the accounting policies relating to securities.
Cash proceeds from the sale of available-for-sale securities during 1996, 1995
and 1994 were $44,194 million, $54,290 million and $23,086 million,
respectively. Net gains from available-for-sale securities sold in 1996, 1995
and 1994 amounted to $135 million (gross gains of $281 million and gross losses
of $146 million), $130 million (gross gains of $570 million and gross losses of
$440 million) and $65 million (gross gains of $157 million and gross losses of
$92 million), respectively. There 



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

were no sales of held-to-maturity securities during the three years ended
December 31, 1996. During 1995, early redemption of certain held-to-maturity
securities by their issuers resulted in a $2 million gain.

   In accordance with the adoption of a SFAS 115 Implementation Guide, the
Corporation reassessed the classification of all securities held during 1995.
The result of the one-time reassessment was the reclassification of $4.7 billion
of held-to-maturity securities to available-for-sale securities and $11 million
of held-to-maturity securities to trading assets. Unrealized net gains related
to the transfer of held-to-maturity securities to available-for-sale securities
were $21 million after-tax. The amortized cost of held-to-maturity securities
transferred to trading assets approximated the fair value.

   The amortized cost and estimated fair value of available-for-sale securities
and held-to-maturity securities, including the impact of related derivatives,
were as follows for the dates indicated:

                      

(a) Includes collateralized mortgage obligations of private issuers which
generally have underlying collateral consisting of obligations of U.S.
Government and Federal agencies and corporations. See Note One for further
discussion.

   The amortized cost, estimated fair value, and average yield at December 31,
1996 of the Corporation's available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities by
contractual maturity range are presented in the following table.

                                                                     

(a) The average yield is based on amortized cost balances at the end of the
year. Yields are derived by dividing interest income, adjusted for the effect of
related derivatives on available-for-sale securities and the amortization of
premiums and accretion of discounts, by total amortized cost. Taxable-equivalent
yields are used where applicable. 
(b) Securities with no stated maturity are included with securities with a
remaining maturity of ten years or more. Substantially all of the Corporation's
MBSs and CMOs are due in ten years or more based on contractual maturity. The
estimated duration, which reflects anticipated future prepayments based on a
consensus of dealers in the market, is approximately 5 years for MBSs, and less
than 1 year for CMOs.

4 - LOANS

The composition of the loan portfolio at each of the dates indicated was as
follows:



   Bonds that have been issued by foreign governments (such as Mexico, Venezuela
and Brazil) to financial institutions, including the Corporation, as part of a
debt renegotiation (i.e., "Brady Bonds") are classified as loans but are subject
to the provisions of SFAS 115.

   As a result of the reassessment of the portfolio in connection with the
adoption of the SFAS 115 Implementation Guide, the entire held-to-maturity
portfolio of Brady Bonds, other loans, and related derivatives (measured
pursuant to SFAS 115) were reclassified to the available-for-sale category in
1995. The amount of the reclassification was $1,972 million at amortized cost.
Unrealized net losses related to the transfer were $454 million, after-tax.

   A significant portion of the Brady Bonds are collateralized by zero-coupon
U.S. Treasury obligations. Up to two-years' interest on Brady Bonds is also
collateralized by U.S. Treasury obligations. Management continually evaluates
and monitors the ability of the foreign governments to meet their obligations
under the Brady Bonds that they have issued and that are included in the
portfolio, and believes that any unrealized losses on these securities are
temporary in nature.

   The amortized cost and estimated fair value of loans measured pursuant to
SFAS 115 (which are all available-for-sale), including the impact of related
derivatives, for the dates indicated were as follows:



   The 1996 results included a net loss of $80 million (gross gains of $155
million and gross losses of $235 million) related to the disposition of emerging
market securities. The 1995 results included a net loss of $49 million (gross
gains of $204 million and gross losses of $253 million) on the disposition of
emerging market securities. A net gain of $233 million (gross gains of $348
million and gross losses of $115 million) was recorded on the disposition of
emerging market securities in 1994. Cash proceeds from the sales of these
available-for-sale loans during 1996, 1995 and 1994 were $952 million, $1,193
million and $1,079 million, respectively.

IMPAIRED LOANS

The following table sets forth information about the Corporation's impaired
loans. The Corporation uses the discounted cash flow method as its primary
method for valuing its impaired loans.




(a) Impaired loans for which the discounted cash flows, collateral value or
market price equals or exceeds the carrying value of the loan. Such loans do not
require an allowance under SFAS 114. 
(b) The allowance for impaired loans under SFAS 114 is a part of the
Corporation's overall Allowance for Loan Losses.


                                

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

5 - ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES

The table below summarizes the changes in the allowance for loan losses.



(a) During the 1996 first quarter, the Corporation incurred a charge of $102
million as a result of conforming its credit card charge-off policies. 
(b) Includes $28 million related to the sale of banking operations in southern
and central New Jersey.

6 - LONG-TERM DEBT                     

The following table is a summary of long-term debt (net of unamortized original
issue debt discount, where applicable) displayed by remaining maturity at
December 31, 1996.



(a) Remaining maturity is based on contractual maturity of the debt. 
(b) The interest rates shown have been adjusted to reflect the effect of ALM
derivative contracts, primarily interest rate swaps, used to convert the
Corporation's fixed-rate debt to variable rates. The interest rates shown for
variable-rate issues, including those fixed-rate issues converted to
variable-rate, are those in effect at December 31, 1996. 
(c) At December 31, 1996, long-term debt aggregating $2.2 billion was redeemable
at the option of the Corporation, in whole or in part, prior to maturity, based
on the terms specified in their respective notes. The aggregate principal amount
of debt that matures in each of the five years subsequent to December 31, 1996
are $1,518 million in 1997, $1,131 million in 1998, $1,596 million in 1999,
$1,644 million in 2000, and $985 million in 2001.


                                                 THE CHASE MANHATTAN CORPORATION
                                                                AND SUBSIDIARIES


   The Corporation issues long-term debt denominated in various currencies,
although predominately in U.S. dollars, with both fixed and variable interest
rates.

   Fixed-rate debt outstanding at December 31, 1996 mature at various dates
through 2013 and carry contractual interest rates ranging from 4.00% to 11.83%.
The consolidated weighted-average interest rates on fixed-rate debt at December
31, 1996 and 1995 were 7.78% and 7.81%, respectively. A majority of the
Corporation's fixed-rate debt has been converted to variable rates through the
use of swap derivative contracts. Variable-rate debt outstanding, with
contractually-determined interest rates ranging from 4.38% to 6.54% at December
31, 1996, mature at various dates through 2009. The consolidated
weighted-average interest rates on variable-rate debt at December 31, 1996 and
1995 were 5.69% and 5.99%, respectively.

   Included in long-term debt are equity commitment notes and equity contract
notes totaling $968 million at both December 31, 1996 and 1995.

   Equity commitment notes require, by their terms, the Corporation to issue,
prior to their maturity, shares of common stock or perpetual preferred stock or
other securities of the Corporation (collectively, "Capital Securities")
approved by the Federal Reserve Board equal to 100% of the original aggregate
principal amount of the notes.

   Equity contract notes require, by their terms, the Corporation to exchange
the notes at maturity for Capital Securities with a market value equal to the
principal amount of the notes or, at the Corporation's option, to pay the
principal of the notes from amounts representing designated proceeds from the
sale of Capital Securities.

   At December 31, 1996, the Corporation had designated proceeds from the sale
of Capital Securities in an amount sufficient to satisfy fully the dedication
requirements of its equity commitment and equity contract notes.

   The Corporation has guaranteed several long-term debt issues of its
subsidiaries. Guaranteed debt totaled $405 million and $420 million at December
31, 1996 and 1995, respectively.

GUARANTEED PREFERRED BENEFICIAL INTERESTS IN CORPORATION'S JUNIOR SUBORDINATED
DEFERRABLE INTEREST DEBENTURES 

In December 1996, Chase Capital I, a Delaware statutory business trust owned by
the Corporation, issued $600 million of 7.67% Capital Securities, Series A
("Series A Capital Securities"). In connection with this issuance, Chase Capital
I purchased from the Corporation $600 million of 7.67% Junior Subordinated
Deferrable Interest Debentures, Series A ("Series A Subordinated Debentures").
The Series A Subordinated Debentures are the sole assets of the trust, bear
interest at the rate of 7.67% per annum and mature on December 1, 2026. The
Corporation has, by the terms of the indenture under which the Series A
Subordinated Debentures were issued and the related trust agreement and
guarantee, fully and unconditionally guaranteed all of Chase Capital I's
obligations under the Series A Capital Securities. The Series A Capital
Securities are subject to mandatory redemption, in whole or in part, upon
repayment of the Series A Subordinated Debentures at their stated maturity or
earlier redemption. 

   Distributions on the Series A Capital Securities are payable semi-annually
in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year, commencing June 1, 1997 and
are recorded as interest expense by the Corporation. The Series A Capital
Securities are treated as Tier I Capital for the Corporation.

7 - PREFERRED STOCK OF SUBSIDIARY

In September 1996, Chase Preferred Capital Corporation ("Chase Preferred
Capital"), a wholly owned subsidiary of The Chase Manhattan Bank, issued 22
million shares of 8.10% Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series A ("Series A
Preferred Shares"), with a liquidation preference of $25 per share. Chase
Preferred Capital is a real estate investment trust established for the purpose
of acquiring, holding and managing real estate mortgage assets. Dividends on
Series A Preferred Shares are cumulative and are payable quarterly in arrears
commencing December 31, 1996 and are recorded as minority interest expense by
the Corporation.

   The Series A Preferred Shares are generally not redeemable prior to September
18, 2001. On or after such date, the Series A Preferred Shares will be redeemed
for cash at the option of Chase Preferred Capital, in whole or in part, at a
redemption price of $25 per share, plus accrued and unpaid dividends, if any,
thereon. The Series A Preferred Shares are treated as Tier 1 Capital for the
Corporation. The Series A Preferred Shares are not subject to any sinking fund
or mandatory redemption and are not convertible into any other securities of
Chase Preferred Capital or the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries.

8 - PREFERRED STOCK
                      
The Corporation is authorized to issue 200 million shares of preferred stock, in
one or more series, with a par value of $1 per share. At both December 31, 1996
and 1995, 82.0 million shares of preferred stock were outstanding.

   Dividends on shares of each series of preferred stock are payable quarterly
and are cumulative. All the preferred stocks outstanding have preference over
the Corporation's common stock with respect to the payment of dividends and the
distribution of assets in the event of a liquidation or dissolution of the
Corporation.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The following is a summary of the Corporation's preferred stocks outstanding:
                                       

(a) Redemption price includes accrued but unpaid dividends, if any.
(b) Shares of such series are represented by 8.0 million depositary shares, each
representing .25 of a share. 
(c) Floating rates are based on certain money market rates. The minimum and
maximum rates are 4.50% and 10.50%, respectively, for each of Series L and
Series N Preferred.

9 - COMMON STOCK

The Corporation is authorized to issue 750 million shares of common stock, with
a par value $1 per share. The number of shares of common stock issued and
outstanding was as follows:



(a) Under the terms of the merger agreement on March 31, 1996, all 18.6 million
treasury shares of Chase were cancelled and retired.

   During 1996, the Corporation repurchased approximately 26.7 million shares of
its outstanding common stock. Of this amount, 15.2 million shares were
repurchased primarily to meet the anticipated needs of the Corporation's
employee stock option and incentive plans and were part of a buy-back program
that terminated at September 30, 1996. The remaining 11.5 million shares were
repurchased in the fourth quarter of 1996 as part of a stock repurchase plan
announced in October 1996.

   During 1996, approximately 19.4 million shares were issued (of which 16.9
million were from treasury) under various employee stock option and incentive
plans, and 3.2 million shares were issued (of which all were from treasury) upon
the exercise of warrants which had originally been issued during 1993 by Chase
in settlement of a legal action. The warrants expired June 30, 1996.

   During 1995, 7.6 million shares were issued from treasury in connection with
the conversion of the Corporation's 10% convertible preferred stock and 6.9
million shares were issued in connection with the acquisition of the U.S. Trust
securities processing businesses.

   As of December 31, 1996, approximately 76 million shares of common stock were
reserved for issuance under various employee incentive, option and stock
purchase plans and under the Corporation's Dividend Reinvestment Plan.

   Under the Corporation's Dividend Reinvestment Plan, stockholders may reinvest
all or part of their quarterly dividends in shares of common stock.

   Common stock newly issued, or distributed from treasury, during 1996, 1995
and 1994 was as follows:



(a) Amount includes 11,184,277 and 11,385,569 shares of common stock issued in
1996 and 1995, respectively, under broad-based employee stock option plans. See
Note Fourteen for a discussion of the Corporation's employee stock option plans.
(b) During 1996, 1995 and 1994, shares distributed from treasury were
20,056,837, 22,132,496 and 1,055,455, respectively.

10 - FEES FOR OTHER FINANCIAL SERVICES
                                         
Details of fees for other financial services were as follows:

                                                              



                                                 THE CHASE MANHATTAN CORPORATION
                                                                AND SUBSIDIARIES


11 - RESTRUCTURING CHARGES AND OTHER EXPENSE

Restructuring Charges: In connection with the Merger, $1.9 billion of one-time
merger-related costs have been identified, of which $1.65 billion was taken as a
restructuring charge on March 31, 1996. An additional $164 million of
merger-related expenses, out of an expected $250 million of merger-related
expenses, were incurred during 1996 and included in the Restructuring Charge and
Expenses caption of the income statement. The remaining merger-related expenses
are expected to be substantially incurred over the next year as these costs do
not qualify for immediate recognition under an existing accounting pronouncement
and were not included in the $1.65 billion charge taken on March 31, 1996. These
costs will also be reflected in the Restructuring Charge and Expenses caption
when incurred. The $1.9 billion of merger-related costs reflects severance and
other termination-related costs to be incurred in connection with anticipated
staff reductions (approximately $600 million), costs in connection with planned
dispositions of certain facilities, premises and equipment (approximately $700
million), and other merger-related expenses, including costs to eliminate
redundant back office and other operations of Chemical and Chase and other
expenses related directly to the Merger (approximately $600 million).

   At December 31, 1996, the reserve balance associated with the above charge
was approximately $917 million, of which $280 million related to severance and
other termination-related costs, $540 million related to the disposition of
certain facilities and premises and equipment, and $97 million related to other
merger costs, including costs to eliminate redundant back office and other
operations.

   The 1995 results included a $15 million restructuring charge relating to
exiting from a futures brokerage business.

   In 1994, the Corporation incurred the following restructuring charges: $260
million taken in connection with a program to improve earnings per share, $105
million relating to a voluntary retirement program offered to eligible
employees, $52 million for other productivity initiatives, and $48 million
related to the closing of 50 New York branches and a staff reduction of 650.

Other Expense: Details of other expense were as follows:



(a) Reflects the impact of the reduction in the FDIC assessment rate.

12 - INCOME TAXES
                    
Deferred income tax expense (benefit) results from differences between amounts
of assets and liabilities as measured for income tax return and financial
reporting purposes. The significant components of Federal deferred tax assets
and liabilities are reflected in the following table.



   The Corporation's valuation reserve for Federal income taxes of $98 million
at December 31, 1996 related primarily to tax benefits associated with foreign
operations which are subject to tax law limitations on realization. This
valuation reserve was established in accordance with the requirements of SFAS
109 for tax benefits available to the Corporation but for which realization was
in doubt. A Federal deferred tax asset has been recorded in accordance with SFAS
109 related to foreign deferred taxes. Foreign deferred tax liabilities were
$220 million as of December 31, 1996. The Corporation expects that when paid,
these foreign taxes will be creditable against its Federal income tax liability.

   Deferred New York State and City tax assets approximated $68 million as of
December 31, 1996. The New York State and City valuation reserve of $148 million
was released to income during the first quarter of 1996. Under the principles of
SFAS 109, the valuation reserve is no longer required since realization of all
New York State and City tax benefits is not in doubt.

   The components of income tax expense included in the Consolidated Statement
of Income were as follows:



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS



   The preceding table does not reflect the tax effects of unrealized gains and
losses with respect to available-for-sale securities that are recorded directly
in stockholders' equity, pursuant to SFAS 115, and certain tax benefits
associated with the Corporation's employee stock plans. Stockholders' equity
increased by $254 million and $676 million, respectively, in 1996 and 1994 and
decreased by $38 million in 1995 as a result of the tax effects.

   The tax expense applicable to securities gains and losses for the years 1996,
1995 and 1994 was $51 million, $68 million, and $73 million, respectively.

   A reconciliation of the income tax expense computed at the applicable
statutory U.S. income tax rate to the actual income tax expense for the past
three years is shown in the following table.



   The following table presents the domestic and foreign components of income
before income taxes for the past three years.

                             

(a) For purposes of this disclosure, foreign income is defined as income
generated from operations located outside the United States.


13 - POSTRETIREMENT EMPLOYEE BENEFITS PLANS
                                              
New domestic postretirement plans for the Corporation were approved in 1996, and
the prior plans of Chase and Chemical were merged as of December 31, 1996.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PENSION PLANS

As of December 31, 1996, the Corporation had one noncontributory pension plan
that provided defined benefits to substantially all domestic employees (the
"domestic pension plan"). Commencing in 1997, the domestic pension plan employs
a cash balance form of defined benefit formula that provides for benefits based
on salary and service. The prior domestic pension plans of both Chase and
Chemical also provided defined benefits to substantially all domestic employees.
Chase's domestic plan employed a cash balance formula that provided for benefits
based on salary and service, subject to a minimum benefit level, while
Chemical's domestic plan included both a cash balance feature and a
final-average-pay feature. Contributions to the Corporation's domestic pension
plan are made within a range permitted under applicable law, consistent with the
prior plans of Chase and Chemical.

   The accompanying tables present the funding status and the components of the
net pension expense for the Corporation's domestic pension plan.

FUNDED STATUS OF DOMESTIC PENSION PLAN



(a) Consists primarily of listed stocks, fixed-income securities and
participation rights.



                                                 THE CHASE MANHATTAN CORPORATION
                                                                AND SUBSIDIARIES

COMPONENTS OF DOMESTIC NET PENSION EXPENSE



   During 1994, Chase offered and completed a voluntary retirement program in
which eligible participants in the postretirement plans received accelerated and
enhanced benefits if they elected to retire under the program. As a result of
this voluntary retirement program, a restructuring charge of $105 million was
taken, primarily relating to pension benefits.

   The Corporation also has a number of other defined benefit pension plans,
domestic plans not subject to Title IV of the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act and several foreign pension plans. The Corporation's funding
strategy for these plans is based on plan and legal requirements. Employee
Benefits expense related to these plans totaled $47 million in 1996, $45 million
in 1995, and $30 million in 1994. At December 31, 1996 and 1995, the
Corporation's liability included in Accrued Expenses related to those plans it
has elected not to prefund fully totaled $177 million and $170 million,
respectively.

   The Corporation has several defined contribution plans. The most significant
is The 401(k) Savings Plan, which replaced similar plans of both Chase and
Chemical. The plan, subject to certain limits, allows domestic employees to make
tax-deferred investments and earn matching contributions from the Corporation.
In addition, several foreign locations provide defined contribution plans.
Employee Benefits expense related to all defined contribution plans totaled $95
million in 1996, $94 million in 1995 and $86 million in 1994.

   During 1996, the Corporation also recognized a one-time pre-tax $40 million
charge as a result of conforming retirement benefits provided to foreign
employees.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL AND LIFE INSURANCE

The Corporation provides postretirement medical and life insurance benefits to
substantially all domestic employees who meet certain age and length-of-service
requirements at retirement ("current benefits"). Consistent with the benefits
previously provided by Chase and Chemical, the benefits provided by the
Corporation commencing in 1997 vary with length of service and date of hire, and
provide for limits on the Corporation's share of covered medical benefits. As
with the prior benefits, the current medical benefits are contributory and the
current life insurance benefits are noncontributory. The Corporation has not
prefunded these benefits.

   Effective January 1, 1995, the Corporation adopted SFAS 106 for
postretirement medical benefits for certain foreign employees. Consistent with
the January 1, 1993 adoption of SFAS 106 for domestic employees, the Corporation
elected to expense the entire unrecognized accumulated obligation as of the date
of adoption of SFAS 106 related to its foreign employees via a one-time pre-tax
charge of $17 million ($11 million after-tax).

   The accompanying tables present the components of the liability and periodic
expense related to providing postretirement medical and life insurance benefits.
The discount rates and rates of increase in future compensation used to
determine the actuarial values for these benefits are generally consistent with
those used for the domestic pension plan. During 1996, the assumed
weighted-average medical benefits cost trend rate used to measure the expected
cost of benefits covered was 10.4%, declining gradually to a floor of 5.7%. The
effect of a 1% increase in the assumed medical benefits cost trend rate would be
to increase the 1996 periodic expense by approximately 5%. As of December 31,
1996, the cost trend rate used was 10% for 1997, declining gradually over seven
years to a floor of 5.25%. The effect of a 1% increase in the assumed medical
cost trend rate would be to increase the December 31, 1996 accumulated
obligation by approximately 5%.

COMPONENTS OF POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL AND LIFE INSURANCE LIABILITY




COMPONENTS OF NET POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL AND LIFE INSURANCE EXPENSE



   The decrease in the accumulated benefit obligation as of December 31, 1996,
resulted primarily from the changes in assumptions.

14 - EMPLOYEE STOCK-BASED INCENTIVES
                                       
Following is a description of the terms of stock-based awards granted during the
past three years and a discussion of the pro forma impact that the
fair-value-based method, if adopted for income statement recognition purposes,
would have on the Corporation's earnings. As a result of the Merger, the
Corporation assumed all outstandings awards of prior Chase plans at a conversion
rate of 1.04 for each outstanding award.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
KEY EMPLOYEE STOCK-BASED AWARDS

The Corporation has a long-term stock-based incentive plan (the "LTIP") that
provides for grants of common stock-based awards, including stock options,
restricted stock and restricted stock units ("RSUs"), to certain key employees.
Awards were also granted under the prior Chase and Chemical plans. In addition,
during 1995, a plan was initiated under which, effective January 1, 1996, a
portion of incentive compensation exceeding specified levels is paid in
restricted stock or RSUs.

   Under the LTIP and prior plans, stock options have been granted with exercise
prices equal to the Corporation's common stock price on the grant date.
Generally, options cannot be exercised until one year after the grant date, and
become exercisable over various periods as determined at the time of the grant.
Options generally expire ten years after the grant date. The accompanying table
presents a summary of key employee option activity during the last three years.

KEY EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS

                                                                        

(a) Of the total options outstanding at December 31, 1996, 1,186,000 options
(all exercisable) had exercise prices ranging from $10.22 to $25, or $14.17 on
average, and a remaining life of 4.0 years; 15,448,000 options (11,803,000 were
exercisable) had exercise prices ranging from $25 to $50, or $38.19 on average,
and a weighted-average remaining contractual life of 6.5 years; 4,967,000
options (6,000 exercisable) had exercise prices ranging from $50 to $70.06, or
$58.27 on average, and a remaining life of 9.0 years.

   Restricted stock and RSUs are granted at no cost to the recipient. Restricted
stock and RSUs are subject to forfeiture until certain restrictions have lapsed,
including continued employment for a specified period. The recipient of a share
of restricted common stock is entitled to voting rights and dividends. An RSU
entitles the recipient to receive a share of common stock (or cash, in some
cases) after a specified period of continued employment; the recipient is
entitled to receive cash payments equivalent to dividends on the underlying
common stock.

   Under the LTIP, vesting for most restricted shares and RSUs accelerates if
the stock price reaches and sustains target prices for a minimum period (the
"targets"). For half of the award, vesting is conditioned solely on continued
employment; for the other half, the award is forfeited in its entirety if the
targets are not achieved ("forfeitable restricted stock and RSUs"). During 1996,
2,400,000 of such awards (all payable solely in stock) were granted. During 1995
and 1994, 859,000 (67,000 payable in cash) and 901,000 (68,000 payable in cash),
respectively, of such awards were granted; all awards granted in 1995 and 1994
vested as a result of the targets having been achieved in 1996 and 1995.

   Additional restricted stock and RSUs are outstanding for which vesting is
conditioned solely on continued employment. During 1996, 1995 and 1994,
respectively, 207,000, 489,000 and 156,000 of such awards were granted. In 1996,
these awards were primarily issued under the aforementioned plan, under which a
portion of incentive compensation exceeding specified levels is paid in common
stock. Awards in 1995 and 1994 were granted primarily under the previous Chase
plan.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
BROAD-BASED EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS

In December 1996, the Corporation adopted its Value Sharing Plan, under which
9.7 million options to purchase common stock were granted to substantially all
full-time (150 options each) and part-time (75 options each) employees. The
exercise price was equal to the stock price on the grant date. The options
become exercisable after six years, or earlier if the stock price reaches and
sustains target prices for a minimum period. The 1996 award is the first of what
is intended to be three equal annual grants. The additional grants are expected
to be issued in December 1997 and 1998 to eligible active employees on those
dates. The exercise and target prices for these awards will be determined at the
time of the grant; other terms will be similar to the 1996 awards. Both of the
Corporation's predecessor institutions made similar awards in 1994. All
outstanding options expire ten years after the grant date.

   Under the prior Chemical plan, 20 million options were granted in June 1994
to substantially all full-time (500 options each) and certain part-time (250
options each) employees. The options became exercisable during 1995 when the
stock price targets were reached.

   Under the prior Chase plan, 16 million stock options were granted in January
1994 to substantially all full-time (400 options each) and certain part-time
(200 options each) employees. Employees hired between January 1994 and June 1995
were awarded a proportionately reduced number of options with an exercise price
equal to the then-current stock price. The options became exercisable in
December 1995 as a result of Chase shareholder approval of the Merger.

   The following table presents the activity in the broad-based employee stock 
option plans during the past three years.



                                                 THE CHASE MANHATTAN CORPORATION
                                                                AND SUBSIDIARIES

BROAD-BASED EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS

                              

(a) For options outstanding as of December 31, 1996, the exercise prices ranged
from $30.77 to $86.38, and the average remaining contractual life was 8.8 years.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
COMPARISON OF THE FAIR- AND INTRINSIC-VALUE-BASED MEASUREMENT METHODS 

SFAS No. 123 is effective for awards granted in 1995 and subsequent years. It
establishes accounting and reporting standards for stock-based incentive plans,
and allows two alternative methods for accounting for employee incentives: (a)
the fair-value-based method, or (b) the intrinsic-value-based method, on which
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees" was based.

   The Corporation elected to continue accounting for its employee stock-based
compensation plans under the intrinsic-value-based method. No expense is
recognized for stock options as they have no intrinsic value. Forfeitable
restricted stock and RSUs are valued at the vesting date stock price. The
expense for restricted stock and RSUs, other than forfeitable awards, is
measured by the grant-date stock price. If the recipient may elect to receive
cash payment in lieu of stock, expense is measured by the amount of cash paid.
Stock compensation expense recognized in reported 1996 earnings totaled $65
million, before taxes.

   If the Corporation had adopted the fair-value-based method, options would be
valued using a Black-Scholes model. Forfeitable restricted stock and RSUs would
be valued at the grant-date stock price, after deducting the value assigned to
the probability that the award would not reach the target price. Consistent with
the intrinsic-value-based method, the expense for restricted stock and RSUs,
other than forfeitable awards, is measured by the grant-date stock price; if the
recipient may elect to receive cash payment in lieu of stock, expense is
measured by the amount of cash paid. The pro forma net income and primary and
fully diluted earnings per share impact, if the fair-value-based method was
adopted, would have been as much as 1.5% lower than reported 1996 amounts, and
as much as .5% lower than reported 1995 amounts. The impact of stock
compensation on pro forma expense is expected to increase in 1997, as compared
to 1996, primarily due to the impact of a full-year's pro forma expense
associated with the Value Sharing Plan, under which options were granted in
December 1996. Under both the intrinsic- and fair-value-based methods, the net
impact on Stockholders' Equity is the same.

   The following table presents the assumptions (weighted, based on aggregate
grant-date award values) used to derive the dividend-adjusted
Black-Scholes-derived grant-date fair value of options granted during the past
year.



(a) Expected dividend yield is based primarily on historical data at the grant
dates.

   Under the fair-value-based method, the grant-date fair value for an option
equals the sum of the annual probability of exercise or vested termination,
multiplied by the dividend-adjusted Black-Scholes-derived value of an option
terminating in that year. The weighted-average grant-date fair value per option
for grants awarded during 1996 was $13.91 for options granted to key employees
and $16.66 for options granted under the broad-based Value Sharing Plan. The
weighted-average grant-date fair value for all restricted stock and for RSUs
payable in stock granted to key employees during 1996 was $46.15 per share.

15 - RESTRICTIONS ON CASH AND INTERCOMPANY FUNDS TRANSFERS
                                             
The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System ("Federal Reserve Board")
require depository institutions to maintain cash reserves with a Federal Reserve
Bank. The average amount of reserve balances deposited by the Corporation's bank
subsidiaries with various Federal Reserve Banks was approximately $1.2 billion
during both 1996 and 1995.

   Restrictions imposed by Federal law prohibit the Corporation and certain
other affiliates from borrowing from banking subsidiaries unless the loans are
secured in specified amounts. Such secured loans to the Corporation or to each
of certain other affiliates generally are limited to 10% of the banking
subsidiary's capital and surplus; the aggregate amount of all such loans is
limited to 20% of the banking subsidiary's capital and surplus. The Corporation
was well within these limits throughout the year.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

   The principal sources of the Corporation's income (on a parent company-only
basis) are dividends and interest from The Chase Manhattan Bank and the other
banking and nonbanking subsidiaries of the Corporation. Federal law imposes
limitations on the payment of dividends by the subsidiaries of the Corporation
that are state member banks of the Federal Reserve System (a "state member
bank") or are national banks. Under such limitations, dividend payments by such
banks are limited to the lesser of (i) the amount of "undivided profits" (as
defined) and (ii) absent regulatory approval, an amount not in excess of "net
income" (as defined) for the current year plus "retained net income" (as
defined) for the preceding two years. Nonbank subsidiaries of the Corporation
are not subject to such limitations.

   In accordance with the foregoing restrictions, the Corporation's bank
subsidiaries could, during 1997, without the approval of their relevant banking
regulators, pay dividends in the aggregate of approximately $1.5 billion to
their respective bank holding companies, plus an additional amount equal to
their net income from January 1, 1997 through the date in 1997 of any such
dividend payment.

16 - CAPITAL
               
Under the risk-based capital guidelines of the Federal Reserve Board applicable
to the Corporation in 1996, banking organizations are required to maintain
certain ratios of "Qualifying Capital" to "risk-weighted assets." "Qualifying
Capital" is classified into two tiers referred to as Tier 1 Capital and Tier 2
Capital. In addition, the Federal Reserve Board has another capital measure, the
Tier 1 Leverage ratio. Banking organizations are required to maintain a minimum
Total Risk-Based Capital ratio (Total Capital to risk-weighted assets) of 8%, of
which at least 4% must be Tier 1 Capital. The minimum Tier 1 Leverage ratio is
3% for banking organizations that are generally considered strong, have
well-diversified risk (including no undue interest rate risk), excellent asset
quality, high liquidity and good earnings. Higher capital ratios could be
required if warranted by the particular circumstances or risk profile of a given
banking organization. Failure to meet regulatory minimum requirements could
result in actions taken by regulators. Management believes that as of December
31, 1996 the Corporation has met all capital adequacy requirements to which it
is subject.

   Pursuant to FDICIA, the Federal Reserve Board, the FDIC and the Comptroller
of the Currency adopted regulations setting forth a five-tier scheme for
measuring the capital adequacy of the depository institutions and bank holding
companies they supervise. Under the regulations (commonly referred to as the
"prompt corrective action" rules) to be "well-capitalized," a banking
organization must have a Tier 1 Capital ratio of at least 6%, a Total Capital
ratio of at least 10%, and a Tier 1 Leverage ratio of at least 5% for banks and
4% for bank holding companies. The ratios for the Corporation and each of the
Corporation's banking subsidiaries, including The Chase Manhattan Bank, Texas
Commerce and Chase USA, exceeded the ratios required to be well capitalized at
December 31, 1996. Management is not aware of any subsequent events that would
alter this classification.

   The following tables present capital ratios and the components of capital for
the Corporation and its significant banking subsidiaries. Assets and capital
amounts for the Corporation's banking subsidiaries reflect intercompany
transactions, whereas the respective amounts for the Corporation reflect the
elimination of intercompany transactions.



(a) Tier 1 Capital or Total Capital, as applicable, divided by risk-weighted
assets. Risk-weighted assets include assets and off-balance sheet positions,
weighted by the type of instruments and the risk weight of the counterparty,
collateral or guarantor. 
(b) Tier 1 Capital divided by adjusted average assets (net of allowance for
credit losses, goodwill and certain intangible assets).
(c) The provisions of SFAS 115 do not apply to the calculation of these ratios.
(d) Excludes the assets and off-balance sheet financial instruments of the
Corporation's securities subsidiary, Chase Securities Inc., as well as the
Corporation's investment in such subsidiary. Including the Corporation's
securities subsidiary, Chase Securities Inc., the December 31, 1996 Tier 1
Capital, Total Capital and Tier 1 Leverage ratios were 8.37%, 12.29% and 6.39%,
respectively.



                                                 THE CHASE MANHATTAN CORPORATION
                                                                AND SUBSIDIARIES



(a) In accordance with Federal Reserve Board risk-based capital guidelines,
minority interest for the Corporation includes $550 million and $600 million in
preferred stock instruments issued in 1996 by subsidiaries of the Corporation.
For a further discussion see Notes Six and Seven. 
(b) Includes off-balance sheet risk-weighted assets in the amounts of $79,099
million, $74,373 million, $3,824 million and $103 million, respectively, at
December 31, 1996.

17 - DERIVATIVE AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
                                                 
The Corporation utilizes various derivative and foreign exchange financial
instruments for trading purposes and for purposes other than trading, such as
ALM. Such derivative and foreign exchange transactions involve, to varying
degrees, credit risk and market risk. A discussion of the credit and market
risks involved with these financial instruments is included the first six
paragraphs of the Derivative and Foreign Exchange Financial Instruments section
of the MD&A on pages 52-53, paragraphs one through three and five through seven
of the Credit Risk Management section of the MD&A on pages 48-49, and paragraphs
one, two and eight through ten of the Market Risk Management section of the MD&A
on page 54.

Derivative and Foreign Exchange Instruments Used for Trading Purposes: The
credit risk associated with the Corporation's trading activities is recorded on
the balance sheet. The effects of any market risk (gains or losses) on the
Corporation's trading activities have been reflected in trading revenue, as the
trading instruments are marked-to-market on a daily basis.

Derivative and Foreign Exchange Instruments Used for Purposes Other Than
Trading: A discussion of the Corporation's objectives and strategies for
employing derivative and foreign exchange instruments for ALM activities is
included in the first four paragraphs of the Asset/Liability Management
discussion of the MD&A on pages 55-56, paragraph seven on page 57 and paragraph
four on page 58.

   At December 31, 1996, gross deferred gains and gross deferred losses relating
to closed derivative contracts used in ALM activities were $584 million and $626
million, respectively. The Corporation also uses selected derivative financial
instruments to manage its sensitivity to changes in market interest rates on
anticipated transactions; however, such transactions are not significant. At
December 31, 1996, deferred gains and losses associated with anticipatory ALM
transactions were insignificant.

   The following table summarizes the aggregate notional amounts of derivative
and foreign exchange contracts as well as the credit exposure related to these
instruments (after taking into account the effects of legally enforceable master
netting agreements) for the dates indicated below.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS



(a) The notional amounts of exchange-traded interest rate contracts, foreign
exchange contracts, and stock index options and commodity contracts were $521.5
billion, $9.5 billion and $6.4 billion, respectively, at December 31, 1996,
compared with $417.7 billion, $10.6 billion and $5.1 billion, respectively, at
December 31, 1995. The credit risk amounts of these contracts were minimal since
exchange-traded contracts principally settle daily in cash. 
(b) Includes notional amounts of purchased options, written options and
cross-currency interest rate swaps of $89.6 billion, $94.2 billion and $87.8
billion, respectively, at December 31, 1996, compared with $92.2 billion, $92.4
billion and $58.6 billion, respectively, at December 31, 1995.

Classes of Derivative and Foreign Exchange Instruments: The following classes of
derivative and foreign exchange instruments refer to instruments that are used
by the Corporation for purposes of both trading and ALM.

   Interest rate futures and forwards are contracts for the delayed delivery of
securities or money market instruments in which the seller agrees to deliver on
a specified future date, a specified instrument, at a specified price or yield.
The credit risk inherent in futures and forwards is the risk that the exchange
party may default. Futures contracts settle in cash daily and, therefore, there
is minimal credit risk to the Corporation. The credit risk inherent in forwards
arises from the potential inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their
contracts. Both futures and forwards are also subject to the risk of movements
in interest rates or the value of the underlying securities or instruments.

   Forward rate agreements are contracts to exchange payments on a certain
future date, based on a market change in interest rates from trade date to
contract settlement date. The notional amount on which the interest payments are
based is not exchanged. The maturity of these agreements is typically less than
two years.

   Interest rate swaps are contracts in which a series of interest rate flows in
a single currency are exchanged over a prescribed period. The notional amount on
which the interest payments are based is not exchanged. Most interest rate swaps
involve the exchange of fixed and floating interest payments. Cross-currency
interest rate swaps are contracts that involve the exchange of both interest and
principal amounts in two different currencies. The risks inherent in interest
rate and cross-currency swap contracts are the potential inability of a
counterparty to meet the terms of its contract and the risk associated with
changes in the market values of the contracts due to movements in the underlying
interest rates.

   Interest rate options, which include caps and floors, are contracts which
transfer, modify, or reduce interest rate risk in exchange for the payment of a
premium when the contract is initiated. As a writer of interest rate caps,
floors and other options, the Corporation receives a premium in exchange for
bearing the risk of unfavorable changes in interest rates. Conversely, as a
purchaser of an option, the Corporation pays a premium for the right, but not
the obligation, to buy or sell a financial instrument or currency at
predetermined terms in the future. Foreign currency options are similar to
interest rate option contracts, except that they are based on currencies instead
of interest rates.

   The Corporation's use of written options as part of its ALM is permitted only
in those circumstances where they are specifically linked to purchased options.
All unmatched written options are included in the trading portfolio at their
estimated fair value.



                                                 THE CHASE MANHATTAN CORPORATION
                                                                AND SUBSIDIARIES

   Foreign exchange contracts are contracts for the future receipt or delivery
of foreign currency at previously agreed-upon terms. The risks inherent in these
contracts are the potential inability of a counterparty to meet the terms of its
contract and the risk associated with changes in the market values of the
underlying currencies.

   Stock index option contracts are contracts to pay or receive cash flows from
counterparties based upon the increase or decrease in the underlying index.
Commodity contracts include swaps, caps and floors and are similar to interest
rate contracts, except that they are based on commodity indices instead of
interest rates.

   To reduce its exposure to market risk related to the above-mentioned classes
of derivative and foreign exchange instruments, the Corporation may enter into
offsetting positions.

   To reduce credit risk, management may deem it necessary to obtain collateral.
The amount and nature of the collateral obtained is based on management's credit
evaluation of the customer. Collateral held varies but may include cash,
securities, accounts receivable, inventory, property, plant and equipment, and
real estate.

   Derivatives and foreign exchange instruments are generally either negotiated
over-the-counter ("OTC") contracts or standardized contracts executed on a
recognized exchange. Standardized exchange-traded derivatives primarily include
futures and options. Negotiated OTC derivatives are generally entered into
between two counterparties that negotiate specific agreement terms, including
the underlying instrument, amount, exercise price and maturity.

   Included as part of the financial instruments presented in the preceding
notional table are transactions involving "when-issued securities" which the
Corporation enters into primarily as part of its trading activities. When-issued
securities are commitments to purchase or sell securities authorized for
issuance, but not yet actually issued, and are not recorded on the balance sheet
until issued. However, these commitments are marked-to-market with the resulting
gains or losses reflected in trading revenue.


18 - OFF-BALANCE SHEET LENDING-RELATED FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
                           
In addition to using derivative and foreign exchange financial instruments, the
Corporation also utilizes lending-related financial instruments in order to meet
the financing needs of its customers. The Corporation issues commitments to
extend credit, standby and other letters of credit and guarantees, and also
provides securities-lending services. For lending-related financial instruments,
the contractual amount of the financial instrument represents the maximum
potential credit risk if the counterparty does not perform according to the
terms of the contract. A large majority of these commitments expire without
being drawn upon. As a result, total contractual amounts are not representative
of the Corporation's actual future credit exposure or liquidity requirements for
such commitments.

   At December 31, 1996, in accordance with the AICPA's Audit and Accounting
Guide for Banks and Savings Institutions, the Corporation allocated $70 million
of its allowance for credit losses to letters of credit and guarantees, which is
reported in Other Liabilities. For a further discussion, see Note One on page
69. The following table summarizes the contract amounts relating to the
Corporation's lending-related financial instruments at December 31, 1996 and
1995.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET LENDING-RELATED FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS



(a) Excludes credit card commitments of $54.2 billion and $47.6 billion at
December 31, 1996 and 1995, respectively.

   Unfunded commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer
who has complied with predetermined contractual conditions. Commitments
generally have fixed expiration dates.

   Standby letters of credit and guarantees are conditional commitments issued
by the Corporation generally to guarantee the performance of a customer to a
third party in borrowing arrangements, such as commercial paper, bond financing,
construction and similar transactions. The credit risk involved in issuing
standby letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending
loan facilities to customers and may be reduced by participations to third
parties. The Corporation holds collateral to support those standby letters of
credit and guarantees written for which collateral is deemed necessary.

   Customers' securities lent are customers' securities held by the Corporation,
as custodian, which are lent to third parties. The Corporation obtains
collateral, with a market value exceeding 100% of the contract amount, for
customers' securities lent, which is used to indemnify customers against
possible losses resulting from third-party defaults.

19 - CREDIT RISK CONCENTRATIONS
                                  
Concentrations of credit risk arise when a number of customers are engaged in
similar business activities, or activities in the same geographic region, or
have similar economic features that would cause their ability to meet
contractual obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic
conditions.

   The Corporation regularly monitors various segments of its credit risk
portfolio to assess potential concentration risks and to obtain collateral when
deemed necessary. The initial segmentation of the portfolio for this purpose is
by product within the consumer portfolio and by industry within the commercial
portfolio. The table below indicates major product and industry segments
including both on-balance sheet (principally loans) and off-balance sheet
(principally commitments to extend credit) exposures.




NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

   The Corporation's exposures within these major segments can be diversified by
risk rating, maturity, geography and segmented within industry classifications.
These diversification factors reduce concentration risk. For the geographic
concentration of residential mortgages and credit card outstandings, reference
is made to the tables entitled Residential Mortgage Loans by Geographic Region
and Domestic Credit Card Receivables by Geographic Region within the Domestic
Consumer Portfolio section of the MD&A on page 50. For a discussion of the
Corporation's credit exposure to financial institutions, reference is made to
the Derivative and Foreign Exchange Financial Instruments discussion included on
pages 52-53 of the MD&A. Also, see pages 51 and 52 of the MD&A for a discussion
of the domestic commercial real estate portfolio (which discloses its
concentration, primarily in the New York/New Jersey and Texas markets) and for a
discussion of cross-border exposure within the foreign portfolio (which
discloses its concentration in Latin America, principally Brazil and Mexico).

   Management believes the current credit risk portfolio is well diversified and
does not contain unusual concentration risks.

                                                               

20 - FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

Fair value is the amount at which a financial instrument could be exchanged in a
current transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced sale or
liquidation, and is best evidenced by a quoted market price, if one exists.

   Quoted market prices are not available for a significant portion of the
Corporation's financial instruments. As a result, the fair values presented are
estimates derived using present value or other valuation techniques and may not
be indicative of the net realizable value. In addition, the calculation of
estimated fair value is based on market conditions at a specific point in time
and may not be reflective of future fair values.

   Certain financial instruments and all nonfinancial instruments are excluded
from the scope of SFAS 107. Accordingly, the fair value disclosures required by
SFAS 107 provide only a partial estimate of the fair value of the Corporation;
for example, the values associated with the various ongoing businesses which the
Corporation operates are excluded. The Corporation has developed long-term
relationships with its customers through its deposit base and its credit card
accounts, commonly referred to as core deposit intangibles and credit card
relationships. In the opinion of management, these items in the aggregate add
significant value to the Corporation, but their fair value is not disclosed in
this Note.

   Fair values among financial institutions are not comparable due to the wide
range of permitted valuation techniques and numerous estimates that must be
made. This lack of objective valuation standard introduces a great degree of
subjectivity to these derived or estimated fair values. Therefore, readers are
cautioned in using this information for purposes of evaluating the financial
condition of the Corporation compared with other financial institutions.

   The following summary presents the methodologies and assumptions used to
estimate the fair value of the Corporation's financial instruments, required to
be valued pursuant to SFAS 107.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FINANCIAL ASSETS

Assets for Which Fair Value Approximates Carrying Value: The fair values of
certain financial assets carried at cost, including cash and due from banks,
deposits with banks, federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale
agreements, due from customers on acceptances, short-term receivables and
accrued interest receivable, are considered to approximate their respective
carrying values due to their short-term nature and negligible credit losses. The
fair value of loans held for accelerated disposition is also considered to
approximate carrying value. As discussed in Note One, such loans are carried at
the lower of cost or current estimated disposition value.



                                                 THE CHASE MANHATTAN CORPORATION
                                                                AND SUBSIDIARIES

Trading Assets: The Corporation carries trading assets, which includes debt and
equity instruments as well as the positive fair value on derivative and foreign
exchange instruments, at estimated fair value.

Securities: Held-to-maturity securities are carried at amortized cost.
Available-for-sale securities and related derivative contracts are carried at
fair value. The fair value of actively-traded securities is determined by the
secondary market, while the fair value for nonactively-traded securities is
based on independent broker quotations.

Loans: Loans are valued using methodologies suitable for each loan type as
discussed below.

   The fair value of the Corporation's commercial loan portfolio is estimated by
assessing the two main risk components of the portfolio: credit and interest.
The estimated cash flows are adjusted to reflect the inherent credit risk and
then discounted, using rates appropriate for each maturity that incorporate the
effects of interest rate changes. Generally, emerging market loans are valued
based on secondary market prices.

   For consumer installment loans and residential mortgages for which market
rates for comparable loans are readily available, the fair values are estimated
by discounting cash flows, adjusted for prepayments. The discount rates used for
consumer installment loans are current rates offered by commercial banks and
thrifts; for residential mortgages, secondary market yields for comparable MBSs,
adjusted for risk, are used. The fair value of credit card receivables is
estimated by discounting expected cash flows. The discount rates used
incorporate the effects of interest rate changes only, since the estimated cash
flows are adjusted for credit risk.

Other Assets: This caption consists primarily of equity investments, including
venture capital investments. The fair value of these investments is determined
on an individual basis. The valuation methodologies include market values of
publicly-traded securities, independent appraisals, and cash flow analyses.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FINANCIAL LIABILITIES

Liabilities for Which Fair Value Approximates Carrying Value: SFAS 107 requires
that the fair value disclosed for deposit liabilities with no stated maturity
(i.e., demand, savings and certain money market deposits) be equal to the
carrying value. SFAS 107 does not allow for the recognition of the inherent
funding value of these instruments.

   The fair value of foreign deposits, federal funds purchased and securities
sold under repurchase agreements, other borrowed funds, acceptances outstanding,
short-term payables and accounts payable and accrued liabilities are considered
to approximate their respective carrying values due to their short-term nature.

Domestic Time Deposits: The fair value of time deposits is estimated by
discounting cash flows based on contractual maturities at the interest rates for
raising funds of similar maturity.

Trading Liabilities: The Corporation carries trading liabilities, which include
securities sold, not yet purchased, structured notes as well as derivatives and
foreign exchange instruments, at estimated fair value. These instruments are
valued using either quoted market prices, pricing models, quoted market prices
of financial instruments with similar characteristics or discounted cash flows.
For the estimated fair value of trading liabilities, see Note Two.

Long-Term Debt: The valuation of long-term debt, including the Series A Capital
Securities, takes into account several factors, including current market
interest rates and the Corporation's credit rating. Quotes are gathered from
various investment banking firms for indicative yields for the Corporation's
securities over a range of maturities.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
UNUSED COMMITMENTS AND LETTERS OF CREDIT

The Corporation has reviewed the unfunded portion of commitments to extend
credit as well as standby and other letters of credit, and has determined that
the fair value of such financial instruments is not material.

   The following table presents the carrying value and estimated fair value at
December 31, 1996 and 1995 of financial assets and liabilities valued under SFAS
107 and certain derivative contracts used for ALM activities related to such
financial assets and liabilities. The table excludes those derivative contracts
used by the Corporation to manage the risks associated with its mortgage
servicing rights that are not required to be fair valued under SFAS 107. At
December 31, 1996, the carrying value of the derivative contracts was $62.1
million, and gross unrecognized gains and losses were $41.6 million and $57.7
million, respectively, resulting in an estimated fair value of $46.0 million.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS






(a) The carrying value and estimated fair value include the carrying value and
estimated fair value of derivative contracts used for ALM activities.

(b) The carrying value and estimated fair value of daily margin settlements on
open futures contracts are primarily included in Other Assets on the balance
sheet, except when used in connection with available-for-sale securities, which
are carried at fair value and are included in Securities: Available-for-Sale on
the balance sheet. The Corporation uses these contracts in its ALM activities to
modify the interest rate characteristics of balance sheet instruments such as
securities available-for-sale, loans and deposits. Gross unrecognized gains and
losses from daily margin settlements on open futures contracts were $4 million
and $1 million, respectively, at December 31, 1996.

(c) The carrying value of derivatives used for ALM activities is recorded as
receivables and payables and is primarily included in Other Assets on the
balance sheet, except derivatives used in connection with available-for-sale
securities which are carried at fair value and are included in Securities:
Available-for-Sale on the balance sheet.

(d) Represents derivative contracts that, as part of the Corporation's ALM
activities, are used in place of cash market instruments. See Note One for a
further discussion.

(e) Derivative contracts used for ALM activities were valued using market prices
or pricing models consistent with methods used by the Corporation in valuing
similar instruments used for trading purposes.


                                                 THE CHASE MANHATTAN CORPORATION
                                                                AND SUBSIDIARIES

21 - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

At December 31, 1996, the Corporation and its subsidiaries were obligated under
a number of noncancelable operating leases for premises and equipment used
primarily for banking purposes. Certain leases contain rent escalation clauses
for real estate taxes and other operating expenses and renewal option clauses
calling for increased rents. No lease agreement imposes any restrictions on the
Corporation affecting its ability to pay dividends, engage in debt or equity
financing transactions, or enter into further lease agreements. Future minimum
rental payments required under operating leases with initial and remaining
noncancelable lease terms in excess of one year as of December 31, 1996 were as
follows:



   Total rental expense was as follows:



   At December 31, 1996 and 1995, assets amounting to $58 billion and $57
billion, respectively, were pledged to secure public deposits and for other
purposes. The significant components of the $58 billion of assets pledged at
December 31, 1996 were as follows: $21 billion were loans, $13 billion were
securities, and the remaining $24 billion were primarily trading assets. These
amounts compare with $21 billion of loans, $16 billion of securities, and $20
billion of trading assets pledged at December 31, 1995.

   The Corporation and its subsidiaries are defendants in a number of legal
proceedings. After reviewing with counsel all such actions and proceedings
pending against or involving the Corporation and its subsidiaries, management
does not expect the aggregate liability or loss, if any, resulting therefrom to
have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial condition of the
Corporation.

   The Corporation may guarantee the obligations of its subsidiaries. These
guarantees rank on a parity with all other unsecured and unsubordinated
indebtedness of the Corporation. See Note Six for a discussion of the
Corporation's guarantees of long-term debt issues for its subsidiaries.

22 - INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS

The following table presents average assets and income statement information
relating to international and domestic operations of the Corporation by major
geographic areas, based on the domicile of the customer. The Corporation defines
international activities as business transactions that involve customers
residing outside of the United States. However, a definitive separation of the
Corporation's domestic and foreign businesses cannot be performed because many
of the Corporation's domestic operations service international business.

   As these operations are highly integrated, estimates and subjective
assumptions have been made to apportion revenue and expenses between domestic
and international operations. Estimates of the following are allocated on a
management accounting basis: stockholders' equity, interest costs charged to
users of funds, and overhead, administrative and other expenses incurred by one
area on behalf of another. The provision for credit losses is allocated based on
charge-off experience and risk characteristics of the portfolio.

   The Corporation considers the balance in the allowance for credit losses to
be available for both domestic and foreign exposures; however, a portion of the
allowance is allocated to international operations based on a methodology
consistent with the allocation of the provision for credit losses, as discussed
above.

                                                                and Subsidiaries

Distribution of Assets, Liabilities and Stockholders'
Equity; Interest Rates and Interest Differentials

A three-year summary of the Corporation's consolidated average balances,
interest rates and interest differentials on a taxable-equivalent basis for the
years 1994 through 1996, is provided on pages 96 and 97. Income computed on a
taxable-equivalent basis is the income reported in the Consolidated Statement of
Income adjusted to make income and earning yields on assets exempt from income
taxes (primarily Federal taxes) comparable to other taxable income. The
incremental tax rate used for calculating the taxable equivalent adjustment was
approximately 43% in each of the years 1994 through 1996. A substantial portion
of the Corporation's securities are taxable.

   Within the Consolidated Average Balance Sheet, Interest and Rates summary,
the principal amounts of nonaccrual and renegotiated loans have been included in
the average loan balances used to determine the average interest rate earned on
loans. Interest accrued but not collected at the date a loan is placed on
nonaccrual status is reversed against interest income. Interest income on
nonaccrual loans is recognized only to the extent received in cash. However,
where there is doubt regarding the ultimate collectibility of the loan
principal, cash receipts, whether designated as principal or interest, are
thereafter applied to reduce the carrying value of the loan. Loans are restored
to accrual status only when interest and principal payments are brought
current and future payments are reasonably assured.

   A summary of interest rates and interest differentials segregated between
domestic and foreign operations for the years 1994 through 1996 is presented on
pages 98 and 99. Regarding the basis of segregation between the domestic and
foreign components, see Note Twenty Two of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements at page 89. A portion of the Corporation's international operations
are funded by domestic sources (intra-company funding). Generally, the source of
such domestic funds is the Parent Company which, in order to optimize the
Corporation's overall liquidity, deposits its excess short-term funds with The
Chase Manhattan Bank's Nassau Branch to hold until such funds are needed.
Intra-company funding is very short-term in nature and the Corporation believes
such funds are not subject to cross-border risk.

   Domestic net interest income was $6,721 million in 1996, an increase of $272
million from the prior year. The increase in 1996 was attributable to a higher
level of interest-earning assets (for further discussion, see the section
entitled "Net Interest Income" in Management's Discussion and Analysis at page
39).

   Net interest income from foreign operations was $1,653 million for 1996,
compared with $1,798 million in 1995. The decline primarily reflected a shift
to lower yielding interest-earning assets.

   The table on pages 100 and 101 presents an analysis of the effect on net
interest income of volume and rate changes for the periods 1996 over 1995 and
1995 over 1994. In this analysis, the change due to the volume/rate variance has
been allocated to volume.

The amortized cost, estimated fair value and average yield, including the impact
of related derivatives, at December 31, 1996 of the Corporation's
available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities by contractual maturity range
and type of security are presented in the table which follows:



(a) Securities with no stated maturity are included with securities with a
remaining maturity of ten years or more. Substantially all of the Corporation's
MBSs and CMOs are due in ten years or more based on contractual maturity. The
estimated duration, which reflects anticipated future prepayments based on a
consensus of dealers in the market, is approximately 5 years for MBSs, and less
than 1 year for CMOs. 

(b) The average yield is based on amortized cost balances at the end of the
year. Yields are derived by dividing interest income, adjusted for the effect of
related derivatives on available-for-sale securities and the amortization of
premiums and accretion of discounts, by total amortized cost. Taxable-equivalent
yields are used, where applicable.

(c) Includes investments in debt securities issued by foreign governments,
corporate debt securities, collateralized mortgage obligations of private
issuers, other debt and equity securities.

   Of the securities held in Corporation's securities portfolios, securities
issued by the Federal Republic of Germany exceeded 10% of the Corporation's
total stockholders' equity at December 31, 1996, with a fair value of $3,208
million and an amortized cost of $3,148 million. U.S. Government and Federal
Agencies were the only other issuers whose securities exceeded 10% of the
Corporation's total stockholders' equity at December 31, 1996.

   For further discussion of the Corporation's securities portfolios, see Note
Three of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements on pages 71 and 72.

================================================================================
Loan Portfolio

The table below sets forth the amount of loans outstanding by type for the dates
indicated:



   The foreign loan portfolio includes Brady Bonds which are subject to the
provisions of SFAS 115. A significant portion of the Brady Bonds are
collateralized by zero-coupon U.S. Treasury obligations. Up to two-years'
interest on Brady Bonds is also collateralized by U.S. Treasury obligations.
Management continually evaluates and monitors the ability of the foreign
governments to meet their obligations under the Brady Bonds that they have
issued and that are included in the portfolio, and believes that any unrealized
losses on these securities are temporary in nature.

   Commercial mortgages provide financing for the acquisition or refinancing of
commercial properties. Construction loans are generally originated to finance
the construction of real estate projects. When the real estate project has cash
flows sufficient to support a commercial mortgage, the loan is transferred from
construction status to commercial mortgage status.

   For a discussion of the Corporation's loan outstandings, see "Loan 
Portfolio" on page 48.

Maturities and Sensitivity to Changes in Interest Rates

(a) Includes demand loans, overdrafts and loans having no stated schedule of
repayments and no stated maturity.

security pursuant to SFAS 115 mature in over 10 years.




Cross-Border Outstandings

The extension of credits denominated in a currency other than that of the
country in which a borrower is located, such as dollar-denominated loans made
overseas, are called "cross-border" credits. In addition to the credit risk
associated with any borrower, these particular credits are also subject to
"country risk" - economic and political risk factors specific to the country of
the borrower which may make the borrower unable or unwilling to pay principal
and interest according to contractual terms. Other risks associated with these
credits include the possibility of insufficient foreign exchange and
restrictions on its availability. To minimize country risk, the Corporation
monitors its foreign credits in each country with specific consideration given
to maturity, currency, industry and geographic concentration of the credits.

   The following table lists all countries in which the Corporation's
cross-border outstandings exceeded 1% of consolidated assets as of any of the
dates specified. For further discussion of the Corporation's Cross-Border
exposure see page 52.

Cross-Border Outstandings Exceeding One Percent of Total Assets(a)


                                                                           
(a) Outstandings (including loans and accrued interest, interest-bearing
deposits with banks, securities, acceptances and other monetary assets, except
equity investments) represent those of both the public and private sectors and
are presented on a risk basis, i.e., net of written guarantees and tangible
liquid collateral when held outside the foreign country. At December 31, 1996,
outstandings to Canada were $2,776 million, which were in excess of .75% of
total assets. At December 31, 1996, 1995 and 1994, outstandings to Korea were
$2,691 million, $2,809 million and $2,164 million, respectively, which were in
excess of .75% of total assets. At December 31, 1994, outstandings to Hong Kong
and Mexico were $2,603 million and $2,259 million, respectively, which were in
excess of .75% of total assets.

(b) Outstandings exclude equity received in debt-for-equity conversions, which
is recorded initially at fair market value and generally accounted for under the
cost method. Commitments (outstanding letters of credit, standby letters of
credit, guarantees and unused legal commitments) are excluded. At December 31,
1996, off-balance sheet commitments, after adjusting for transfers of risk,
amounted to $2,502 million for Japan, $2,040 million for Germany, $2,767 million
for the United Kingdom, $963 million for Italy, and $195 million for Brazil.

The majority of outstandings to the above countries are short-term in nature,
which mitigates the credit risk as transactions settle quickly. These
outstandings generally represent interbank placements and trading assets. Due to
the short-term nature of interbank placements and trading assets, the
Corporation's balances tend to fluctuate greatly and the amount of outstandings
at year-end tends to be a function of timing, rather than representing a
consistent trend.

                                                                and Subsidiaries

Risk Elements

The following table sets forth the nonperforming assets and contractually
past-due loans at the dates indicated:



(a) Accruing loans past-due 90 days or more as to principal and interest, which
are not characterized as nonperforming loans.

   Renegotiated loans are those for which concessions, such as the reduction of
interest rates or deferral of interest or principal payments, have been granted
due to a deterioration in the borrowers' financial condition. Interest on
renegotiated loans is accrued at the renegotiated rates. Certain renegotiated
loan agreements call for additional interest to be paid on a deferred or
contingent basis. Such interest is recognized in income only as collected.

Impact of Nonperforming Loans on Interest Income

The following table presents the amount of interest income recorded by the
Corporation on its nonaccrual and renegotiated loans, excluding loans held for
accelerated disposition, and the amount of interest income on the carrying value
of such loans that would have been recorded if these loans had been current in
accordance with their original terms (i.e., interest at original rates). The
decrease in the total negative impact on interest income reflects the continued
reduction in the level of the Corporation's nonperforming loans.

Summary of Loan Loss Experience
Allowance for Loan Losses

The table below summarizes the changes in the allowance for loan losses during
the periods indicated.


                                      
(a) Includes losses on sales and swaps of loans previously classified as
emerging markets.
(b) Transfer relates to the allowance for credit losses on derivative and
foreign exchange financial instruments.
(c) Transfer relates to the allowance for credit losses on letters of credit and
guarantees.
(d) Relates primarily to the consolidation of a foreign subsidiary.
(e) Relates primarily to the sale of banking operations in southern and central
New Jersey.
(f) Includes $291 million related to management's final evaluation of the
emerging markets portfolio.
(g) Includes $55 million related to the decision to accelerate the disposition
of certain nonperforming residential mortgage loans.
(h) Includes $175 million of recoveries on the disposition of emerging markets
debt.

   As of December 31, 1996, in accordance with the AICPA's Audit and Accounting
Guide for Banks and Savings Institutions, the allowance for credit losses has
been allocated into three components: an allowance for loan losses, which is
reported net in Loans; an allowance for credit losses on derivative and foreign
exchange financial instruments, which is reported net in Trading Assets - Risk
Management Instruments; and an allowance for credit losses on letters of credit
and guarantees, which is reported in Other Liabilities. Prior period amounts
have not been reclassified due to immateriality. The Corporation views the
aggregate allowance for credit losses to be available for all credit
activities. 



(a) Includes a charge of $102 million related to conforming credit card
charge-off policies. See page 49.
(b) Includes charges for assets transferred to held for accelerated disposition
of $148 million and $701 million in 1994 and 1993, respectively.

(a) Excludes securities sold but not yet purchased.
(b) The weighted-average interest rates reflect the impact of local
interest rates prevailing in certain Latin American countries with highly
inflationary economies. The 1996 and 1995 rates reflect lower interest rates due
to the significant decrease in Brazilian inflation beginning in the third
quarter of 1994.

   Federal funds purchased represents overnight funds. Securities sold under
repurchase agreements generally mature between one day and three months.
Commercial paper is generally issued in amounts not less than $100,000 and with
maturities of 270 days or less. Other borrowings consist of demand notes, term
federal funds purchased, and various other borrowings in domestic and foreign
offices that generally have maturities of one year or less.

   At December 31, 1996, the Corporation had unused lines of credit available
for general corporate purposes, including the payment of commercial paper
borrowings, amounting to $1.0 billion.
